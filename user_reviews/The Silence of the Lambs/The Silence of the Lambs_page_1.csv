1,10,As good as its notorious reputation suggests.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerYoung FBI Agent Clarice Starling is chasing a ruthless serial killer, she enlists the help of convict Doctor Hannibal Lecter, a notorious cannibal and master of manipulation.If suspense thrillers are your thing, then this must rate as one of the greatest ever made. This film is genuinely unsettling throughout, you'll be wondering just who is playing who at times.An absence of blood and gore, this relied on the story and acting, for my money it's infinitely superior to the films that followed. The psychological terror is the key to this films success.Jodie Foster is excellent as Clarice, but Hopkins, what can you say, it's another of those performances that make you fully aware that he is one of the very best, he is outstanding in the role.The dynamic and chemistry between Hopkins and Foster is off the scale, the tension, the unease, the uncomfortable forged bond.I think this is where my love of Chianti comes from.10/10.",True
2,10,"Dr.Lecter, I'd like to see you again...",MaxBorg89,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Silence of the Lambs runs two hours.Anthony Hopkins appears for little more than sixteen minutes, yet during those minutes he hasn't bored you for a second, not even after the tenth or eleventh viewing. Such is the power of his performance, it's absolutely impossible to forget him.His character, Dr.Hannibal""The Cannibal"" Lecter, is a brutal killer with revolting methods and habits, but he's also very intelligent, charismatic and with good taste(you can interpret that as you like).A clichè by now, but who cares? He still is one of the key elements in this wonderful thriller, which sees Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling asking for Lecter's help to catch another killer.The result is a dangerous yet fascinating relationship between the young, unexperienced FBI-agent and the convicted,but basically omnipotent, psychiatrist.He's a step ahead of everyone all the time, and makes sure everyone notices, with his witty, unforgettable one-liners.If there had to be only one reason to worship this movie, then it would have to be the chemistry between the two leading actors.Never before has a non-sexual man/woman connection been more thrilling.Never before has a film's ending been more unsettling and brilliant and left us asking for more.Best watched with a nice Chianti...P.S. dear film-buffs, have the lambs stopped screaming?",False
3,10,A rare contender for the best film of all time,Mikheil-H,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNot so long ago, I was involved in a debate to decide what the best film of all time was. Not necessarily my favourite or the most re-watchable, but just the best film. Somehow, after a drink, a few arguments and a lot of contemplation, I singled out The Silence of the Lambs. The question remains though... was I actually onto something?The Silence of the Lambs follows agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is desperate to apprehend the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine). To try and help her gain insight into the mind of a psychopath, the aspiring agent must consult the genius, yet sinisterly manipulative psychiatrist turned cannibal, Doctor Hannibal Lector (Anthony Hopkins). From the very first scene, Silence of the Lambs' genius is obvious. During the opening credits, with eerie music displaced on top, the camera follows Clarice, with almost stalker-like intent, as she completes a training course in an initially empty forest. This immediately founds a cruel feeling of fear, dread and unease that continues to build throughout the film... though there are noticeable spikes during any visits to the film's most infamous character.Hannibal Lector - ""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti.""The Silence of the Lambs is one of three films in history to win the big 5 awards at the Oscars (best picture, actress, actor, screenplay and director) and the reason for those wins is thanks in large part to every and any scene involving Clarice's interaction with the eponymous Hannibal Lector. Imagine, Heat's diner talk, The Dark Knight's interrogation, or The Godfather's meetings. This is the level Silence of the Lamb's interviews are at. With closeups of both characters faces capturing their psychological chess game in exquisite detail, both actors are at the top of their games and refuse to provide respite for their entranced audience. Jodie Foster perfectly encapsulates the intelligent, ambitious yet emotionally delicate Starling who along with Anthony Hopkin's now iconic portrayal of the psychopathic Lector create a pairing so iconic that their interactions have been parodied to no end (references range from The Batman to Stranger Things to even Tom and Jerry).Hannibal Lector - ""And what did you see, Clarice? What did you see?""Clarice Starling - ""Lambs. The lambs were screaming.""Commonly touted alongside Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley as one of the all-time-best movie heroines, Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling is an icon. Whilst this is largely down to the captivating performance at the heart of the film, another crucial reason is how the director (Jonathon Demme) frames our protagonist. Throughout the film, the camera will occasionally position itself in Clarice's point of view. This means that whoever Clarice is talking to (serial killer or otherwise) will often stare directly down the lens and thus directly at the audience. This allows viewers to become a pseudo-psychologist themselves and deduce the intentions and thoughts of multiple characters in Clarice's periphery. Furthermore, this technique also forces audiences to identify with Clarice, as she navigates a case that, due to her age, gender and position, involves all eyes being on her.Jack Crawford - ""Starling, when I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you didn't it? It was just smoke, Starling. I had to get rid of him.""Clarice Starling - ""It matters, Mr Crawford. Cops look at you to see how to act. It matters.""Thankfully, to match the astounding performances at the heart of the film, The Silence of the Lambs bolsters a captivating, quick-paced and unbearably suspenseful story spread across a 2-hour runtime. By using the conversations with Hannibal almost like beginnings of a chapter, the film signposts where the story is heading, without giving any of its delicious twists away. This feat is even more impressive as Lector himself is only on screen for 24 minutes and 52 seconds, yet the pacing is so exquisite that his absence is never truly felt. Furthermore, the hunt for Buffalo Bill serves to keep both the audience and Clarice on their toes. By drip-feeding revelations surrounding Bill's psyche and own particular brand of horror, a sense of trepidation, tension and terror is expertly raised throughout the film. This then reaches a crescendo where, after a clever misdirect, Clarice finally confronts Bill in what has to be one of the most suspenseful battles ever put to screen. Does anybody breathe when the lights turn out?Clarice Starling - ""He won't come after me.""Ardelia Mapp - ""Oh really?""Clarice Starling - ""He won't. I can't explain it... He - he would consider it rude.""With a haunting score, powerful performances and exquisite pacing, The Silence of the Lambs personifies everything a psychological thriller should be. It is thematically rich, touching on overt and covert sexism, childhood trauma and the philosophy behind serial killers all while brimming with endlessly quotable dialogue, a lightning-fast pace and iconic characters. Honestly, I doubt many could argue with The Silence of the Lambs' status as both a classic for its genre as well as the medium of film as a whole. However, although not everyone may agree with it being the best film of all time, after a rewatch, I'd willingly fight anyone who claims it isn't close.",True
4,n/a,Absolutely Brilliant.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sweeping all five major Academy Awards (""Oscars"" for Best Movie, Director, Actor, Actress, Screenplay) is quite an accomplishment.  Doing it nearly a year after a film was released is a miracle considering the notoriously short attention span of Oscar voters.  It is a powerful example of how great a movie can be when superb writers, directors, actors, and others work at the top of their craft.`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.Do not miss this movie.The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see.",False
5,9,A Concerning Comfort Film,rogersellie-08609,n/a,15/08/2025,"Admittedly, I am not the most well versed when it comes to cinema and more importantly well thought-out and thorough reviews of cinema however I wanted to attempt to talk about The Silence of the Lambs.This is quite possibly one of my most revisited horror films, I find myself returning to it without boredom quite often. Re-watchablity is something I have noticed to be heavily lacking in the horror genre, something I personally equate to the overuse of the jumpscare, which isn't such a terrible thing but the intended effect wears thin by the third viewing.Silence of the Lambs being a more psychological horror does an immensely interesting job in their depiction of ""deranged"" or mentally ill criminals. Obviously Hannibal himself can become quite alluring given his disturbed charisma alongside the dustings of his criminal, cannibal, activities. His interactions with Clarice are superb and I don't get tired of watching their bizarre chemistry. Plus Jodie Foster did an excellent job as an up and coming FBI student, evidently a small fish in a large, male dominated pond.On that note I think the depictions of her relationships with men in the film are rather well executed. I would love to one day do a deeper more insightful reflection on this film and actually take into account story and cinematography, all factors really but I'll leave it here for now.",False

7,10,A Story And A Character That You Can't Forget,ccthemovieman-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'll never forget my first viewing of this movie at the theater and will always look back fondly on it for one reason: helping me quit smoking cigarettes.I read the book first, was fascinated by it, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. That was the day I picked to quit smoking and I knew this movie would take my mind off that matter. I was expecting an intense movie and I got it. Little did I realize how well-received this film would be and how it propelled Anthony Hopkins to super-stardom.Although entertaining, this is not always a fun movie to watch, especially with the scenes with Ted Levine who plays the killer, ""Buffalo Bill."" ""Bill"" and his kidnapped young woman are sick and profane people, respectively, and their scenes are very unpleasant. This movie is not for the squeamish with those and other scenes involving the infamous Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Hopkins). There also is some extreme crudeness in the jail/dungeon where Lecter and other inmates are held.Jodie Foster is excellent as the FBI agent ""Clarice Starling"" and Scott Glenn is low-key and effective as ""Jack Crawford."" A major part of the film is psychological more than violent as Lecter constantly taunts ""Clarice,"" while she tries her best to manipulate him to help with a case. The by-play between the two is a game in itself.Hopkins, however, is the actor people remember best from this movie. His portrayal of the refined-yet-cannibalistic serial killer-doctor is one viewers will never forget. I've enjoyed watching him in the sequels, too. The looks on his face, his fascinating vocabulary with intelligent sarcasm and frankness, never ceases to entertain.""Silence Of The Lambs"" has turned into a modern-day ""classic.""

My friend was right, this is a great movie. It is so well acted, I couldn't even describe. I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" and would recommend it to anyone. It's creepy and exciting.

9,9,Silence of the Lambs,jtkrings,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSilence of the Lambs (1991) follows the story of the young and ambitious Clarice Starling in her attempt to apprehend the serial killer named ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine). Starling goes to the infamous Hannibal Lecter (nicknamed Hannibal the Cannibal for his exotic tastes). Clarice relies on Lecter for his expertise and knowledge about the mind of a serial killer. Whereas Hannibal toys with Clarice in order to amuse himself. Clarice and her fellow agents are forced to rely on the help of a killer in order to catch another.Jodie Foster does an excellent job playing the young and eager Clarice. She portrays her Southern accent as often painfully obvious, which Lecter pounces upon as an insecurity. Foster speaks with a wavering voice at times, showing Clarice's inexperience and disgust with the crimes committed by Buffalo Bill. Hopkins is completely absorbed into the role of Hannibal Lecter. To create his creepy and psychotic persona he stares unblinkingly, forcing both the audience and Clarice to return his cold gaze. Hopkins keeps as still as possible while acting, looking like a snake poised to pounce upon less intelligent prey, and in comparison to Lecter everyone is less intelligent, and is therefore potential prey. Hopkins keeps a soft smirk on his lips throughout the film as if to say he knows something no one else does. The film's soundtrack is absolutely haunting and mysterious. It works well with the film to create tension and anxiety in the audience. However, the director (Jonathan Demme) knows when silence is just as powerful. In a tense scene in complete darkness we are left with no sound save for the heavy breathing of Buffalo Bill. The cinematography is excellent for this film. The colors of the film are gray and lifeless, which complement the film's dark subject matter. At pivotal moments the camera angle switches to first person. This view works perfectly when Clarice rounds the corner and sees Lecter for the first time. We are able to truly appreciate Lecter's piercing gaze, because we see it first hand through Clarice's eyes. The performances of Hopkins and Foster would have been flat if it were not for the well written script. The small anecdotal stories about Lecter help to build his character even before we meet him. Lecter's lines are meant to sound sophisticated and cultured in order to create his paradoxical character as a gentleman-psychopath. Buffalo Bill refers to his victims as ""it"" in an attempt to destroy their humanity in another example of brilliant writing.A key strength in this film is its character development. Not just Lecter or Clarice's development, but their relationship itself. The audience watches as Lecter and Clarice grow closer and closer in a bizarre exchange not unlike two friends sharing secrets. As Clarice learns more from Lecter, so too does Lecter learn more about Clarice. The audience can see that Lecter values this relationship because he does not hunt her down for as Clarice puts it, ""He would consider that rude"".Silence of the Lambs is a gripping and disturbing film, filled with fascinating characters. It remains a timeless horror film that draws from the darkest and foulest corner of humanity's existence. It is a terrifying movie because it reminds us that the monsters in our world are not imaginary, but could pass us on the street any day.",True
10,10,Anthony Hopkins is a god,abinewton07,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAn oldie, a classic and a must see for any horror or thriller fans. The acting from Hopkins and Jodie Foster is fantastic but Anthony Hopkins steals the show. He is genuinely terrifying and believable as a Hannibal lector.I enjoy the scenes the most that feature the two main characters speaking with each other as that connection between them is slowly built, and in a strange way you almost like Hannibal.Although this is over 32 years old, this film stands the test of time. Sometimes watching back old classics you realise things were a little corny or not as well done as you originally thought, but this film doesn't fall into that.MUST SEE 10/10.",True
11,10,A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars,crisp_morning_2004,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is a creepy and taken-by-storm experience with the film, background music is darker than the film itself and too ominous, plot is brilliantly constructed, conversations are thought-provocative, to crown the whole, Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkin are the cream. They take ownership of Clarice and Hannibal respectively, transforming them into the most unforgettable screen images.The psychological path of Hannibal is hard to trace. He is so odd a mixture of intelligence, cruelty, insanity, grace and charisma. In the depth, fledgling FBI trainee Clarice is no match of him. She is still naive yet very ambitious. On the trail of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, she's sent to interview him, a psychiatrist-turned-cannibal. Hannibal is willing to provide clues to finding the killer but only in return for personal information about Clarice herself. He calls it Quid Pro Quo. In those mind games, the two dance backward and forward between cannibal and FBI agent, mentor and student, psychiatrist and patient, father and daughter. It is Clarice who breathes life into the multidimensional sophisticated psychopath and Hannibal who nudges the aspiring student FBI agent and helps her achieve her first success in a world of Y chromosome where her guru Crawford uses her, embarrasses her, excludes her; Doctor Chilton regards her no more than a simple-minded woman and tries to flirt with her. Frankly speaking, though no lack of other impressive scenes, it's really the nerves fights between Hannibal and Clarice that carries the film.Some of the horrible scenes involve Buffalo Bill who, a transvestite, skins his victims, especially woman victims. But the most terrifying one is Clarice's single-handed trace in Buffalo Bill's gruesome den, which also has become another irony to the self-important testosterone-dominated world. Crawford's misjudgment and stubbornness makes him out of the right track, a special anti-terror deployment resulting in vain. But Clarice, though excluded from the business which she should be on, still holds onto her intuition and through on-the-spot investigation finds the serial killer at last. She has to take on him herself. (Demme uses ""deceptive cutting"" there to enhance the tension.) It is definitely a life-or-death fight, especially when Clarice is in the dark, groping her way in absolute terror. I have no doubt everyone holds the breath when the film rolls to that part.A gripping film that well deserved its Oscars",True
12,10,A truly remarkable film,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,15/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsRookie FBI agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is assigned to get into the mind of notorious incarcerated serial killer Dr Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to get his evaluation on the elusive Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who's been abducting and killing young women. When a prominent senator's daughter is kidnapped, it becomes a race against time to find her before she is killed and all the while Lecter is playing mind-games with Starling as well as any help he can provide...The first of Thomas Harris's Hannibal novels to be adapted for the screen, only to be followed some years later with some very lacklustre (but inevitable!) follow-ups, despite it's age this remains one of the most effective chillers of modern times. Despite the mainstream appeal of the film, the grainy lighting and laid-back budget give it an art-house feel that sets it apart from other such films that were as successful. The film manages some effectively disturbing scenes that make it a not altogether pleasant viewing experience.Performances wise, in a very early role, a young Foster shows her promise for future roles, with a gripping portrayal of naivety and vulnerability here that is very compelling and convincing, even though there are some plausibility problems with someone as junior as her being assigned to do something like that. Hopkins too is brilliant as Lecter, playing a dangerous man behind bars who's ability to get inside your head and see the things you don't want him to see makes him no less dangerous, if not more so, than if he was on the outside. He's certainly received the most acclaim for his role over the years, but in my humble opinion, he's actually over-shadowed (though only slightly!) by Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, a truly extraordinary psychopath with an unsettling sexuality disorder that is probably one of the nastiest things ever to be seen in such a mainstream film. As supporting FBI agent Crawford, Scott Glenn is impressive but sort of just faded into DTV land after this film.It's easily one of the most popular films ever made, so it's likely a lot of you are familiar with it already, but with reviews on the so-inferior follow-up films Red Dragon and Hannibal, I thought it only right that I'd finally give this first film a mention. Truly remarkable. *****",False

Hannibal Lector escapes by wearing a dead guy's face. Silly. Oh by the way, how did Lector steal the pen? They don't tell you because it would have been impossible for him to steal it.

The FBI has had no luck with the case and agent Scott Glenn tries to throw a curve-ball to Hopkins by sending Foster.  Hopkins is a former doctor of Levine and holds the clues to capturing the unknown criminal.  Needless to say the film takes many twists and turns, creating a suspenseful thriller that has no equal.  At the heart of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" are the confrontations between Hopkins and Foster.  They play a complicated chess match of words which results in some of the greatest footage ever captured for the cinema.

19,10,One of the Greatest Thrillers of all Time.,notoriousCASK,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece you cannot miss, it's a masterwork of suspense that blends the elements of horror, crime and psychology into one tight and smooth story. It's only the third film in history to win Academy Awards in all the top five categories: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Adapted Screenplay and that imply something about its technical quality as a film. It features expertise level of craftsmanship in all departments of filmmaking, and takes a huge bonus from the exquisite performances put in by its stellar cast. After all these years The Silence of the Lambs remains in a league of its own and is a perfect exemplification of just how great a movie can become when all the right elements come together and work in perfect harmony to form a complete whole.Based on the novel of the same name, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. FBI agent Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a genius psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case of a serial killer called Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), that murders and skins his victims and that Starling as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to make him help with the case.The direction by Jonathan Demme is marvelous, as the film introduces its chilling sense of dread and has the audience on the edge of their seats, from the moment Howard Shore's ominous score hits the screen till the end of the film, especially during the climax with a lot of perfectly crafted suspenseful and nail-biting moments. The editing is perfect as the pace is methodical from start to finish, and each and every sequence is relevant to the story. The cinematography by Tak Fujimoto is fantastic as it fully succeeds into creating a very dark and brooding atmosphere that captivates as well as terrorize the audience, while also exhibiting excellent camera work that makes heavy use of close-ups which increase the creepiness and tension along with displaying an optimal color palette and minimal lightning from start to finish, which further enhances the darker ambience the story was aiming for. Moreover, the production design team has done a magnificent work as every set piece is meticulously crafted, richly detailed and very well-lit. The script by Ted Tally, also packs a very well structured and tight plot, every character has a well-defined arc, all the themes are smartly addressed, the attention to detail is quite impressive, and the complete story and narrative are perfect.The performances are incredible. Jodie Foster as Clarice is absolutely brilliant and gives an impeccable performance as a woman who is desperately trying to forget her painful past and yet at the same time tries to prove her worth in a male dominant world. Anthony Hopkins as the genius psychiatrist and cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter is the perfect amalgamation of charisma, high intelligence and destructive violence, and gives a bone-chilling and memorable performance that will stand the passage of time as one of the absolute best. The small amount of screen time that Hopkins is given is a definitive testament to his acting capabilities, as with such an elegant and minimal performance, he solidifies himself as one of the most iconic villains of all time. Due to the charisma and electrifying chemistry between the two actors every scene they share becomes an instant classic.In conclusion, the Silence of the Lambs is one of the greatest films ever made and a masterwork of brilliant direction, smart screenplay, splendid camerawork, tight editing, marvelous score and exquisite performances, that cemented the legacy of both Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster by engraving their iconic characters into the annals of cinema. The film absolutely deserves all the accolades and recognition it gets, for both its contributions to cinema and the immense impact it had on pop culture. Jonathan Demme's magnum opus is an outstanding achievement in genre filmmaking that has inspired and influenced countless thrillers since its release, and is not only the quintessential suspense and psychological horror film but also an ingenious observation of humanity's dark and violent nature and a masterpiece that every film lover must see.",False

But in 1991 along came Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant Baltimore psychiatrist, to challenge Bates for the on-screen mantle of unparalleled depravity. Cultured and erudite, Lecter reads Marcus Aurelius, listens to classical music, and drinks only the finest wine {a glass of Chianti to go along with fava beans and liver}. Oh.... and by the way, did I forget to mention that he's a cannibalistic serial killer?Thomas Harris' diabolical shrink first appeared in the book ""Red Dragon"", adapted quite decently by Michael Mann in 1986 and retitled MANHUNTER {later remade less satisfactory in 2002 under its original title}. Despite Mann's film not making much of a splash at the time, plans were nonetheless underway to bring Harris' second novel ""Silence Of The Lambs"" to the screen. The unlikely person interested in turning it into a motion picture was Gene Hackman, who hoped to make this his directorial debut. Orion Pictures was onboard, but Hackman soon had cold feet over the grisly subject matter and dropped out. As writer Ted Tally was consuming himself with putting together a solid screenplay, Orion succeeded in convincing Jonathan Demme to direct.The first actress slated to play Clarice Starling was Michelle Pfeiffer and, for the same reasons as Hackman, also had her apprehensions and bowed out. Replacing Pfeiffer was Jodie Foster, who'd just won an Oscar for portraying a rape victim in THE ACCUSED. As for Lecter, the original choice was Sean Connery (!), who declined. No knock against Connery, but that was a good thing too. Try to visualize, if you can, 007 saying ""I do wish we could chat longer, but I'm having an old friend for dinner"". Doesn't quite roll off the tongue so fluidly, does it?The next one considered was Anthony Hopkins, based largely on his performance in THE ELEPHANT MAN, a choice which I thought was odd! The character Hopkins played in that film was Dr Frederick Treves, a decent, compassionate man of medicine who transformed one person's heartbreakingly miserable life around for the better, whereas Hannibal Lecter possesses all the compassion of a Komodo dragon. It took the actor only ten pages of reading the script before realizing this was the best part he'd ever read, and heartily agreed to play Lecter. To capture the right accent for his character he based the voice partially on Katharine Hepburn and Truman Capote.The heroine of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee at Quantico nearing the conclusion of her apprenticeship. A native of rural West Virginia, Clarice was orphaned as a young girl when her widowed policeman father was shot to death in the line of duty. Jack Crawford, her superior in the Behavioural Sciences department assigns her to conduct an interview with one of the most infamous serial killers in the country. Crawford warns her in advance not to reveal anything personal to him, telling her ""Believe me, Starling, you don't want Hannibal Lecter inside your head"".Dr Lecter's home for the last decade has been a Baltimore asylum for the criminally insane. He is so dangerous that he and three other inmates are segregated from the general population, which illustrates just how evil he truly is. Prior to her meeting him, Dr Chilton, the director of the institution, shows Clarice a photograph of an unfortunate staffer who made the grave mistake of turning her back to him.We never actually see what Lecter did to the woman. With Demme's camera in an upward position facing towards Clarice, our heroine's stoic, yet revealing, reaction is enough to put our imaginations into overdrive....and give us the willies!!! Unlike the other garden variety psychos displaying the usual clichéd mannerisms, Lecter simply greets her with a casual, disarming ""Good morning"". Hopkins' phrasing of those two words will put a chill in the audience's spines.Starling has been sent in the hopes that the not-so-good doctor will provide a psychological profile of Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who has been abducting and murdering young women. Intrigued by his visitor, Lecter begins insinuating himself into her psyche by giving an extraordinary accurate character analysis. Their cat-and-mouse interaction is fascinating to watch as Lecter alternates between co-operation {somewhat} and toying with her emotions.Lecter's cryptic clues lead Clarice to the discovery of a severed head belonging to one of his former patients. Though admitting to preserving the cranium prior to his incarceration, Lecter insists he was not the killer. However, he does know the identity of the dead man's lover, the suspect known only as Buffalo Bill. He simply wants to torment everyone by taking his own sweet time before disclosing it.The stakes suddenly get higher in the psychological chess match between Lecter and Starling. Buffalo Bill's next victim happens to be the missing daughter of a Tennessee senator. With pressure now coming from Washington, Clarice approaches Lecter with a {phony} offer of a transfer in exchange for his identification of the serial killer. Unfortunately, this quid pro quo is overhead by Chilton, a womanizing creep whose self-love is more than just a summer romance. His ego will lead to subsequent events that nothing positive will come of.THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is undeniably Jonathan Demme's finest hour. One of his visual trademarks is having his actors speaking directly into the camera, giving us the impression that we're the ones actually interacting with them, and thus putting us in the other person's shoes. Demme's technique is not always effective , but it certainly works with THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS because having Hannibal Lecter, in particular, addressing us face-to-face is enough to put us off balance.In the decades since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, critics and audiences alike have rhapsodized endlessly about the tit-for-tat exchanges between Lecter and Starling. It's an intriguing matchup for sure; he's a remorseless monster, yet somehow this tenacious Southern belle has tapped into his not-so-beautiful mind just as much he has with hers. As he admires Clarice's steely perseverance within a male dominated profession, she may be the only person in the world whom Lecter genuinely wishes no harm to come towards. And his ingenious escape at the ¾ mark makes for one of the tensest scenes in cinema history.For all of its bona fide moments of fright, one aspect which I think Demme doesn't get enough praise for is his vivid depiction of America's rust belt. Thanks to the exceptional work by production designer Kristi Zea and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto, Demme gives us the most bleakly evocative portrait of lower middle class poverty since BONNIE AND CLYDE.THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS became only the third movie to capture the 5 major Academy Awards: Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Ted Tally's first rate adaptation. Hopkins was knighted shortly after his triumph, and when asked by a reporter which honor was more satisfying, he replied ""The Oscar. It changed my life"". For Foster, this was her second win, but this performance was so towering that I'm not sure if anyone other than the most intrepid cinephile would remember what film her first Oscar was for.Back in 1991, I remember reading a review of THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS where the writer of the article proclaimed that Hannibal Lecter may be the greatest movie villain of all time. I thought that was quite an audacious pronouncement for anybody to make. The film was still going through a strong theatrical run, and conventional cinema wisdom assumed that nobody would ever unseat Hitchcock's ultimate mama's boy. But as it turned out, that critic, whoever he or she was, ended up having the last laugh. 🔚",True
21,10,It's a classic!,nickpal1983,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is little doubt that the most memorable aspect of The Silence of the Lambs is Anthony Hopkins' incomparable performance as Lecter. Taking over for Brian Cox, who was effective, but not especially memorable, as the good doctor in 1986's Manhunter, Hopkins instantly makes the role his own, capturing and conveying the charismatic essence of pure evil. To his dying day, no matter how many roles he plays in the interim, Hopkins will forever be known for this part. (It is a credit to Hopkins' ability as an actor that this part did not result in stereotyping. His post-Silence career has been greatly varied, with roles as widely diverse as a stodgy butler in Merchant-Ivory's The Remains of the Day and an action hero in The Edge.) I can throw out any number of superlatives, but none of them do justice to this chilling performance, which I labeled as the best acting work of the '90s. Want to feel the icy fingers of terror stroke your heart? Watch this mixture of brilliant eloquence and inhuman cruelty. As portrayed by Hopkins, Hannibal is both a suave, cultured gentleman and an unspeakable fiend. He is gracious and monstrous at the same time. (Hopkins also provided one of the most quotable lines in recent film history with ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti"", which was followed by an inimitable slithering slurp.)",False

24,7,Somewhat Silenced By Time,daoldiges,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw Lambs during its original release and thought it was pretty good. Having seen it again recently I did still enjoyed it but not quite to the extent I did originally. One thing that didn't hold up was Foster's performance. She still does fine but it did feel a bit forced at times. Her concerns regarding her background and the flashbacks seemed slight this time around. The wrap up regarding Buffalo Bill character seemed a little convenient here. As for the dialogue it still mostly worked but some of it did come off as trite and while not exactly dated, just ordinary. Despite some shortcomings The Silence of the Lambs is still a solid thriller worth checking out.",False
25,5,After 30 years I have finally seen this movie,chinaskee-418-613225,n/a,15/08/2025,And am scratching my head as to why it won a Best Picture Oscar. It's not a terrible movie but it's a pretty standard B thriller with A list actors in it. I won't be going out of my way to see it again. And I'll be skipping the special features on the DVD. Nothing about this film impressed me enough to watch any promos on how it was made.,False

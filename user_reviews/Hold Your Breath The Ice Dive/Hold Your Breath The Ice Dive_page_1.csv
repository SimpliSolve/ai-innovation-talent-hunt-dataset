1,10,Unclear what is with the bad ratings,lsalsa29,n/a,16/08/2025,This is an amazing documentary about a passionate and determined woman who quite frankly does something insanely difficult. Anyone who has ever stepped a foot into a lake in winter after a sauna knows how the whole body screams to get out of the water.The scenery of this documentary was also outstanding. The documentary was filmed in Finland which looks gorgeous. I enjoyed the back stories and the look into her personal life. I appreciated watching this and I don't understand the low ratings. A must watch especially as it is only 40 minutes. Makes me want to try an ice dive in Finland myself.,False
2,9,Amazing ...!!!!! .....Bravo .....!!!!!,aqeel2322,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one the best short documentary about human courage , commitment, passion , love , that sense of achieving something in life even after hurdles ... never to be stop and never let down yourself ...this is what I have learned from it and obviously people will also do ...!!!!",False
3,10,Just impressive,minajasmin,n/a,16/08/2025,"The scenery is indescribably beautiful - yes its Finland so of course its pretty but the camerawork just catches the ambiance of the nature and snow so perfectly.Johanna Norblad and her humble and determined personality inspire me as a woman especially. Its so beautiful to see her fight for her passion and dream.She makes it seem so easy yet I dont think many people would even dare to swim 10 sec under ice...
Even if one doesn't understand the attraction to this sport as it comes with so much danger aswell I truly believe this documentary makes you want to find a purpose in life and fight ambitiously for it.The relationship between the two sisters is also very heartwarming to watch - so much love and support for each other.",False
4,9,Fantastic,samlg3,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerReally enjoyed this. Some of the cinematography was beautiful, and enjoyed the story telling. Also refreshing for a doc like this to be 40mins, often they're stretched out much longer. 40mins felt like a great length.Only thing I didn't appreciate was the coverage of the record attempt. From my perspective at least there were some unnecessary long pauses to make you think that she might not make it to the next check point - I just didn't like that. Would have preferred to see the record attempt in real time without any edits or slow mo's. Just a camera above or view walking on the ice getting a feel for what it was like in real time and to take you into the experience, rather than the replay they give you. That's only my perspective, but otherwise thought it was fantastic!",True

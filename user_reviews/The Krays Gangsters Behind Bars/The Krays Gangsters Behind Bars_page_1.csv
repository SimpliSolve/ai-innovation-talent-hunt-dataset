1,7,Gangsters behind bars,robdrummond,n/a,16/08/2025,I enjoyed this documentary as it featured quite a number of people who knew both Kray twins intimately.To hear these first hand accounts was extremely interesting when compared with the glamorous films and aura built up around them for decades.This truth was very different than the Myth of The Krays.,False
2,10,Honesty is the best policy,rozi127,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gripping,compelling,and honest true story of a Geordie lad trying to do the right thing..in the underworld..very good watch,and completely different frm the rest..10/10 for me.",False
3,8,"Interesting, but Steve has an annoying habit!!!!",thediva-89114,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved the film but Steve the main story teller has a terrible habit of smacking his lips together and making a horrible noise every five darn minutes?!!!,False
4,8,Interesting series,njboden,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI just watched this on Amazon Prime, having watched Secrets of the Krays on the BBC when it was on TV a few weeks ago (now it's only available on BritBox) and there were definitely some similarities as both series had Courtney and Flanagan in the cast talking about the Krays - in fact, Courtney made essentially the same comment about the people he invited to Ronnie Kray's funeral in both programmes, describing the assembled gangsters as 'tasty people'! It was interesting to hear a different perspective on things though - the Geordie presenter of this programme met frequently with the Krays when they were alive and as his job was at one time to make T-shirts, he's the person who's mainly responsible for the famous/infamous 'Free Reggie Kray' T-shirts and was involved with the Krays charity drives to support child cancer victims, however cynical such PR might have been, so he's quite a key associate.I'd heard that Ronnie Kray had a feud with Peter Sutcliffe when they were both at Parkhurst Hospital for the criminally insane too but it was good to hear the details about that too.Definitely recommended.",True

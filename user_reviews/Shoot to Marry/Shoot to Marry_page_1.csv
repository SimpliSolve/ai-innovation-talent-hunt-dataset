2,8,Romantic odyssey,EricaHBecker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched Shoot to Marry with my partner - we stumbled upon it randomly and found it surprisingly entertaining....Man in the throes of a devastating break-up goes in search of The One, meeting incredible people, women mostly, along the way. The central character Steve is strikingly authentic and willing to laugh at himself. It's pretty low budget - very indie. But this romantic odyssey is worth the watch.",False
3,8,Highly entertaining!,DavePaul2010,n/a,16/08/2025,"Funny, self-reflective and occasionally absurd dating doc. The filmmaker hops from city to city looking for women to be in his documentary, and longing for that one special woman to share his life with. Markle's confidence has been shattered after a bad breakup, and he reveals his insecurities in hilarious stream of consciousness narration that runs through the film. Solid film and highly entertaining.",False
4,9,This movie is my life...,graceunderwood,n/a,16/08/2025,"I lived a version of this movie.... complete with the engagement that got called off (though my engagement lasted longer than 24 hours). ""Shoot to Marry"" really captures how hard it is to find love again (and to love yourself again) after getting your heart broken. In a sense this film was hard to watch... brought back memories... but I loved every minute of it and got me thinking about my own choices during that time of my life. I recommend this indie doc to pretty much anyone who's ever had their heart broken. ""Shoot To Marry"" gets it right... super relatable and very funny and full of heart.",False

6,1,Creeped out by the whole thing,mcatkhan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis dude is a genuine creep. He asks ""interesting"" women to be ""interviewed"" but really it's women he finds attractive that he's trying to date. He even finds his old crush from 3rd grade and interviews her, and you can just tell how weirded out she is.I had mixed feelings about the ending, when he finally found someone. I was relieved that he probably wasn't going to turn into a rapist or something after all, but sad that his partner ended up with someone so awful. This movie is cringey and frankly uncomfortable to watch.",True
7,10,Wonderful,katelbeaumont,n/a,16/08/2025,"A forty-ish guy named Steve exchanges Christmas gifts with his long-time girlfriend, sings her a song and proposes. She says yes, followed by what Steve describes to his therapist as a total meltdown. Christmas is over. So is their relationship. In the years that follow, Steve documents his relentless quest to find new love, getting relationship advice from his parents, therapist, and incredible women he meets along the way. Steve is genuine and likeable and brutally honest. My husband and I watched this doc together. We cringed a few times watching Steve stumble on his quest for everlasting love - but never stopped rooting for the guy.Shoot To Marry is a wonderful doc that will resonate with anyone who knows the pain of loneliness. My husband and I were taken by Steve's humor and vulnerability, and by the end we found ourselves moved to tears.",False
8,10,Shoot To Marry is touching and honest.,danaluken,n/a,16/08/2025,"Steve Markle's new documentary Shoot To Marry is a winner.

Disillusioned after a failed marriage proposal, Markle grabs his camera and sets out to learn about relationships from female subjects. He's also hoping to find romance along the way.Markle's journey takes him from L.A. to New York to Boston to Toronto filming with an impressive range of women from a firefighter to an escort turned spiritual healer. In his desperate attempt to find love, Markle is willing to put himself in uncomfortable situations. He films in a sex club and joins a women's workshop called Unleash Your Inner Geisha.Along the way, Markle learns a thing or two and mends his broken heart. But the question remains: Will he find his soulmate? Then along comes Erin, a writer who's been dating men for the free dinners and writing about them in her blog. The two hit it off but Erin feels weird about their age gap - there's eighteen years between them.This doc is special. Markle is openhearted and his offbeat film is uncannily relatable. Shoot To Marry is touching and honest and it's just about one of the funniest documentaries I've seen. Markle comes up against rejection in dating, but his doc is a winner.",False

This is an introspective doc... sometimes uncomfortable, always entertaining.

14,9,doc about heartbreak had me smiling.,AshleyLWritesReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"More than a search for love, Shoot to Marry is an intimate study of a recently singled man learning to like himself.

Shoot To Marry was the perfect antidote - had me smiling start to finish.",False
15,10,The best documentary I have ever seen!,jonahmickelson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shoot To Marry is simply the funniest and most engaging documentary I have ever seen. There are few people that are willing to share so much of their lives as the filmmaker Steve Markle. The realness makes Shoot To Marry relatable and interesting. It looks and sounds beautiful (probably because Steve is an artistic genius). Every scene works perfectly.
I think every single person should watch this documentary and may learn something more about themselves or the relationship they are in.

1,10,Excellent low key portrayal,martinpersson97,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is definitely one of the more coniving and interesting features of the year, featuring a stellar cast of impressive players in this unique documentary about every day life in a secluded Swedish village.It is very beautifully shot, cut and edited in every sense of the word, as one would expect, of course, from such a great director, whose previous works is impressive indeed.Very great cinematography and imagery, beautiful location shootings.It is an emotional, yet poignant and somber outlook at everyday life and death of smaller societies, yet with glimmers of hope.Indeed a beautiful and highly recommended documentary feature!",True

1,8,Very Well Done! Bravo!,dal_asher,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw Cirque du Soleil both in Las Vegas and in Montreal and I can only imagine how hard it was to be ready in such a short amount of time. These athletes are world class performers and seeing the behind the scenes was fascinating. I absolutely love seeing these performers and it almost felt like magic seeing the beauty and art in each performance. Covid was horrible and so many people died and have long term effects. Seeing how many of the cast and crew were able to come back was heart warming. I'm not sure I understand the bad review this received. I guess we all experienced Covid in different ways. We are senior citizens and we stayed home for almost 18 months. We didn't get Covid until we had been well vaccinated so our experience was mild. However, we were in pretty good shape before hand and have struggled to regain our physical stamina. These young people are so inspiring! Thank you all for your hard work and the joy you give in in your performances!",False
2,10,The Art of Life ... Show life,ronysallam,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell... I'm surprised to see that this documentary only hit 5 at the ratings .For me it was amazing exposing all the backstage events that took place and the effort, the time ,the sweat, the emotions ....ect that those performing artists went through in order to get on stage leaving all their struggles behind, aiming just for one sole purpose, to amuse the audience.I never heard about the ""O""Cirque de Soleil before until I watched this documentary.It's worth your time ... A lovely documentary... The music and all the personal stories of the Artists are inspiring.Hope you enjoy it as well.I gave it a10 because I enjoyed it to the last scene.The dedication they put on last for the member of their crew who passed away broke my heart.",True
3,10,The Magic is Still There,make_me_think,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw ""O"" in 1998, it took my breath away. I'd been to shows before, but nothing like Cirque, let alone ""O"". The scale, the water, the undeniable talent and commitment of the performers, and the music. I purchased the CD and still listen to the music now 25+ years later.I didn't realize how profound an effect the this feature would have on me. The opening was sad of course, but when the music of ""O"" began I got chills. I was instantly transported back.Then hearing the stories of loss, struggle, change, and rebirth gave me a new level of appreciation for not only the scale of what it takes to put on a single show, but the dedication and passion to the craft that everyone has and maintains through months and years.Before the premier, one of the show's leaders said that if they can influence 200 of 1,800 then they have made a difference. I cannot imagine how any ""O"" performance affects less than all 1,800 people.Cirque, and ""O"" especially for me, is a treasure.",False

1,9,One of those films that keep your heart warm for a long time,ruochawang,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sometimes the mundane day-to-day life hurts a yearning soul. And off he goes. Glass organ is an art. The journey Rogier took, is an even greater form of art. It is one of those films that keep your heart warm for a long time. You walk out of the cinema with a smile and a little tear, and a few hours later, a few days later, while you're living the everyday life, something from the film floats up and again gives you a smile and a little tear... It is also what I like about Dutch films in general - a very unique type of warmth and humour conveyed through the smallest things that we all live, then we see a bit of ourselves in the characters, and a bit of them in us.",False

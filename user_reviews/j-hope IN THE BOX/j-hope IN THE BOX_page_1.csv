1,9,Rare glimpse into a frighteningly talented artiste,soumashree-06845,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film cruises on j-hope's brilliance and fans' knowledge of it. Its jumps from performance to preparation to performance to preparation acts as a pleasantly surprising tool to inform the world of the excruciating process of bringing one's own album to vision.J-hope is a master performer and a musician of such unique vision that I feel like the world is yet to wake up to his brilliance. This film does a bit of the legwork for the world.Fans of BTS and j-hope -- there are undoubtedly many -- will see a character they are unfamiliar with. A human artiste and a really kind, homely man who needs a support system as much as any of us do.Disney must be lauded for getting j-hope to be Jung Hoseok for the full length of the film. He has earlier been private but now we see a version him we already knew existed.",False

And this doc succeed all my expectations: not only it showed how much work j-hope put into his debut, but also showed how passionate he is about his art, how great work ethics he has, how deeply involved he was with every detail of his projects, how he thought he was trapped in the box of his image in group and how wanted to get out of his it and how eager he is to try many things. Trully insightful video about both his work as artist and about his personality.",False

The scenes that shows his parent's house and him talking to them makes us a little bit closer, it brings some intimacy to the documentary. We also get to see how the members of BTS and him are so close, it's been a decade they are together as a group and yet they love and protect each other and are there for each other in this new chapter they're going solo! Thank you J-Hope for giving us this masterpiece!",False

6,10,J-hope makes you want passion and love,farahohsix-34473,n/a,16/08/2025,"You may be familiar with J-hope as he is in the biggest group in the world, BTS. Although, the group makes a cameo in this documentary, it's about J-hopes solo career. He is the first member to debut as a solo artist. You may have thought you would see J-hope as a bubbly, colorful and fun artist. However, he shows he is so much more than that. He suprised the world with Jack in the box, which brings Rock, old school hip hop, RnB and grunge. Breaking out of his stereotypes and showing the world that he is a multifaceted artist who screams of passion and art.This documentary walks you through J-hopes artistic journey and process of the making of his album and headlining performance at Lollapalooza. A fascinating documentary that shows J-hope love and passion for his work. A unique glimpse into his daily life as ' Jung Hoseok, the loving son and younger brother.

8,10,J-HOPE!!! Wow!!,drpmmh,n/a,16/08/2025,"JHOPE is such an incredible performer. To see the inside look of what he went through in preparing for this historical event in his life was amazing! This took courage and he faced it head on. He showed us determination and hard work pays off. He has come a long way along with his 6 other teammates. I can't wait to see other sides of Hobi. Hobi always gives 100% in what he does, singing, dancing, performing. He shows us that he is human and always remains humble in all his interactions. Him and his teammates are what make me stay and support everything they do. The are our forever artists. Love it!!",False
9,10,"Honest, entertaining and eye-opening",comet-31512,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is an honest, entertaining look into j-hope's preparations both for his first solo album, Jack in the Box, and his record-breaking performance at Lollapalooza. For this debut, he stepped away from the safety of concerts performed with his BTS team in front of members of the band's fanclub, instead choosing to headline the biggest alternative rock festival in the USA, a setting which - like j-hope's gritty hip-hop album itself - is a very long way from the glitzy, tightly controlled performances of kpop. The film hops backwards and forwards in time, showing just how meticulously he prepared for this project and how the creative aspects of the album and performance were absolutely his own.We see j-hope working long hours alone in his studio - struggling with writer's block, dancing and ad-libbing along to his addictive hip-hop tracks and occasionally contemplating the fact that he could have chosen an easier life, were he not so driven by his need to create and perform. We see him taking a well-earned break with his family before launching back into the gargantuan task of organising his own promotions. He has a large and capable team around him, but he checks and adjusts every detail himself, from tasting the food and drink to be served at his launch party to making fine adjustments to the choreography, the band arrangements and the backing videos for his first stage performance. Along the way he talks frankly about his creative choices, the pressure he is under and his hopes and doubts.The high quality footage of parts of the Lollapalooza performance is fantastic and you don't need to be a fan to feel the power and charisma of j-hope when he leaps onto the stage. Behind the scenes, he shows himself to to be driven, detail-oriented and remarkably clear about his own trajectory as an artist. There's no 'superstar' attitude, though - his gratitude to the whole team shines through, from the backing artists to the cleaners tidying up after his launch party. His exceptional talent as a rapper, dancer and singer is on full view, but j-hope's work ethic, honesty and humility may impress you the most.",False
10,10,He made it as a solo artist!,jadebts,n/a,16/08/2025,"How awesome is he! I realize that Jhope is a really sincere and passionate artist. He made it with his professional attitude and effort. He demonstrates that BTS deserves to be the worldwide top artist. His story shows how he prepares for his album, promotions, performances for Lollapalooza with his people and the journey of his growth. I became respectful to him after watching the documentary. Perhaps he was afraid of being alone, performing alone, and preparing all things by himself without his BTS members. However he completed his own mission successfully and at last he said he is ready for his stage for Lollapalooza. One of his staff said to him after the performance, ""I knew you are going to do well."". I think the mention of the staff represents all of Jhope's efforts and marvelous results. He is a man of great promise. I look forward to his future even more.",False
11,10,Let the world witness j-hope's genius!,wonderlust18,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a well produced documentary of j-hope the artist! A real artist that independently told his story through his sublime album and performance at Lollapalooza. His fans has seen what he is capable of so the world need to witness his genius. How he conceptualise and brought to life his vision is an envy to many. He remains down to earth and humble. He is just doing what he loves! His craft.The way the storyline weave through his process and performance is top tier. Keeps everything interesting. The quality of sounds & recording of his lollapalooza performances are clear and crisp compared to the ones shared from Hulu. Hobipalooza needs to be made into a DVD.It is such a very enlightening documentary. His journey and thought process is unique to him. Not all have the ability to visualise a big picture like him. The fact he thought about the Jack In The Box idea 6 months after Hope World shows how creative and artistic he is. He is bold and fearless! Loves change and improve. Others, his peers, stagnated and hide behind others while he bravely face his solo journey on his own to challenge himself.As j-hope said his work makes him breathe that I am looking forward to his future projects. BRAVO!",True
12,10,What an incredible musical journey!,natioo,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was truly a fascinating experience to go on a journey along with j-hope and be part of the creating of his music and the preparation for his historical lollapalooza performance!'Jack in the Box' was chosen as a Top10 album of 2022 by the Rolling Stone and this documentary shows why!The world has the chance to see how j-hope makes his art and I hope everyone who loves music watches this documentary.

13,10,"Raw, Honest and unapologetically J-Hope",laurenlouisaswain,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe I am biased....no, I am biased. However, I loved this documentary.J-Hope allowed us to see the process from start to finish of his recent album Jack in the Box. As someone who knows absolutely nothing about the work that goes into making music, this made me appreciate the real work that goes into it.The care and effort is so obvious in J-Hope's documentary along with the sacrifices made and the impact on him as a person.J-Hope really shows what it is really like behind the curtain, the real emotions and real struggles. I think people forget that artists are real people and that their job isn't glamourous all the time. It requires hours of work, pushback from others along with a series of I could of made that better. He navigates these challenges in such a way that you know comes from having years of experience in the business and it is so cool to watch.We also get a small insight into J-hope's family, his proud parents, whose home acts as a shrine to their successful children. It really warmed my heart to see him able to spend time with his family, however short and I think we all wish we could be invited to J-Hope's house for some of his mum's cooking!Overall it was as much as a hit as I expected! Make sure you take a chance to watch it!",False
14,10,FANTASTIC,anaaannya,n/a,16/08/2025,"""J-hope In The Box,"" starring Jung Hoseok aka J-hope of 21st-century icons BTS, follows the international music sensation as he works to release his first-ever solo album - ""Jack In The Box"". Viewers will be given a never-before-seen look at the creative challenges faced during the album's preparation process, as well as front-row seats to J-hope's Lollapalooza performance and the album's listening party.It was fantastic! I won't be able to put into words how I felt. To be honest, J-hope in the Box entertains me for three main reasons. First and foremost, this is about J-hope, so what else reason do I need to enjoy it?!! Second, on an emotional side, when I came to know that J-hope also has fears and dreams just like the rest of us, I was feeling more connected to him. Like as if I can feel his stress and pressure. I hope it is not sounding weird, but I felt like that. To top it off, he stays after events to thank and hug every staff, which is so sweet and down-to-earth behavior. His interactions with Jimin and Becky G (Rebbeca Marie Gomez) are the icing on the cake. When Jimin was so proud of J-hope and almost cried, I was also crying and feeling proud. Third, his performance at Lollapalooza set a new history. The behind-the-scenes look at his preparation and nerves leading up to the show has increased interest and even provided some excellent value.In a nutshell, J-hope takes us on his solo project journey through this film. We get to know about how The multi-talented artist takes a risk by experimenting with a fusion of kpop, grunge, and rap, how all of the hard work and hardship he faces along the way, etc. The epic Lollapalooza concert is one of the results. Therefore, at least for BTS stans, this is a fantastic documentary that should not be missed.",False
15,10,You gotta see it for yourself. j-hope JAY Hobi Hoseok all in one documentary!,flcaaz,n/a,16/08/2025,"J-HOPE is an incredible artist and person. I love his music. He's the best performer I have ever seen live.I highly recommend this well-made documentary to anyone who likes documentaries, music, behind the scenes content, or learning what makes a talented, passionate person tick. J-HOPE as a solo artist has been waiting years for the opportunity to finally come out of the box and he did it in the grandest fashion in true ""j-hope"" style. Even his most loyal fans were shocked and thrilled by his album Jack in the Box and his historic and legendary Lollapalooza performance. He really set the bar high.Without giving too much away, I like that they showed him creating/writing his album in the Hope World studio. His interactions with his family, staff, members, dancers, and peers are so sweet.I was at Lollapalooza aka Hobipalooza in person (insane, one of the best experiences of my life). The editors did a great job building up excitement and tension in the documentary which had me questioning... ""Oh is everything going to turn out okay with the performance?"" even though I know it did because I was there lol. Thank you j-hope, the creative team (the stage director seems so sweet), and everyone at Disney Plus for bringing this to a wider audience. I had been waiting to see j-hope perform his own music for more than four years and to see it captured in high quality Disney doc style is awesome. The sound quality of the several songs they show is great. It makes me think that he could release the ""Live at Lollapalooza"" version of his set as an album. Even if you know nothing about BTS or j-hope, you'll be entertained. Fyi, j-hope's music is beyond the ""k-pop genre."" Jack in the Box is more old school hip hop boom bap with some rock grunge r&b and more. I highly recommend you check out his music, music videos, and his entire Hobipalooza set available on yt. He genuinely appreciates his fans' support. I am always rooting for his success and look forward to his newest song ""on the street.""I'll be re-watching this documentary often. This documentary and my Jack in the Box vinyl are very precious to me as a j-hope fan.",False
16,10,PERFECTION,Afi_vaqar,n/a,16/08/2025,Oh my gosh From start till the very end I loved everything about this!! You literally feel like you are part of the journey... not only that but you also feel like you are physically attending every single concert.. you see the raw moments... each and every single step... from song writing till the dance practices.. the band practice.. and seeing the other bts members coming to support j hope every now and then was really wholesome... Also you notice that hobi is just sooooooo handsome oh my gosh it's crazy how he's so perfect.. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! HOBI IS STRAIGHT UP PERFECTIONNNNNNNN...!!!!!!!!!,False
17,10,Jhope,jennymastergeorge,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jhope in The Box is such a rare inside glimpse of the mind of musical icon Jhope. He is well known for his role within BTS but not much is known of his process for making music in or outside of the team. He shares such a guarded part of the process of him creating his project Jack In The Box that he says has been inside of him since before his debut 2013.This documentary takes you through the process of challenges of him controlling the helm of making the album, promotion preparations, and his solo debut as the first Korean act to Headline Lollapalooza. Jhope is adamant about showing a more mature side of himself as well as a new direction and message he wants convey within his music.Jhope is a true artist and this documentary truly shows how much love and respect he has for his craft, that he won't settle if he knows he can do better. Every artist should be taking notes.",False
18,10,Great documentary,ambn-06324,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great documentary that shows how hard working and dedicate is J Hope to the music and to his fans. Very well done, shows the process of creating his album, family time and performing time as the super star that he is. The viewer can learn about J Hope a lot, not only as a BTS member, but as a solo artist that can deliver such a perfect album and sold out a big venue as Lollapalooza. He took care of all the details for this new chapter of his artistic life and the result was amazing. He loves to perform and he loves his fans, so he does everything possible to show that. I recomend it very much.",False
19,10,Surprisingly impressed,hoseokinny,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this documentary so much and actually saw it twice to savor each moment. It was fascinating to take a close look at how the album Jack in the Box was created and the thoughts behind the album. The documentary vividly shows how j-hope was involved in every step of the production, from one to ten as he said, One thing clear about the artist is that this guy never ever compromises the quality of his music and performance no matter what. His dedication to his craft throughout the whole process was astounding, and his performance on stage gave me goosebumps all the way. One impressive moment was when he faced a slump and asked himself why he can't live his life in another way, in spite of the pain of creation he had to go through. It was a moment of reflection on his identity and his destiny. He accepts himself, and with a clear idea who he is, follows his destiny fiercely and passionately. This documentary honestly follows his journey, revealing lots of bare face behind the scene. For those who don't know him as an artist, I'd recommend the video of his Lollapalooza performance on Youtube where J-Hope stood as the first main stage headliner for Korean musicians. His breath, sweat, the intense energy of the venue, and his interaction with fans...everything was so raw and alive. Absolutely two thumbs up! Again, j-hope is fearless, a born-to- be artist, and a risk-taker not afraid of testing his limits and the audience can't help feeling it. Lastly, I'm glad this documentary included a little episode of him visiting his parents' place. It was such a soulful, heart warming scene for me. Plus, the Lollapalooza setting in Chicago was a visual treat. I think I will watch this a few more times.",False
20,10,J Hope starts BTS Chapter 2 with a Bang.,bootikins,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary provides an insight in to the promotion, preparation of J-Hope's solo album Jack in the Box and his solo performance as the 1st Korean artist to headline a US festival at Lollapalooza. The documentary provides an insight in to J-Hope's worries, anxieties, relationship with Big Hit staff as he kicks off BTS Chapter 2 with his solo album. The documentary is beautifully shot, shows the intense dance preparations, creation of the Lollapalooza set and the amazing album provides the soundtrack to the documentary. The documentary shows J-Hope as the dedicated, all round performer. Highly recommend watching his Lollapalooza concert on YouTube after watching the documentary.",False
21,10,J-hope the ACE OF KPOP,colombiayrumba,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like ARMY and Ho-seok bias I am really in awe of Hobi's talent and professionalism.He is a man who, throughout his more than 10-year career, has grown both as a human being and as an artist.Jack In the Box is a masterpiece the conception and preparation of the album was very beautiful and personal. Hobi showed us his concern when he did and Hobipalloza was monumental the long hours of work, the sleepless days, the times that he could not eat a bite and that energy that he put into each performance.And thanks to Jiminsi who was with him in this big stepVery proud to be his fan and i love him so much.",False

We get a glimpse of his different sides which is not limited to the sunny disposition that we all know. It shows all the hard work and hardship that he endures during this journey.

23,10,A must watch for music lovers!!,somz-61932,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been following j-hope music since 2019 and have been mindblown from very beginning. Be it hopeworld, chicken noodle soup, or going back to 1verse (not even talking about his whole discography being part of BTS) ...I had been looking fwd to his latest album jack in the box which came out in July 2022. It was a complete shift from what he had done before and his image as a kpop idol being part of BTS. He completely blew my mind. His music is old school hip hop and the lyrics r very deep. He went to headline lollapalooza and broke records there!! No wonder it gained the name hobipalooza ( hobi is his nickname :) )
This documentary is a behind the scenes of the his album and what went on to become what the world came to know as hobipalooza!! Very intriguing and keeps ur attention fully engaged! On top of being an artist, j-hope is a lovely human being. Check that in his interactions with his staff, dancers n crew! All in all, it's a beautiful, raw and not to be missed documentary for a music lover. Even if ur not into kpop (which his solo music is a huge shift from) , u should watch this coz u will get to know a brilliant artist and a lovely person behind all this :) hope u enjoy this!",False
24,10,The superstar that shine like a star : JHOPE,elizabethpaulinemayau,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seing how he worked hard for his music, how hands on he is on everything makes it no question why he is the superstar. I am glad i am able to watch it and not going to lie, it does motivate me a little on how i see and handle things in my life. I really hope with this documentary people will see who jhope is. He is more than a singer/rapper from BTS. He is an artist who work hard on what he loves and he always does the best for his arts/music. From the documentary we can see how he struggled but he managed to give us Jack In The Box. What i like the most is the communication between the artist and the staff. The back and forth feedback make his outcome even better. I am going to watch this again just to appreciate that.",False
25,10,This documentary is the best. But Jimin was unnecessary.,dodams-19383,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is the best. I hope j-hope's record of his musical journey will continue.But I hope the movie director will be replaced. The director recruited Jimin without consulting j-hope and put him in at will, and eventually handed over a lot of footage to Jimin.I can't understand why Jimin appeared or why he took up so much footage. Jimin took the screen by interrupting j-hope every important moment he needed to be in the spotlight under the pretext of cheering. Because of that, we couldn't really enjoy j-hope's important moments.One of the cameras even filmed Jimin separately, who was not the main character and had no role. The camera that took Jimin was actually supposed to be directed at the audience and the staff. It would have been much more screen-rich and fun.Where are the fans who waited in line from dawn, waited all day in a place with no shade, sold out goods in an instant, and cheered until late at night? Where is the mayor of Chicago and the founder of Lola Fallujah who introduced j-hope himself?Director Park Joon-soo committed a big disrespect to j-hope. I object to him filming j-hope's video in the future.Nevertheless, j-hope made the documentary great. For Disney Plus to be more successful, it needs to be thoroughly prepared in advance so that no one will cheat using content.",False

1,7,Quietly shocking,Leofwine_draca,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI remember this story well from it being in the news at the time. This expose looks into the dark heart of an isolated island community and leaves few stones unturned. It turns out to be less about child abuse and more about the politics of the investigation, from the necessity of scapegoating and flawed policework to the focus of all the politicians on protecting the image of the island at the cost of literally everything else. Quietly shocking.",True
2,10,Powerful,mjsterno,n/a,16/08/2025,A powerful reminder of the power of journalism to fight for justice. I'd highly recommend this film to all.,False
3,10,great documentary,misel-21227,n/a,16/08/2025,Wonderful and inspirational movie! Very riveting story and just beautiful visually!,False
4,10,AMAZING,charlottebliss,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a younger person living in Jersey, I found this to be really eye-opening. Shows how easy it is to cover up secrets.",False
5,3,I wish they would let this rest,susanp-78790,n/a,16/08/2025,"Speaking as a Survivor of the system, there is no doubt failures happened. But I found this Documentary did me more harm than good. It is a shame the makers did not take into account the many Survivors who need and want to move on since the end of the Jersey Enquiry some years ago. And there were no proven child murders at Haute de la Garenne so I wish outside Journalists would stop repeating this nonsense. Jersey was dragged into an unnecessary Media storm at the time away from the real abuse that happened, and some people keep on trying to take us back there. Please stop.",False
6,10,Incredible,ciarabennett,n/a,16/08/2025,"An intriguing documentary, Netflix needs to pick this up!!",False
7,10,Eye-opening,laurenamcmurray,n/a,16/08/2025,"Eye-opening and tear jerking documentary. An incredible story of bravery of the survivors, who clearly went through a living hell for decades and now finally have their story shared. And a huge credit to the bloggers who fought from the beginning and never gave up on the survivors or the truth, and to the directors/producers for putting together such a heartbreaking story. This is a must watch.",False
8,1,You can say it got nowhere,Captureman199,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was intrigued to find out what had happened since this documentary was made 3 years on, and you can say nothing.The ex Politician who never once offered himself up for cross examination on any of his far out claims from 2008 onwards emigrated. So instead of fighting for the people he claimed to represent he simply ran away.Then one of the bloggers featured had his blog removed by Google because it broke their rules - presumably because at one time he liked to harass innocent people.The other blogger featured also disappeared after making lots of claims without any credible follow ups. Whilst the producer who never had anything good to say about Jersey has also done a disappearing act.In conclusion, this Documentary 3 years on got nowhere. So it had zero credibility. And if that were not the case, then the historic abuse investigation would have been re-opened and those involved would still be around.",True
9,1,Not wholly Accurate,financejersey,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTime for a reality check on this documentary.For starters Jersey does not hold £1 Trillion Dollars within it's Finance Industry so that figure was pulled out of the air.Secondly the Politician who claims to be a political prisoner on the Island was never above the Law, and wasn't even a politician when convicted of Data Protection offences coupled with Contempt of Court issues.Actually he failed to get elected in 2 previous elections before charges were raised against him so he was a civilian when charged. A big difference to the claims made here.The Police officers Messrs. Harper and Power were found by the Wiltshire Constabulary to have made a mess of this investigation. Now these are the conclusions of a separate investigative Police Force, not any local politician of qualified journalist as implied here.The Bloggers concerned have always had their theories on the infamous coconut chip found at Haut de La Garenne but as specified many times before. Unless the Police have the name of a missing child, then the name of a potential predator with a motive. Nothing further can be done with this theory.The Producer of this Documentary has for sometime made wild accusations against Jersey's Finance Industry and so to has the ex Politician involved. People make wild online claims against Jersey's Finance Industry all the time but it is an offence to Launder Money in the Island and facilitate Tax Evasion. What normally happens is that people report their claims and get those breaking the Law charged. They do not go online and make unfounded accusations against the Island's Finance Industry in the vague hope that something will come of it.",True
10,1,The Train has been and gone.,ianlucas-77716,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was watched in Jersey and very quickly forgotten and the main reason is because they had heard it all before, and many times. We had a £26 Million inquiry which involved some 400 witnesses. Now the former HSS Minister who instigated this program, never even bothered giving evidence to that inquiry and despite his pleadings for legal representation, which as a former Politician, he did not even need. His Public Duty to give his sketchy evidence was his call and nobody else's. The Train has been and gone. But for the rest of the Island the Care Inquiry is over, the appointed Children's Commissioner is doing her job and the Island moves on. The other thing is that out of a population of some 110,000 Islanders, this only affected some 200 people in Care. So the majority of Jersey people would have no indirect or direct connections to any of it.",False
11,5,Great Documentary,Lenny_Hopeless188299,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI must congratulate former CM of Jersey Mr Frank Walker for setting the record straight here. It was a lot of pressure at the time but at least he showed full support for the abuse victims and even offered an open cheque book (which was abused by the then disgraced Police officers) in order to get to the truth. Shame on the former disgraced HSS Minister for still trying to re-write history. He did nothing in the end for the victims as promised. Not even a show at the Multi-million Pound Enquiry when you would have thought he'd be the first person there to show proof of all the ludicrous claims he had made online to that date. But well done Frank and also former Deputy Andrew Lewis for his hard work and perseverance. At least those who needed to hear the truth can now close the book.,True
12,1,More conspiracies than realities.,michael_alexander,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA reflection of the infamous Haut de la Garenne 'remains of a child' story which came out of Jersey back in the noughties.What is amusing about this story is how anxious some people are to go back and re-write what actually happened. Despite a £26 Million enquiry dismissing murder, cover ups and alleged conspiracy by the Authorities. Everybody knows the Police were inept, the remains of a child turned out to be coconut and the ex politician involved ended believing he was above the law only to find out that he wasn't!If they actually did a proper film on what really happened here, it would demonstrate how the Police, Politicians and Media can get carried away with a story and behave unprofessionally.I cannot recommend this documentary because it lacks honesty. It is a rehash of what really happened by attention seekers and should be taken with a pinch of salt.",True

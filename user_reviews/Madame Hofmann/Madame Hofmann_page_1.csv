1,9,A beautiful slice of life,Sebastien02,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary introduces us to Sylvie Hofmann, a great woman who is the head nurse in the oncology department of a hospital in Marseille. Despite the trials she goes through and the difficulties she encounters in practicing her profession (lack of staff and resources), I often smiled and sometimes even laughed. It is full of humour and human warmth. I left the screening feeling good and having learned a few things about how a hospital ward works. I love the energy that emanates from this beautiful piece of art. Another fine moment of cinema from SÃ©bastien Lifshitz, after the already remarkable ""Adolescents"" and ""The Invisibles"".",False

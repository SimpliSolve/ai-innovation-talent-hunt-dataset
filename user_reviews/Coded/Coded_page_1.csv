1,6,Good but it needed to be longer.,Otkon,n/a,15/08/2025,And more focused on the artist and the art. Too much ancillary posturing about more modern advertising and not enough explication and analysis of the man's illustrated works as they pertain to the hidden meanings.It left me wanting more.,False
2,9,Good...,RosanaBotafogo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Queer, the LGBTQIA+, the letter Q means strange, they are people who do not identify with the standards imposed on sex and gender, moving between genders... However, the film goes beyond these definitions, portrays the great prejudice about the theme... Good, very good, but sad...
An expert artist who portrayed homosexuality, through subliminal drawings, very well represented in this beautiful documentary biography of J. C. Leyendecker, his 50-year union with Charles Beach, at a time when this was unthinkable and even criminally reprehensible, from 1901 to 1951... Sad and unacceptable, even for the time, revolting...",False
3,9,Definitely give it a watch,atama-17341,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved it a lot, I wish more people knew this documentary existed and knew about J. C. Leyendecker's work
It really needs more promotion and the animation was beautifully used to tell the story, I really appreciated it, I always love when an illustrator or painter's life is expressed through drawings and paintings like this documentary (or Loving Vincent.)
and as a queer person it's makes me immensely happy and incredibly inspired every time I find out about queer people throughout history who have made an impact even if they didn't receive the credit they deserved and just now are getting the recognition :')",False

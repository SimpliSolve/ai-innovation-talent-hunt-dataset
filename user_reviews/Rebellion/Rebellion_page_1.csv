1,10,Fly-on-the-wall film making to perfection! With interesting characters,imogenwethered,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really interesting and well directed observational documentary. Fly on the wall film making to perfection - as they follow the eclectic group of Extinction Rebellion leaders across several years from early beginnings to global awareness of the movement. I was hugely impressed by the foresight of the producers/directors in identifying the potential of the group as subject matter. I was fascinated to see how activism can work, along with the group's use of super glue and their drive to obtain prison lock-ups as a measure of success! The film certainly portrays some very interesting characters.",False

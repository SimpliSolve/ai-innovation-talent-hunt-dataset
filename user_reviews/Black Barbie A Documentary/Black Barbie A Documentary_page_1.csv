1,7,Well made,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDirector and writer Lagueria Davis has created an amazing movie that asks so many questions about Barbie and what she means to the world of race. Yes, there were once no black Barbies, then there was only Julia, Barbie's black friend who had no African-American features, just the same doll with black skin. And today, we have come pretty far, but still not far enough, as this movie shows.Davis' aunt Beulah Mae Mitchell worked at Mattel for 45 years and was only the second black person to work at their headquarters. She became friends with the woman who created Barbie, Ruth Handler, as well as Kitty Black Perkins, who made the first black-featured Barbie.At one point, girls had to ask, ""Why not make a Barbie that looks like me?"" I was thinking about this today at a toy show, as when I was a kid, the only choices black kids had when buying Star Wars toys were Lando and one of his Bespin guards. That's it. Two black dolls and hundreds of other aliens and all white people.I liked how this film showed how people interacted with the doll as kids, what it means to them today and how the brand still needs to do better. That said, the fact that representation has increased does mean something. As a purchaser of boy toys growing up, G. I. Joe always had a diverse team of ethnicities and outlooks, even having multiple African-Americans: Roadblock, the heavy machine gun soldier who joined the army to learn how to be a chef; Doc, a military chaplain and medic who despite being on an anti-terrorism task force is a pacifist; Stalker, who escaped the ghettos of Detroit to be a leader and Alpine, who was an accountant and a mountaineer. On the cartoons, the Cobras even had black characters, such as Cobra officer Lieutenant Clay Moore and Raven, a Strato-Viper pilot. As for He-Man, an all-white line, they have added the Sun Man characters to their characters, providing some much-needed addition of other races.The ""Barbie and Nikki Discuss Racism"" moment in this in pretty weird, though. I think it's important to speak on these issues, but even G. I. Joe mainly handled problems like downed power lines. It's a big topic for kids to get into and are Barbie and Nikki the right people to be discussing these heavy issues?Black Barbie raises thoughts and questions I didn't think of and for that, I found it an interesting film. I'd liked if it was a little shorter, but it's not my movie or story to tell.",True
2,6,Decent with a few irks,phae_dra,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a BB collector, I was eagerly looking forward to this documentary. For those of us who collect BB there is very little media attention given to the historical significance of BB. I thought the doc was well done, the narrator seemingly not liking dolls at the beginning and then saying she liked them at the end I found to be fake for the sake of the documentary and unnecessary. At least that is how it came across. The inclusion of certain commentators was also puzzling. Why was Gabourey Sidibe, who had no experience with BB or anything of value to add to the documentary included? Was she there for window dressing or did the producers want to make a point? I still don't get it. At least other contributors could relay their direct experience either owning or playing with the dolls. The social experiment with the children and the dolls was interesting but was too long and should have been edited. Although the scene of the black boy grabbing up the white barbie claiming she is the nicest, prettiest etc..is a scene that will never leave me. My goodness I hope his parents are able to help him overcome his lack of self awareness. It also would have been interesting to see actual BB collections of people, like myself who have spent decades cultivating their collection. Maybe expand the documentary outside of the scope of a few people. The discussions with Kitty Black Perkins and the Mattel employees was fascinating and I would of liked to hear more details about specific dolls, especially the vintage ones including the black males. Christie/Brad /Francie/Cara/Curtis. This documentary was a decent effort but I found it lacking in many areas.",False
3,10,Unwrapping the Magic of Black Barbie on Netflix,nick11042002,n/a,16/08/2025,"Opening Statement
In a world where dolls are more than just playthings, Netflix's Black Barbie documentary stands out as a heartfelt exploration of representation, history, and the enduring legacy of one of the world's most iconic toys.For Barbie fans, movie buffs, doll lovers, and toy enthusiasts, this film is a must-watch. Let's take a deep dive into why this documentary is worth every minute of your attention. Here is my movie review.Discovering the Hidden Layers of Barbie
The documentary by writer and director Lagueria Davis, begins with an engaging opening statement that pulls viewers into the story of Barbie's evolution. It examines how the doll has mirrored societal changes and the pressing need for diversity in toys. From the moment the first Barbie was released in 1959, it was clear that she would be more than a mere doll-she would become a cultural icon.A Glimpse into Barbie's History
One of the most fascinating aspects of Black Barbie is its detailed exploration of Barbie's history. Created by Ruth Handler, Barbie was initially introduced to fill a void in the toy market for an adult-looking doll that could inspire girls to dream big. Handler's vision was groundbreaking, and the documentary does an excellent job of showcasing her innovative spirit and the people she chose to surround herself with.Ruth Handler's Visionary Leadership
Ruth Handler's role in Barbie's creation is central to the documentary. Handler listened to her workforce (especially Beula Mae Mitchell), welcoming ideas and feedback that would shape Barbie's future. This open-minded approach allowed the brand to evolve and address changing societal norms and expectations, including the need for more diverse and representative dolls.The Birth of Black Barbie by Kitty Black Perkins

The film highlights the importance of representation and how a single doll can make a huge impact on young minds. The documentary included an insightful look at the work of Doctors Kenneth and Mamie Clark and ""The Doll Test."" This test essentially proved the psychological effects of segregation on African-American children. Black children preferred white dolls over Black dolls, even though they looked the same except for skin color.Cultural Impact and Representation
Black Barbie has had a profound cultural impact. The documentary dives into stories from individuals who saw themselves represented in Barbie for the first time. These personal anecdotes emphasize the importance of diversity in toys and how it can inspire self-confidence and pride in one's identity. I won't ruin it by telling you the names but I was pleasantly surprised to know of the people that had a Barbie in their own image.Expert Curation and Insights

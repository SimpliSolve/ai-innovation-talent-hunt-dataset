1,7,Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhakpa Sherpa,CinemaSerf,n/a,15/08/2025,"Next time you are in the supermarket, have a look at the staff and imagine that one of them has climbed Mount Everest ten times! That's the story of this illiterate Nepali woman who has struggled to bring up her two daughters, hold together an increasingly violent marriage and then work with her brother at home in Nepal to lead teams of people to the top of the world's highest peak. What's clear from the outset here is she is an immensely grounded and humble woman who has a deep respect for the mountain: she even asks it's permission before ascending (and assumes force eight winds and avalanches is it saying no!). Using her latest attempt in 2018 as the starting point for the story, we are introduced to her daughters - Shiny, who is accompanying her mother on the trip, and the not so aptly named Sunny who, at 19, is staying at home. It's never been an easy ride for Lhakpa Sherpa. She couldn't even get a job as a porter when she started out - women weren't deemed to be strong enough, but her perseverance eventually convinced the then Prime Minister to encourage women to take a more active part in the business of the mountain. She meets and later marries Romanian climber George Dijmarescu and the pair become a formidable team as her summit's start to mount up, but he had baggage of his own stemming from a poverty-stricken youth in Romania and a dependency on the bottle which adds to the trauma for both and to her troubles at their home in Connecticut. The photography both current and archive is frankly quite breathtaking, illustrating the bleak hostility of the almost lunar terrain and by the end of this documentary, I thought she made it look almost straightforward (even if she does admit, in her mid-40s - to feeling ""a little crappy"" at 25,000 feet!). There's something engaging about Lhakpa Sherpa. A woman dedicated, respectful and loving who is certainly addicted to the outdoor life, but who is clearly motivated to do all she can to support and educate her daughters. It's hard to imagine that she will ever stop and it wouldn't surprise me if she were to inspire one of her daughters, and a great many Nepali women, to follow in her footsteps.",False
2,8,Astonishing persistence,JoyceGalileo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lhakpa Sherpa Has climbed Mount Everest 10 times and holds the record for The number of times a woman has summitted Everest. The story is even more amazing because of her abusive husband, Romanian climber who found refuge in America and met her on one of the climbs.She narrates the film and takes one of her daughters with her back to Nepal where she does her 10th summit. It's enchanting to see her daughter meeting her cousins in Nepal and it's heartbreaking to see the daughter who stayed back in West Hartford, and who has gone through a tough time because of her abusive father.Watching her climb was frightening, but the entire film is very moving.",False
3,7,Hard work and strong constitution,MickyG333,n/a,15/08/2025,"7.3 stars.I was moved by this documentary. This woman, apparently some sort of Nepalese peasant girl, born in a cave, born a Sherpa. She explains the Sherpa girls, they are born with the name Sherpa and their first name is the day of the week, and she was born on a Wednesday, thus Lhakpa. And so with that tidbit of knowledge given to us, we embark on her most recent climb of Everest in 2022 with flashbacks over the past 20 years. This is her tenth climb. She is the only woman to climb Everest more than 6 times, according to Wikipedia. There are two women that have done it 6 times. The story is amazing. She seems to be a sound person with a lot of energy, a positive mental attitude, and two wonderful daughters. Her husband was an abusive man and she had to overcome that challenge as well. She really is a hero.This is an emotional film for many reasons. The music evokes feelings of sympathy and joy. I highly suggest you check it out, just to get an idea of how some seemingly unknown and unfortunate person can be so successful in life and overcome so many challenges.",False
4,10,Give sponsorships to this cool woman,mmartic-21937,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved this documentary, even though it was completely opposite of what I expected it to be.I've been following Lhakpa's professional life before this documentary, but I didn't know the hardships she's been through. I cried so much and I am so happy to see the reward for all she has accomplished.She is a lovely mother, fighter, smart and interesting story-teller. If I were to climb high mountains, I would definitely love to have her as my guide, and enjoy hearing amazing stories and life's simple truths told in an interesting way.She is lucky to have such a lovely and beautiful daughters. I hope life gives them peace and health. They already have great support.",False
5,10,A very real story about a very real woman,kerrytalam,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a beautiful, touching, very real story about a remarkably humble & determined woman. Her journey is often tough & calls for her to dig deep for the resources she needs for her & her family to survive; in doing so she discovers she thrives & conquers on those challenges. Her story is an inspiration for women of every circumstance, demonstrating that resourcefulness & sheer determination are necessary to transform one's existence. Lharkpa, you are amazing.üôè
The documentary itself, is excellently shot, in what must arguably be, the world's most beautiful location & is most sensitively allowed to unwind with her own personal narration. Inspirational story told excellently, job well doneüôè",False
6,6,Mountain Madness,dierregi,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm in the grip of a mountain obsession right now, watching and reading everything I can about climbers. Naturally, that led me to ""Mountain Queen"", the story of Lhakpa Sherpa - a remarkable, resilient Nepali woman with achievements as towering as Everest itself.Watching it right after the nearly unbearable ""14 Peaks"" brought some serious cognitive dissonance. In ""14 Peak""s, we're presented with Nirmal Purja, a sort of Nepalese superman who showcases the triumph of Nepali men over Westerners. ""Mountain Queen"", however, tells a different story, revealing that while Nepalese men may conquer peaks, they're not exactly climbing the mountain of gender equality. Women like Lhakpa face deeply ingrained sexism, with little access to education and a societal structure that limits their opportunities.Lhakpa Sherpa herself is nothing short of heroic. Coming from a poor family, she found a way to carve out a life in Nepal and later in the U. S., initially with her partner (later husband), George, also a mountaineer. The respect I have for her knows no bounds; she fought her way up Everest not once, but a record-breaking 10 times and even summited K2 - all without the support or recognition her male counterparts receive.Yet, here's where the documentary falters. Following what I can only assume is the unwritten Netflix directive to avoid telling stories chronologically, we're plunged into a flashback whirlpool of Lhakpa's life, from her triumphs on Everest to her difficult and abusive marriage with George. While her resilience through domestic violence is part of her story, the focus on her suffering almost overshadows her achievements, making the documentary feel more like a bleak recounting of DV than an ode to her accomplishments.Despite her challenging personal life, Lhakpa emerged as a record-setting climber who defied odds stacked against her at every turn. It's a shame that the documentary's jumbled editing seems more interested in casting her as a victim than in celebrating her heroism.",False
7,9,Wonderful view of Everest from a native point of view,dsb-02142,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary because it gave an experience from a native Sherpa point of view. Not only that but aI really enjoyed this documentary because it gave an experience from a native Sherpa point of view. Not only that but a native Sherpa woman! Her goals, her accomplishments in the face of extreme prejudice and adversity is a true testament to the strength and amazing gift of the Sherpa. I've always been amazed when watching documents on Everest of the endurance and loyalty of the Sherpa. This documentary helped me to understand the mindset and drive of this amazing people. A must see for Everest fans.",False
8,10,Super Woman of the Mountains,abhijitnaik-37260,n/a,15/08/2025,Such an inspiring story . Very well directed and a sensitive portrayal of Lakhpa and her family. You get drawn in to the story from the get go. Here is a woman who is transported to an Alien land and the way she picks herself up is amazing! I loved the way her relationship with her two girls and the manner in which this has been portrayed.The majestic Everest and the influence this mountain has on the Sherpas is well depicted.I truly hope that this documentary will bring her fame and fortune that she so richly deserves.At the end you tear up and hope that she continues to Climb and inspires many women to do so in her footsteps.,False
9,10,An Inspiration to Women (and Men),cinwalkbag,n/a,15/08/2025,"This incredible woman, Lhakpa Sherpa, who has summited Mount Everest an astounding 10 times, has inspired many people with her kindness and grace in the face of countless obstacles, and with her strength and determination to create a better life for her children and herself. Her dream from an early age was to climb to the top of Everest to ""see what's on the other side"", and in spite of no education and no money, she persevered until she not only became the first woman to summit Mt. Everest and survive, but then broke her own record an incredible 9 more times. As if that weren't enough, she also summited K2! This documentary was very well done, with amazing videos of her climbs, as well as home videos of her children as they grew up. Beautiful, touching documentary.",False
10,4,A Celebration of Narcissism,judyahughes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why are viewers celebrating narcissism? Both climbers were complete narcissists. Her accomplishments were incredible, but she placed her safety and life at risk with impressionable and depressed kids at home. Her children are the heroes. They experienced major traumas throughout their lives caused by the parent's choices. Continuing to climb Everest left the possibility of no parent remaining in America. Beautiful cinematography and showing of the Sherpa culture. The structure of the documentary is well done, but throughout I was frustrated with the behaviors of the 2 main climbers and the destruction of Mt Everest through irresponsible tourism. My critique is not of the movie makers but of the subject.",False
11,9,"From Abuse to Altitude: Lhakpa's Journey from Unwed Mother to Everest Queen. Breathtaking Cinematography, Masterful Editing, and Inspiring Storytelling",samabc-31952,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Everest is my doctor. It fixes my soul.""
""Everest is a mountain queen, and it treats you as one.""LhapkaI am still reeling from the experience of watching this awe-inspiring and humbling documentary chronicles the extraordinary life and achievements of Lhakpa Sherpa, the first Nepali woman to climb Mount Everest and the only person to summit it ten times! Her record remains unbroken, just like her spirit.With unprecedented access to her personal journey, the film takes us on a breathtaking adventure to the highest peaks on Earth, while also exploring the depths of her resilience, determination, and courage. From her humble beginnings in a small Nepalese village to her triumphant summits, Lhakpa's story is a testament to the power of the human spirit.In a culture where the old saying ""having a daughter is like watering your neighbor's garden"" perpetuates gender bias, Lhakpa's achievements shatter this notion, proving that a daughter can bring immense pride and glory to her family and nation.What struck me most was the stark contrast between Lhakpa's fearlessness on the mountain and her helplessness in her personal life. Despite facing down treacherous ice walls and crevasses, overcoming unimaginable physical and mental challenges, and submitting Everest ten times, she struggled to stand up for herself in her own home. She suffered physical abuse at the hands of her husband and lived in constant fear.But Lhakpa's determination knows no bounds - after summiting Everest 10 times, she continued to push herself, climbing K2 in 2023, one of the most challenging mountains in the world!Lhakpa's journey is not just about conquering mountains but also about challenging societal norms and expectations. It's a powerful reminder that even the strongest among us can be vulnerable and that our greatest achievements cannot shield us from everyday life's challenges.The film's stunning cinematography and intimate storytelling weave together a narrative that's both thrilling and deeply moving. I laughed and cried along with Lhakpa, feeling a deep connection to her story.Watching the documentary was more than just a cinematic experience - it was a journey of self-discovery and inspiration. Lhakpa's story reminded me that we all have the power to overcome our challenges and reach new heights. It also reminded me that true strength isn't just about what we achieve but about how we face our vulnerabilities and weaknesses. She is my hero now!Overall, it is a must-see not only for those who are inspired by stories of adventure, perseverance, and female empowerment but also for every man and woman who values life and self-respect. Lhakpa Sherpa's remarkable story will leave you breathless, inspired, and eager to reach new heights. Watch Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhakpa Sherpa, a MUST-MUST-WATCH. Available on Netflix.",False

13,9,Inspiring stuff!,ahendo-53403,n/a,15/08/2025,I follow Lakhpa on Instagram and found her film there. What a resilient amazing woman. I wish her every success - her achievements should be recognised and celebrated. I think this film must be cathartic to the recovery of domestic abuse for both she and her daughters. I loved seeing a film about Everest being told from Sherpa perspective. She has a true passion and calling for the mountains and to see the respect she has for the mountain is inspiring in itself.She has a true passion and calling for the mountains and to see the respect she has for the mountain is inspiring in itself. I wish she and all her family well.,False
14,10,I rarely give a 10 but...,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a remarkable story told in a masterful manner. Lhakpa Sherpa is one of those characters that if you saw in a fiction film, you would think is too perfect. Born and raised in Nepal, Lhakpa carried her brother daily to school but was not allowed to enter because she was a girl. She used her innate intelligence and unbending will to overcome the unspeakable hardships she faced: chauvinism, misogyny, abuse, poverty, single-parenting. She had to overcome all that to then perform some of the greatest feats in climbing history.It is fortunate that there is great historic footage and photographs of her early exploits. The filmmakers chose to layer her current experience with the thread of her fascinating history, creating a dynamic film that flows and keeps the viewer's interest. My wife and I watched on my phone in a flight (not our favorite mode) and both had tears in our eyes at the end. Not of sadness, but of joy and awe.",False
15,8,amazing life and amazing views,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a documentary on Lhakpa Sherpa. At first glance, she is a lowly food worker in Hartford struggling to raise her kids as a single mom. It's 2022. She is returning to her Nepal to attempt her 10th Everest summit. She would be breaking her own record for the most Everest summit by a woman. She has brought one daughter while another daughter struggles to come to terms with the drunken abusive behavior of Lhakpa's ex-husband. This is an amazing life full of struggles and triumphs. The Everest views don't need me to sell them. I think I've heard about the Sherpa name although it is always shocking to be told again. I used to think that it's a job title.",False
16,1,What are people watching? This documentary isn't about mountaineering!,Dubdub1974,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm so confused by the never ending praise for this woman.**TRIGGER WARNING: Child Abuse, Neglect, DV***
This woman sure has accomplished incredible things in the mountaineering world but at what cost?!She had 4 kids. 4 kids she would abandon over and over again to chase her obsession of climbing Everest over and over again.And yes I know ""Hurt people hurt people"" and she has plenty of
hurt to share but if that explains things it doesn't excuse the behavior.This documentary was really hard to watch.Sure there's mountainnering in it but what I really see is cycles of abuse. We see 3 of her kids in the documentary. The youngest has taken on the classic role of parenting and defending her mother when she just in her mid teens. The older one can't even verbalize the trauma she witnessed but also was dealt when her mother would run off for months at a time to chase her obessions. It's not like the mother was making any money and could provide some kind of care for the kids. The documentary never addresses where she left those kids for months at a time while she disappeared. Her constant ""I love you""s while failing to make her kids a priority is textbook narcissism and gaslighting. Yes, she climbed Everest repeatedly, but it would have been far better if she'd actually cared for the children she brought into this world or at least provided them with some stability.",True
17,8,Remarkable and awe-inspiring life story,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhakpa Sherpa"" (2023 release; 104 min) opens, we are at ""Everest Camp Four, a/k/a the Death Zone"", and Lhakpa Sherpa is there, making contact with Base Camp, where her daughter Shiny is awaiting the latest update from her mom. We then go to ""Connecticut, Six Weeks Earlier"", where Lhakpa is working at Whole Foods, supporting herself and her 2 daughters. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from British director Lucy Walker (""Waste Land""). Here she reflects on the remarkable live and times of Nepali woman Lhakpa Sherpa (we learn that everyone in Nepal has the same last name: Sherpa). It is almost too hard to comprehend it all, but the film lays it out very nicely, jumping back-and-forth in time between today and the past. The film makers address the most difficult issues (an abusive marriage) head on, and how, despite all of the factors weighing against her, Lhakpa perseveres and along the way sets many Everest records. But let's be clear: the ""summits"" referred to in the movie title do not reflect just her mountaineering.""Mountain Queen: The Summits of Lhaka Sherpa"" premiered at the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival to immediate acclaim. The movie is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. Netflix started streaming this some months ago, and suggested it to me based on my viewing habits. Thank you Netflix! If you are interested in another Everest-related movie, or simply in the mood for a remarkable and awe-inspiring life story, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False

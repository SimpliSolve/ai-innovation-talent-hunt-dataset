1,6,Oddly enjoyable,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"A documentary quite unlike anything else I've seen. This Swedish offering is more like a Roy Anderson film. Scenes play out one by one, the camera locked as the action's captured within the frame. Now I say action, but there's nothing scripted. It's an honest albeit carefully crafted look at how funerals work. It's probably not for everyone. In all honesty I've no idea how things of this nature work in England, but I'm pretty sure the Swedes do it better. It certainly appears to have style, grace and a beautiful minimalism. There's a sense that you could point the camera almost anywhere and capture something cinematic. Maybe that's just Sweden? I need to visit. There's a weird mundanity to it and a sense that although we're party to some intimate settings and candid moments, we're kept at arms length by the camera. It's respectful. Despite its declaration to document the industry of death. It is carefully crafted and clearly intent on being a piece of cinematic art as much as anything else. It's nice though, simple. Nothing to decide, just watch and study. Preparing bodies, preparing funerals. Digging graves, adjusting wreaths. Everything we see has a purpose and connection, if not always immediately obvious. It's playful, drip feeding this world to us without anything extra, no guide, no narration. Just what we pick up from those on screen, bits of conversations, details of what's happening in the moment, but for their benefit, not ours. It's not at all somber, there's even some light humour, but mostly there's calm. Quite, well organised, uncluttered calm.",False
2,7,Death is not always scary,MarcoParzivalRocha,n/a,15/08/2025,"When someone dies, there are certain procedures that must be followed before the final rest.This documentary follows the routines of the death industry in Sweden. We see the daily life of workers in a morgue or the undertakers in a small rural cemetery.Doesn't feel morbid, this doc doesn't focus on the shocking parts of death, but rather on the serenity and respect that are part of an atmosphere that, strange as it may seem, transmits to the viewer peace and a feeling of satisfaction, as we see how the industry works.The photography is very good, using essentially static shots, which make sense in this narrative, very silent and symmetrical.The dialogues are short, essencial being small talk between colleagues.It's a good reflection on a topic that scares the human being so much.",False
3,9,Quite beautiful,daan-974-232383,n/a,15/08/2025,"A quiet observation of people that work in the funeral industry. Beautiful images, quirky and funny every now and then, yet respectful.",False

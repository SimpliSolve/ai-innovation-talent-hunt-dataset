1,8,Good documentary,markvanwasbeek,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ruben Smit returns with his newest nature documentary, centered around the not very well known grutto (other birds/predators are shown a lot too). Not too extraordinary, and propably not very interesting for foreigners. Unless you have a love for birds, or beautiful Dutch (winter) landscapes. However in light of the environmental issues in the Netherlands, it should be a must see for all Dutch people.",False

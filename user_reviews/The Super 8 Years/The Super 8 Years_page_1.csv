1,9,Super,MartenLovesFilm,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBeing usually seen as a film about the life of Annie Ernaux, that won't do this film justice. It's also a documentary, illustrating the world situation in the 1970s and onward. For example the illustration of how life in Chile really was when Salvador Allende was the ruler of the country, and what happened when Pinochet used an illegal military coup to become a sort-of dictator. Also, the film is a highlight because it's based on real super 8 material, which manages to really transport the shown situations and just feels more real. And yes, her life and that of her family is also shown, offering interesting insights and portraiing a very special person.",True

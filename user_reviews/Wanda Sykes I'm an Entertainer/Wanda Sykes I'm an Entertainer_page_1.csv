1,8,Wanda Knocks 'Em Outta the Park!,davidalan-66862,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWanda Sykes is at the top of her game, confirming she is one of the funniest women comedians OF ALL TIME!Throughout the hour-long show, Wanda knocks 'em out of the park as regularly as Aaron Judge did for the Yankees in 2022. For example, when telling the story of her 13-year-old daughter who invites her gay male friend over for a sleepover, Wanda tells the boy that it's okay that he's gay...but he better still be gay when he wakes up in the morning!Nobody delivers lines funnier than Wanda, with her Black twang, and she adds a surprising level of physical comedy to this routine, at one point dropping on the stage and doing a double rollover in a bit about her wife entering a store that was seconds a way from closing. The audience erupts in laughter at this and dozens of other big moments. Another great bit is when she talks about her lazy kids asking if they can eat breakfast before bed so that they can sleep in. That's just gold!The only thing that may make some viewers cringe is that Wanda gets very political through much of the the show. Unless you're an all-in Democrat, like Wanda is (and which the majority of the country is not, according to the latest polls), you may not be on her side completely from start to finish. But politics aside, she's pretty damn funny!",True
2,10,Outstanding Show!,Beaches700,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wanda Sykes did not disappoint! I truly enjoyed her one hour performance.Wanda was knowledgeable, creative, on point, and HILARIOUS on every level!!I laughed throughout her entire performance. I could truly relate to the content in her performance. She covered numerous topics and I was sitting at the edge of my seat waiting for the next one.Wanda also engaged me with her facial expressions and how she interacted with the audience. I laughed out loud during the entire performance.The performance went by quickly and I enjoyed the entire show.You will be thoroughly entertained! Superb!!",False
3,10,Wanda giving a masterclass,silkygirl20,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolute brilliance by Wanda using her incredible story telling, her tearing down of the recent political madness of the past few years packing every punchline with a huge laugh. Wanda absolutely sets the bar, every single time and all comedians need to take her lead. She brought absolute soul-crushing moments in this comedy special and then just as quickly picks you up with a laugh while your heart is still breaking. Thank you Wanda, you speak from the depths of your soul and we are so grateful for you and you bringing light in the darkness. I'll be arching this one over and over and laughing every time.",False
4,4,Wanda gone all political. Complete garbage,kbx-44606,n/a,16/08/2025,"She used to be funny, but now just using her act for political bashing and shaming white people. Gave 4 stars for the couple funny moments that had nothing to do with politics. Very sad! I don't think I would ever watch another of her specials and that's a shame cause she used to be funny. News flash Wanda: people just want to be entertained like you say you are not lectured about all the harm we caused your rich spoiled self . Sorry I was born and ruined your life by watching your shows and laughing at your jokes. Cause apparently the color of my skin is now a crime in your routine. Leave politics out of comedy.",False
5,5,Why do comedians think they're politicians?,bloo4455,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wanda, if you want to get into politics, go be a politician. Nobody is watching your stand up for a lesson on what you believe. Which is honestly what most of this ""stand up"" special felt like. It's obvious that when she's not doing her job, she sits in her mansion watching the news and gets all riled up to make herself feel like she doing something ""important"". I find it ironic that throughout her special, she claims that she is an entertainer, yet for the majority of the set, she is not entertaining, but rehashing tired and frankly old news. There were parts of the set that were funny. In particular, a bit about the women's bathroom that really had me laughing. I had to give the special 5 stars for that part alone. Wanda can be so energetic and funny and it honestly makes me disappointed that she will not stop talking politics and just be a comedian. Entertainers are supposed to give us an escape from the real world. If I really wanna hear about real world noise, I'll just go watch the news. I'll end with this:Dear comedians, actors and everyone in the entertainment industry,I speak for everyone when I say, we do not want to hear about politics in anything that you create. Please give us an escape and something to enjoy so we can recharge and be happy even if it's only for a little bit of time. Be a true artist and stop taking the easy and lazy way out by incorporating politics into your ""art"". Please.",False

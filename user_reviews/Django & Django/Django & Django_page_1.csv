1,7,Tarantino - the perfect guide for this tour,lotekguy-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've long maintained that no one in Hollywood has more fun with his craft than Quentin Tarantino. Here's further support for my thesis. Who else opens a documentary with a mockumentary? And gets a pair of major stars to appear in it?Though nominally an homage to director Sergio Corbucci, it's really more of a focused interview with Tarantino, allowing him to explain his love for Spaghetti Westerns, including their historic role in context with all that preceded them, and transpired here during those years, giving due credit to those on both sides of the cameras. Corbucci is the primary object of his praise, but many others, including some lesser-known contributors, get their moments in the sun, as well.I've seen over 300 of these films (including all that are featured here), and continue seeking others on my checklist. I'm obviously a genre fan. Even so, I found new appreciation for many I've already savored, and plan to re-watch a few, based on his insights. (In fact, since posting the rest of this review a couple of weeks ago, I re-watched Navajo Joe and upped my prior IMDb rating for it by a point; more appreciation for all Burt did there, thanks to QT's perspective.)Tarantino isn't credited as the writer or director of this doc, but his fingerprints are all over it, even beyond what he says on camera.I wish they'd covered one question that's been bugging me for a while, though it would have been somewhat off-topic. I've noticed many more Appaloosas in Spaghetti Westerns than in U. S. oaters of the same era. Were horses of that distinctive breed so much more prevalent in Spain than here, or did they just have better agents?The preceding digression notwithstanding, thanks for making this project, dude. It was fun and informative to see a bit of what's going on between your ears.",False
2,7,A Great Look Into The Inspiration For Quentin Tarantino,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This terrific documentary film centering around conversations with Quentin Tarantino about the history of the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci. The best part is that it reveals as much about Tarantino's films as it does about the Spaghetti Western genre. We see, at least, and hear Tarantino's understanding of the influences and the Direction. We see how the Fascism of WWII Italy influences the Directors. We see how the violence of the childhood world of these men impacted the violence of their films and, subsequently, Tarantino's films. For a lover of films, whether Tarantino, Westerns, of films and general this is great conversation and film.",False
3,7,"A fun, brief watch",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this, and think Tarantino is a very interesting director to listen to, and I find him talking about movies very engaging (almost as much as I enjoy hearing Scorsese talk about film). You can tell he's truly passionate about Corbucci and the genre of Spaghetti Westerns as a whole because there's a couple of times his words can't keep up with his thoughts ðŸ˜…I wish it had been a little longer by going into a few more movies (Corbucci appears to have directed heaps, and I've only seen two, so will need to check out some others), especially because I feel like there were a couple of extended montages near the end that only served to pad this out to over 70 minutes. But if ""I just wanted a bit more"" is the biggest complaint I have about a documentary, then it's honestly a pretty damn good documentary.",False
4,7,Informative even if Tarantino makes it more about himself than his subject,Retrostudious,n/a,16/08/2025,A really self-indulgent piece where the line is kind of blurred between Tarantino celebrating Corbucci and celebrating himself for being a fan of Corbucci.It's almost like a hipster at a gig smirking that he heard the band first but then decides to get up and play his own songs in the middle of their set.It was an enjoyable documentary but Tarantino took the shine away from it a little.,False
5,6,"Interesting, but too much Tarantino",MissyTheCat,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed this bit of history of Spaghetti Westerns focusing on the '2nd best' director of these westerns, Corbucci (behind Leone). It was interesting to see the influence on Tarantino's film making, especially his 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'.He is a serious fan of the director and genre, but it would have been nice to have had other film scholars discuss this as Tarantino is passionate, but disjointed and long winded when he discusses this topic. Also, it is pretty niche. It's mostly of this one director, during the time that he made westerns, even though he made other genre films before and after and there were other Italian directors also making westerns at this time.I found it interesting that at the end of the movie Tarantino is trying to guess who's grave a character is visiting at the beginning of one film and he takes a deep dive. Granted, he says its just his opinion, but a few minutes earlier in the documentary, they play an interview of Corbucci telling a story about an actor concerned with the direction Corbucci has given him in a scene as it won't match his character in the previous scene they had already shot. And Corbucci is essentially laughing at this actor's devotion to detail. So, the take away is that Corbucci was not too terribly concerned with details, and Tarantino's obsession with what the detail of this visit to a grave meant was probably all just in his head.None the less it was fun to geek out on this very specific detail in Italian/western film history with a serious fan of the topic.",True
6,8,Quentin Tarantino what a nerd,Marwan-Bob,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really loved it, Very informative and entertaining at the same time, a must watch for all cinephiles and especially Spaghetti western fans. Don't miss it.",False
7,8,Spaghetti Westerns 2nd best director,fostrhod,n/a,16/08/2025,"Django & Django, if you recall in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood, Ray ( Leonardo diCaprio) went over to Italy to make some spaghetti westerns. The first part of this movie recalls the fictitious meeting in great detail of Ray meeting Italian director Sergio Corbucci. Quentin Tarantino then narrates a great documentary about Corbucci. Nice to see clips of westerns that are very rarely seen now, and even better to see The Specialist from 1969 starring Johnny Hallyday , the film that should have been Ray's. Tarantino is his usual infections self in this thoroughly entertaining film 8/10.",False
8,8,KInd of Odd Little Documentary,polsixe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Or is t a mockumentary, not really sure with Tarentino's intro using his OUaTiH Rick Dalton backstory. Anyway, comes off as a good recap of Italian Spaghetti westerns, yes Corbucci is a real Director. Lots of clips, good for a laugh, and Tarentino does some kind of film school analysis of the deeper plotting and messaging. Makes one want to watch Minnesota Clay.",False

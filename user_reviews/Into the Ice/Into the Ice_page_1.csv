1,10,The Epics of nature,arjen-19805,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSimply the descent into a crater of darkness, to expose a cathedral of nature, illuminated into vision via refraction's of itself.It's awe inspiring to witness an event so grand in nature, shaped in streams of energy, only to be swept back into infinities of probability.The physics of earth seen on camera, growling back to us by wringing the layers of it's very creation against each other.Beyond this, I feel the film is showing us a current day view of the complexity of travel in these regions, the intense dangers and knowledge of the land that is required, only to stay alive by sheer luck.Also the technological hurdles become abundantly clear for measurement, a field that is easily overlooked.Measuring is knowing for certain, as the world is ever in flux, like a one of it's kind cathedral, unique in every possible way, pulled apart in probability of the energy put into it.",True
2,5,"""A disaster in slow motion"" -- Stunning ice shots, glacial narration",evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHere is a rare opportunity to enjoy the marvels of Greenland's ice sheet.That's the domain of several researchers studying changes in the frozen plain, which they attribute to global warming. These guys' work ain't exactly the stuff of exciting cinema, but a viewer won't tire of crystalline icebergs or sapphire rivulets in an environment sans construction or tree. The many colors of the ice zone reflect the age of its various parts -- some of which go back 11,000 years.I have an interest in arctic nature and cultures, and I'd have liked to glean a little of the context here -- perhaps a glimpse of the airfield, or the store where our probers stock up on packages of ramen. No such luck. However, at one point, we do see the scientists plant mini-pines in a woodsy locale, as they try to compensate for carbon footprints left by their work. Come again? I don't think the average moviegoer is going to grasp their logic. And where were they, anyway -- back in the Danish homeland of the filmmakers?Much time is devoted here to the 180-meter descent of a moulin, or shaft in the ice created by meltwater. We're told it took the guys two hours to get back up, yet we're shown nothing of a surely grueling ascent. Why?I question who'd go to see this in a theater. It seems better-suited for public TV. Maybe after midnight.",True

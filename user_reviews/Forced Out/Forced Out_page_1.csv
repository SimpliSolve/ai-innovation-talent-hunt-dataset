1,6,Orientation...,lechmich-18982,n/a,16/08/2025,"To serve your country should have nothing to do with what floats your boat. I might say that I am hetero male, and I have worked with gay men in several roles without problem. To make the distinction that the military is something other than in that living together means you might accidentally have sex or see.something arousing is ridiculously childish. To think that gay people are less suitable for combat roles than heterosexual people has not as far as I know been proven in any study as yet. The bottom line is that society cannot tell someone who they are allowed to love, and if that particular person wants to serve their country in the armed forces - so be it.",False
2,8,Important subject matter,joeybanana71,n/a,16/08/2025,"Clearly, I have been living in a bubble. I had an inkling that it was not generally a good idea to be gay and in the forces, but this documentary was a real eye opener for me. I had no idea just how savagely gay personnel were treated if their sexuality was discovered. I have nothing but respect for the people in this documentary, for fighting back against the awful, state-sponsored, homophobic bullying they endured. To think this hateful persecution has occurred in my country during my lifetime, is truly sickening to me. These people just wanted to serve their country - from what I can gather here, the country isn't worthy of them.",False

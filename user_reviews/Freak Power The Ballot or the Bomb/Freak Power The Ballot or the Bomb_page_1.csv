1,8,Packs a punch!,photographyisadrug,n/a,15/08/2025,"The more things change, the more they stay the same. In a surprisingly intimate look that show cases not just a passoinate side of Hunter S. Thompson but those around him, those that worked towards building better world, especially when it comes to the role of law enforcement. Ideas like that the role of the police shouldn't just be to make everyone out to be a criminal but understand the cause of crime and how a community can work towards unifying one another. It honestly felt that the same exact arguments between the conservatives and the freaks could be made today and unfornately probably even 20 years from now. But the film does a great job of creating a spark of hope, that change is possible, even radical change. As long as people stand up and use their voice with such passion that they just can't be ignored. For any fans of Hunter S. Thompson or just anyone that wants to see how politics at the community level can bring about huge change, this is a great film to check out.",False

And to have an idol be Hunter S Thompson, well goddamn. The film was amusing and also marked seriousness when thinking struck. I'm not going to involve spoilers because if you're reading this and considering watching. Well hell spend your hard earned dollar on this film. You wont regret it, especially if you love the man himself. This film gets a hell yeah for me and the boys. True grit while watching this film. Cheers.",False

4,10,'Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb' is the documentary that Hunter S. Thompson has long deserved,roryfeehan,n/a,15/08/2025,"As we close in on election day in the most contentious and insane presidential election in living memory, one question that keeps popping up across the media landscape is this - ""What would Hunter S. Thompson have to say about the current election and the sorry state of American politics?""It is a fair question to ask. As the author of Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail '72, Hunter S. Thompson was responsible for one of the most incendiary and celebrated books on the circus that is American politics. His coverage for Rolling Stone was a revelation at the time and is as fresh and compelling today as ever. Indeed, many so-called journalists and pretenders to the throne could do well to go back and read Thompson's coverage and learn about the difference between actual insightful and revealing writing and that of merely serving up sycophantic bulletin board puff pieces for their preferred candidate. Thompson took no prisoners and skewered politicians on both sides. It was a brave thing to do in the era of Nixon but then Thompson was no ordinary journalist. He refused to merely stand on the sidelines, sniping at the participants - Thompson got directly involved. In 1970 he ran for Sheriff of Pitken County, Colorado, on the Freak Power ticket in a surreal campaign that drew international attention. And he almost won. Though he lost the battle, his campaign kick-started a political movement in Aspen that ultimately won the war, the reverberations of which still ripple throughout the community today.The new documentary Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb, co-directed by Daniel Joseph Watkins and Ajax Phillips, tells the story of Thompson's campaign and builds upon Watkins' previous effort, the hugely impressive book Freak Power: Hunter S. Thompson's Campaign for Sheriff. In addition to the massive volume of research that they had from that project, they discovered a virtual treasure trove of original campaign footage, some of it not even developed, which forms the basis of this new film. Essentially, this allowed Watkins and Phillips to tell the entire story of Thompson's run for sheriff using original footage from 1970, filmed as the campaign progressed. Watkins also discovered nearly 3000 photographs from the campaign taken by David Hiser and Bob Kreuger. It is truly remarkable material that presents the real Hunter S. Thompson, totally unfiltered as he makes a serious attempt to affect political change in his home town.The directors made the sensible decision to let this extraordinary footage tell the story through the participants own words, captured as they were on the scene in 1970. Complimenting this are several voice-overs from the individuals involved, from Bob Braudis (former Sheriff of Pitken County) and Joe Edwards (former Pitken County commissioner) to the artist Ralph Steadman and Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone. In a clever move, we don't actually see these people until the very end, 50 years later, which proves to be strangely poignant.I don't want to give a complete breakdown of all the footage here or indeed the story. I think it is best that you see it unfold for yourself but I will say this - the parallel with what is happening today is uncanny. Through sheer serendipity, Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb serves to show us how little has changed in 50 years. The dynamics involved, the generational clashes and dirty political tactics deployed by the establishment are frighteningly familiar and relevant. One such powerful example of this is the scene at the beginning of the film as the incumbent Sheriff, Carrol D. Whitmire, representing the Democratic Party, debates Thompson. When asked about the source of Thompson's support, Carroll responds - ""I don't know what Freak Power is. I don't know what they are talking about when they talk about Freak Power."" Thompson's answer was as salient then as it is today - ""Freak Power is the ability to act, to have control over your environment, to have control of your government. My idea of running for sheriff is to expand the notion of the office. As it is now you just don't talk to a cop, they are the enemy and that's true not only of Aspen but of all over the country. That's a dangerous situation when the enforcement arm is totally out of communication with the reality...It is time that we either bridge that chasm with some kind of realistic law enforcement or else I don't think it is going to be bridged in this country, we are going to have revolution.""As someone who has invested many years writing and researching about Hunter S. Thompson for my PhD, I have to say it is a delight to see the man treated onscreen in a serious, respectful manner. Hunter on film has been very hit and miss over the years and there has always been a temptation to indulge the Gonzo persona or idle celebrity gossip. The film also benefits from the focus being solely on his pre-Fear and Loathing days, with none of the over-the-top theatrics that define his later career. I have always maintained the view that Hunter S. Thompson's career in the decade prior to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is actually the most interesting period of his life and the one which arguably contains his best work. Thankfully, more and more people are now discovering the incredible output from Hunter during this period (I highly recommend his letters collection The Proud Highway in this regard)Freak Power shows us the serious writer and concerned citizen from that period, determined to take a stand against the greedheads that threatened his community. It reminds us that there was a lot more to Hunter S. Thompson than drugs and bad behavior. Clearly the film was a labor of love for all involved and this is reflected in every aspect of the production, from the soaring soundtrack to the unmistakable film poster by none other than the legendary Ralph Steadman. I also believe that the film contains the only known footage of Hunter with his legendary attorney, Oscar Zeta Acosta, who is shown briefly with Thompson on election night as he learns of his political fate.However, as Thompson's campaign manager Ed Bastian added - ""In retrospect, we can see that it was a really powerful oar-stroke forward for the change and political dynamics in the valley area around Aspen. All of the things we did...they all set the stage for what was to soon follow."" Thompson's would later offer the mantra - ""Politics is the art of controlling your environment."" He proved that to be the case by getting involved and taking action. We can all learn from that.",False
5,10,This is the best documentary I have ever seen,gueronamara,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAn hour and half feels criminally short by the time we reach the inevitable conclusion that is dropped on us like a bomb.The makers do a superlative job piecing together vintage footage of the campaign itself and from scenes around the country. I felt like I had gotten into a time machine to the madness that was the late 60s/early 70s. The documentary is so much more than just an exploration of Thompson's campaign, it covers the zeitgeist of the day, from Vietnam to The Weathermen, the true focus of the whole thing is what it means to fight 'The Man'.I was previously familiar with Thompson's run for sheriff, but the details, actual footage and interviews make it so real and palpable.Hunter and his crew of 'freaks' shake the establishment to its core by participating in the very same system that is holding them down. Rife with moments of glory and heartbreak, this doc is a ride through the mangled corruption and greed that is American politics.Even if you have never heard the name Hunter Thompson, it is imperative that you watch this documentary in an election year that may prove to be the most important in modern history.We need Freak Power more now than ever.",True
6,10,Absolutely Incredible,Parvana5,n/a,15/08/2025,"This doc was extremely well made and a great insight into the life of Hunter Thompson at a time when he was a serious journalist taking action. As we are facing one of the most important political times in recent history, Hunter's message is more important than ever. The issues Hunter was fighting for in 1970 are scarily similar to now and there is so much we can learn from watching Freak Power. As the saying goes...""History repeats itself"" but maybe this time we can be inspired by Hunter to help make the changes needed.",False
7,10,A Call to Action,bcurtinp,n/a,15/08/2025,"A great documentary about Hunter S. Thompson's 1970 campaign to become Sheriff of Pitkin County. The issues that the country faced during the Nixon era are eerily similar to today's contentious partisan environment. I thoroughly enjoyed watching these larger national themes get seamlessly woven into Hunter's local campaign. I highly recommend this documentary, as the directors do a great job showing that local elections are just as important as national elections and that collectively getting out to vote really does matter.",False
8,10,👍👍👍,nesmith-30559,n/a,15/08/2025,Great documentary!!!!! Grabbed my attention throughout the whole doc which is very rare for me. The footage they had of hunter played a huge part of relaying the overall message of the documentary.,False
9,10,Don't miss out Hunter fans or those interested in grass roots politics,storm-nick,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is prime Hunter S. Thompson - a man on a mission to protect his home and willing to take on the establishment to do it. The message and brilliance of this film is its staying power - the issues of police reform, environmentalism, land use, and drug laws are just as relevant now as they were then. I hope everyone takes the time to watch the film and PAY ATTENTION at the local level.",False
10,10,Thompson's defining moment.,travola-35109,n/a,15/08/2025,"Most people would say his defining moment was the publication of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but they would be wrong. That may be his biggest moment in his literary career because it was a skyrocket for him as far as fame (which ironically ruined his career) but for his personal life it was when he ran for Sheriff of Pitkin County. Before he created and became gonzo Hunter tried his hand at starting a rebellion in the small town of Aspen. He made strong points against land developers and outlandish drug laws. His foresight on the devastation of major companies coming into small town America and ravaging communities, small businesses, and nature's ecosystems was incredible and is still massively relevant today.He did it with his own style and grit as only Hunter S. Thompson could do because there can never be another like him. All imitation of the man is embarrassing and inaccurate. People who aren't fans or informed about him think he was just a guy on drugs playing a character when that was just him. They focus on his outlandish behavior without listening to the knowledge he was bestowing on his readers and listeners. He was extremely intelligent and cared deeply about what was once The American Dream. If you were really paying attention he was teaching while also entertaining you.Thompson cared greatly for this community and changing it for the better and fighting against the continued pillaging by corporations, government, and ignorance. This was the happiest time of his life and he truly felt like a leader. People were listening and he was changing minds. He also was doing something that should be highly commended in America and that getting new voters registered and making people understand the importance of voting. He was trying to make a real difference.This documentary covers this time in his life and the history in Aspen that he was attempting to make. This was Hunter S. Thompson being Hunter S. Thompson and not playing a character or embracing the outlandish in his Gonzo style of journalism which was revolutionary at the time. If you are a fan you will love this and it will help you brush up on the man's life and work. If you aren't very familiar with the man this is a great documentary to become acquainted with the man and hopefully get into his works and legend. In my opinion he's one of the most important writers of the last 100 years. He created a new style and it was so intertwined with who he was as a person that it's impossible to replicate accurately without completely ripping him off. Please watch this if you enjoy his work or if you don't know it and you are simply into small town politics or just raising a little bit of hell for the sake of change.",False
11,10,A Great Doc about a Great Man!,vegasalec,n/a,15/08/2025,"An excellent documentary that examines one of the most interesting periods in the incredible life of Hunter S. Thompson. Full of original footage that gives great look into this fascinating story. Timely and timeless, I highly recommend this film for fans and first timers alike. HST was one of a kind though we could certainly use more like him.",False
12,10,HST was the man we all needed and didn't know it,acdp-70321,n/a,15/08/2025,"Freak Power just shows how much HST loved his home. He wanted to protect the beauty of aspen and would go to any lengths to do so. He took on the government and stood for his own beliefs and values. Many of today's people see HST as some old drug addict, but this film will show you how much he cared for his town.",False

16,10,A stunning documentary on a brilliant individual,dptsxbps,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was brought to this film not entirely sure what to expect, it far surpassed my expectations for it and provided a great insight into the life and times of one of my literary heroes. I would thoroughly recommend this film to any enthusiasts of HST but also more broadly for those wanting to learn more about the life and times of one of America's most influential literary figures.",False
17,10,Freak Power is the power we need in America today!,justinadammarshall,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an incredible document of the power of one freak to change his town, if every town had one freak that would do this the country would be a million times better for it. As for the film, the trove of footage gathered by the filmmakers of this beautiful campaign is impressive, I was expecting more interviews and less original footage but I was happily wrong! The footage of the debates were especially cool to me. If you are a fan of HST than you will love this pic.",False

23,10,Freak Power Doc Freakin' Good,garylynch-34293,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary provided one of t first honest accounts of Hunter S Thompson the seeker of justice. Too often HST is reduced to a hedonistic figure of excess, which ignores some of the most important aspects of his career. Hell's Angels, Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail and The Battle of Aspen, all are deserving of attention, appreciation and reflection. In this documentary finally this is explored. My only gripe is that there hasn't been a sequel made to outline his time with the Hell's Angels, get it done!",False
24,10,"Freak Power wasn't a freak incident, but as relevant as ever",pwknox-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I credit HST for first interesting me in politics when I was in college (along with political journalism) because he made it personable and accessible through his honest and emotional writing.Years later we're missing The Good Doctor more than ever, yet his political activism remains relevant and inspiring today more than ever.Therefore we must heed his warning shot from 1970 captured in this brilliant documentary. With footage I've never seen anywhere else before (a serious compliment from a serious fan), Freak Power makes HST's campaign resonate.A big thank you to the filmmakers for keeping the Gonzo spirit alive and educating the world as history repeats itself, again and again. Hopefully we learn this time.",False
25,10,Hunter at his most lethal,masterkifi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb shows us a different side of Hunter that some viewers may not be aware of if they came from the Terry Gilliam film ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (which is also a fantastic film in its own right). Instead, the documentary focuses on Hunter during his run for Sheriff of Aspen in 1970, and by god does it deliver. This film lets the audience know just how relevant Hunter's run for sheriff has become for today's society. Today, two sides of the political spectrum are at war: the radical right and the radical left. They fight with each other with no end in sight. Hunter instead runs on the ""Freak Ticket"", not declaring allegiance to any party. He also speaks against the police abusing their power, and instead offers a chance for the police to coexist with the people. After watching Freak Power: The Ballot or the Bomb, I fully believe that the power of Freak must speak to the world once more.",False

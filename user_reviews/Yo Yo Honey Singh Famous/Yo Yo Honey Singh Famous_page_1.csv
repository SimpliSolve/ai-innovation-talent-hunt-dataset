1,7,Decent watch to see different shades of Honey but it doesn't really reveal or shock with revelations,wonderwellwisher,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix, in general, is known for producing both quality documentaries and some unimpressive ones. This time, they present the story of a once-upon-a-time youth icon of India: Yo Yo Honey Singh.This documentary delves into his downfall, the events surrounding it, his controversies, and how he managed both his success and failures. We get a relatively raw portrayal of Honey Singh, showing a more vulnerable side of the star.Whether you like him or not, he undeniably remains a phenomenon who pioneered the rap culture in India. As mentioned in the documentary, his songs were, and still are, played in pubs, rickshaws, and parties. While his lyrics and songs continue to be questionable, he justifies them as catering to public demand-a point that's hard to disagree with. After all, what sells is what's produced, a basic demand-supply chain at work.However, the documentary fails to shed light on some key aspects. The reason behind his hiatus is vaguely addressed, and his controversy with his wife is downplayed for privacy reasons. Moreover, no industry insiders are named-those who may have supported or hindered his career-making the series feel rather superficial.It's understandable that nobody wants to tarnish their image, but if a documentary doesn't reveal the unknown, what's the point of it?Overall, this was a decent watch, offering a glimpse into the various shades of Honey Singh's personality. With its short runtime, it's worth a try, but don't expect anything groundbreaking. The essential masala is missing, which could also be attributed to the makers.#PranuReviews #YoYoHoneySinghFamous #YoYoHoneySinghFamousReview.",False
2,6,Good documentary!,rabbi-75135,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yo Yo Honey Singh : (Famous) 2024 is good documentary based on most famous and my favorite Indian musician Yo Yo Honey Singh! I was really waiting so much for this documentary. But, i think there was still so many things left to describe which is not covered in the documentary!

Honey Singh has always been a trailblazer, and my admiration for him started with his incredible music production. Over time, I've come to appreciate his unmatched talent in so many other aspects. He is truly the GOAT! Watching his journey on screen, I couldn't hold back my tears, especially seeing him in such vulnerable moments.To those who hate on him or mock his relentless efforts to make a comeback: shame on you! It takes extraordinary courage and strength to rise again after a low phase, and Honey Singh has done it with grace and determination.His fanbase is unmatched-it's the biggest and the most loyal of all. Through his highs and lows, we've stood by him, and he's never let us down. Despite his fame and success, he remains so humble and down-to-earth, which only adds to why we love him even more.This documentary is not just a story about music; it's about resilience, hard work, and the power of never giving up.

5,10,Honest Review,jaykartherealartist,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally, I had the chance to watch the much-talked-about documentary on my OG Ustaad Ji, @yoyohoneysingh. To be completely honest, it was one of the most emotional and inspirational experiences I've had in a long time. Whether you're a fan of Honey Singh or not, whether you follow music closely or not, this documentary is an absolute must-watch.The story beautifully unfolds the life of someone who not only defined an era in Indian music but also faced the harshest battles, both externally and internally. It's a story of resilience, determination, and rising from the ashes like a phoenix. As someone who has followed his journey, this documentary felt deeply personal. There were moments when I couldn't hold back my tears, and I'm sure anyone watching it would feel the same, regardless of their connection to him or his music.The documentary takes you behind the scenes of the glitz and glamour that most people associate with Honey Singh. It reveals the man behind the superstar - his struggles, vulnerabilities, and unwavering willpower. From his meteoric rise in the Indian music industry to his sudden disappearance and the rumors that followed, the film sheds light on every aspect of his life.It was heartbreaking to see the extent of his battle with mental health issues. He openly talks about his struggle with bipolar disorder, the paranoia, hallucinations, and the toll it took on him. The way he described those dark days was gut-wrenching yet inspiring because it shows how far he has come since then. This is not just the story of an artist making a comeback; it's the story of a man reclaiming his life.One of the most emotional moments in the documentary was when his family and friends shared their perspectives on what he went through. Their unwavering support and belief in him during his lowest moments were deeply touching. His sister's account of how the family dealt with his mental health crisis added a new dimension to the narrative. It's a reminder that behind every success story, there is a support system that often goes unrecognized.The documentary also touches upon the challenges he faced in his personal life, including his relationship with his ex-wife. It paints a vivid picture of how fame and personal turmoil can collide, leading to intense struggles that most people don't see. It's raw, honest, and incredibly real, which makes it all the more impactful.What stood out to me was his unshakable determination to make a comeback. The journey from his darkest days to finding his way back into the industry is nothing short of inspiring. Honey Singh's story is a testament to the power of resilience and self-belief. He didn't just make a comeback as an artist; he emerged as a stronger, wiser individual who is unafraid to embrace his vulnerabilities.For me, the documentary wasn't just about music or stardom; it was about life. It's about facing your fears, battling your demons, and rising above the odds. It's a reminder that no matter how far you fall, you can always get back up if you have the will to fight.Watching this documentary has given me a newfound respect for Honey Singh, not just as an artist but as a human being. It's rare to see someone open up so vulnerably about their struggles, and it's even rarer to see them rise above it with such grace.In the end, I walked away from the documentary feeling inspired, emotional, and deeply moved. If you haven't watched it yet, I urge you to do so. Whether you're a fan or not, this is a story that everyone needs to see. It's a tale of strength, hope, and redemption that will leave a lasting impression on you.To my OG Ustaad Ji, @yoyohoneysingh, thank you for sharing your story with us. It's a reminder that heroes aren't just the ones who win; they're the ones who refuse to give up. You've inspired millions, including me, with your journey, and for that, I'll always be grateful.",False
6,2,PR- ocumentary by Honey Singh Studio,Cinephilecurse,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo being a fan of honey Singh I was very excited to be watch it however, my excitement was shattered by seeing the worst of editing and story telling. There are so many problems with this documentary.It should have told the trajectory of Honey Singh song the story behind every hit and what actually happened to him they have taken bits of information which I already knew. I couldn't take anything new from this, if you have seen even one podcast of honey Singh then you would find this too boring, they kept emphasis on Designer song which was to come in 2022 and how honey is excited about his come back, you are releasing this documentary in 2024 and keeping emphasis on designer song which was released in 2022 which no one us ever heard of.To me it should have ended with Millionaire song and there are too many plot holes, they don't tell the complete story behind the controversies, mostly it feels like Honey paid them to get his documentary out. I couldn't take anything from this one no hit of nostalgia too.Honestly the Lalantop interview with Honey Singh was more interesting.Will give it a Pass !",True
7,10,Yo Yo Honey Singh: Famous - A Must-Watch Story of the No. 1 Rapper's Rise and Comeback,kumar_yogesh,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Yo Yo Honey Singh: Famous"" is a must-watch for music lovers and fans of India's No. 1 rapper and singer. This documentary takes us through his incredible rise to fame, capturing his influence on the music scene and the pressures that came with being at the top. It also delves into the reasons behind his sudden disappearance, offering a raw and honest look at the personal struggles he faced.The documentary showcases his inspiring comeback, revealing both the highs and lows of being a celebrity.

8,5,"Disappointing ""PR-ocumentary"" of a career that deserved a deeper exploration",spjek,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yo Yo Honey Singh: Famous doesnt feel like a documentary about Yo Yo Honey Singh but a documentary made by Honey Singh and for Honey Singh. The doc superficially scratches the surface of the Phenomenon of Yo Yo or his downfall and takes every chance to focus on his mental health issues and comeback which makes this clearly a PR effort to hopefully get his career back to previous height. Yo Yo seems sincere and honest when he talks about his mental health issues but the documentary barely spends time on anything to make a real impact.The documentary should have spent more time on how he became Yo Yo, shown more of his songs, interviewed more people from Bollywood who worked with him or even his fans talk more about him or let Badshah and co talk a bit more about the controversial part of his career and really explore Yo Yo Honey Singh's career. A 30 mins interview with Yo Yo talking about his mental challenges and desire to make a comeback would have probably been more insightful than this documentary. Highly disappointing. 5/10.",False

10,1,Very bad,appleavisha,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHoney Singh, the controversial and often polarizing figure in the world of Indian music, has had a meteoric rise to fame. With his unique fusion of Punjabi, hip-hop, and Bollywood beats, Singh, also known as Yo Yo Honey Singh, has garnered a massive fan base. However, the documentary about his life and career, while attempting to capture the essence of this popular yet divisive artist, falls short in almost every regard. What could have been an insightful and engaging exploration into the man behind the music ends up being a superficial, self-congratulatory, and ultimately unsatisfying portrayal.First and foremost, the documentary fails to offer any real depth into Honey Singh's personal life or his musical evolution. At the outset, we are promised an intimate glimpse into his journey, from his humble beginnings to his rise as the ""king of Bollywood music."" But what we get instead is a glossy, surface-level look that glosses over many crucial aspects of his career. The documentary feels like a well-produced PR stunt rather than a sincere exploration of his life and work.One of the most glaring issues with the film is its lack of critical perspective. Singh, throughout his career, has been accused of misogyny, promoting harmful stereotypes, and creating music that is often deemed offensive. The documentary barely touches upon these controversies, and when it does, it does so in a defensive manner. Instead of addressing the criticism head-on or providing any introspection into the impact of his music, the film opts to simply paint him as a misunderstood genius. It feels more like an attempt to whitewash Singh's image rather than present an honest, balanced portrayal.Moreover, the film does little to explain how Singh's music fits into the broader cultural context of India and the world. While his beats and catchy hooks have earned him an enormous following, there's little discussion of his influence on the Indian music industry or his role in shaping the popular music landscape. We get no deeper understanding of how his work speaks to the youth or the social issues it touches upon, if at all. The documentary only scratches the surface, leaving viewers wondering what made his music resonate with millions, beyond the obvious commercial appeal.The lack of real storytelling also harms the documentary's pacing. Rather than constructing a compelling narrative, it feels more like a series of disconnected talking heads, random interviews with fans, and hastily stitched-together moments from Singh's career. The film is disjointed and often repetitive, recycling the same themes over and over without offering any fresh insights or engaging visuals. There is a heavy reliance on media clips and social media moments, which, while giving a sense of his popularity, do little to flesh out his character or music.Another significant flaw is the missed opportunity to delve into Singh's creative process. For someone who has been so influential in shaping the sound of Bollywood music over the past decade, one would expect a deeper exploration of how he crafts his songs, his collaboration with other artists, or the challenges he faces as a performer. Instead, we are left with a vague notion of him being an 'artist' without any substantial exploration into what makes his work stand out, aside from its commercial success. This oversight makes the documentary feel more like a promotional tool than an exploration of artistic integrity.The cinematography and direction also leave much to be desired. While the documentary boasts a slick production value, it's more style than substance. The visuals feel empty and uninspired, with little effort to make the viewer emotionally connect to Singh's journey. There's an overreliance on flashy montages and dramatic slow-motion sequences, which only serve to distract from the lack of meaningful content.In conclusion, Honey Singh's documentary is an underwhelming and disappointing experience. It fails to provide any significant insights into the artist's life, musical journey, or impact on the industry. Instead of a nuanced and reflective piece, we are presented with a sanitized version of his story that leaves too many questions unanswered. Fans of Singh might enjoy the occasional behind-the-scenes footage, but for those looking for a deeper understanding of the man behind the music, this documentary ultimately disappoints.",True
11,10,"Rise, Fall and Redemption",dekajyotimoyee,n/a,16/08/2025,"''Yo Yo Honey Singh : Famous ""is a must-watch for music lovers and fans of the artist. The raw and unfiltered approach taken in the documentary makes it incredibly impactful, giving viewers an authentic glimpse into the highs and lows of Honey Singh's life.It's more than just a story about a musician; it's an emotional journey that highlights the struggles, resilience, and eventual comeback of a man who shaped India's music scene. Even those who doubted his talent or dismissed his contributions will find this documentary compelling.The deeply emotional narrative had me in tears, as it shed light on the tough times Honey Singh faced. Despite his challenges, his determination to rise again is truly inspiring. It's heartening to see the ""Yo Yo"" we know and love back in action, stronger than ever.

12,1,Better to listen his old song than to watch this documentary,mayanktiwari-62155,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the full documentary honey singh has only done one thing and that is to praise himself. This is made just to clean his image and his family image. Throughout the documentary he is only boasting about his comeback. But there was none to watch. Dont know why they were in rush to release this. He could have waited for one genuine comeback so that a closer can be written of. May be wait till the millionaire song ( which is still better than all of his songs since his comeback).And again in the documentary he is putting it on people that we want to hear only those songs, which include girls and booze. But no that is not correct there are many such song which do not have this kind of content but still it went hit.And also they did talk about divorce but again he said in such a way that it looks like he is right and other part is wrong. Hs is saying that now I will tell part which no one knows. But then boss you are telling the part which means you will say it favourable to you. This is the poorest attempt from Netflix to make a documentary. Docs contains raw footage not something which hs is saying himself.",False
13,10,REAL INSPIRATION!,yoyojabrafan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched the Yo Yo Honey Singh documentary on Netflix & it made me laugh and cry at the same time. He saw the peak that no indian artist has ever seen in their career but then bipolar disorder came into the picture. He used to think that he is going to d!e, he even wished for his de@th. But The way he came back seeing HELL feels like paaji ne dobara janm liya hai aur dobara se wo duniya paagal kar hi denge. Worst part started from CHICAGO live show - I saw him crying & it was really heartbreaking - You can't even imagine how this guy was feeling that time!!! His brain was out of his control. Everything/everyone used to scare him. Media was also one of the reasons why he had to suffer from all this - they portrayed him in a very wrong way.But he is really a FIGHTER, he is getting better day by day. Many people are still poking him/trying to finish him but he is not stopping. Whatever he is doing, everything is for the fans. Bande ka 5-6 saal pehle ka look ek baar 2024 se compare karo, hats off to his transformation despite the fact that his medication is high on sodium & lithium (causes weight gain). Well PART 2 has been started & I'm 200% sure that he will blow the world again just like before! Sherawali Maa ka mujhpe seedha ashirwaad hai.

Feel like watching 20 years in 1 frame documentry.,msniharika,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a loyal fan who has followed Yo Yo Honey Singh's journey for over a decade, watching this documentary was an emotional rollercoaster. It perfectly captures the essence of a man who revolutionized the Indian music industry, faced his demons, and still came out stronger.That beat ...ting, tig ting...gallasyHoney Singh goggles isn't just an artist; he's a movement, a phenomenon that inspired millions of us. From his early days dropping beats no one had heard before, to becoming the face of Indian pop-rap music, his rise was meteoric. But this documentary dives into more than just his success - it peels back the layers to show us the human behind the star.Watching his struggle with mental health, the pressures of fame, and his hiatus from music was heartbreaking, but it also gave me even more respect for him. Singh's ability to come back, embrace his imperfections, and still create hits that dominate the charts proves why he's irreplaceable. His music has been an anthem to countless fans like me - it's not just about catchy beats, but also his raw honesty and fearless expression.This documentary reignites the pride of being a Yo Yo Honey Singh fan. His journey is an inspiration: a testament that no matter how hard life hits, real talent and passion can never be forgotten. He remains the king of Indian music in my eyes, and this story shows exactly why. Yo Yo forever!",False
16,5,Honey Singh's Honesty Through Success and Struggle,SAMTHEBESTEST,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yo Yo Honey Singh Famous (2024) :
Movie Review -As a media person, I have learned a lot about Honey Singh and even attended some of his song events here in Mumbai. I have also had a couple of brief meetings with him and thought that we understood this guy; we knew him. Well, I was wrong. There is much more to Honey Singh's life that we don't know, including when he was not Honey Singh and how he transformed into Yo Yo Honey Singh from just Honey Singh. There is also a deeper insight into the tough days of his life, alongside his successful phase.Yo Yo Honey Singh Famous sees Honey Singh opening up about one of the most secretive aspects of his life, which is Bipolar Disorder. As he says, ""You can be cured after having your kidney damaged because there is someone to give you a kidney. But how will you cure the brain? Who is there to give you a brain?"" Logically, that's very apt. However, this docudrama is not well shot. Something feels off while summarizing the life of H. Singh-something is definitely lacking.It starts with his early days when he had to fight his father to make a career in the music world. His first performance, his first award, and then how he gained support from his father to enter this crazy world of music. Though he grew up listening to legendary singers like Mohammed Rafi, he never created music like that. His focus was on youth, contemporary music, and a fusion of Indian rap with hip-hop and international genres. It's a fact, and widely accepted, that his early songs were exceptional-perhaps his best work until he made Blue Eyes and Lungi Dance. The game changed from CDs to YouTube, and somewhere along the way, he was struck by mental health issues and exhausting schedules that put a pause on his career and ultimately hindered his success.Honey Singh makes a heartfelt confession about bipolar disorder and how his brain wasn't functioning at that time. He also does not shy away from discussing his looks, weight, and flop songs. However, the cinematic feel is lacking. The use of camera work, footage, sound, and background score does not provide a quality experience. Those nostalgic moments from his career (in songs and concerts) are not utilized well. Many clips do not even have HD quality to enhance your viewing experience. It feels so staged. Nevertheless, the narrative does not bore you, and it is not long either. It's about 80 minutes or so, and you can't take your attention off the screen, even if it's a small-screen experience.Mozez Singh's vision presents the story from an honest perspective as he does not want to hide anything-be it the controversy surrounding ""Nirbhaya,"" his vulgar songs like ""Chooot,"" or words like F, MF, BC-none of which are bleeped out. So, it's a wholesome experience in that sense, and an emotional one too for his fans, but the question is, are others interested? Thankfully, this hardly takes half the time you need to watch a movie, so you can give it a try. But don't expect much. Though it starts off brilliantly, I still think it drags somewhere in the last quarter, and the climax doesn't really offer anything to look forward to.RATING - 5/10*",False

It's not just a documentary - it's a journey through the life of a musical legend who has shaped the industry like no other. As a die-hard fan, I've always admired his raw talent, but this documentary gave me a whole new perspective on the man behind the music.From the very start, ""Famous"" takes you through the highs and lows of Honey Singh's career. The documentary doesn't just focus on his rise to fame, but it dives deep into his personal struggles, the battles he's faced, and the immense pressure that comes with being in the limelight. As a fan, it was eye-opening to see the dedication and sacrifices he's made to get to where he is today.One of the most powerful parts of the documentary was the insight into Honey Singh's creative process. Seeing him in the studio, working tirelessly, and pushing boundaries with his music was truly inspiring. It reminded me of why I fell in love with his music in the first place - he's not just a performer, but an artist who puts his soul into every beat, every lyric, every melody.The personal moments shown in the documentary are equally moving.

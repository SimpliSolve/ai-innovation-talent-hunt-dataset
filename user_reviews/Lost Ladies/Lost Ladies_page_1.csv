1,9,A Small Movie with a Big Heart,spjek,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow. What a rewarding experience. Laapataa Ladies is an amazing nostalgic trip to the days of Basu Chatterjee and Hrishikesh Mukherjee's cinema of simplicity, morals, values and the common man. This is the kind of movie that makes its audience care for and invest in its characters. This is the kind of movie that makes its audience believe that there is goodness in the world. This is the kind of movie that makes its audience want to watch movies for its relevant and real content, its natural and realistic performances, its gentle lessons on morality and humanity with a drizzle of subtle humor. Unfortunately this is also the kind of movie most audiences wont watch in theater because they consider it OTT material. But this is the kind of movie that will make its audience come out of the theater with a smile on their face, a contented heart and a serene soul. This is what ""a small movie with a big heart"" really means.Every aspect of the movie is stellar. The story is simple yet complex as it very delicately manages to comment upon multiple social issues without preaching about them. The humor is satirical but not sarcastic. The story is fresh and gives enough room for all its characters to breathe, take appropriate shape and find their respective arcs. Each character has been written with care and given the required attention. The two titular Laapataa Ladies, the devastated husband in the village searching for his wife, his mother who has even forgotten what she really likes, his shy sister in law with a hidden talent that even she isnt aware of, the sour grandmother who also seeks a friend to talk to, the disillusioned but helpful Manju Mai at the station, the lovable chai serving kid Chottu, the somewhat corrupt police officer with his simple minded but good hearted constable and the female constable who came through sports quota etc etc. All characters in the movie have been created with a lot of love and honesty and they have also been played brilliantly with an equal dose of love and honesty.Ravi Kishan as the police inspector is the only really well known name in the cast and he delivers a mighty and nuanced performance. Nitanshi Goel and Pratibha Ranta as the Laapataa ladies showcase what natural and realistic acting should actually look and feel like. Satendra Soni is a somewhat familiar face but now he deserves his name to be remembered also. Geeta Agrawal Sharma has rightfully become the Go-To actress for the ""good mother of a struggling, poor household"" role after great performances in 12th Fail, OMG2 and a small but nice appearance in Fighter. Sparsh Shrivastava, Chhaya Kadam, Rachana Gupta, Durgesh Kumar and many others have given heartfelt performances that deserve attention and applause.It may seem like the world is overflowing with negative vibes, bad people, unfortunate situations but just like a lotus grows in muddy, murky waters, the inherent goodness and kindness that exists in people sparkles in Laapataa Ladies. This is something that cant be captured on camera with big budgets, bigger stars, flashy costumes, state of the art VFX etc. It requires heart and that is what Laapataa Ladies has in abundance. Kudos to Kiran Rao for capturing the best and worst of human nature with such a delicate and warm touch. This is a movie that deserves to be experienced in its natural environment, a movie theater. It will not give you the adrenaline highs of a big budget blockbuster but that lovely smile on your face, that feeling of content and happiness that this movie gifts you will last much longer than you could ever expect. Must Watch Cinema.",False
2,9,Treat Yourself with This Low Budget Masterpiece if You are True Cinema Lover,missingabhiashu,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before making the movie the makers have done a very well research of rural India. The details shown in the movie about the villages of North India carries the entire movie on its shoulder. Its a social commentary on many superstitious belief which is still being followed very strongly in rural India. The makers have also proven that for showing women empowerment, neither they have to undress girls nor have to give wine glass in their hand. The movie is salad of Light comedy, social drama, social messaging, a hit on negative side of patriarchy and women empowerment. The best part of the movie was it gave many wonderful messages by keeping entire plot of the movie quite light and Comic. Apart from all this makers have also proven the point that we don't need high quality VFX, mega stars and big budget to make a masterpiece as the budget of this movie is only 5 crore as per my knowledge.Talking about the performances according to me, Sparsh Shrivastava has totally nailed it. Whatever scenes he has got, he performed it with 100% perfection. He along with Nitanshi Goel were having that innocence shown beautifully on big screen. Both were having limited screen timing together but they had wonderful chemistry. Pratibha Ranta was most impactful in the entire move and movie makers tried to give most of the social messages in the movie through her. Through her strong screen presence, she added more value to the messaging part of the movie. Ravi Kishan was most popular face of the movie but makers have utilized him only as supporting cast but he has done wonderful job in that. Each scene of the movie has been directed with heart. Comedy, Emotions, Social Commentary, chemistry between lead casts everything looks very well directed. This kind of direction will tempt me to watch more work of Kiran Rao.This movie is roof why Aamir Khan is asset of Indian Cinema. Even without his screen presence, he has ability to give this kind of masterpiece. I always believed that movie maker Aamir is better than actor Aamir.",False
3,8,Kiran Rao and her team just nailed it.,sunilprasad-02312,n/a,15/08/2025,"Today, I went to the theatre to experience Kiran Rao's new movie, ""Laapataa Ladies."" I was stunned when I watched the movie. The performances, storytelling, humor, and social messages were outstanding. Initially, I wasn't very interested in seeing her new movie, considering Kiran Rao had directed only one movie in her career, ""Dhobi Ghat."" However, knowing that she is Aamir Khan's ex-wife and has been a co-director, writer, and producer of many good films, I decided to give it a try.Let's talk about the movie. The cast is entirely new; actors and actresses are all new faces to me. But they gave their best in the movie, especially Pratibha Ranta and Ravi Kishan. The social message part of the movie was really good, highlighting how women were treated like servants or slaves. They showed various issues, including agricultural problems, that exist in India.The movie is set in the 20s era when mobile phones were just introduced in India, and the only game was the snake game on Nokia mobiles, so there was no internet, no Gen Z, and no adult scenes. It was a purely cinematic experience. The girl who stole my heart is Nitanshi Goel. She is so cute, man. I loved her. She is now added to my crush list.Anyway, you should watch this movie if you want to see some good wholesome social drama. This movie will absolutely win your heart. I give this movie 4.5/5. Lastly, I want to share something that happened in the theatre. A guy who was working at INOX, where I watched the movie, asked me, ""Sir, boi ta kemon laaglo ar etake apni koto star deben out of 5."" I told him the same rating that I gave in this review.",False
4,10,Must Watch Film!!,Sudeepamittal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow! This is one of the rare movies that actually made me cry. Tears were rolling down my cheek by the end of the movie. The three leading actors did phenomenal work but my favourite was Nitanshi Goel as Phool. Her innocence was enough to make me fall in love with her and root for her throughout the film.The scene where Phool gets her first salary is just so heartwarming! From being this naive young girl in a completely unfamiliar place to finding her strength and becoming financially independent, her journey was beautiful. The film is wonderfully developed, and it works as a true dramedy, a positive one at that, where we are shown there is something good out of everything. You feel for the characters since the beginning and celebrate their success. Sparsh Srivastava as Deepak is so lovable and Pratibha as Jaya is witty. The bonding all the characters manage to develop is lovely. The way Phool calls out to Deepak and they both hug each other while crying, it's best scene in the whole film ! The scene where Deepak secretly holds Phool's hand and she looks at him and then after a point, lets go off her ghunghat while they keep holding hands had me with butterflies in my stomach !!! Lovely film !!",False
5,10,This is called REAL CINEMA,rishavgarg-67147,n/a,15/08/2025,"Laapataa Ladies - THE BEST MOVIE OF 2024,period!This is a perfect example of how to take a movie with a strong and inspiring storyline.Kiran Rao is a commendable story teller, and she surely knows to have the right blend of dialogue delivery with sensibility and delicacy.Nitanshi Goel's acting is a benchmark and she embodies it with full of life. Her emotions, innocence, vulnerability and happiness can be truly felt as she takes us through her tough journey in a completely unknown world.Phool and Deepak's purest love, chemistry and just being there for one another when it's really needed is worth to withhold in your memory for a long time.This movie is a big inspiration for women and future generation.",False
6,10,Excellent story and Amazing Performances!,gncvvmym,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amazing movie... loved the storyline & characters
Special mention for Nitanshi Goel ,an actress that I was not familiar with but put in a powerful showing of her emotions as Phool, the way I felt pity for her and wanted to protect her the entire time and then felt proud of her in the last scene .. impressive! So I am sure we will see her in more mainstream movies in the future.Ravi Kishan puts in a very strong performance as Manohar and really makes the audience stunned with the plight of his character and the unfair rigged system that he gets up against in the end.Every character was amazing. Definitely worth a watch for the whole family.",False
7,10,CINEMA AT ITS PEAK,khanrizwan-33472,n/a,15/08/2025,"Such a beautiful way of story telling. Humour with a message hidden in it. Amir Khan productions should be a school for aspiring film makers. The way the characters are portrayed strike a chord with the societal norms. Ravi Kishan who is playing the cop is the soul of the film. Other actors too have played their part very well. The set up in the 90s is wonderfully displayed on the screen. Characters listening radios, cyber cafe etc etc. The movie sends a strong message for woman empowerment and the upliftment of women in the society. The women still being considered as some sort of slave in the society when artificial Intelligence is surpassing human intelligence.",False
8,10,A must watch amazing movie,muhammadakram-10129,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an amazing movie👍I haven't been bored even for a second. A movie on a sad reality of our society, that how this society treats women but tells it in a comic way. The comedy was too good. Movies tells how to truly empower women and not any toxic pseudo feminist agenda movie. A must watch solid 10/10.We feel what the characters feel, their laugh make us happy and their sufferings make us cry.And a bonus on everything the Ravi Kishan's character. Oh my god, can't explain in words. He done the comedy so well, as if it comes naturally to him. He was ""movie ki jaan"".Apart for that others character were also really good and actors performed so well and naturally.",False
9,8,Kiran Rao delivers a gem of a film!!!,shashank_1501,n/a,15/08/2025,"Laapata Ladies is a sort of film that is very rare these days. A satire that is an eye-opener for the audience and needs everyone's attention. With unknown cast, limited budget and great script, it's a movie for all age-groups, every gender and is bound to go a long way.This Kiran Rao's tragicomedy of two brides in rural India who accidentally get swapped during a train journey while returning from their wedding. Their misadventures after this strange event will make you laugh and the same time think about the social taboos a women has to go through in our society.Ravi Kishan playing the cop investigating this case is a delight to watch. Very subtly and hilariously he gives movie the much needed comic side that perfectly balances the emotional cause for which the movie was made. Probably one of his best performance till date.Newcomers Sparsh Shrivastava (Deepak), Nitanshi Goel (Phool) & Pratibha Ranta (Jaya), they all justified their casting by giving some of the memorable performances. Hats off to all of them.",False
10,n/a,DONT JUDGE THE MOVIE FROM ITS TRAILER!!!! MASTERPIECE,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"IT WAS A WOW MOVIE!!! Through this movie you take a trip to the rural india, I judged the movie from its trailer and starting intro of the movie and later changed my mind and dared to watch it, this is a true masterpiece didnt noticed when i got indulged into watching it and how early the movie ended!! Movie is based on REALLY DIFFERENT CONCEPT AND INNOCENCE that still EXISTS IN RURAL PEOPLE IN INDIA!!!I ENJOYED WATCHING A MOVIE AFTER REALLY LONG TIME!!!Most movies are based on similar plot but this one is different.The movie is filled with comedy, love and social messaging.THIS MOVIE IS FOR REAL A TRUE INDIAN MASTERPIECE THIS MOVIE DESERVES MORE VIEWS AND WIDER AUDIENCE !!!!!!!",False
11,7,Jagtey Raho!,chand-suhas,n/a,15/08/2025,"Deepak marries Phool Kumari and Jaya is married to Pradeep. Both the couples take the same crowded train to their respective villages. Deepak accidentally alights the train with Jaya, leaving Phool Kumar stranded at the train station. Deepak is in love with Phool whereas Pradeep is in love with the dowry Jaya's family gave him. Set in 2001, how does Deepak re-unite with Phool while Jaya dreams for her freedom, forms rest of the story.First things first, Laapataa Ladies is a must watch film. The narrative keeps everything simple and it remains heartwarming throughout. No unnecessary increase in the melodrama as Kiran Rao efficiently establishes the story through her strong characters. The writing and execution simply stands out, connecting with the characters instantly. Special mention to Ravi Kishan's character which in a filmy way owns the climax scene.The film had several standout scenes and Deepak - Phool yearning for each other while Phool learns a bit to survive in the real world. Then there is Jaya who dreams to study organic farming and live the life she wants, without being forced into a life she loathes. As Deepak - Phool's story remains as innocent as possible, Jaya's story is that of hope and has more emotional depth. The actors live their characters and kudos to Kiran Rao and team for getting those performances from them.",False
12,9,A nuanced metaphoric comedy on women empowerment,vineeta-pillai,n/a,15/08/2025,"#laapataladies
#womensupportingwomen
#IWD2024
#MustWatchInterestingly, the reviews of the film by leading dailies prove the very point that the film attempts to make... about the invisibility of women, and their lack of agency .Here it is .. The TOI says it's a story of two husbands who lose their wives, Filmibeat also called it a story of two young husbands, Business Standard calls it the story of a husband who loses his wife , ABP Live comments on the laughter it evokes, The Indian Express says ""it is struggling to stay afloat"" ( so not true 😃) .Only a handful got it right ! Filmfare, The Hindu, and a few others.And this is the very premise of the film.Based on an award winning story written by Biplab Goswami, Kiran Rao returns to direction after 14 years with this delightfully thought provoking social commentary on women's empowerment . And wow, does she deliver !The story is set in a fictitious village in a state called Nirmal Pradesh, reflective of any state in the cow belt of India. It revolves around Phool, and Jaya two women who are on their way to their new marital homes, and due to identical veils, Phool's husband mistakenly brings Jaya home, instead of Phool.Phool realised late at the last stop that she has been deserted, and Jaya knowingly accompanies the wrong husband to his home. When both husbands realise that one's wife is ""wrong"" and the others wife is missing, starts the journey of finding them and returning them to their rightful homes . Phool is a shy, simple village girl, with no exposure to the world at large, and does not know either the address of her village or the address of her husband's home. .Jaya is a girl who is a brilliant student and top ranked amongst 200 students , but has been forced to marry a man who has reportedly killed off his first wife due to dowry.Both women experience freedom, a sense of agency , and in the process they find themselves . In 5 days, they undergo a life altering journey of self discovery, and confidence.The veil of the two brides is metaphoric in nature ... and the Lifting the veils of social ills like patriarchy, education, lack of power, no freedom of choice, apart from the more obvious ills of lack of education, dowry. Very very masterfully, the story starts being told through the eyes of the men ( the husbands , the policeman) and soon shifts gears towards the actual story of the women . If they had not got lost, they would probably never have found their voice, their confidence and their will. Three vital skills needed to live a life of control and happiness .A special mention needs to be made of the character Manju Maai who runs a tea stall at the station where Phool gets lost. She unexpectedly plays the reluctant catalyst in the transformation of Phool .. and their scenes and dialogues leave you hanging on your each word. Masked, layered and simple all the same time ! She aids Phool to look within and question everything, of why just being obedient and skilled at housework is not ""good upbringing"" . She is also the person who introduces Phool to the thrill of earning an income, however meagre is might have been.Women's empowerment is such a loosely used term, seldom portrayed in its real sense at the grassroots level. What does empowerment mean to a woman ? Only a woman can tell ! It's different for each woman, as it's different for Jaya and Phool. But the sisterhood between the two when they come face to face in the end makes you want to stand up and dance and weep with joy!Nitanshi Goel as Phool, Pratibha Ranta as Jaya , Sparsh Srivastava as Deepak, Chaya Kadam as Manju Maai, Ravi Kishan as the police inspector have given spectacular performances.But the real Hero is the Story itself and the nuanced and skilful direction by Kiran Rao. Take a bow !! This gem is not to be missed . Films like this come once in a blue moon . Savour every minute every dialogue . It's definitely the breakout film of this year !",False
13,7,A wholesome experience,av1rup,n/a,15/08/2025,"A sweet wholesome simple film sans the star casts, peppy songs , action sequences and (off late) political agendas but rooted in its core values and essence.It brilliantly weaves a straightforward story of self discovery and revelation with a satirical take on the social prejudices and dogmatism especially in rural India.It sometimes feel bit dragged and over stretches the comedy content and songs on some instances but not enough to become an issue.Overall a great theatre experience (sadly there were only a handful of audiences) and a ""good"" enough content from Bollywood. Hope it is able to take the 12th fail route amongst the other ""commercial"" star-casted competitors.",False
14,1,Copy of movie Burqa City,shivprasadalavekar,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLapata Ladies (2024) - A Disguised Copy or a True Original?Bollywood has long been criticized for its lack of originality, and Lapata Ladies is yet another example that raises the same concerns. While the film pretends to be a fresh, thought-provoking tale about the struggles of women in rural India, it doesn't take long for viewers to realize that it heavily borrows from other films, both in concept and execution. Yet, Bollywood shamelessly submits such films to the Oscars, acting as if they have created something groundbreaking. Let's take a deep dive into what makes Lapata Ladies a disappointing, unoriginal cinematic experience.The Story - Rehashed Yet AgainThe film revolves around the chaos that ensues when two newlywed brides, veiled as per tradition, mistakenly get swapped during a train journey. While this premise might sound engaging on the surface, it quickly starts feeling like a mix of multiple films we've seen before. It borrows thematic elements from movies like Bawarchi (where an outsider transforms lives in a household), Swades (depicting rural struggles in a glorified manner), and even Do Dooni Chaar (where mistaken identity drives the plot). The plotline is predictable, relying on exaggerated dramatic twists and comedic moments that lack genuine humor.One of the most frustrating aspects of the film is its insistence on appearing fresh when, in reality, it's a rehashed story wrapped in a new setting. It neither brings anything innovative nor does it give due credit to the sources from which it is inspired. Instead, it pretends to be an original creation, conveniently ignoring the fact that it borrows heavily from classic narratives that Bollywood itself has recycled multiple times.Performances - Carried by Overacting and StereotypesThe cast, comprising relatively lesser-known actors, does their best to inject life into the weak script.",True
15,8,Highly Recommended 👍🏼 by Hit Ya Flop - Movie World,HitYaFlop_MovieWorld,n/a,15/08/2025,"Breaking Barriers with Wit and Grit. Laapataa Ladies is a cinematic gem that shines a light on the timeless struggle against patriarchy, skillfully set against a rural backdrop. Directed with finesse and fueled by stellar performances, this film is a compelling blend of humor & sarcasm, delivering a poignant message. It's a film that entertains, educates, and inspires, leaving a lasting impact on its audience long after the credits roll.From its intriguing premise to its captivating sequence of events, the screenplay keeps audiences hooked from start to finish. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and hits all the right notes, seamlessly weaving humor into its commentary on societal norms. The direction is uncomplicated yet captivating, making the narrative easy to follow while still leaving room for thought-provoking moments.What truly elevates the film are its star performers. Sparsh Shrivastava delivers praiseworthy performances. Nitanshi Goel delivers a memorable performance. Pratibha Ranta shines as a woman determined to break free from the shackles of patriarchy. Her portrayal is confident, drawing audiences into her character's journey. Ravi Kishan and Chhaya Kadam steal the show with their standout performance.",False

25,10,Mainstream Bollywood could never do this!,snegi-62907,n/a,15/08/2025,"It feels imperative to point out in the beginning that mainstream Bollywood with big budgets and actors (who cannot really act in the first place) could never in their dreams produce a movie like this. I would recommend everyone to go with it.The essence of the movie lies in drawing out little instances from everyday life where women selflessly compromise with their own aspirations for the sake of society and patriarchal family set up. Very subtly the movie compells you to think about how gender bias against women is so deep-rooted that it seems quite normal. The social message thus conveyed is very impactful.The performances are off the charts. Each member of the cast portrayed the essence of a rural village in a very fine manner. Story is gripping and combines very well the elements of humour, drama and morality. Sparsh Srivastav has delivered a phenomenal performance, so has Nitanshi Goel. Also, Ravi Kishan's presence acts as a cherry on top.So overall, it is a brilliant and light movie which makes you think heavily.",False

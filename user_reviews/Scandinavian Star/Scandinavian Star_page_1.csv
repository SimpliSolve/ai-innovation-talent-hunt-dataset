1,10,A must watch!,hanna-410-658236,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly one of the greatest documentaries I have seen. I feel like I have been on the Scandinavian Star on the night of the fire. This series is as gut wrenching as it should be. It's heartbreaking as it is. It's one of those ""I dare you to watch without crying"".I'm happy this documentary of what happened that night is made so well because this tragedy deserved something that actually tells the story of what happened. From the families that lost their loved once, to how the fire spread and started, to the people who owned the ship and where responsible for safety. And then of course, who in the world killed all those people.The survivors telling the story are so good at sharing what happened that you would think they had done nothing else since. And that might be the case too. As a viewer you constantly feel so grateful they survived to tell what happened. The editing of switching between the personal stories and the facts of the ship and journey is done so well.To me this is a must watch watch. I believe it's important for history and also how something as absurd of a self started fire even can happen - out at sea.Thank you to the crew, survivors and the people behind this as wow. Just wow.",False

1,7,An unbelievable documentary that left some things out,gnic2000,n/a,17/08/2025,"I remember living this while it happened through Twitter. The whole story was unbelievable, every time something happened it was even more funnier than before. It took place during ~2 years, particularly during the COVID pandemic. It generated tons (and I mean: tons) of memes because how weird, unexpected and fanciful the whole story was.This documentary tells the story of Cositorto, a salesmen + preacher who created Generation Zoe, a Ponzi scheme across many countries in Latin America, and even in some countries in Europe.While all the crucial points of the story are there, I felt like there could have made a better job explaining more about the promises made to deliver money and some of the supposed business Generation Zoe was investing in. While the most important are there, others were left out.There are some witnesses telling their stories, how they got into it, how they got out (if they did), and even interviews from Cositorto itself.I had a great time, lots of memories came in, but I felt that if you didn't know anything about the story, it wouldn't be that great. I watched it with my girlfriend and I had to add some clarifications or explanations for some points of the story.",False
2,2,The documentary is poorly composed; the story is interesting,aspeierrealestate,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary is quite poor. The theme park metaphor and scenes are disruptive, boring and unrelated, they distract from the story. The documentary would be a lot better if they removed one hour of slow theme park scenes. There is a scene with a Homer Simpson voice over of a man in a mask which makes no sense whatsoever. We love watching documentaries and this one is the worst I've seen in a long time. The story is very interesting so I still watched it in full.There are good interviews to Zoe employees and to Cositorto. Also there are shots of the Zoe offices and companies that are worthwhile.",True
3,8,People can learn from this!,gordanatasevski,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't even imagine that people can fall down for this kind of stuff. Giving all money you have and expect to earn twice more without doing anything.... I mean every normal person who has clear mind at that moment will not believe this. Zoe was organization who destroyed so much lifes and they still saying that they are innocent. It's great to watch and share to other people, educate them. And I think this is the matter of God. People wanted more and more and that's why God took them all. You have to be satisfied with things God gave you and not asking for more and more all the time or things like this will happen.",True

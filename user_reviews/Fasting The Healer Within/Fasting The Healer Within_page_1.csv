1,9,Heal thyself! - The True Miracle Cure,warriorsrising,n/a,15/08/2025,"I randomly stumbled across this documentary. This is my first IMDB comment and I knew I had to write it. Having survived a meth overdose and a near-death experience at age 17, I turned my life around and began fasting 2 years later. My first fast was 3 days on liquid. I'll never forget that experience. The longest I ever went on liquids was 10 days. I had no idea of all the cleansing, physical, mental and spiritual benefits I would experience from it over the decades that would follow. I'm so grateful Saxon & Sinclair decided to upside it and do this documentary. Everyone needs to see it... particularly unhealthy Americans! I can confirm the real-life personal testimonials, along with their own on this documented journey, are legit. There are things covered and shared here that only someone whom has fasted extensively can relate to. Not only can fasting potentially heal just about any ailment within the body, it will transform your perspective on life, health & much more in many positive ways! Most people will never even fast 2-3 days in their life, or experience the marvelous benefits and clarity that come with it. It takes more than twice the average person to have the discipline & willpower to do longer fasts. Once you try it, you'll never be or look at life the same again! Your appreciation for the simple things in life, like actually having food to eat, will skyrocket. Mainstream medicine doesn't advocate it because it could put the pharma industry out of business. I like that the film highlighted that you need to understand how to prep your body for a fast & how to break a fast the right way. Also, covering a cancer patient who tried one route before fasting to save his life. The body's potential for self healing is unprecedented. In our modern society, filled with genetically modified foods & toxic poisons, it's no longer an option; it's a necessity! Also read Paul & Patricia Braggs (creators of Braggs organic apple cider vinegar) book, The Miracle of Fasting. It's not easy & it's not pleasant at times, but it's entirely worth it. It truly is mind over matter. You CAN begin living a fasted lifestyle if you're willing to discipline yourself and take back your life & health. You CAN do this!! Thanks again for the film, gentlemen!",False
2,10,COMPLETE TIME-TESTED SCIENCE !! GET to KNOW it !!,aom-37355,n/a,15/08/2025,"The absolute best Documentary about FASTING, period !!The absolute definition of SCIENCE is ... reality based KNOWLEDGE which stands up to the test of TIME !! Why, because humanity has been FASTING since the beginning of time !! Were our westernized societies 'educated' about real unbiased and time-tested science, we'd understand the difference between p$eudo-$cience and the TRUTH !! The Latin word for KNOWLEDGE is Science ... it's no mystery ! So, if you want to practice discerning the difference between fantasy and reality, open your eyes and ask yourself a few questions! If cutting nonsensical information & food-like substances out of your physiological / psychological 'diet' is so dangerous; then ... why does it HEAL US ????Organic plant foods and unbiased & INDEPENDENTLY funded research are our only hope for WELLNESS !!!!!! So, get off the mainstream and get into the REALITY !!!",False
3,2,Would have worked better as a 20 min youtube video,ash-10441,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unfortunately this video really misses the point of why and how people fast. There's absolutely no information leading up to the fast about what they ate to prepare and how they exercised, no details about there genetic make up and basically a travel show with a bit of chit chat.As this is the sort of film that people will search out rather than stumble across due to the niche subject matter, you really need to provide more scientific evidence and show supporting historic facts about fasting, such as the history of it and where it originated. As I'm interested in fasting I expected a lot more fasting back story.At times these just feels like a couple of bro's who are interested in themselves and that's it. Which is a shame. Seems like there's still a gap in the market to fill if someone wants to make a real film about fasting, unfortunately this isn't it.",False
4,1,"Unblanced. No science, scientists or warnings",simeondrage,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this so you don't have to. There's no discussion about science, approached with a fixed mindset, biased and potential dangerous and problematic due to showcasing cancer cures, which I won't fully discount but they need to be presented so people are fully informed of risks of not getting chemotherapy etcAlso zero discussion or insight into potential different effects fasting has on men and women, especially with regard to female hormones and fertility and general health. Female bodies respond differently to men's when fasting.Felt like a advertisment for the Bali fasting clinic.Lots of one sided sudo medical opinions included.If you want to watch people fast, watch Alone which is much more enjoyable.",False

1,10,Fantastic adventure into a rarely seen side of Indonesia,NickCalpakdjian,n/a,16/08/2025,"Audun Amundsen has created an enthralling film that dives into Indonesia's jungles and explores a rarely seen side. The real treat offered audiences in this film is Audun's longevity. He is no fly in fly out tourist. Spending some 15 years with his characters he is able to capture moments of adventure, emotion, heartbreak and excitement that could not be achieved in a short examination of Aman Paksa and his families life.",False
2,10,Very unique and insightful,michael-84548,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't like to write reviews, but I think this documentary deserves one.
15 years is a long time to follow through a story and I think this unique movie made us see very clear an interesting slice of life from a unique culture that is not seeing much publicity outside Indonesia.
I dare to say that a lot of problems and complexities of life exposed here are quite universal and probably that makes this move quite important to see.
If there is a lesson to learn from this move is not one that probably most of the people will see it right away: don't be afraid to re-evaluate your values and happiness level in this crazy modern world.
I hope more people will see the move and will ponder about choices they make in their life with a more critique eye.",False

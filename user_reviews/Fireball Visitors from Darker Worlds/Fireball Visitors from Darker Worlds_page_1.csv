1,8,Another great Herzog documentary,ebeckstr-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"One can't go into a Werner Herzog documentary expecting a Discovery Channel or National Geographic style affair. Fireball is characterized by Herzog's iconic eccentricity, off-beat narrative style, quiet but intense narration, and sometimes far fetched and even seemingly non sequitur connections among ideas. He connects science, folklore, art, and other cultural histories through their connections with meteorites. I found this documentary fascinating, mysterious, and in some parts simply beautiful in the humanity on display.",False
2,8,A whimsical exploration of existence beyond ourselves,TheVictoriousV,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's purely a coincidence that I am reviewing two documentary features in a row - partly brought on by the fact that I don't yet know where to see The Climb or Wolfwalkers. But following up I Am Greta, a movie that wants us to be really sad about the state of the planet, with one that sometimes basks in the Earth's inconsequentiality next to the rest of the Universe (not that this means we shouldn't treasure it; quite the opposite) was an amusing line-up.There are very few filmmakers who resonate with me in the same way as Werner Herzog, the German legend who all but dominates the very documentary genre. This isn't because I always admire his films, but rather because of the way the indifference of the unfeeling cosmos seems to fascinate him - along with things that are strange and non-human, including grizzly bears and Baby Yoda.Herzog finds glee where others are brought despair. The non-discriminating, inevitable reality of death, and the chaotic forces that may one day annihilate all of us in a single swoop (no matter how important we deem ourselves, or how desperately we believe in divine reward and greater purpose), are depressing reminders to some, while others look at them with fascinated awe. The only thing I like more about Herzog is the accent.In Fireball: Visitors From Darker Worlds (viewable on Apple TV), Herzog looks at meteors, as well as the sort of people who have made it their life to look at meteors. We also learn what meteor strikes have come to mean for various hopeful cultures and individuals around our spheroid (a museum in France even carries a message for potential alien visitors, meant to be found if we don't survive the next asteroid hit, and Herzog expectedly jokes about the optimism in the faith that aliens will understand Modern French).Some peoples have taken meteorites as a sign of our importance (a message from Someone Greater), whereas scientists might take it as a sign that there is insurmountably more to existence than humanity - which is fine.At Herzog's side is volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer; not to be confused with Joshua Oppenheimer, another giant in the world of documentary film (Herzog was an executive producer on his masterfully disturbing Look of Silence in 2015). But as documentary films go, Fireball is indeed made with expertise, focusing on well-selected subjects and being very well-shot (I found the use of drone cameras to be unusually effective, adding some ""size"" to our aforementioned spec of a home by transitioning from space rock close-ups to long-shots of an Alsatian vista).Many of the characters we meet are as fascinating as the very exploration of meteorides and forces immeasurably older than ourselves - particularly delightful, in my opinion, is the Norwegian man who revolutionized the research of so-called micrometeorites; items that fell from space, scarcely the size of a dust grain. A character we don't see enough of, according to some reviewers, is Herzog himself.But following Oppenheimer (who conducts most of the interviews) is fun too, and Herzog's narrations are more than enough this time. The essentials are still there. We are still very much reminded that, sometimes, the things that make us seem so unfathomably small can also make us feel so unfathomably lucky that we're alive to explore them; that we exist in an age with the right tools; that our place in the solar system even allowed for evolution to reach this point; that the latest Apollo asteroid strike, a moment of immense destruction, made it so we could eventually live.Who knows? There may even be a reason these stones made their way to humankind after all; something that made them seek us out. Then again, I might just have watched too much Goop Lab to be entirely rational. I hereby issue my apologies for that last bit.A quick note, just so I can flex my knowledge since kidhood: I have not misspelled the word ""meteorite"" when speaking of ""meteorides"" earlier in this post. A meteoride is a piece of space debris (usually from a comet or asteroid, both of which distinguish themselves from meteorides in that they actually orbit a star) that becomes a METEOR when entering a planet's atmosphere, and METEORITE if it lands on the surface.",False
3,7,Polar-Roid Camera,southdavid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another documentary on Apple TV, shamefully this is the first Werner Herzog documentary that I've seen. If they're all as enjoyable as this one, I'll start hunting down a few more.The Documentary sees Herzog and his scientific collaborator Clive Oppenheimer travel the world looking at the impact, physically, culturally and spiritually, that Meteors and Comets have had on the Earth. From scientific studies, both low and high tech, to the effect that Meteors have had on the storytelling of remote Pacific tribes, they explore with a sense of wonder and with Herzog's deadpan delivery of the voiceovers.As Documentaries go, ""Fireball"" takes rather a scattershot approach to investigating all the ways that Meteorites and Asteroids have affected our planet, it's never less than beautiful though - as our heroes circumnavigate the globe meeting scientists, theologians and tribesman to hear stories, theories and facts about the subject. We see a wide range of vistas and landscapes all wonderfully caught on camera and occasionally with the excellent use of a drone.A little of the documentaries style takes some getting used to. Herzog likes to hold uncomfortably long shots on the interview subjects, whilst he explains in voice over who they are and why they went to see them. Oppenheimer actually conducts most of the interviews, in a light chatty fashion which I think helps to put a few of the more awkward subjects at ease, there's also a lovely moment towards the end when he finds a large Meteorite in the polar icecaps. Herzog's Bavarian brogue takes a little getting used to, but once I was, I really loved it and he's really very funny, with odd little asides and descriptions of the action that genuinely made me laugh out loud a few times.It's not quite as deep in some areas as I might have liked, but it's as enthusiastic and enamoured with its subject as any documentary I've seen in a long time.",False
4,6,"An interesting documentary, but not a very deep one",mbrcf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tiff 2020 02Fireball: Visitors from Darker WorldsIt's always a joy to listen to Werner Herzog as he goes through his subjects and narrates them and you can see his passion, his excitement for finding unique, hard to find little stories about science, about people around the world and to retell them through his filmmaking skills, to try to share that beautiful things he found in his journey.However, this film is a bit formless and weak on structure and layout. Herzog and his co-director Clive Oppenheimer just go interview some knowledgeable people and scientists about asteroids and meteorites. There's no arc and momentum about this film, it's just a collection of interviews, locations and some information about meteorites. If you already have an interest about them, this is a must see for you, and if not, well, it's a watchable film but not a very deep or memorable one.",False
5,6,More about culture,themadcamel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was curious to watch this documentary as I've always been fascinated about the impact of celestial bodys hitting the earth and it's effect on human evolution, religion, and beliefs. Although beautiful in parts this film has not much new to offer in ways of science, it lacks intrigue becoming somewhat boring all-round. It was more a vignette into peoples lives than it was about meteorites.",False
6,7,It's alright,benprichardsdotcom,n/a,16/08/2025,Definitely not as juicy as some of Werner Herzog's other documentaries. Maybe it was the effect Oppenheimer had on the interviewees; maybe he couldn't get as much out of them as Herzog might have. The subject matter is infinitely intriguing but Fireball just didn't get out of 3rd gear.,False
7,9,Herzog magic of ol',vaguira,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a long-time admirer of Herzog, I wouldn't describe myself as free from bias. I approached this documentary with caution, given my recent experiences with some of his latest work (Family Romance Inc, et al). Without ruining your experience, there is one thing I could say about this documentary: it transmits the passion and drive of Herzog's golden days. Many of the clich√©s are still there (the soundtrack, for instance), but in a good way. Herzog meets an old friend and together they explore a fascinating topic: meteorites. In the long, silent shots of human faces, the Herzog magic of old re-emerges. As in the old days, Fireball is ultimately a human look no other director could provide. It doesn't have the slow pace of ol'; Herzog's interaction with Hollywood probably has a lot to do with that. But in the end, Fireball deserves to be seen. It is an intimate and colourful exploration of us and the rocks and dust that makes us.",False
8,7,A Unique and interesting perspective on the subject. Well done.,jdzacpt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Initially put off by the narration I must admit, the narrators voice eventually grew on me ,and in fact adds to the appeal of this enjoyable and informative look at the subject. Watch, enjoy, open your mind and heart and learn.",False
9,9,A profound exploration of extraordinary possibilities,shrinavaratnam,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film just puts science and fiction into the realms of extraordinary possibilities beyond our own human existence. It is at once real and incredible, probing into the messages from light years away that showcases a magical, if sometimes frightening, expanse that's beyond our wildest imagination. And the real treat, and stunning truth, is that science is showing us how space and the cosmos is so much so connected to us at the core.",False
10,6,Herzog and Company Get Their Rocks Off,Cineanalyst,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rocks are cool, I suppose, and those from space more so, but it's a stretch to hold interest through others looking at and talking about them for an hour and a half. Fortunately, Werner Herzog's narration can hold interest like no other, and some of the anthropological examinations of meteorites and their craters is compelling, including in the formation of the ring of Mayan cenotes. A replay of the common story of the extinction of the dinosaurs from the same Chicxulub asteroid also works. Even some of the more routine interviews with scientists or those otherwise interested in space dust are raised by their enthusiasm and sometimes is even rather ASMR triggering. The Antarctic scenes of people lining up along the ice to search for stones looks nice.I gather ""Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds"" is similar to Herzog and co-director Clive Oppenheimer's prior documentary ""Into the Inferno"" (2016), where Oppenheimer's specialization in volcanology came into play, as his scientific background continues to serve this doc in him doing the interviewing while Herzog brings the idiosyncratic narration and decades of filmmaking experience of a New German Cinema director. Speaking of volcanos and asteroids, I suppose I ought to feel special given that Herzog claims here that only a few had known (although probably not true if even I knew about it) about NASA and others' efforts to track and, perhaps one day, divert large asteroids from impacting Earth. That people are watching these space rocks and devising plans--whether or not it involves nuclear weapons and probably not in the sense as depicted in ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact"" (both 1998)--to potentially respond to them is probably why I'm less concerned that humanity's extinction will be from an asteroid impact. Those supervolcanos seem more of a problem (as ridiculously depicted in ""2012"" (2009)) given that they may be more unpredictable and impossible to do anything about, as well as anything akin to ""The Core"" (2003), as in that of the Earth, or a Sun burp (""Knowing"" (2009)), or, forget rocks, what if an entire stray planet or large black hole wandered into Earth's orbit. We're sitting ducks. Something to think about.",False
11,9,Mesmerizing journey by one of Germanys greatest filmmaker,MisterHangul,n/a,16/08/2025,"When you watch a documentary by Werner Herzog, what you get isn't just your traditional well narrated documentary. It's a journey. A journey through the world and through different cultures with a specific theme. This time, this specific theme are Meteors and it's origins. Werner Herzog behind the camera and also serving as the narrator, he again comes with support, and like with ""Into the Inferno "" (2016) this support is the charismatic Volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer.Calling ""Fireball"" a traditional documentary isn't the right term. It's a mesmerizing mixture containing the power of science, spectacular pitctures and music. Combined with Herzogs relaxing voice, this documentary works more like a lucid dream than a simple documentary about Meteors. If you watched Into the Inferno on Netflix, you kinda know what to expect. Into the Inferno is also brillant and I cannot recommend it enough. If you have watched Fireball on Apple TV before and now wanna dig deeper into this Arthouse-Documentary style, go for it.If you plan to watch Inferno, relax, enjoy it with a good Whisky or Whine and let it absorb you. In my opinion, only Werner Herzog is capable of grabbing the viewer in such a way.",False
12,5,Really hoped for something more...,jtboone2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just a rambling montage of bits of information that never seem to have a distinct direction or point. Random. Really disappointing. Was expecting so much more. A solid through line with a cohesive vision, but no, not what this is. It's a mess of a documentary by one of the most renowned documentarians of all time. Sad.",False
13,9,Hard to fault,Leofwine_draca,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another classic and fully immersive documentary from Werner Herzog, just as involving as the previous two he made with Clive Oppenheimer (INTO THE INFERNO and ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD). This one's all about meteorites, and it's a globetrotting adventure that aims to explore the people and mysteries surrounding their origins and arrival on our planet. As usual, Herzog mixes a vast and complex matter with small intimacies, and seems to draw out welcome eccentricities from his human participants. The photography is bravura and Herzog's narration as spot on as ever. Like with most of his documentaries, this one's hard to fault.",False
14,10,Omg. Thank you for amazing documentary!,snersisyan-54595,n/a,16/08/2025,Not only amazing but I have learned so much. Thank you!,False
15,8,"Obscure topic, beautiful cinematography, and narration that is both dull and exciting. Its wonderful.",KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pretty solid documentary that achieves its goal by not really having a goal besides exploring. Much like meteorites and their impact on this world physically and culturally, we know so much and yet so little. Werner Herzog and Clive Oppenheimer are not trying to answer questions other can't answer, but instead are searching the world with each person having their own reasoning and logic for meteorites.This film ambient and wonderful. Herzog's narration, the slow long takes, and ambient music might make some viewers sleepy but for those who stay awake are enthralled and put into a state of awe as they witness the beauty of Earth, humanity, and the unknown.When this film is over you might feel like you just learned the meaning of life yet you couldn't say what it is. Its grand, ambient, and definitely worth watching.",False
16,5,"Some Jewel Moments, Many Boring",davejenner,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film could've been fantastic, and there were some moments that were just amazing. But there were many moments where there was lots of slow moving music and slow moving B roll footage that was just absolutely boring and could've easily been edited out so as to not waste my time. Then there were moments where weirdos were interviewed and dance rituals performed which had no scientific bearing on this topic. Favorite part was the scientists in Antarctica and their experiences.",False
17,8,Amateurish but fine,henrycoles9,n/a,16/08/2025,Werner Herzog showed the spirit and artistic liberty of an amateur in this documentary and I liked him for it.,False
18,9,Give it a watch,callahans20,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ten minutes in, and I was ready to bolt for yard work. But I stuck with it, mainly because my husband brought me a banana split. Thank Goodness, on both counts. Because this documentary became fascinating, and then riveting. It's simply a stunning look at things you thought you knew, but are so much richer than you dreamed. Also, the banana split was pretty good.",False
19,10,Mind Blowing,jason-j-whittle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is the definition of mind blowing. It's strangle how little we think about space rocks that hit Earth, and all the possibilities that come with it. I particularly liked exploring the question of space rocks seeding life on earth or other planets. This will take you on a journey all over the planet, visiting crash sites and leaning about religions and cultures that have been significantly influenced by historical impacts. I had no idea that Muslim people were really into a particular meteorite. The historical impacts during times of humans coincidence with religious and superstitious beliefs.",False
20,2,"Narration horrible, tonns of pseudoscientific whooo",Berkeleyblue,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first Apple TV+ documentary I didn't finish. The Narration (watched it in German) is hideous, monotone and his pronunciation is overall very weird. Never liked this Narrators style but here it destroys every little piece if credibility the movie has left. It seams stretched at point where we are shown scenes from deep impact or the Last days of the dinosaurs, when at other points the narrator tells us, that what followed was so complicated, that they wont torture us with it.That has to be the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in a documentary. A format dedicated to advance knowledge and share information.Instead of experts, we are confronted with jazz musicians tht kinda hunt for meteor dust as a hobby. It's filled with religious nonsense much more than it is filled with actual, scientific research and findings.The topic could have been amazing and I was excited when I saw it, as I'm a big fan of cosmology and meteorites are fascinating to me. Having watched Tiny Worlds and Elephant queen, I expected way more from this and was absolutely crushed by what was shown to me. I would award it 1 Star, wouldn't it be for some brief momenta of actual scientific information and beatiful images from Antarctica.I wouldn't recommend this to any one with prior knwoledge or interest in the field and would encourage everyone else to take the message in this documentary with a grain of salt. There are other documentaries that do a far better job than this, which is unfortunate.And please, never have us sit through this narrator again. It's definitely not a skill he has.",False
21,3,I love documentaries,sgimera-34917,n/a,16/08/2025,But this was very dry and monotone throughout. Not very captivating or perhaps just too long for the material they cover.,False
22,5,Worst doc of his career,alpinedon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is Herzog losing his touch? This was certainly not his best film. Herzog has always been at his best doing things ""his way"" but there are certain moments when included moments are just plain sloppy and should've been cut from the film.",False
23,2,Disappointing in Every Way,mahamraad-07929,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like astronomy, Science or even just watching documentaries, walk away! ""Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds"" has literally nothing new or interesting to say about meteorites and even if it had, you probably couldn't understand it due to its really hard to understand and exceptionally boring narrative!
let's be honest, shall we? if I had a very thick German accent I myself would be the first to notice it and naturally wouldn't choose myself to be the narrator on a documentary that's gonna be in English.
saying that, here is my question to Mr. Werner Herzog: how much of a narcissist or an ignorant person do you have to be to decide on narrating this ""documentary"" yourself?!
leaving that behind, the camera work is not very good, lots of very very idiotic close ups of people during each one Mr. Herzog masterly manages to make everyone - even viewers!- very very uncomfortable indeed.
in conclusion I think ""Fireball: What the hell were you thinking Mr. Herzog?!"" would've been a much better title for this 'Documentary""",False
24,1,WTH did I just watch,davenacrelli,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was such a great topic, but unfortunately a horrible narration and writing. More religious than scientific. Nothing short of a waste of time. So disappointing. Sad. Just sad.",False
25,3,Awkward Documentary,yxdpa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I rarely write a review in IMDB. But I can say this is one of the awkward documentary I've ever seen. The editing, narrative, music were so out of place. There is one scene which there is this awkward pauses where the canera just focus on the faces. Expected a very mind blowing documentary but got a gloomy and boring documentary instead.NOT RECOMMENDED",False

1,8,A visceral viewing experience that will be the definitive portrayal of the Chilean protests,gricey_sandgrounder,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I am aware of the Chilean protests, my knowledge was barely surface level.As soon as I saw this film documentary, I am fully aware of not just how it all happened. But also how pivotal this is for the country in every way.This is my first experience of director Patrizio Guzman's work and I have heard good things and it shows how much they love their country. Especially when they've making documentary films about their country for the last half century.From the word go, you are already into the action, on the frontline and hearing directly from the people involved.There is a lot of energy coming from both the interviewees and the filmed footage. Along with a well structured narrative, you get a pretty thorough look at the many things the whole is fighting for.There are also some astonishing images caught on camera that will stay with you.I would have liked an aspect that saw the other side contribute to the documentary. But considering the circumstances was never going to make that possible, it wasn't a major gripe.This was a very raw viewing experience and felt like a definitive look at this event. The first-hand account of the action makes the imagery striking and the interviews are compelling. It further shows how passionate this part of the world is and makes any outsider truly understand what is happening over there.",False
2,7,"There are flames that consume, and there are those that nourish.",Blue-Grotto,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mass demonstrations recently set Santiago and Chile on fire in a ""marvelous chaos."" A different kind of country is emerging from the ashes.For over thirty years since the last dictatorship in Chile, conservative men retained their grip on power. They did not represent the country. What began as a protest over mass transit in Santiago grew into a broader movement for dignity, housing, pensions, health care, paid tuition, and equality for women. A violent repression followed. In the face of oppression what remains standing is hope, resilience, and marichiweu (a word of the Mapuche people that stands for ""always the people will win."" The changes to Chile's constitution are coming along with a new and long imagined future of true equality. It is the beginning of life rather than mere survival for the Chilean people.The most outstanding and mesmerizing documentary films I've ever seen, Nostalgia for the Light and The Pearl Button, are from veteran documentary filmmaker Patricio Guzman. First off, if you did not see either film, stop what you are doing right now and stream them on the nearest electronic device! These compelling and heartrending stories, the knowledge of Chilean affairs that they convey, and the beautiful cinematography from start to finish, will leave you spellbound and dazzled. While My Imaginary Country is not at the level of Guzman's previous films, it is still high quality coming from him. Guzman was filming during the 1973 coup against Salvador Allende and just gained in documentary filmmaking prowess since that time. My Imaginary Country combines interviews and commentary from his fellow activists as well as his own takes on the incendiary events that began in 2019 in Santiago. It first appeared at Cannes.",False
3,6,My Imaginary Country,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Perhaps because I've recently watched quite a few lively and informative documentaries based around the protests in Hong Kong, I found this all rather repetitive, partisan and dry. It's not that the story isn't well worth telling, it's just that Patricio Guzmán relies too heavily on the (perilously shot) archive footage and protester interviews without really putting much context into just what is happening in Chile in 2019. The narrative suggests it's about equal rights for education and job opportunities, but there is little illustration from that narrative just how the protesters aim to achieve that in a politically divided nation that hovers close to bankruptcy and has very close ties to a Catholic church that is catholic in more the just name. They present many of the answers but are they viable solutions? This film just presents us with a rather one sided video-diary of police excess whilst students merrily throw petrol bombs at people doing their jobs - in this admittedly flawed democracy. This also assumes a degree of knowledge of the local situation that I doubt many independent observers have, and thereby it presents us with a sort of David and Goliath scenario clearly inviting us to support one side without making any effort at all to explain the strategy of the Piñera government. I think balance is really important with political documentaries. Present us with both sides and let us choose which to believe and maybe endorse. Present me with a once-sided, intellectual, fait accompli and I'm afraid I usually just lose interest. It's worth a watch, but needed much more meat on the bones of debate.",False
4,3,Pure communist revolutionary propaganda,montiel-jaime,n/a,16/08/2025,"Romantic narrative of what was nothing more than an attempted coup against a president democratically elected by his people.Those of us who live in Chile and witness what happened firsthand have a very different vision from that of the director of this documentary.Since Chile's return to democracy in 1990, Chile had made progress on multiple fronts, becoming the Latin American country with the highest human development index and highest per capita income. All this, under a functioning democracy and a free market development model.But the Latin American ultra-left of a Chavista character, under the coordination of the Sao Paulo Forum, does not tolerate that a Latin American country develops except under its terms.This is the story of how that ultra-left did not respect democracy in Chile.",False
5,2,How not to make a film about your home country,Horst_In_Translation,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""Mi país imaginario"" or ""My Imagined Country"" is a co-production between France and Chile and the latter country is also pretty dominant in this pretty short documentary that is closer to the 80-minute mark than to the 1.5-hour mark. The director and writer here is Patricio Guzmán, a filmmaker from Chile who is over 80 now and has worked on films since the 1960s already. But despite this long time and fairly prolific career, you will probably not really find too many films in his body of work that you have heard of already. He did score a solid amount of awards recognition, but all this also comes only from smaller bodies the way it looks to me. Honestly, as you can see form my rating, I would have been totally fine with this documentary here never getting made. I felt it was almost more of a comedy with how absurd it all was what the interviewees in here are saying and that they do not realize one bit that it may apply to them at least as much as it applies to the ones they are criticizing I mean just you can simply say that this documentary is fully biased, only shows one side of the story and never includes a single police officer, member of the Chilean military forces or member of the government. It does not need to be the president himself. In any case, you can always say that maybe they asked these people to say a few words during this film and they simply declined or did not respond, but it does not matter.Then the film still could have been more objective with a more talented filmmaker in charge, but the truth is it is all black-and-white only: The good guys on the left of the political spectrum, the bad guys on the right side. Needless to say that the ones on the right are also always the extreme right and the ones on the left are harmless and peaceful coming out there to demonstrate with the drums they bring to make music in the process. Oh boy. This is not what things are really like, not in Chile and not anywhere else. Just look at some of the scenes in this film and how aggressively violent the demonstrations are with the stuff they throw at the police officers. But the mayhem caused by the (extreme) left is ignored all the time and not really included in the media either. At least not television. With newspapers and magazines, things are slowly getting better luckily. Here it is especially absurd though. They show us what these demonstrators are doing and at the same time they fully pretend that only one side is evil. I am not even defending the police or anything. Those did despicable acts too, but it is not just them. There was this pretty interesting analogy about fire that one female interviewee came up with. What did she say? The fire from the left is one that includes hope and the vision for a better future in the smoke that goes up in the air. Okay, I am probably exaggerating a bit here now, but you get the message and what I saying with it. On one side, it is all about hope, on the other it is about destruction and burning hope. As absurd as it gets. I am also pretty sure that everything we hear from the interviewees here was written before. Maybe by them, maybe by Guzmán, but it is not important. The agenda and message are always the same.There is this speech also by the woman who rambles on about everything she supports and literally if this one is not a radical member of the left-wing, then I am the Emperor of China. But she would have fit in nicely with the Democrat party in North America. I will not say anything else about her because the sooner I forget her, the better. Needless to say, she was also wearing a mask because of the pandemic despite speaking into a microphone. Unreal. Was there anything good at all about this? Maybe the chess player who was quite stunning, but sadly what she had to say was also biased and fueling more hatred from one political spectrum. I also have no clue why she was in it. Maybe it was really just because of her looks. It was not told that she played any role in the uprisings at all or so. All she did was make a connection when being asked if chess can be seen as a game that has a parallel with the situation in Chile. This was so bizarre. All of it. This is not good documentary filmmaking. Rather the opposite in fact. But you understood that by now I hope. Admittedly the video recordings from up in the air of this gigantic number of demonstrators was quite impressive. How packed the streets were. Not gonna lie, this is where the filmmaker maybe should have rather put his focus on instead of including all kinds of hatred from beginning to end. The perhaps most embarrassing moment was probably when we had this quartet of women there and what they did. Like literally, this felt like a comedy movie at that point. If it had been meant as a satire, I would say please nominate this film for a Golden Globe in the comedy/musical category, but they were 100% serious with this dance performance and what they had to say.This was also linked by the way to a truly despicable and disrespectful statement here from this documentary, namely when these oh so brave role model women talk about how the political establishment is dominated by rather old White (I may capitalize or is it a privilege for another race?) men, which until this point may be not wrong (I admit truth when I see it, that's what makes you unbiased, not to an 80-year-old documentary filmmaker who still hasn't understood), but when they ramble on about these old White men raping them, it becomes as absurd as it gets. This is a statement that should be treated lightly and the ones who say so should be taken to court for false accusations. The system owes this to the men who are falsely confronted with a serious accusation like this and it also owes this to the women who are indeed victims of rape or survivors (even if I don't like the term in this context) or whatever you want to call them. No woman who actually got raped and had to go through this devastating heartbreaking act would use said term related to politicians who just maybe refused positive discrimination to them. Or even if they do not do enough for women in Chile, which is absolutely okay to criticize, then you should still stay with the facts and not get carried away like these people do. It's just disgusting and this statement was even used twice there. As if they were proud of this comparison. I think it's a travesty and I feel sad for all the woman who have to live with an event like this in their past and this film literally mocks them. There is also no debating this. It is the facts what was said here in this film. But I cannot really be surprised. Why? Because Guzmán has already film-wise elaborated on Pinochet over 20 years ago, so it was obvious that here we would also get the full program in terms of one out of Allende and Pinochet being totally bad and evil and the other being a saint. Yeah right.The end of the film is also kinda expected. Early on, we had one interviewee ramble on about how horrible it would be if the candidate from the right wins the election and I think on one occasion they even call it automatically non-democratic if it is not their candidate who is in charge as if there wasn't even an election or so... ridiculous. But yeah, what I wanted to say here is then that Chile finally also gets its Obama, Trudeau, Macron equivalent finally and we hear extracts from a speech from the man, a speech he gave briefly after the election. Guess what, I do not support the winner, but I accept him and would never say this was not a democratic decision. Certain people can learn a lot from this approach of mine. So yeah, political speech at the end of the film what makes it this? Little hint: Ten letters, starts with a ""p"" and ends with an ""a"". You know what I mean for sure. I wonder how many theaters would have agreed to show this film if it had been told from the other side of the spectrum. Or not even that, unbiased in the middle would have been good enough. Maybe 5% of the ones that showed this biased mess. Also where are the male interviewees? I smell a serious case of gender discrimination here. Misandry galore. What I found even more worrying than all this, however, was people in the room actually applauding the outcome when the closing credits rolled in, some sang the song that was playing there, probably something patriotic linked to Chile or communism. Sad to see this kind of propaganda work so well in the simple-minded and they are probably the majority. What a mess! I could only shake my head and get out of the room as fast as possible. I am sure it was those people who would take people to court who dare sing a patriotic German song in whatever context. Okay, this is enough. I highly recommend you to stay far, far away from this film. Sad to see a filmmaker at this age has understood nothing about his craft. Don't see it on the small or especially not the big screen. I am glad I have a movie theater subscription and paid no specific sum of money to see this one. Perhaps the worst film of the year, a definite contender without a doubt.",True

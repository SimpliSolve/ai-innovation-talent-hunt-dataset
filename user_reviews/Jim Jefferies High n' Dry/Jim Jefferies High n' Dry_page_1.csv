1,8,"Jim, stick to the stand-up comedies.",deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen quite a lot of his stand-up comedies and I've always been entertained by them. I like his style, his sense of humour, not afraid of self-deprecation, his raunchy dirty jokes. I tried watching his weekly show, The Jim Jefferies Show, which I found okay but not great. His weekly show was just too much reading the autocue, didn't look natural, and that's the big difference with his stand-up comedies that are so much better. High & Dry brought a constant smile on my face, exactly the kind of show I was expecting. Jim Jefferies should just stick to what he does best and that's on a stage in front of an audience.",False
2,7,"Funny, but lots of stolen bits and repeated lines.",backup-50362,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's better than his last special, but there's an entire segment of 69 jokes ripped off from Tom Segura, and a bunch of other jokes I'm pretty sure he stole from others like Doug Stanhope, as he always tends to.He also repeats some of his own old jokes by the word, like ""If you're (insert group here), know that you're not welcome here."" or ""(insert group here) are the worst people on Earth."" or ""You may know DJ Qualls as the skinny guy from Hustle n Flow""- and it's pretty ridiculous. Like you're watching a broken record loop for over a decade.And as always, he's found new and inventive ways of pretending to be edgy, while actually doing the most middle-of-the-road, safe jokes as to not veer away from his new, fake liberal persona. For example, he makes fun of Greta - and that was something - but before he started he had to be like ""I agree with her on EVERYTHING!""Jeez, Jim, where'd your balls go? You're not edgy if you tell the audience what your ""real"" opinion is before or after each joke, and it's always a safe leftist one we all know you don't actually mean.But hey, this special isn't as bland and aimless as the last one, and for Netflix, it's far beyond what the standard is.So despite my many gripes with Jim ""Jefferies"" the person, Jim ""Jefferies"" the comedian is still 10/10 by Netflix standards.",False
3,6,"Decent, but not flawless. Second half wasn't great.",rechtienejalec,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like Jim Jefferies, he seems to have some solid material. The main flaws I see are a weak second half and really weird pacing. Jim Jefferies has a tendency to overextend jokes well past their welcome (could be to being on the spectrum, which from experience makes it hard to move on to the next subject without finishing the first), and that seems to be especially prevalent in this one. There were some really solid jokes in here, like the Koala bear one, the Bachelor, the Swedish babies, and a few more. These jokes are solid dark humor, yet Jefferies decides to spend almost half of the special about his sex life with his wife. First off, nobody needed to know about all of that, he got way, WAY, too descriptive. Second, too long with little laughs. It was just 15-25 minutes of pure low brow humor with no clever twist. Overall though, this is a special worth watching, except you may want to skip the bit about his sex life.",False
4,10,Ignore The Amateur Critics...,genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"Because it's now hip to dump on Jefferies while acting as though one is above it. Anyone that tries to be witty and says their 4 our of 10 rating is because he 'gives it a go' and is a 'partidipaction trophy' is wanting to say more about themselves than the special.As always, he does a great job with storytelling and his always enjoyable digressions that entertaining enough that you almost forgot what led to them. A great example is the DJ Qualls bit.Even better is his take on the LGBTQ issues and does a great job laying it all out without leaving the reality of it all. From the sounds of it, this might be the last Jim Jefferies special. I hope it's not but if it is, it's a great way to end. I do hope he continues though because he will be greatly missed.",False
5,10,Ahh Jim,mickeyadamo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its hard not to like this guy, even though we don't agree on most topics lol. I guess that what makes a good comedian is when you think they have backwards ideals and the poorest of judgment but are still funny as all hell. A good comedian finds a way to make people laugh at anything and id say Jeffries does a great job of that. We were watching his early comedy back in 2014 or so and while he has transitioned quite a bit from those routines his overall approach to the mic seems to be the same - talk about controversial issues and make fun of the absurdity of humanity, though from the take of someone who admits hes a dumbmass.Respect Jim, and arent we all.A+",False
6,8,Great step!,phillipse-86958,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure why there's so much hate. I loved Jim's old specials during the ""Legit"" era, then he got that comedy central show... That was a rough era and I wasn't enjoying much of what he was putting out, it felt like the comedy was restricted. This special feels like he's going back to the crass style of comedy that got him famous! Doesn't feel like he was pulling punches or over politicized the special. While there are bits about current social issues, they don't feel incredibly pointed or like he's trying to get a message out of them. It feels like a talented writer making jokes about modern society. Great to have ya back Jim! Keep this up!",False
7,1,Very disappointing,dhanisingh-40445,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was looking forward to this special. And I was so very disappointed. Only about 20 minutes of decent new material. The rest is just vulgar and not funny. Definitely the worst special he has done. High and dry is a very apt title has he definitely has run out of new good material. It was very difficult to watch and I persisted hoping it would get better but unfortunately it just got worse and I was glad when it ended. I used to recommend his specials to others. I will no longer be doing that. The jokes have gotten progressively worse, more vile and unnecessarily vulgar. After watching this special I can confidently say I am no longer a fan. Its a pity because his earlier specials were brilliant. This was just awful.",False
8,5,Somewhat bland...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of course I had to sit down and watch the 2023 stand-up comedy special ""Jim Jefferies: High n' Dry"", as I stumbled upon it. I didn't know about it, prior to getting to sit down and watch it. But then again, I am not really keeping up to speed with upcoming comedy specials.I have seen a couple of older shows from Jim Jefferies, and I have to say that the 2023 show ""Jim Jefferies: High n' Dry"" wasn't his best of shows. Sure, it was watchable, and there were some funny moments, but as a whole set, then it just felt a bit flat and as if he wasn't running on a full tank.Some good laughs here and there, but the show was just somehow lacking that special spark of energy that Jim Jefferies usually have shown in previous shows. Don't get me wrong here, though, because I am not saying that ""Jim Jefferies: High n' Dry"" is a bad show, far from it. And I am sure that fans of Jim Jefferies will get a kick out of this 2023 special.My rating of ""Jim Jefferies: High n' Dry"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",False
9,4,I wanted to like this,makennahl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really wanted to like this special because I've watched all of Jim Jefferies other specials, and this one was frankly underwhelming and difficult to stay engaged. There were a couple of good jokes throughout the special, but ultimately many of them were drawn out. He often uses just the sheer volume of his voice to make a joke, but just being loud doesn't necessarily make you funny. Overall, I do appreciate Jim for sticking to his original shtick of self-deprivation and raunchy comedy, but this show is probably best viewed in person. I don't want to be too overly critical of a comedy special, especially Jim Jefferies, as I am a fan, but I would probably skip this one.",False
10,4,He tries...,AnotherPersonInTheWorld,n/a,16/08/2025,"But he isn't actually that funny anymore. He really gives it a good go, attempting to be controversial, talking a bit about sex, but honestly there is nothing new here, nothing you haven't heard before many many times.Like most things these days it's just a money grab aimed at the LCD where mediocrity is all that is needed. He has obviously seen other comedians handling the topics he tries to talk about, but they are far superior, but hey if there is a bandwagon to jump on and Netflix are paying... why not.I'd give it a generous 4/10 as he tries hard, a participation medal of a rating.. .. ..",False
11,3,Yet again...,ybchkdxpc,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're not tired of the ""applaus-ter"" for a comedian virtue signalling for about 50% of the special, then this one might be for you. The special was comprised of good jokes hidden between politicized rhetoric that overshadowed the real comedy. I can appreciate how comedians want to use their platform to echo the same 5 talking points for the greater good, but it's become trite and cliche for any comedian with a couple specials already released.The dirty jokes seem more forced, not so much naturally flowing thoughts but more brute force, sudden impact to pull a laugh. There was a good special in there somewhere, it's just sad to see Jefferies giving us a speech on social issues instead sticking to the material we came to love and know from him.",False
12,4,"Jim Jeffries is one of my favorite comedians, but this is not good",GTReddy711,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jim Jeffries is one of my all time favorites and was looking forward to this stand up, but it just wasn't up to his standard of clever jokes. It was more just the crass side of his typical jokes that are usually accompanied by clever joke writing, so it was very disappointing.It almost feels like he felt he need d to be controversial, when in reality he just needed to be himself. I really hope he ends up figuring out how to navigate the current world and starts writing the way he used to. There was about 10-20 minutes of actual entertaining jokes, but there's no need to watch the full show, just watch clips.",False

1,8,Think you know Poly?...,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm reasonably clued up when it comes to the origins of punk. I know Poly Styrene and X-Ray Spex, but only really as fronting a great band. This goes deeper, her story told by Celeste Bell, her daughter. It's very personal with Bell narrating, slowly going through Poly's belongings and history, an impressive archive of her life. Marion Elliot. Brixton. Late 70s. Mixed race, confused in a volatile society fuelled by hatred and the NF. She was a fighter. Proud, defiant, but still with a youthful fragility. If punk was about anything, it was taking a stand and claiming an identity and Poly managed that brilliantly in what's still a almost exclusively male world. Poly was more punk than most, she was clearly having a blast, but it still meant something. A pure DIY ethic. Home made clothes, hand drawn album art. Certainly more punk than half the hangers on that the scene created. It's mostly made up of photos, old footage, lyrics on scraps of paper, all with the occasional respite of Bell looking wistfully over books, trying on clothes, visiting locations that tie the narrative together. There's plenty of music, live clips, easily proving her punk icon status and a roll call of names all singing her praises, Kathleen Hanna, Don Letts, John Cooper Clark, Pauline Black, band members and family. These voices together with Poly (Ruth Negga bringing Poly to life via her diaries) and Celeste make up the backbone and give it a real honesty and authenticity. Sadly it's not in any way as original as Poly, but it's enjoyable and informative. Much in the same way White Riot is about the Rock Against Racism gig that X-Ray Spex played. Poly's story is interesting, both from the band perspective, the music and the person. The vacuousness of fame, fake and plastic, ultimately finding weaknesses that would haunt her. It takes a toll. Thought that she went mad. Diagnosed with schizophrenia instead of bipolar, aged 21. She wound up in a psyche ward, tranquillised. It's really sad, not only for Poly, but for Celeste recounting the feelings of her 4 year old self. Forced to walk away for herself after just 1 record. She recognised what she needed to do to survive. Continuing to write, there was a solo album that didn't do well and Poly was dropped by EMI. A career over, married with a child at 24, looking for an anchor and finding one with the Hare Krishna via a trip to India. An about turn perhaps, but one that worked for a time. There's not much music left behind, but this proves there was a life fully lead. Thrown a myriad of obstacles from that formative racism to the cancer that took her. Remarkable woman.",False
2,7,A documentary with an Identity!,joebloggscity,n/a,16/08/2025,"Up front I'll admit I was already a fan of X-Ray Spex from years back, and loved some of their tunes. Over the years I'd seen lots of references to the influcence that Poly Styrene had on the evolution of various strands of music in particular 'Grrrl Power' music from which there's been lots of great music.So this documentary was one I was looking forward to, and much credit to the creators of this documentary they have created a mostly honest documentary that shows her life from beginning to end. Led & narrated by her daughter, it takes us through generations that were unique in the pre-internet days.It mostly avoids hagiography although is partisan in its outlook on. The documentary fairly shows a warts 'n all side to her, as she made her mistakes as all do. This is no reality TV show with heartbreaking melodrama but a genuine story of a person, of an era and the good & bad that came through that Punk era.She survived, but sadly is no longer with us.Would I recommend this? To anyone who is interested in the Punk, Indie & New Wave alternative scenes, then I'd say very much ""YES"". It's no utopia but that's what makes it interesting.As said, it will definitely be for those from a certain generation and also who share a love of the indie scene music. A great honest tribute to a very unique & interesting alternative artist.",False
3,8,The personal behind the persona,timleesongs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating documentary film about Poly Styrene on Sky Arts (thankfully also on NowTV). It takes the angle of her daughter who had a difficult childhood living in the shadow of a famous mother with bipolar disorder.A very emotional journey from childhood fear and neglect to acceptance, love and reconciliation.The personal behind the persona. Loved it.",False
4,7,Amazing woman shame about the daughter,rachellowe-26123,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an incredible woman. This documentary was great but it could have been up there with the best if it hadn't been marred by the commentary of her bland, self obsessed monotone daughter who missed so many opportunities by focussing attention on herself. I guess the irony of her making 'I am a cliche' would have been lost in her.",False
5,8,lovely documentary,sgardler,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a lovely insight into who poly styrene was when she wasn't on stage. The documentary is not too focused on the daughter, she was a massive part of poly's life and poly had been dead for 10 years when the documentary was realised so its not like they could have just asked her for more information to put into the documentary. Id have loved to seen more about the other members of X-ray spex but the documentary is ment to be about just poly styrene so that's ok.If you think calling the film ""I Am a Cliché"" is rude then you clearly no absolutely nothing about X-ray spex or poly styrene. X-ray spex made a song called ""i am a cliché"" that's where the name is from.",False
6,10,"A brave insight into a genius, flaws and all",nina-dawson,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan of X-ray Spex and Poly Styrene's solo work, I put off watching this for quite a while... Not wanting to mar my own long-held opinions of an incredible woman I never knew. OK, I was too young for X-Ray Spex at the time but did see Poly Styrene Brixton Academy in '91.Celeste has given us a privileged peek into her mother's journey.I had followed Poly Styrene's career and knew at a surface level her breakdowns. But wow this was raw. I Am a Cliche powerfully walks us through all that, both from Poly's perspective and also a child's innate needs-based perspective.Watching this (eventually!) I celebrated the gigs and the interviews, and I sobbed through the struggles.A unique approach was the use of interviewees as voice overs on scenes and footage, rather than seeing lots of talking heads that is common on similar tributes. This ensured the viewer's focus remained on the subjects, not the commentators.A superb work of art. Not what everyone expected (from some of the reviews I've read). Highs of exuberance of creativity against an underlying unease of societal pressure and judgement. No one created good art to make people feel comfortable. Well done to Celeste, not only her mother's daughter, but the creative woman she has become both because of and despite her mother's creativity, receptiveness and vulnerability... and primarily from her own creativity, recognition of her own self worth and determination to define herself and know her needs. It's a wonderful tribute and a sensitive declaration of how a child of a revered person has their own truth to speak.Big up marvellous audacity, bravery, and generally not giving two hoots what anyone else thinks.While there ain't no answers from the cotton wool clouds, I Am a Cliche does answer questions of how an incredible woman influenced so many, while navigating being human with her own personal circumstances and cultural history. Just beautiful.",False
7,8,Good documentary treatment of punk star's good-times/bad-times story.,wadechurton,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA very individual and unique talent, in 1976 19-year-old Marianne Joan Elliott-Said fearlessly reinvented herself as Poly Styrene, a day-glo punk rocker with a parodic 'consumer product' name fronting a raucous band which she also put together herself, writing the song lyrics into the bargain. Unfortunately, the success of the band spurred her nascent bipolar disorder and after just three years, five singles and one album, it was over. As the documentary shows, the years following contained many harrowing experiences for Elliott-Said, and her daughter as her mental condition flared and subsided with painful regularity. Nevertheless, with proper medication, Elliott-Said managed to find some equilibrium in the 1990s, and in 2010 even released 'Generation Indigo', a second, far more successful solo album (her first 'Translucence' in 1980 was a critical and commercial failure). Unfortunately she succumbed to metastatic breast cancer the following year at the age of 53. This documentary features voices from the past (no contemporary forensic interviewees are seen on-camera), an actress reading from Elliott-Said's diaries, and her daughter Celeste's comments. This latter element is, as other reviewers have noted, somewhat of an intrusion on the story, and indeed it does seem as if Celeste was perhaps intruding upon her mother's 'territory' somewhat. She even appears on-stage with her mother at the latter's final live show, singing the X-Ray Spex signature song 'Oh Bondage, Up Yours'. The diary readings would probably been enough but Celeste is featured prominently throughout, occasionally even speaking in that 'sing-song', child-like voice with which Elliott-Said would introduce the X-Ray Spex songs live and on record. The documentary does a respectable job of tracing Elliott-Said's life, although after the giddy heights of punk-pop stardom, the mood darkens considerably, and in fact it is hard not to hear Celeste's raw, bitter comments as some sort of 'revenge' for a disturbing childhood at the hands of her monster-mother. Then, with the new album and a triumphal live show with the reformed X-Ray Spex she is suddenly gone, along with the optimism which had built up in those final years. It's a good documentary, well worth watching to find out the full story of a previously-overlooked key personality in the UK punk scene, but when the atmosphere turns cold, it is something of an ordeal.",True
8,4,Poly Styrene: Not A Cliche,WitnessToIt,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is almost a decent documentary - pretty good when it's focused on Poly.Sadly the daughter is in love with herself and is far too intrusive in this; I don't mean by that that she shouldn't be commenting, but she does too much, and more so all the *film* of her in this.Do we really need to be reminded about the book on Poly?Constantly the daughter is looking through the book while narrating.The daughter is shown far too much in this, and like another review stated, it marred this documentary. *Greatly*.It's very unfortunate.I also take offense at the title of this movie; it occurred to me nearing the end of watching it, that it was likely her daughter's way of getting some final ""revenge"" against whatever bitterness she had toward her mother.Poly Styrene - Marianne Elliott-Said - was no cliche, she was one of a kind, a visionary, lyrically. And she was a fragile human being indeed.This documentary ultimately does Poly a disservice - it both pays tribute to her, and insults her at the same time. Not right.While this had moments, it was not exactly satisfying at all.",False

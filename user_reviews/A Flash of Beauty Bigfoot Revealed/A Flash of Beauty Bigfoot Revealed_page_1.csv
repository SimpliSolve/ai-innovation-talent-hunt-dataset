1,8,Good until the faked photos near the end,keenangeiger,n/a,16/08/2025,There's an Alaska Bigfoot story near the end where the producers slipped in unrelated drone footage not related to the encounter of the female witness. Was promising until the deceptiveness at the end. Otherwise strong showing with a swerve towards conspiracy.,False
2,9,Very well done.,thelifeofpyfe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of the Bigfoot documentaries I have seen, this is one of the best. The stories are compelling and interesting. No odd extraterrestrial, transdimensional or telepathic nonsense. The people giving their accounts are very credible and believable. The inclusing on Peter Byrne and Dr Jeff Meldrum really lends the believability to another level. And I have to say the last report with the gentleman who has cancer...very emotional and a 'good-for-him' moment! This is one documentary that I recommend to everyone who is interested. I am glad they didnt' add false information or questionable theories. Great job.",False
3,10,Excellent,heichertgary,n/a,16/08/2025,Probably the most down to earth Sasquatch documentary I've ever seen. Very credible testimonies from a wide range of witnesses and the perfect documentary for skeptics to watch. Highly recommend this if you're interested in the subject of Sasquatch.,False
4,5,No Evidence But Good Folklore Tales,jbakabird,n/a,16/08/2025,"The reason this is popular is because it is a very well produced and calmly presented documentary about people who claim to have seen Bigfoot. Because people speak without sensationalism and with conviction with a nicely edited production and excellent soundtrack, it can lead one to give credibility to the sightings. However, no evidence is actually presented other than stories so I would call this a documentary about folklore and people's belief in such. In other words the topic could have been ghosts or aliens or forest gnomes and it would have been equally interesting. But to reiterate, there is nothing credible presented that is evidentiary, it's just a series of stories overlaid on stock footage.",False
5,10,Excellent work,najor,n/a,16/08/2025,Beautifully filmed and treated with respect. So much about Bigfoot/Sasquatch that I was unaware of before this film. It will make you think. Nice work!,False
6,10,"Very well done, until the end....",Ghostofthewoods,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI still give this 10 stars as it was very well made. But the story at the end, although I don't believe was intentionally faked, I don't think was real and let the show down. In my opinion, the pilot either set this up, OR the 'movement in the hedge' was a someone with a camera making his/her YouTube video of someone in a fancy dress suit that was inadvertently photographed from the plane. It just didn't look real, and there are some cheap suits that are almost identical to what they were wearing readily available. I think the lady was genuine, but possibly mislead or mistaken.",True
7,10,I am now hooked on all things Bigfoot thanks to the directors,ryantskinner,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of my favorite movies and here's why:Flash of Beauty"" also manages to balance its thrilling moments with heartwarming and thought-provoking themes. It explores the connection between humans and nature, the importance of preserving the wilderness, and the power of belief in the face of skepticism.""Flash of Beauty"" is an absolute must-see for anyone intrigued by bigfoot legends. With stunning cinematography, impressive creature design, and a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat, it's a delightful ride into the mysterious world of bigfoot. A must-watch for cryptozoology enthusiasts and movie lovers alike!",False
8,10,"Enthralling with zero ""hype""",abfabwords,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI loved this doc, and totally dont find most to be any more than hype that is intended to hook your interest. THIS is different - it interviews BOTH scientists and ""believers"". I loved the interview w the sheriff - who is so real, this isnt something he believed in yet changed his life!THE ENDING i wonderful I think about the chap who had cancer, and it made a difference in his life TOO, his experience. You can say whatever your wnt about ""man in a suit"" but, cmon - this man is still alive after stage 4 deadly cancer.THIS doc made me feel - the Sasquatch - chooses YOU. And for a reason.Never saw it presented this way before. Thumbs up, cant wait for Part TWO!",True
9,10,Best of Bigfoot,tlastelk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I own a digital copy of this movie and have watched it several times. Some of the other reviews call some of the footage fake. I see nothing fake at all having experienced the ""Predator Effect"" myself. You know something is there, you see the brush moving but you can't see what's doing it. I have seen or not seen this phenomenon twice. It's hard to describe here. I have also met the filmmakers and a number of the people interviewed in A Flash of Beauty including Dr Simeon Hein Ph. D. I recommend reading his book Dark Matter Monsters to further understand what is presented in the movie and to better understand the sequel A Flash of Beauty Paranormal Bigfoot.",False

1,9,"I Agree, The Old World Order Is Not Common Knowledge",steve-83-602015,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOld World Order is about architecture when buildings had doors and doorways sized for people much taller than 6-feet. It is about a time when there was an alternative energy source. The movie shows orphan trains (1854-1929) and infant incubators at fairs (late 1800s - 1940s). It speaks of rigid airships (the Hindenberg which crossed the Atlantic to the U. S. ten times and seven times to Brazil). Rigid airships were different from zeppelins (the Graf Zeppelin which made 144 ocean crossings) . Rigid airships were built from 1897 to 1937.The old world order was partly dismantled by world's fairs (exhibitions of the industry of all nations) and partly by fires. Buildings made of stone do not melt when the temperature of the fire is 1,000 degrees but do degrade at a temperature of 2,000 degrees. ""Every major city in America experienced a great fire."" Some of the fires and cities named in the documentary were: The Chicago Fire, the San Francisco Fire, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Salem, Chelsea, Baltimore, Paterson, NJ, Portland, OR, the great fire of Honolulu in 1900, London, and South Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.The Old World Order was an interesting civilization.One problem with this documentary was that it did not cover the trains of orphans well. Viewers would think the children may have come from World War I, but we do not know for sure from where the premature babies and the orphan trains came.Second, how did the giants disappear and how did they disappear from books on human origins?Thinking about what was taken from humanity, how it was taken from us, and thinking about how and why it was supposed to be unknown is the great impact of this documentary.",True
2,8,Truth exposed but with clown music and hats,web-534-393830,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why is this information successfully appearing everywhere all at once? The evidence is clear and there is little margen of error regarding the age of the buildings. The narrative taught in schools is clearly invented and alienating. These buildings were not built in the 19th century and are not from a Greco-Roman civilization since they are present all around the world. This aspect of the documentary is perfect and I wish it ended there, together with the evidence on incubators, orphanates and asylums. But the film expands to other interesting subjects that actually discredit the main one instead of enhancing it. And the hip hop ""music"" used is the nail on the coffin, making the whole work look like a teenager's joke, too fringe, and so unsharable.",False
3,10,OLD WORLD ORDER TRUTH,jmhcorcoran,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has unveiled the truth about our history. It shows the mastery of building great monuments with horse and buggies. How was that done - it calls into question. Ever notice old buildings say ""Founded in 1800"" not "" Built in 1800"" makes you wonder.

4,10,Good story,mostarmaka,n/a,16/08/2025,"""History is a set of lies agreed upon""Provocative and thought-provoking, this documentary sheds light on unconventional ideas that challenge our understanding of history. From alternative perspectives on iconic events to unorthodox interpretations of cultural heritage, the film presents a diverse range of perspectives that will leave you questioning the narratives you thought you knew. While some ideas may seem radical, they spark essential conversations about the complexities of the past and the power of history to shape our present. A must-watch for curious minds and those willing to think outside the box.",False
5,1,"Scepticism is good, stupidity is not",silvabruna,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gather some footage from god knows what sources and question all kinds of facts by suggesting far fetched and unproven idea's. Its good to question things from our past, its not good to question them by suggesting alternative but not well argumented ideas of how our past might have been. An open mind is brain that can argument, with logic and sensible ideas. That was missing in this documentary. Didn't bother to fact check cause no facts were offered. I have questions about how the pyramids were constructed but that doesn't make me think that a some elitists have altered the conception of how it came into place. That's just ridiculous.",False
6,1,"AI Images, incoherent interviews, and terrible editing",imdbfan-9407835832,n/a,16/08/2025,"This felt like it was put together by a junior high school student. Just a mish-mash of vaguely put together conspiracy theories with almost no relation or context. The video and audio editing must have been done by someone commissioned on fiverr. Music blaring in and out as people are talking. ""Oh yeah, let's plug in Moonlight Sonata at full blast in this part in particular for no reason!"" Truly brilliant. These guys think giants built state capitals and blimps were flying yachts in the sky I guess? They go on to both back up their stories and refute themselves nearly in the same sentence with the same explanations. It's impressive to me one of the 'experts' appeared to be outside during his interviews because I doubt anyone else involved in this production has touched grass since 2020. Good thing he was wearing those 3D glasses you get in movie theaters so the fake sun won't hurt his eyes.",False
7,1,Movie Review: The Old World Order,mechfire,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Old World Order"" is a low-budget conspiracy theory ""documentary"" that promises to uncover hidden truths but ends up being an exercise in confusion and frustration. The film is an odd assortment of theories that leap from one topic to another without ever establishing a clear narrative or point. It lacks coherence, credible sources, and a basic understanding of the subjects it attempts to tackle.The film features a series of so-called ""experts"" who oscillate between stating observable, logical facts and launching into wild, unsupported conclusions. For instance, the documentary suggests that the presence of large doors in old European buildings implies that people were once 20-30 feet tall-a claim that defies logic and common sense. Another bizarre assertion is that iconic buildings in Washington D. C. from the 1850s were stolen from an unnamed group and that this history was covered up.One of the film's most glaring flaws is its failure to clearly articulate its subject matter. It never explains what it's talking about, who is involved, or what the ultimate goal of the discussion is. The narrative is a jumble of disconnected statements, each more outlandish than the last. The lack of direction leaves viewers puzzled and exasperated.The credibility of the film's experts is also highly questionable. At one point, a janitor is cited as a witness to an underground basement's existence-based on hearsay from another janitor who never actually saw the basement. This kind of flimsy evidence undermines the film's already shaky premise. A quick Google search could easily verify or debunk the film's claims, such as the existence of a basement in a museum.Theories presented in ""The Old World Order"" are not just outlandish but also disregard basic scientific principles and historical facts. For example, the film posits that a race of giants once existed and that this truth is being hidden by a shadowy group. It also claims that stone buildings cannot burn down, ignoring well-documented events like the Notre Dame fire. The film even touches on the idea of suppressed ""unlimited free energy"" from a non-existent ""ether,"" showing a lack of understanding of modern science.Overall, ""The Old World Order"" fails on every front. It is neither informative nor entertaining. The documentary's lack of coherent argument, credible sources, and basic logical reasoning makes it a frustrating watch. For those interested in conspiracy theories, the film ""Conspiracy Theory"" starring Mel Gibson offers a much more engaging and coherent narrative. In contrast, ""The Old World Order"" is a poorly executed and pointless endeavor that doesn't even manage to be amusing in its absurdity. It's best avoided unless you're looking for a lesson in how not to make a documentary.",False

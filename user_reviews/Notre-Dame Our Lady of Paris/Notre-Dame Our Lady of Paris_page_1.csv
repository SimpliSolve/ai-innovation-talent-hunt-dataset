1,7,compelling TV special,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a 2 hour ABC special about the iconic Paris cathedral and its devastating fire. This reminded me of the 9/11 TV documentary in 2002. In that one, two French filmmaker brothers happened to be filming a Manhattan firefighter when 9/11 attack occurs. It's no surprise that it's the same filmmaking brothers. I would say that this has an echo of that urgency but it's not quite the same thing. There is a difference between the two incidents. The relic extraction is thrilling. There are various footage from outside on the streets. I learned that there is a sketch artist in the fire department for some reason which is extremely fascinating. It does allow the show to use sketches to illustrate the fire. That brings us to the most compelling parts of the special. It's the actual firefighting in the interior. The most awesome footage is the real footage inside the fire but that's not usually possible since the firefighters do not carry cameras. The sketches do well enough especially with a bit of animation. French audiences will probably appreciate this more but there is a compelling story for everyone.",False

1,7,It's Jackass,nafodude,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not as crazy as some of the stuff they do, but they are getting older and obviously need to wind down.No plot, nothing to think about, have some beers and watch the carnage.A good laugh.",False
2,8,A little hit and miss but it's not from lack of commitment,jtindahouse,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's wild to me that we got another 'Jackass' movie. I had no hope of getting another one after 3, however when the money runs out, the money runs out. I was always going to be interested to see just how far these guys were capable of pushing themselves. It turns out pretty far.The movie has prolific nudity like we have never seen before from this series. There's always been full nudity here and there but they really ramped it up a notch this time around.There are a number of new faces, including a female in the group this time around. Sadly not many of these newbies added much to the product. The had the odd moment here and there but mostly they weren't given a lot to do and just found themselves just standing around commenting on other's stunts.The clips are pretty hit and miss. There are some classics in the mix, but there are also some that probably shouldn't have made the final cut as well. The opening and closing sequences were surprisingly dull and unmemorable I'm sad to say.When it's good 'Jackass Forever' will have the entire cinema in stitches though, and while it couldn't come close to the consistent magic that 'Jackass Number Two' managed all those years back, it is still a very good time. If this is the last we ever see of this group then they can hang their heads up high. 8/10.",False
3,7,Another One Will Kill Them,damianphelps,n/a,16/08/2025,"The originals ain't gettin any younger so its a smart move that they brought in some new recruits. A couple of them are duds but most of them were pretty good.Its as funny as all the other movies with most of the stunts providing entertainment, not high end but totally funny.I laughed more than I thought I would and cringed nearly as much :)",False
4,6,Not the best entry.,rphanley,n/a,16/08/2025,Recycled bits and lots of dicks. Nothing really new just more of the same. I feel like some of the guys knew what was about to happen to them at times and they just played along. It had its moments but its not the same without the entire crew. They did put something in the end for Ryan which was cool. Overall though it was just ok.,False
5,6,"I'll watch it again, and again. But it still doesn't feel like Jackass",jordanrgs,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll keep this short. Its a great film staring most of the Jackass cast, but lacks the chemistry of the previous installments. I chalk this up mainly to the presence of the new and mostly dull cast members. My favorite bit was the treadmill scene, and I think its because Bam was still there, and it was also the original cast (I didn't even realize bam was left in until I watched that bit for the third time... Maybe its just coincidental that my favorite bit is the one with Bam). The intro was so incredibly dull that it bummed me out before the film even started.On a positive note, its always fun to see what any of the original cast members are up to, and this doesn't disappoint in that aspect. It just doesn't feel quite like the other entries. Without Dunn, Bam, Dicco, Raab, Rake etc, it did not feel the same.",True
6,10,Nostalgia,chris_rowe-881-168820,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly there is a review, the most recent I saw that rips apart the movie for not appealing to everyone, they criticise the writing, story and cinematography and effects, I mean just get a grip, it's a stunt film being nostalgic to a time they all were in the forefront of relevancy in the late nineties.I do not understand why I'm seeing reviews of people surprised or offended, you are the generation of people that are circumcising the world of entertainment and making it a beige nightmare.Not everything is for everyone, pretty early on we work out we have different tastes, I'd much rather see a dude fly off a ramp into a door than a man in a tutu doing ballet for 4 hours but I equally respect both as different but great. That's what people need these days, they harp on about acceptance at every turn but try and kill everything that's different or not to their tastes, we're making changes based off temperamental hypocrites who don't know themselves.The film is as expected, laugh a minute, odd one wasn't funny to me but others laugh so I appreciate again we all react differently. I won't spoil the film but if you like jackass you'll like this, if you like stupid pranks or stunts on YouTube you'll like this, if you come in expecting anything different then you are the problem.As deep as it sounds jackass is a message of a bygone era where stuff was stupid, dangerous and care free, not sterile and woke, they don't care about race or religion they'll smack you in the nuts. The world needs genuine acceptance and that includes entertainment.Thank you for your service guys, absolute legends! I'm glad to see Steve-O has made a real good life for himself.Lastly RIP Ryan, still missed.",False
7,7,Forever and always,LetsReviewThat26,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jack ass have returned after eleven years and really the guys needed a break. Here they hit the ground running as the opening credits is filled with enough explosion and stunts already, and a dragon made from a penis. There are some really great stunts as always. The treadmill band, the human ramp and the furniture store being some of the greats . Of course there's loads of dangerous Ness to eat up and the amount of genitalia here is not to little and not too much. Of course it's clear the guys are getting on and it's really nice to also see new faces that all added their one little bits. RIP ryan and thank you for guys for this it has made my day. So long and I hope the newbies can live up and continue on the great legacy.",False
8,10,You know your gonna have fun!,chambetm,n/a,16/08/2025,"When Jackass 3 came out my son was 12 and I drove to his school and got him out early so we could see it together. 11 years later, he came home from college and we went together today. An absolute blast!",False
9,6,"DIEHARD Jackass fan! But, what a LETDOWN ðŸ˜•",atticus08287,n/a,16/08/2025,"All the previous Jackass movies, are & rated 10/10 in MY book.But, this one (Jackass Forever - AKA 4)...What a complete let down. I knew from the start, it wouldn't be the same without Bam & (RIP ðŸ’”) Dunn.That magical, chemistry, natural hilarity. Was completely MIA.It felt forced, Preston looks like he's sick & just broke my heart that something was missing.4.5 was a BETTER movie, then this one was.It's worth watching, but maybe once. Or once every 7-10yrs.The others, I watch 4-6 times a YEAR.Also, I HATE the new cast.""Poopies""? What a STUPID F'in nickname & he's NOT funny.The ONLY thing/person, that TRULY held this film together. That has the BEST & FUNNIEST parts & shocked me..
Danger Mother F'in Ehren McGhehey!He should have been the TOP billed cast member of this movie! He's normally, more of the background extra type of dude.But, he MADE this movie worth while. Held it together & had the most hilarious scenes!Hats off to you, buddy!",False
10,1,it's boring,efecctor,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's boring and dusgusting, 90 percent of it is about hitting each other in the balls. They've clearly ran out of ideas and can only think of balls.It's also a little bit fake, the reactions are exaggerated and unreal, fake laughs fake hype erc.",False
11,8,Jackass is back,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can't help but love the absolute lunacy of a jackass movie, and this installment is no docent. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, and you'll definitely yell ""oooohhh"" many times.",False
12,7,older,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"The gang is back doing the same dumb sht. Guy! Don't ever change. There are plenty of bat and balls. They've added a girl to the gang. There is a nostalgic post-credit section. The mime-off is the best constructed. The bear is insane. It is the only truly insane section. The bull is the most damaging. This is the modern-day Three Stooges. Like the Stooges, the general public is going to find this repetitive. To be fair, there is only so far that they can take this. I guess they could do more celebrities and general public scenes. For fans, this is never getting old even as the guys get older.",False
13,3,Wildly Overrated,Ktbaron,n/a,16/08/2025,"More of the same. And it got old 10+ years ago. Same ball hitting, same bull stunt, same poop stuff, same semen stunts, etc, etc, etc. You've seen it all before. Nostalgia is the only reason this thing doesn't have a rating of 3 or less.",False
14,7,Cup and Balls Game,southdavid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Twenty years after the first film, for reasons passing all understanding, Johnny Knoxville is still prepared to get hit by a bull, even though it's destroyed him literally every time it's happened. I do think, that this was perhaps my favourite of the Jackass films, for reasons I'll come on to.A series of skits, stunts and practical jokes, the Jackass team (with a couple of exceptions) reunite and bring in some fresh blood (literally) to see how much pain and suffering can be inflicted on a suspecting and willing body.I guess I liked this one best because it did away with some of the aspects of the other films, I didn't retrospectively enjoy so much. It felt less mean spirited, with less stunts being pulled 'on' people (especially the public, which I disliked the most) and more stunts with active participation of the cast. The new cast mix in well, and I don't know whether the plan was to cycle into this new era for Jackass, or just to take some of the pressure off filming this one, but I'd certainly watch more films based on them going forward. There's a cyclical nature to this particular film though, with homages to sketches from the early days featuring heavily and then shown side by side in the end credits.My other issue when rewatching the previous films recently, was the unnecessary distressing of animals as part of it. Though animals are still involved in this one, it does feel like they're added here to do the torturing and there were several comments by the cast and crew, that you can overhear, about not accidentally hitting them whilst trying to get away.Is it high art? No, of course not. And is most of it instantly forgettable? Absolutely, but I remember laughing and squirming quite a bit, and that is all I was looking for.",False
15,6,Really not worth the watch,functioningfine,n/a,16/08/2025,"The worst of the movies. Ball busting and dick smashing. Not really funny when that's 50% of the movie. Some stunts were pretty dumb and added in as a filler. Not sure how another movie was made 10 years after the last. But hey, people seem to have enjoyed it based on other reviews. To each their own.",False
16,9,Had me laughing all the way through.,destiny_west,n/a,16/08/2025,"My daughter is a mad Jackass fan so I went with her to see the new film Jackass Forever. Even though she disagrees with me, I think this is their best film. Sure it is tragically missing Ryan and of course Bam isn't to be seen due to reasons. But I loved every moment of it. I found in the other Jackass films there would be stunts where I would be bored, but this one kept rolling out the good stuff, one after the other.They probably could have changed the title to Jackass Cock Torture. Because there is plenty of that to be seen.I wasn't overly keen on there being a token woman in the crew now. ( I can say that, as I'm a woman) I just don't think its necessary.. why do it? Its not like she fully committed to any major stunts anyway.Regardless, I was not disappointed. I will definitely watch it again.",False
17,7,Bruiising and amusing,neil-476,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJackass ForeverA group of grown men (and a couple of women who don't enter the spirit of the thing to quite the same extent) take part in assorted stunts, japes and practical jokes, many of which are unsavoury and most of which involve actual violence, sometimes graphic, often involving genitalia, and all of which generate hysterical laughter among those members of the ensemble to whom it is not happening. Faeces are involved, bones are broken, blood is drawn, and bruises - many, many bruises - are inflicted. Also contusions.These people have been doing this for 20 years now. And it's still funny. It shouldn't be, but it is.There is much male nudity. The reaction it provokes is usually a need to wince.",True
18,8,"Overall this ""is Just another Jackass movie,"" which is great.",kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jackass Forever (2022) is a movie my wife and I recently saw in theatres. The storyline follows some of our favorite old faces and some new ones in both staged and unexpected shenanigans where they put themselves and their bodies in harms way and we get to see what happens...This movie is directed by Jeff Tremaine (The Dirt) and stars Johnny Knoxville (Bad Grandpa), Steve-O (Game Over, Man), Jason 'Wee Man' AcuÃ±a (Elf-Man), Chris Pontius (Charlie's Angel: Full Throttle) and Ehren McGhehey (All Hell Breaks Loose).I always forget how many exposed penises are in these movies until I watch them again. I seriously never understand how many junk punches someone can take...the poor fellas must be sterile by now. The skits are always fantastic and it was fun seeing them pay tribute to some of their old stunts from both the movies and show while also unleashing some news ones. There's always fantastic creativity in these pictures. I also liked the new cast members.Overall this ""is Just another Jackass movie,"" which is great. I would score this an 8/10 and recommend seeing it for fans of the series.",False
19,7,Funny,jameycraigo,n/a,16/08/2025,It is pretty funny but too much penis. I like jackass for a while. And this one was okay. But be careful if you are taking children. I went to regal and check it out. Check out jackass 4.5. That was pretty cool as well Thank You and that is a honest review.,False
20,2,Least Funny of The Series,pdbordelon,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is easily the least funny of the the Jackass series. There are a few genuine laughs but lot of the magic is gone. The stunts are uninspired and the dynamic isnt the same as it was in previous JA movies. Its not just that they are older. The new cast members aren't funny, Bam and others are missed, but the biggest problem is in the writing. The stunts here are gross and dangerous as usual but overall lack the funny and witty aspects that made JA great. I wound up fast-forwarding through parts of this as the action was either slow or boring.",False
21,9,"Still as crazy as in the beginning, still highly entertaining.",deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's very simple, if you didn't like any Jackass stunts in the past nothing will change here, you will still hate it. On the other hand if you always enjoyed watching the Jackass crew performing the most ridiculous but also hilarious stunts this movie will be right up your alley. I found it amazing they're still up for that kind of stuff. They're all much older and probably have enough money to live twice comfortably, but they still manage to do stunts that look very painful. Looking at the amount of injuries they had with this movie you can only conclude the human body has its boundaries and at one point you will get hurt. But for the viewer it's pure entertainment. I watched it with a big smile on my face, from the first till the last second, and I'm sure a lot of people will have the same experience.",False
22,6,Head to the theater and enjoy it for what it is worth.,TheActionBuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a collector of much memorabilia over the years, the Jackass and Wildboyz shows hold a special spot in my life. It hurts to say that this movie wasn't up to snuff when compared to the others. I still got plenty of laughs, and the new guy Poopies is absolutely hilarious. Go out and support these guys for making a fourth movie, and some good laughs will come with it. 5.8/10.",False
23,1,What a flop,synerthol_yooo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Easily the worst out of all movies they put out,boring to the end,to me this movie wasn't funny at all,unlike the previous ones,I'm glad this is the last Jackass.",False
24,6,Doesn't hold a candle to the last couple movies,scragglywags101,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was great seeing the gang back together, but this was definitely the weakest entry in the series. The pacing felt all off in this one; way longer stunts that didn't really add up to much. Definitely some funny moments and Ehren took an absolute beating, but most others weren't involved in any super physical barring the dick stuff and the bull. The body just don't heal like it used to! The new crew was there for the physical stuff and they did a decent job. Poopies stood out the most to me. It was fine and I'll add it to the collection, but the charisma is wearing off. :(",False
25,7,Jackasstravaganza: Old and New Trying To Stay Relevant,rgkarim,n/a,16/08/2025,"LIKES:QuickIt feels like a show, moves like a show, and works toward just putting as many pranks as possibleThe 90 minutes flew by and it kept the laughs coming for much of the showing I was inSome of the Stunts Were Hilarious:When they pull their creativity together, Knoxville and the gang make some insane stunts that are a laugh riot when they come togetherMy favorite stunts were ethe ones with a little surprise thrown in, or threw the players for a loopThe ones that brought fun commentary, or a theatrical set up, were the ones that were the cleverest for me.Props to them for taking on some of the stunts and following through, for that take fortitude, bravery, and dedicationOld and New:If you've grown up with the series and enjoy the cast, you'll be pleased with the involvement of the classics facing the gauntlet of challengesSome of the new players knock it out of the park and are at home in the franchise primarily Zach Holmes is the one I enjoyed the most.The torch is being passed well and showing the promise of the two of them coming together and the brotherhood still feels strong as ever-Did need more time with the group and hear their stories for inclusion.DISLIKES:Some of the New Cast Is MehThey have not grown into the roles for me and take a new dynamic that feels a little forced and blandTheir commentary and attitudes don't fit to the others and are a bit too in your face for my likingThe skit they were in felt a little simplified and boring, and we had less time interacting with them and their personalitiesPredictable Pranks diluted the laughsToo much foreshadowing took the laughs a way as the forced acting /dialogue did little to leave me surprisedWhile not everything has been shown, the hyperaggressive advertising has shown a lot of the stunts and took some of the laughs off for meThe forced acting makes you wonder how much is a surprise and how much is just being risky/stupid.The Editing:It feels like an episode of the television and the old way does not feel like it needs to be a movieIts cohesion is lacking and the connection is just gone, making it again feel like a waste in the theater when it could do well at home viewingThe Stunts and Details:The movie is very focused on genitalia and groin humor and focuses too heavily on these stupid and silly stuntsI don't enjoy looking at genitalia in the levels I have and seeing the abuse to them to be cringe worthy and/or sickening at timesThere are some still disgusting moments involving genital fluid that do little tickle my funny bone and yet got a lot more focusThe slow-motion repeats and close ups of these techniques do little to enhance my experience and again held little too much screen timeThe VERDICT:It's tough to grade this movie knowing what the series is all about, but I'll do my best to be fair to the series. Jackass Forever is just doing what it does best, but this time with characters who approaching the danger zone of death and serious injury. If this is your style of movie and entertainment, this movie is going to be a 10 out of 10 for you and worth the investment with a group of friends. After all, it's quick, it's stupid, and it blends old and new for passing the torch on and keeping the franchise alive. However, in regards to a movie, it of course lacks limitations that Knoxville's other movies have held that I enjoyed. The advertising has revealed much of the stunts, the editing feels very lazy and simple, the new characters need more time to grow into, and the stunts/focus on the groin area took time away from the other skits I liked. Overall, the movie is okay, but it could have done just fine on streaming instead of the theater. I found myself enjoying Impractical Jokers more, but their skits are more up my alley and I appreciated the attempt at making the movie feel more like a movie.My scores are:Documentary/Action/Comedy: 7.0
Movie Overall: 4.0.",False

4,4,A documentary from the 90s?,alvareskrull,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately, those polish freedom fighters ran away from the grasp of communist dictatorship to fall on the lap of figures like Pope John Paul II, Lech Walesa and Mario Vargas Llosa. If we were still in 1990, that would be justifiable. But in 2020, 30 years later (!), the movie producers and protagonists only show they still do not understand how our world works. It would be interesting to ask the polish folks to whom did they vote in the recent presidential election. My bet is Trump! Witch is sad, really sad. (A lateral question: What is Edward Norton doing narrating this upside-down fairy tale?)",False
5,9,Stellar! I can't say enough...,joelmcnichol,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a story you might never have heard about if it were not for these dedicated filmmakers. You can feel the devotion and passion for this moment in history told with such skill and attention to detail that you can't look away. There aren't many films where I have felt right there in midst of a journey with the heros of the story but this one knocks it out of the park; this is a stellar film!,False
6,10,Action packed yet also historical and educational,worldtraveler-36637,n/a,16/08/2025,"Exceptional documentary! Very well done, with a unique and powerful blend between action (whitewater rafting, kayaking, exploration) as well as historic aspects of Poland during the Soviet era with Russian communist control over the country.There's also an element of discovery and exploration of Peru, the Colca canyon, and the expedition's high stakes. A tale of adventure, danger, and survival brought together with great story telling. Highly recommend watching this one, as there's lots to learn and see.Will be great to see more films from this team who produced this documentary, looking forward to it!",False

10,10,"Engrossing film blending adventure, culture, and history - would watch again",narekfuture,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film captures a unique and exciting story that may have otherwise been lost and forgotten!Godspeed, Los Polacos tracks the story of 5 Polish adventurers who during the Soviet Union used white-water kayakers to escape their otherwise drab existence in Communist Poland.The archival footage, presentation, and music were on point and new to me. And very engaging.The stories of these individuals and their struggle to escape Poland and explore the raging rivers of the West were countless and incredible. All the twists and turns were coupled with historic events ranging from the Solidarity Movement, John Paul II, and the Peruvian Civil War.I learned a ton, while really enjoying the film, and experiencing thrills as this unlikely group challenged the world's most challenging rivers, risking their lives in the process.Highly recommended if you're looking for a film off the beaten path.",True

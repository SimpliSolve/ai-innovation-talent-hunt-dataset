1,10,Beautiful film by Dirk Braun,jwheeler-06359,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a beautifully-filmed story of the Grumman Albatross and of a by-gone era that is magically brought to life. The footage is incredible and the interviews with people with first-hand experiences make it compelling. The filming is extraordinary - kudos to Dirk Braun for his vision and expertise. This is an elegant film that should inspire others to dream. There is a fascinating mix of historical footage with breath-taking scenes of oceans and beaches. Mr. Braun has the ability to immerse you in the 1930's and bring you to the present in a very artistic way. This film will stay with you for a long time after watching it.,False
2,10,A beautiful,imdbfan-690896,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had the privilege of watching The Flying Boat on the big screen, and I'm so glad I did;
While Braun's film centers around a specific aircraft, the story gives way to his stunning visual aesthetic, both in cinematography and color treatment - there are many awe-inspiring visual moments. His deep appreciation for the community, lifestyle, and STYLE surrounding a vanishing craft (no pun intended) is coming across in the most beautiful way. This film feels like a labor of love, of the aircraft, and of filmmaking itself.The whole thing left me with warmth, nostalgia, and some introspection over a disappearing world.Totally recommend - 10/10.",False
3,10,Absolutely a must see movie!,TylerM-64,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was very excited about this documentary from the very first time I saw the trailer for the film. I bought the dvd version as soon as it was available. I saw the possibilities available for pre screenings but was never in the right place. I have to saw the movie does not disappoint!!! It is awesome!!!! The documentary features the infamous Grumman Albatross, a rare type of seaplane known as a flying boat, of which only a few remain. The way the movie uses historical footage plus the combination of the original modern footage is amazing. Never before seen / heard stories from the interviews of actual owners and operators of the Grumman Albatross is an absolute amazing insight to the history of the infamous seaplane. It is absolutely a must see. Now it's even easier to watch since it's been added to streaming platforms.",False
4,10,My Favorite Movie About My Favorite Airplane,BillyJ-04,n/a,15/08/2025,"Truly a cinematic masterpiece about such a unique airplane and those who care about them. Thank you for bringing it to a broader audience for other people to enjoy, and appreciate the dedication it takes to keep these aircraft up and going. It helps people appreciate the mission these aircraft held when they were built. As well as the time and effort it takes to keep them going. It's not just about the time it takes to keep them going, but the money, dedication and most importantly the passion for these aircraft. Without the passion of the owners it would be impossible to keep these aircraft up and going.",False
5,10,When boats flew...Flying Boat film,LauraS-9805,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a beautiful movie for all those who love the flying boats. It is reminiscent of a bygone era when aviation was young and adventurous. The cinematography is beautiful. So glad that Dirk Braun had the vision and time to do this. I followed his Instagram page for a couple of years, waiting anxiously for the film ti be released. I was not disappointed, and neither will anyone who loves these aircraft. So glad he was able to resurrect the ones that were already sitting in the boneyard in Arizona. I live near the old Pan Am seaplane base in Coconut Grove, and can only imagine how beautiful it must've been with these aircraft. Highly recommend this beautiful film.",False
6,9,Absolutely wonderful,JaysonH-31,n/a,15/08/2025,One of the best films I have seen in a long time. As an aviation enthusiasts I would strongly recommend. This film made me want a albatros even more than I do on a daily basis. To see this wonderful machine and the guys with is brings back a nostalgia for in my opinion a better and simpler time where a real adventure was still a possibility. The filming of this is something astonishing in it's self. To be able to command such attention and capture such a beautiful machine is in its on a worthwhile watch. I'm giving this film a 9/10 mainly because I don't believe anything is perfect. But I can tell you. I am watching this again this coming weekend with my girlfriend and my cousins while we are at the lake.,False
7,10,Incredible doco about an amazing aircraft,NeilS-782,n/a,15/08/2025,"A we'll put together film showing the re-birth of several of these much loved aircraft. The doco brought together multiple stories, weaving them into an incredibly well filmed and captivating presentation. Amazing scenery from the frozen arctic to the white sandy beaches and turquoise waters of the tropics brought together with incredible video photography throughout the film.The film was laced with multiple historical footages, some showing working albatrosses in their former glory, others showing the heyday of the flying boat era.All in all, one of my favourite documentaries and well worth the one hour.",False
8,10,Wonderful revival film of Aircraft and Seaplanes,wellenzeitsurfboards,n/a,15/08/2025,"Flying Boat is a wonderful film. It really showcases the passion and love of aircraft, especially seaplanes. There is a whole world of class and beauty associated with these aircraft, which seems to be all but forgotten, left to decay in lonely airplane graveyards. This film captures the revival of these aircraft. More importantly, it revives the beauty and memories of a unique time in aviation history, when quality was preferred over quantity, imagination was abundant, and exploration was ultimate freedom. Watching this film and hearing the stories and adventurous tales of these aircraft really stokes the imagination. A truly wonderful and inspiring revival film.",False
9,9,I only wish it was longer!,imdbfan-444910,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a wonderful documentary about the lives of the late flying boats after WW2, where adventure and legend are still able to be found. From smuggling in South America to pleasure flights over the coast to living in a ""flying RV"" where every day is a new adventure, Flying Boat offers a glimpse into a world that many thought was long gone.The recent resurgence in the popularity of these majestic flying machines gives me hope that we as a society are rediscovering the beauty and practicality of aircraft that can land on water as well as on land. Perhaps in the near future a new generation of flying boats will be seen taking to the skies, and what a sight that would be!",True

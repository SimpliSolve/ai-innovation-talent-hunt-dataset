The messages of the album came across very well on screen and I was surprised by how well the documentary-style of the behind the curtain aspect was done. A very interesting watch regardless of if you are a fan or not, and overall paced very well if you might be concerned for the running time of the film. I was never bored. The talent working in hand with production as well as her attention to detail has made an excellent film and I will be seeing this again in theaters. Anyone that hasn't experienced the Renaissance are truly in for a treat. The longevity of her career and talent is undeniable both in-person and as a director.",False
2,10,Beyoncé>>>>>>>,jbwh,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all...10, 10, 10! IT was perfection!Bro.... Beyoncé is BUILT DIFFERENT! NO ONE is in her league! She is a once in a lifetime artist. She is like SCARY GOOD!She has so much on her plate and how she juggles her life personal and professional is awe inspiring. No one works as hard as her. Watching this film is like being inside of a body and seeing how everything works. Beyoncé and her team are amazing the way they work together, but Beyoncé being the one the centers it all. I do not envy being the boss of all those of people. She makes it work though. All the behind the scenes with her family is beautiful!The transitions gagged me. Idk if documentaries are eligible for the editing Oscar... if they are, this definitely deserves at least a nomination.The theater cried, cheered and danced the night away!A job well done Beyoncé!",False
3,10,.,gabrielsousaa,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""I have nothing to prove to anyone at this point,"" Beyoncé declares in her new tour documentary, Renaissance. Charting her record-breaking 2023 tour, this film offers an inside-look (written, directed and produced by Beyoncé) at the hive required to build something as extraordinary as those live performances. Because Beyoncé doesn't just put on a show. She puts on the show.It was blamed for the surprise rise in inflation in Sweden back in June. Combined with the equally dominating force of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, the Renaissance shows sent the US economy temporarily surging out of its pandemic slump. Around 2.7 million concertgoers attended Renaissance over the course of five months, while the tour is estimated to have grossed close to half a billion dollars. She's that girl.Beyoncé is supported by all manner of celebrity guests, including fellow pop titan Taylor Swift, who arrives in a sheath of silver. Inside, phones are stowed away in lockbags, while audience members are handed champagne, salted popcorn and Smarties (British chocolate, nice touch). Then, gasps as the woman of the moment (of the year, of the decade!) walks onstage and thanks those who followed her ""formal opulence"" dress code to the letter.""Thank you for coming, thank you for dressing up,"" she says, adding how proud she feels that the film is released on World Aids Day, in honour of her late uncle Jonny. ""Feel free to dance, sing, cry... thank you.""For anyone who doubts the neccessity of a concert film, well, prepare to stand corrected. This isn't just a highlights reel. It's a rare and remarkable look at the staggering, Spielberg-style production that goes into putting on a show like Renaissance.Each two-and-a-half hour event involves myriad costume and set changes, a full troupe of dances, and a setlist spanning the 41-year-old's career to date, from her Destiny's Child days to her surprise 2013 album, Beyoncé, which celebrates its 10-year anniversary in two weeks. Renaissance the album, released last year, pays dazzling homage to the Black and queer pioneers of post-Seventies house and disco while also celebrating her own sexual liberation. Songs such as ""I'm That Girl"" and ""Cuff It"" are delivered in a luxurious murmur, like a big cat stretching its limbs out after a good meal. ""You hate me,"" she purrs on ""Cozy""... ""because you want me.""""When I am performing, I am nothing but free,"" she says in the Renaissance film. ""The goal for this tour is to create a place where everyone is free, and no one is judged. Unique."" Regardless of this, it is impossible to deny that Beyoncé has harnessed a level of perfectionism we rarely see in any art form. Not since Prince has a musician wielded such control over their live show. Whether she's exhibiting vocal gymnastics on ""Dangerously in Love"" or rising into the air on a silver horse while wearing a diamond-encrusted harness (Lady Godiva meets Studio 54), everything appears flawless.To achieve this, production has to be handled with the utmost precision. Beyoncé spent four years working with choreographers, designers, crew, sound engineers, medics, security and caterers in the build-up to the tour's launch in Stockholm, Sweden, on 10 May. ""In order to perform as many times as we perform, we have three stages,"" she explains at one point in the film. ""As one is getting set up, the other two stages are travelling to the next city and getting built."" Watching women and men dangle from harnesses, assembling giant installations and working out complex floor plans, is like watching an entirely new city being built in real time.Beyoncé allows no room for error. Far from painting her as the benevolent queen, Renaissance shows her in all her business and creative glory. She grills her camera crew: why can't they find a wider lense? Even when there are mistakes, she turns them into new triumphs. The sound cuts out: she seizes the opportunity for yet another dramatic outfit change.Once the concert begins, for the audience it's a case of blink-and-you'll-miss-it. Dancers whirl around the stage; a disco ball descends from the rafters; Beyoncé rides in on a lunar rover while her 11-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, dances in front. The tempo and sheer spectacle of it all leaves you breathless. No one compares.",True
4,10,The best concert film I have experienced!,oliverfielding-41700,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beyoncé's 'Renaissance' is not just a concert film; it's a masterclass in performance art. Building on the formidable foundation set by 'Homecoming,' this film elevates every aspect: cinematography, sound design, and insightful documentary footage. Personally, having experienced the Renaissance World Tour live, I can attest that the film authentically captures, and at times, surpasses the concert's brilliance.The sound design is a revelation. Witnessed in IMAX, it's an auditory spectacle. The bass reverberates through your body, while Beyoncé's vocals are a perfect blend of power and warmth. I don't think I've ever head Beyoncé sound better, even in a live setting.What surprised me was the emotional depth in the documentary segments. Unlike previous works, 'Renaissance' delves deep into Beyoncé's familial bonds, the album's inspiration, and the particularly arduous planning and rehearsal phases. It's more than just a behind-the-scenes look; it's a journey into the soul of the project, sharing the spotlight with those who inspired and contributed to this monumental experience.The concert footage is simply breathtaking. Regardless of personal opinions about Beyoncé, her ability to deliver an unmatched live performance is undeniable. The film magnifies this brilliance with its stellar camera work, editing, and sound design. The film rips through concert dates, in Everything Everywhere All At Once style editing, and the fashion explodes onto the screen. So many colours and expert concert lighting, it all just looks and sounds so incredible. It's impossible not to be sucked into this experience.'Renaissance' is a testament to the evolution of concert films, much like Beyoncé has redefined live performance throughout her career. This film is a transformative experience, leaving me as exhilarated as when I attended in person. It's a must-see, not just for fans of Beyoncé, but for anyone who appreciates groundbreaking artistry in music and film.",False

6,8,A Renaissance Of Concert Crafting: Queen Bee Builds the Hive Of Dynamic Delivery:,rgkarim,n/a,15/08/2025,"LIKES:The Sound Quality
-Let's get the obvious out of the way and talk about how the theater really maximizes the sound quality in this experience.-A concert requires this be on point, and Beyonce's guidance did not fail to deliver room shaking bass, engaging beats, and q musical storm that shakes the clothes.-Fantastic editing to make sure every sound stays balanced and heard, beautiful support of her vocals, and these background effects kept me ingrained, illustrating a great use of the art of sound making to the highest quality yet.-To even use a trick about a concert snafu and ingraining that...stellar design and clever tricks that really impressed me.The Camera Angles:
-You want to feel like you are in the concert and experiencing it from every angle? Then again, props to the editing and film crew of this piece.-Renaissance does great things with the guidance of the camera work, constantly moving around to give you the whole stage timed beautifully to help enhance musical number
-Shots of Beyonce's props, key dancing moments and instrument playing, a balance of wide and focused angles, and even crowd views, all achieve a goal of integration that takes this movie to higher levels of concert conversion.-Alongside good filters, high quality imaging, with ingraining a camera phone filming perspective , the movie accomplished for me, an experience that felt like ""I'm there"".The Songs: -I have not been on the tour, nor do I know most of her work outside local radio the last few years, but the concert has a lot of her new edge that other audience members were dancing to.-It's got great power, a live presence that matched the studio recording with clear vocals, and killer stage presence that helps somehow enhance the musical presence of the movie.-So, for fans of her music, you are going to really enjoy what the Queen and her cast, especially her sound engineers, really accomplished much in this regards.The Choreography:
-You may not like the music, you may not like the dancers, but it's going to be hard to not give them props for some insane dance numbers they put on in this show.-The control these people have in their bodies with this strength to pull off these taxing movies was impressive to me A few members had my favorite moves, doing so much with stamina and movement really brought something to the stage just past her singing.-Hip hop and Pop and Lock reign the dominant style for me, but the way they keep the coordination and mood, adjust for the angles, and integrate so much into the performance... quite awesome in helping add that concert atmosphere.The Special Effects:
-While certainly more impressive in person, Beyonce has brought a stellar show of her stage effects to the silver screen
-Laser light show are just the base of this piece, a really cool light effect that does some wicked tricks with the computer screen and the air that would be stellar to see.-Pyrotechnics accomplish much in the way of a contained firework show, helping to give contrast and framing to the impressive props she rides around the stage.-And of course, the massive screen behind her holds character, albeit weird for me, that transitions into some of the coolest stage designs I've seen in a long time. A fine fit of technology with real life effects accomplished much for this reviewer and may be one of the best aspects for theater viewing.The Costumes:
-I can't' say most of the outfits were my cup of tea in terms of sexual prowess. But fI was impressed at the designs holding up to the demanding performances.-Color's are bold, alongside a lot of texture based designs with shiny rhinestones, very silky material, and unique prints that are original, matching the energy of the performance and eye catching.-They hold up well to the demanding moves of the wearers, look great in a lot of the lighting, and match the leader's unique outfit with coordination that I find amazing by the design team.-And as this is a concert film, the editing gives you plenty of time with all styles, transitioning the moment on the show to essentially swap the costumes rapidly as if paper dolls were their canvas.The Editing:
-Another nod from me, the editing accomplishes a lot with the effects to take all the things above and bring them together in a very engaging piece.-The costume tricks alone were impressive, but there was so much more to the film, a logical presentation of shots and elements to make me feel like VIP concert member.-Alongside picking key moments, there was a great combination of the tour, and parts of the nonconcert material, it helps give you this documentary/concert that has personality and tries to give one the ""full"" experience. Only tripping a few points.The Behind The Scenes:
-Perhaps my favorite part of this piece, the behind the scenes was perfect for a geek like me to see how it all comes together to make this giant spectacle.-Construction of the show, the costumes, and the planning took my favorite spot, just seeing so many people coordinating with Beyonce to make this show.-For those who are big on the current movements, you have plenty of praise and representation in this film and even have messages that the queen wants to share that hold the vibes of the concert.-And for those who put the artist on Olympian Goddess level, you'll get more than enough time with her struggles and attitude to the artistry. Some of these, were inspiring for me, primarily seeing the hard work in planning the show and her family history that explains a lot.DISLIKES:Less Editing On Numbers:
-Going to a concert, I like to see the whole song like some artists have done, and this movie cut a fair number of songs midway through their performance.-While some of these were brilliant cuts, some of my favorite songs were interrupted too soon for me and I really wanted to se them to closure and what she could cap them with her magical touch.-If this is a concert movie, I kind of wanted a bit more focus on that, including more time with the band shots that sometimes got lost to the other angles.-In addition, I don't need to see about a fourth of the movie flashing to the fans at the concerts. I get it's about unity, and there is a message, but again, I'm here for the concert numbers, where my audience involvement is my fellow theater attendants.The Beyonce Glorification:
-My favorite behind the scenes stuff is seeing the hard work of this woman and the planning of the show, seeing the strength to balance work and family to A levels.-But past that point, the movie's portrayal of her personal life and pride did little for a regular person like me.The film felt very edited/social media like, highlights, fake phrasing, and very dramatic messaging that does not do much for me, that it took away from the things I was enjoying seeing.-That effect carried over into the background dancers' tales as well, and though the cultural feel is there, the doctoring and dramatic telling just feel a bit too pushed for me.-And of course, if you aren't a fan of the attitude, you aren't going to like some of the aggressive lines used at times, as it's a very big focus on her new persona which is just not what I like about Beyonce.Too Sexualized:
-My concerts of choice are about the music, the dancing, and perhaps not fully on sexual imagery and attitude.-This was not the song list for me, nor the show, with Beyonce's new direction being very aggressive, very big on inviting poses, and lyrics that beat this drum to death.-No shame to anyone who likes this. It's just not the concert experience I particularly like, preferring her previous shows and albums to this show where body, anger, and attitude lyrics are the primary focus.-The message she says is important about loving yourself and pride, but I just felt this movie did not take the best approach to presenting it, going again more PSA than performance.-As the shots showed, the movie was who love her new work and agree whole heartedly with the message, you won't find this a dislike at all, but approaching from a general point, this is again going to be a warning and limitation.The VERDICT:
Another win in the concert experience, Beyonce's Renaissance accomplishes much in the way of documentary with musical concert experience. Sensational effects are the thing that won me over to stay in this long movie, seeing so many great shots of wonderful stage effects that really make a theater the optimum way. To build alongside the performance really was impressive to me, and the constant angle changes and editing really optimize the viewing experience. Throw in a wonderful sound editing to help make sure you get everything, alongside creative choices, and well, it's hard not to give props to the work at hand. Alongside an experience of the behind the scenes, including glimpses into her life, well, the Beyonce fan is easily going to give this a 9 or a 10. For me though, the movie doesn't have the song variety of other concerts, focusing more on aggressive sexualization and other political topics that do little for a reviewer like me. When the glimpses are doctored of her life to sometimes fuel that fire, the concert escapism is lost and a regular Joe like me loses the enjoyment despite the message trying to be conveyed. From all of this, my score is difficult to put, but as I'm going for movie overall vs. Concert personification, the scores are going to vary based on how different the media are:Music/Concert/Documentary: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 5.0.",False
7,10,THE BEST DOCUMENTARY/CONCERT FILM,dkalij,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe ABSOLUTE BEST DOCUMENTARY/CONCERT FILM. I doubted it could top ""homecoming a film by Beyoncé"" but IT DID! She's so vulnerable in this film and even though she is a perfectionist she shows that hard work and being dedicated to her craft is what allowed her to be portrayed that way. I left the theater feeling inspired and even having a deeper admiration for her because she is juggling being a mom, wife, friend, daughter, sister and being the GREATEST LIVING ENTERTAINER ALIVE with so much grace and poise.I also enjoyed her family moments in the film, after all Beyoncé is human lol she's very much relatable. Blue Ivy Carter will be a force to reckon with, I was disheartened to hear that she knew of the nasty comments written about her performance BUT I was so proud she decided to rehearse everyday and get better to prove her haters wrong. She reminded me of a young Beyoncé just eager to learn and get better.",True

12,8,I think I enjoyed the film more than the live concert!,ta-98251,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having attended the Renaissance World Tour in May, I wasn't sure whether I would watch Renaissance: A Film By Beyonce but then I remember how much I enjoyed the Homecoming documentary on Netflix. Not only did I watch it in the end, but I saw it from the balcony of Cineworld's Superscreen which boasts an incredible wall to wall screen, immersive Dolby Atmos sound and two floors which made feel like I was in the a stadium all over again but a little closer and with better sound. This was the perfect screen to soak up a 2 hour and 48 minute spectacle.Firstly, reliving the performances on the big screen was amazing. Viewers feel Beyonce's energy up close and personal as well as that of her dancers, many of whom have become recognisable names and faces over the years. We also see close shots of fan reactions and sometimes see the performance from their vantage point which drives home how mesmeric Beyonce's on screen presence has become. The Renaissance 'tourdrobe' is on full display as we flash between difference performances of the same song which allows the audience to revel in the Beyonce's outstanding wardrobe (Uncle Johnny made it). One of the best things about the 'tourdrobe', is that it's easy to recognise the location you attended based on the outfit Beyonce was wearing, if not the stadium architecture. London was easy to spot! Those who didn't attend live will recognise several outfits from viral clips.Whilst the performances are stunning and worth the admission price, it's the behind the scenes content and commentary from Beyonce that adds the cherry on top without ever feeling that they were taking away from the show. As per usual, Beyonce sweats over each miniscule detail of the show. She praises everybody from the stage crew to the backing dancers, highlighting how important their role is. The is an emotional segment where we witness Blue Ivy's first performance and its aftermath. This is one of many moments that we get to witness between Beyonce and a family member, friend or tour family. Importantly, Beyonce speaks of the motivation and inspiration for the album. A Renaissance, a new beginning where everybody can and should be comfortable in their own skin.This was an entertaining, energetic and insight look into the Renaissance tour.",False

As they were spectacular, visually and audibly. Yet for movie (and the price) I expected more of behind-the-scenes access, as well as for the context and cultural significance that went on the album, more interviews and commentary (with experts, other artists, etc.).Considering it is a 3-hour movie I believe it should've focused more on how the album was created, as well as all the choreography and artistry behind. And only highlight the key performances from the tour.",True
14,5,This one isn't for me,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beyoncé is an interesting singer as while I am not a big fan of hers, I have enjoyed a couple of her songs in the past and some of her movie roles she had done. This documentary explores her Renaissance World Tour and the behind the scenes moments and there are some pretty good camerawork and discussions about the event. Including some gorgeous color presentations and uses of the music and soundtrack that helps to build the narrative and setting. But because I am not emotionally invested with her previous work ""Homecoming"" or ""Black Is King"" and her musical works, I felt both interested and bored watching this.I mentioned there are good discussions explored about the creation of her album and the tour but there are discussions that dragged quite a bit or felt like they went nowhere. With the interviews and guests featured, there are some guests that were interesting but some guests that didn't really impacted the discussions and felt a bit awkward since their discussions and interviews felt a bit cringeworthy and slightly got on my nerves. With the movie being the runtime of 168 minutes, the pacing is pretty uneven and certain scenes felt unnecessary. I understand the heart and passion of what Beyoncé is trying to communicate but I just wasn't emotionally connected with it. I gave this one a watch since I like to give all kinds of movies a chance but just like Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, it's not for me.Overall, Beyoncé is one talented singer and actress/filmmaker but I didn't emotionally connect with the documentary. I do recommend it for Beyoncé fans tho.",False

This movie doesn't just entertain; it inspires and uplifts, leaving an indelible mark on the heart and soul of its audience. Beyoncé proves once again that she's not just a musical icon, but a visionary artist whose talents know no bounds. 'Renaissance' is a must-see for anyone who appreciates the art of storytelling through music and film. It's a celebration of creativity, passion, and the enduring power of art to transform and transcend.",False
21,10,TENS across the board!,tonygmendez,n/a,15/08/2025,"The 'Renaissance' film is an absolute vibe. Seeing Beyoncé's concert live was already a spiritual experience, but this movie takes it to another level. Feeling more inspired and liberated than ever, it's like Queen Bey reached through the screen and ignited a fire of self-acceptance in my soul. The way she champions gay pride in the film makes me feel seen and included, turning the concert into a personal celebration of identity. And can we talk about her work ethic? It's not just inspiring; it's a whole mood. Beyoncé is not just an icon; she's a beacon of empowerment and fierce self-love, and this film captures every fabulous moment. 🌈✨",False
22,10,I ugly cried for nearly 3 hours,latreeselambirth,n/a,15/08/2025,"So many moments made me teary-eyed starting from 5 minutes in. There are so many joyful, sexy, reflective, and celebratory moments coupled with an entire world of lights, colors, fashion, diamonds, bass, and beauty. I felt like a total boss, a diva, a visionary, and a nurturer all in one. The entire movie audience was interactive throughout, which made us feel like we were at the concert. People around me sang, danced, cheered, and even swayed their fans. It was definitely a memorable moment! Do yourself a favor and watch if you are a fan of Beyonce or even just a fan of great music. By the time I left, I felt even more inspired to follow my passion.",False
23,7,"Good, Could've Been Great",thatblondude,n/a,15/08/2025,"Oh, the editing team really think they've achieved something astounding here, don't they? And it's not like they didn't have a trillion chances to. Unfortunately, the entire thing feels flat. And for a 170 minute project, this is very equal to a crime.I won't get into the directing efforts because I feel the problem isn't exactly there, even though it is far from being a splendid job. The editing is tasteless, and it's where the main flaw is. Instead of taking us to the vibe of the concert, somehow the film manages to pull us away, so we're left with a lifeless feeling.You're about to jump out of your seat 'cause you know a certain powerful moment of the tour is coming, and when it actually happens, you are left with an empty feeling, thinking to yourself ""well, it was better when someone illegally put together a multicam edit with fan videos on Youtube"".The whole movie structure is a mess, and there's no rhythm whatsoever. To go through the whole thing and not get used to constant and extremely dry transitions from concert to documentary seems awry.The movie obligates you to care way more about the next outfit than what's actually happening on stage, and I was sure that would work beautifully on the screen, but it was just too... messy? Distasteful, even.The sound mixing is full of poor choices. Even some pieces of live vocals were shockingly wrong. Moments when what you're hearing simply doesn't match what you're watching, and while the audience obviously understands it is a collection of different performances, there's no excuse for that on a film.There are some stunning takes and beautiful shots every now and then. The audience sequences are so fun and quite frankly the best part of this film. Some documentary bits bring strength to the project (Blue Ivy's sequence is deeply touching). The fact that it comes from a beautiful tour full of interesting details can't be ignored, it is only not explored in the right way.All in all, it simply doesn't do justice to the excellence that is the Renaissance World Tour, and that is a shame.",False
24,5,Not good if you're not a die hard fan,MovieNinjaGuy,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm pretty open minded when it comes to music so went into this with no expectations. I do know some of Beyonce's older music with Destiny's Child and the likes of her big hits Halo and Single Ladies.The first 10 minutes seemed fine. It is pretty much the start of one of Beyonce's concerts and her excellent vocals are on form. I thought I will enjoy this if the entire near 3 hour film is like this. The only thing I noticed what I thought was weird was the different takes of the same songs edited together, this is clear from the changing of day to night time setting but above all Beyonce's constant wardrobe changes. Fine, I could up with that niggle but it definitely became irritating later on.However then the haphazardness starts. We constantly switch between 10 or so minutes of concert footage and either backstage rehearsal footage or Beyonce reflecting on where she is in her private life (even whilst flying on a private jet - ugh) etc. It does not interest me anywhere near as much as watching what an artist can do best. Maybe as some extra footage on a Blu Ray or a separate documentary this would have been great but intertwining this with concert footage, I'm not sure is a good idea. It didn't work for me. Seeing Beyonce's backstage stuff could be interesting. Maybe as a 10-15 minute intro and after that just present an entire single concertI wanted to get back to the concert every time the backstage / private footage parts were shown...However, that turned out to be disappointing as well. The music became exceptionally monotonous, as if you are in a club all evening. Almost every song appeared to be about sex / I'm a strong female, included twerking and had no live band (I think I saw them on stage for about 5 songs). So we are reduced to listening to samples, many voice intro tracks and I guess a tape for music. I recognised two songs: Partition (not exactly a good song) and probably her biggest early solo hit: Crazy in Love. This is astonishing considering Beyonce's large early back catalogue. But I guess it has been left in the past. Which is a shame.There is also some time spent on a concert power malfunction. Maybe interesting to some but I'm not sure it's relevant.Bringing her 11 year old daughter on stage I think is bizarre considering the quite adult subject matter of Beyonce's music during most of the show. But it's up to her. Just weird seeing her daughter's mother near naked riding (both literally and figurative speaking) a tank like vehicle in the background.Maybe Beyonce feels the need to stay relevant with only doing modern club music and pushing sexual boundaries that she has done for over 20 years. It seems somewhat tiring to me to watch for so long.Now some of the visuals and props are excellent, there is no denying. There is a spectacular show there somewhere. However if it is not firstly and mostly about good music, I simply lose interest and I don't care what spectacle you bring to the table.The music is pretty drab and lacks different textures to say the least.Like where Beyonce is currently at, I had little knowledge of Taylor Swift's recent music as well a few months ago, but I thought her Eras concert film was far more digestible for an average music enthusiast and in fact I ended up watching it several times at the cinema. I also added some of Swift's songs to my music playlists. It says enough. Thus when Beyonce's film came around I thought I'd give it a shot too. But it's very, very different, and not in a good way.I doubt I could sit through Renaissance again. Even the first time felt like too much.I thus cannot recommend this film at all but to the die hard Beyonce fans who like her recent music. They will probably like this a lot, sure.",True
25,10,Renaissance: A by Film Beyonce is a captivating and unique concert experience. An absolute masterpiece and must see.,kevin_robbins,n/a,15/08/2025,"My wife and I attended Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé (2023) in theaters last night. The film delves into the meaning of Renaissance, the intricacies of assembling the tour, influences from Beyoncé's past evident in the concert, aspects of her life (past and present), and, naturally, the tour itself.Written and directed by Beyoncé Knowles herself, the film features cameos by Jay Z, Kelly Rowland, Diana Ross, Kendrick Lamar, Blue Ivy Carter, Michelle Williams, Megan Thee Stallion, Tina Knowles, and Matthew Knowles.This film is a meticulous exploration of details, emphasizing the effort behind a world tour, the impact of family on her artistry, the complexities of her current family life, and her evolving state of mind. Beyoncé effectively highlights various tour outfits, performance venues, and audience reactions, incorporating concert segments, docuseries elements, and almost music video-like scenes. Notably, there's a potential new song to wrap things up. 👀. Everything about this movie is perfect.In conclusion, Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé is a captivating and elite concert film, offering a unique viewing experience. I would give it a perfect score of 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",False

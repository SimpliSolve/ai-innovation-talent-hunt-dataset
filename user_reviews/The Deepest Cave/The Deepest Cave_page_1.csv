1,6,"Very interesting, but not very engaging.",alanrife1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The director of the film states that sometimes his films need a storyline crafted, while this adventure doesn't need one because it is a constant state of exploration. I understand what he is saying but, it does need more storyline. Otherwise, this was an incredible look in at a place none of us will ever venture to. I'll watch as many of these as are made for that reason alone.",False
2,10,Great but....,njpowell-99432,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think the movie was very interesting and I enjoyed it. The one thing that got to me was that it seemed a bit of a s*** deal that the expedition leader's so-called ""superstars"" doing all the hard work and finding all that new ground, right as they were going to break records for him to then just send them back up to the base camp!? I don't know caves, I thought perhaps it may have been due to the time spent down in the cave but they were young lads and were excited, i presume the director making the film who was with the main guys at the start was still down there when they made the final climb so why not the big guns?? All of a sudden there were numerous different cave'rs but not the guys who originally did all the hard work and it just didn't sit right with me and it seemed unfair the guys were gutted. Like I say I know 0 about caving so the leader no doubt had his reasons it just felt unfair. I thought any feedback is good feedback on how the movie looks to the viewer.",True
3,3,Not enough cave.,sarahgossett,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of those documentaries that primarily consists of interviews with the team in which they discuss their emotions about various aspects of the expedition. Heartwarming bios of team members are given. Tense moments occur, and then when obstacles are overcome we are treated to shots of the team standing around pumping their fists and saying ""WOO!"" We the audience know to be impressed by something in the cave when one of the team members breathlessly informs us that it is ""cool"" or ""awesome.""Sadly, though, not much actual cave is featured. It is more of a backdrop for human achievement.",False

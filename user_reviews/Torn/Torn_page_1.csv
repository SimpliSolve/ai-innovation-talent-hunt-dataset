1,7,A story about love,Jimmy_JimJim,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is more a movie about love than one about alpinism (for that, you'd want to watch Meru, also features Conrad Anker). As far as a love story goes, this one is quite original. It is emotionally complex, yet delicate, so much so that no Hollywood scrptwriter has dared tackle this topic yet, at least not from this angle. This movie is a bit rough on the edges (for instance, it can try to delve deeper in Conrad's psyche) but nonetheless, quite enjoyable to watch.",False
2,6,Sentimental look at life after Alex Lowe,timothy-42295,n/a,15/08/2025,"Meet Alex Lowe, his climbing partners and his family. Get to know the real hero of the Alex Lowe story, Conrad Anker. He did everything Alex could do and couldn't do. Mad respect.",False
3,8,A genuine documentary with real heart and some minor flaws,pdzeller113,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am very invested in the rock climbing scene and knew the Anker/Lowe story from articles, and documentaries of the past so I was very interested to see what the story looked like from the sons of Alex. I loved the heart and authenticity of it. For that, I give it 8 stars
From a technical and story structure aspect, I found it lacking. I greatly respect Max for tackling what is a very deep and personal documentary, but he certainly isn't the most experienced documentarian. Some of the editing was choppy and some of the visuals were used a couple too many times to maintain an air of freshness. The song during the credits is also used during the credits of the Alpinist, just kind of a funny coincidence.I don't want to be harsh in the film by any means. I truly enjoyed it. I give it an 8 for the genuine respect I have for the Lowes and Ankers and the authenticity that was brought to such a hard topic. It fell short of a 10 for me only for film making reasons.",False
4,10,Tissues required!,bmwytng,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mountain climbing isn't the real subject matter here. This is a truly touching, genuine story of friendship, love, tragedy, heartbreak, and recovery. Torn by loss, a new family is bonded together with tenderness, love and care. The fragility and trials of life. Of healing, resilience, and positivity. Tears are inevitable for this one!",False
5,10,A beautiful tribute and a testament of what love can do,mflorenciat,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was not ready for this. Have tissues at hand, you'll need them. Brilliantly directed and written and a truly inspiring.Just beautiful. Well done you all, may this wonderful thing you did bring you more closure.",False
6,7,Good film,qban0124,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed the film but towards the end I really couldn't feel any sympathy for the family. I was sadder for Conrad then Alex's wife and kids. It seems like they resent him but just chose to do a documentary about him because he was ""famous"" and disappeared in an avalanche. There was never any mention of Alex as their ""father"" or ""dad"" he was just always Alex. Of course, this doesn't mean that IS what they feel but that's the vibe I got while watching this because it seemed like the kids were annoyed that this was even going to be a topic.",False
7,10,There are no words...,kennishamblin,n/a,15/08/2025,"I low key am obsessed with mountaineering. I watch any and all documentaries about this lifestyle, more times than not ,sad things go down. Your story, about Alex's story, and your family's story is done so.... I can't even explain it! Loved how it was shot, loved how the raw footage was put in, bravo Max, really enjoyed this, you did your family proud. ‚úåüèº",False
8,7,nice story,toby-82633,n/a,15/08/2025,"A nice story. I'm sure if you live a life that is dangerous and takes you away from your family and kids perhaps you would think otherwise, or at least understand the costs better if it goes south.",False
9,10,Beautiful,torno-26-581842,n/a,15/08/2025,"I remember Alex Lowe well from my subscription to Outside Magazine in the 90s. I used to go to Bozeman to see friends, and skied the slopes of Bridger Bowl several times. This film really brought home the person as well as the mythical scale his legend became. His family had to move through stages of grief more than once. I felt like this was a moving, heartfelt tribute, and a wonderful personal glimpse into this enduring family. Conrad is an honorable and good man for the things he has done and I can't help but think highly of him now, as he became legendary in his own right. In the end this was a film very moving and I was in tears for the last ten or fifteen minutes. Deeply personal, deeply touching, and deeply beautiful.",False
10,7,An honest documentation,DLochner,n/a,15/08/2025,"An honest documentation, with interesting images. Anyone who does not know the deceased will find little access. It's about the life of a mountaineer who died for his dream. Unfortunately, the documentary is very sentimental and emotional at times, which doesn't really help the film's actual message. But the suffering of the bereaved, especially his sons and his wife, is very clear here.",False
11,10,Moved me to tears,jenhaileywales,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just happened upon this title in my Disney+ app and decided to give it a go. It's definitely worth watching, even if you don't know the family story or the details of the patriarch's untimely death. It's beautifully put together and comes across as incredibly genuine. Be ready to grab a box of tissue.",False
12,5,A painful and frustrating portrait of trauma,actonbell,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMany glorious shots of the breathtaking Himalayas make a poignant backdrop for this painful portrait of a traumatized family. An agonizing watch because it's made by the eldest son of Alex Lowe, Max, who doesn't seem able, as a documentarian, to dig deep below the -- sorry -- avalanche of grief and anger that he and his family are still buried under. Many times I thought to myself, ""These people are so locked in."" No one seems to be able to dig very deep into themselves. When Max presses his mother about why she ""fell in love"" with her dead husband's climbing partner three months -- three months! -- after Alex went missing in an avalanche, she just says, ""I was in love."" That's the extent of your insight? Everyone has mask-like expressions, unable to look into themselves, except for Conrad Anker who is heartbreakingly aware of his survivor guilt. Even Max, who was driven to make this film to dig himself out in some way, can't say why he didn't take Conrad's last name when his two younger brothers did. He just says, ""Yeah, I don't know why I did that."" I found myself yelling in my head: ""Because you resented your mother for moving on too quickly! Because you were still traumatized! Because no one in your family is able to process anything and you're unwilling to go along with the weirdly blank, smiling erasure of your mother!"" I often find climbers hard to understand. This gave me a secondary understanding of what it is to be raised in a family who don't or can't seek to understand themselves. As a result, the final images of supposed peace and healing felt forced and scripted. I ache for all of them.",True
13,10,"Brutal, raw, real life",jamesreactive,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerThis film is a wonderful documentary which follows a family broken apart and remade. This is a beautiful tale and it is real. It is an honour to have this story shared with us. Thankyou to the family who have brought this to our screens. This is unlike anything else you can watch.,True
14,10,A beautiful love story,dsb-02142,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a widow, my heart went out to this beautiful family trying to come to grips with the sudden loss of their husband/father. And the struggle of Conrad Anker as the soul survivor and beat friend of Alex Lowe. Beautifully filmed - heartbreaking footage and yet, a positive and hopeful continuation of family.",False
15,10,The most beautiful documentary I've watched in a long time,annamarie1234,n/a,15/08/2025,"The title of this movie was so well chosen. ""Torn"" is every single person in this family from Alex himself (caught between his family and his passion) but also his wife, his three children and Conrad.It was such a special documentary to watch with the footage and documentation from back then and today. Every step of the way was documented. Such a great tribute to Alex Lowe, his family and Conrad Anker.Alex Lowe would surely be proud and what a beautiful legacy to leave one's father.Coming from a patchwork family, I could also really relate to the inner conflict of the different people in the documentary.Sobbed so much at the ending. This movie will stick with me for a while.",False
16,10,I'm Torn...,pamwrva,n/a,15/08/2025,"The love of a family wasn't enough to keep him home. Was he selfish to take such risks as a family man or selfless in giving his life for an adventure. He missed out on so much but I'm sure his last thoughts were of his family. Ultimately his sons were able to give him a proper goodbye.While his wife and best friend moved to quickly in my opinion, it's clear that Conrad filled a void and clearly loved the family. What a wonderful tribute to a man who couldn't be still enough to just be a dad but ultimately was a hero to his kids. I'm sure seeing him one last time brought closure and solace to his family. He missed out on so much but hopefully his soul was able to feel and see it.",False
17,9,Tissues and Love for the Mountains,karsyneverett,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is about moving on from tragedy. Life in the mountains is rugged, dangerous, and remarkable - much like the family in this film. A brutal but beautiful watch.",False
18,10,A special story.....,y-03103,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was somewhat aware of the tragedy and aftermath which forms the backdrop to this moving documentary. Thank you to Max Lowe, friends and family for sharing their experience of a hugely personal circumstance.It was fascinating to hear the different perspectives of the Lowe men on their relationship with Alex - given their ages at the time of his tragic death. As someone who became a father in recent years I do wonder if there could be a epilogue to this story. I don't know if any of the boys have children but one's perspective of one's own parents changes with parenthood. I often think about the time I'm spending with my beautiful babies, time for me which is the most important and special and emotional of my life. But it's time my children will have no memory of even though it will partly form who they become. I would love to hear more from the three thoughtful Lowe men in due course.",False
19,8,Deeply moving climber's portrait by his son,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Torn"" (2021 release; 92 min.) opens, we are in ""Bozeman, Montana"", where Max is reviewing archive materials (videos and slides) about his dad, Alex Lowe, a celebrated climber who perished in an avalanche in the Tibetan Himalayas in 1999. Max was 10 yo at the time. His 2 brothers Isaac and Sam were even younger. We also get to know Conrad, Alex's best friend and climbing partner, who survived that very same avalanche... At this point, we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: the first half of the documentary is what I would call your typical extreme sports documentary, where we witness the exploits, one more jaw-dropping than the other, of Alex and his climbing partner Conrad. I had never heard of either one before seeing this. Then seemingly out of nowhere (at least for me), the documentary takes a major turn and becomes something totally unexpected. I will not mention further details so as not to spoil your viewing experience. All I will say is that the documentary moved me to tears (literally). The documentary benefits from the fact that so much archived footage and slides were available, including of the 1999 deadly avalanche.""Torn"" is currently streaming on Hulu, where I stumbled on it just the other night. This is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a bit too generous, although I will readily confirm that this is very, very good. Whether you are familiar with the Alex Lowe saga or not (as I was), I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
20,10,An incredibly touching story,leslie_mesones,n/a,15/08/2025,"I rate movies all the time but this is the first review I have ever written. I happened on this documentary and was not sure if I would like it. I loved it! Such a sad and yet beautiful story about love, loss, and family. Jenny, Conrad, and the boys suffered an huge loss. At the same time, it brought them together so they could continue life without Alex. As a family. They honored the memory of Alex every day. Conrad had survivors guilt but he was an hero to everyone. It was clearly a tough story to tell so thank you to the family for being vulnerable and sharing with us. It is an incredible documentary!",False

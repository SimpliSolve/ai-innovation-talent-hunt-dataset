1,8,Inspiring,MickyG333,n/a,16/08/2025,"7.6 stars.I felt really warm and fuzzy watching this. Turner had a really rough start in 2023 season. I remember watching a game when they started giving him standing ovations, because me and my dad watch the Phils a lot and we were like, ""wow, the Philly crowd is giving him a standing o, nobody ever does that in Philly. It's almost an unwritten rule for like 60 years or so, who knows, but those fans are the harshest in b-ball, but maybe not so much as they used to be and this time it helped to be nice. Just got done watching the Phillies choke out this season, so they are in the usual form. They have the worst history for championships compared to length of time the team has been around.",False
2,10,It's nice to be nice,spreecm,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an inspirational short story!One man's life revolves around his beloved Phillis baseball team. When the new superstar goes through a really low period on the pitch, rather than jump on the bandwagon of booing and getting on his back,he inspires his city to cheer and make him feel like the superstar he is.He reflects on his own demons and uses that to help inspire his team and his city. You cannot help but smile and will him and the player on.As he tells the camera it's""nice to be nice""and isn't that what everybody would like?When the superstar says thank you at the beginning of the new season you know how much it meant to him too.",False
3,9,"I didn't know what to expect, and I cried happy tears",alexscothern-25708,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't follow baseball or any sport for that matter. But this was a heartwarming reminder that we're all human and we're all more of a family than we think in our daily waking hours. I loved this short and I can't wait to share it with others in order to brighten their day.You can discontinue reading because the rest of my words are fillers, because apparently there's a minimum number of characters needed in order to leave a review. I personally don't think anything more needs to be said than what I already did. I hope you watch The Turnaround and I hope that it inspires you to be nicer more often. Also, don't vote for the hateful and ignorant orange moron. Minimum required amount met. Peace!",False
4,10,What the world needs now...,wemmies-306-317956,n/a,16/08/2025,".. is love, sweet love. Kindness, love, and good energy will change the world instantly. What an amazing short! Fan for life of #7 Trea Turner.The power of social media. The power of kindess. The power of using your support as a whole for humanity. The darkest moment of your life being turned around to ripple effect and change every viewer and participant. Life is a wild ride and I am so thankful to get to witness this short film. It is very simple and basic but drives home the solid point of loving your neighbor as yourself and being an active participant in life to lend a brother a hand when he needs it.Bravo.",False
5,9,Great for a Philly demographic.,psuflyinflag,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Turnaround is a great example of why sports are so bittersweet. There are no storybook endings with Philadelphia teams. The start of the film even directly says it. As someone who grew up around Boston fans in their stretch of fame... sports can be very polarizing. But it's clear that John has a bond with not only his city, not only his team, but the environment and culture of people around him.The Captain is a great centerpiece in which to wrap the narrative around. He was not afraid to open up, and sharing his mental health struggles is never an easy ask. As someone who struggles as well; this movie will be a comfort that I will come back to.Having one director love sports, and the other not care about baseball seemingly made the story easier to digest. Be prepared for blue hues to match the mood. Shots may linger a hair longer than needed, but I think it matches the exasperated tone that has been set.The Turnaround is a well shot and edited short story. I only wish the duration was longer, and (of course) the Phillies produced a happier result. I can only give plaudits, and hope that The Philly Captain, Ben Proudfoot, and Kyle Thrash, continue working together.",True
6,10,Inspirational,barronwoodrow,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really made me think and I always smile
When I see the Philly captain on Adam the Woos videos. What a great guy! He truly is inspirational and shows love in a way we all need to see and do. Thank you Philly Captain for your smile and happiness you bring to others. This is a great doc that is short but carried a great message we all need to hear. Even if you aren't a baseball fan you will like the message and enjoy it and get someone out of it for sure. I know I did.I am a baseball fan but admit not a Philly fan but a fan of great baseball and the Phillies have that for sure. Check this out !!",False
7,10,Go Phillies!,jayradano,n/a,16/08/2025,"Proud of the Captain, been a fan of his on YouTube for a while now and it's really cool to see him reaching new heights. This is how the true Philly fans act and support their teams, 4 for 4 baby. As Philadelphia fans we get a bad stigma that we are all trash and low class people that just wanna fight and drink beer. The Philadelphia sports fan has evolved, we've seen our dads, friends and elders act like that and we decided we aren't gonna be those type of fans anymore. We just love our teams and are very passionate, we don't want to fight opponents or fans, we just want to win and have a good time like the rest of yous! Let this be a good starting point for a change of views of Philadelphia fans from the rest of the nation. Good work Cap and Go Phil's, Flyers, Sixers, and Birds!",False
8,10,Touching ! Made me cry! Love it,lindajmc-23899,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a brief documentary, which I like, about people supporting each other. This is a beautiful documentary with great music. It proves what love can do for a person. Not about baseball as much as it is a heartwarming story about people helping people, showing up for one another. Stewiethe one eyed chihuahua rocks ! Some of the film is from Jon's actual YouTube films, which is well done. Really, watch this flick and feel better about the world. Honestly, this film could have been longer , with more expansion on Jon's YouTube account and how he decided to make the appeal. The photography and music is beautiful. This is a film with many layers. Watch it more than once.",False

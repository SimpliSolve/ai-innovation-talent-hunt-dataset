1,8,Interesting and entertaining documentary. Couldn't believe it was real.,gmuniz-87961,n/a,15/08/2025,"For some reason I decided to watch Spielberg's Catch Me if You Can again a few days ago. Then, just last night, I saw this doc on Hulu, with the subject saying the phrase in the trailer. Had to watch it. Glad I did.Very well made doc about a career criminal and his escapades. The sheer audacity, patience and attention to detail this guy displayed while planning and executing his heists was unbelievable. Had to stop the film and check the internet to make sure this was a real doc and not fiction filmed documentary style.This was also similar to Catch Me in that both protagonists enjoyed embellishing their own already over the top capers. Highly recommended.",False
2,8,Better than expected,Johannesn,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen I saw ""Hulu"", I really didn't think it would be worth watching. But I saw the trailer and found it interesting, so I gave it a try.I must say, I don't understand why people would rate this so low. The dude documented all his crime with a camcorder. This stuff is REAL.But only 11 people have rated it so far, so maybe it's too early to judge.Surely his theft is immoral, but I found it all to be very exciting. And perhaps he shouldn't work for hardcore criminals, but hey, apparently he's back to stealing PlayStations, so he's probably living in San Francisco right about now.I haven't seen something as well documented since Gladbeck: The Hostage Crisis.",True
3,8,This is the stuff that the greatest heist movies are made of. Amazing!,imseeg,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis story is something else and then some! I mean, this would be really a terrific plot for any heist movie, although one would think it wouldnt be believed, because this story is that incredible, but it truly has happened for real!This documentary portrays the life of a young, shy, lonely adopted boy, who out of solitude and insecurities started stealing. First small items from the store, like cigarettes, later on, he invented a ingenius scheme in which he stole electronics from a regular store and then went back (with fake, selfmade receipts) and got money for the items he had stolen from that very store!Imagine that!At a young age he got caught for the first time. Fled from the cops. Got arrested again and was put in an interrogation room, where he crawled into the ceiling and escaped again.And on and on and on.This guy went to become the thief of one the most famous jewel robberies of the eighties. It hit the news worldwide that this incredbily precious jewel was stolen. And why did he do it? For the fun and the thrill of it. How did he do it? It's still a mystery...This guy obviously is a compulsive thief. From a young age on, he compensated his lonely, insecure life, with the thrill of stealing. A good part of this documentary is about his youth and about his insecurities. His mother is being interviewed as well and she is often in tears about the dangers her son went through, when he was on a stealing rampage, which ultimately got him caught in dealings with really dangerous violent criminals, which became his downfall.This once so shy andlonely nerd went on to become one of the most famous master thieves in history.What a story! This plot beats many popular heist movies. Incredible true story!",True
4,6,"Title: ""The Jewel Thief"" ( A Tantalizing Tale of Crime and Consequences",doyler79,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""The Jewel Thief"" is a Hulu original documentary that delves into the life of Gerald Blanchard, a seasoned robber whose criminal escapades spanned several decades. The film's runtime of 100 minutes begins with an extended focus on Blanchard's criminal evolution, painting his rise to infamy in a somewhat innocent and even comedic light. Born in Canada and later relocating to Omaha, Nebraska, Blanchard's criminal journey started with robbing electronic stores as a teenager, despite multiple arrests.As the documentary progresses, Blanchard's criminal pursuits escalate, with him infiltrating bank construction sites to meticulously plan ATM heists before the banks even open. His audacity knows no bounds, even managing to escape police custody by navigating through air ducts in an interrogation room.The film's interviews with Blanchard offer a complex portrait of his character. He comes across as entertaining but far from a likable figure. While his upbringing in a single-parent household might suggest a potential link to crime, it's evident that his motivations extended beyond mere poverty. Blanchard, portrayed as somewhat of a ""nerd,"" demonstrated an uncanny talent for robbery.Blanchard's criminal exploits allowed him to lead a life of luxury, including international travel and high-end theft, all of which he flaunted by sending pictures to the detectives pursuing him. The culmination of his criminal career centers on his audacious theft of the Star Empress Sisi, a diamond and pearl jewel from Vienna's Schonbrun Palace. However, the details surrounding this heist remain shrouded in mystery, as the film hints at a parachuting plan that is later debunked.The documentary takes a darker turn as it explores Blanchard's downfall. While his crimes initially appeared non-violent and mostly victimless, his overextension, combined with pressure from organized crime figures, led to lapses in judgment. Blanchard, known by over twenty aliases, inadvertently left a trail when he rented a car under his real name, enabling authorities to wiretap his phone and eventually apprehend him.Director Landon Van Soest employs a mix of humor and suspense to engage viewers in Blanchard's story. However, the film refrains from glorifying its subject, even as Blanchard revels in recounting his escapades while conveniently omitting crucial details. ""The Jewel Thief"" is a well-crafted crime documentary that portrays its protagonist as cunning but falls short of elevating him to the status of an anti-hero.In summary, ""The Jewel Thief"" offers an intriguing exploration of a criminal mastermind, Gerald Blanchard, with an array of ingenious schemes. The film's blend of comedy and suspense keeps the audience engaged, but the lack of glorification and Blanchard's questionable moral character leave it with a score of 6 out of 10.",True
5,7,Despicable Guy,ethanarmstrong79,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Jewel Thief details the criminal exploits of Gerald Blanchard through interviews with police detectives, friends, associates, his mother, and Blanachard himself. He's broadly characterized as clever and ingenious. Nobody is as impressed by his criminal talents as Blanchard himself, as he grins for the camera throughout.Of course, there's no mention of how his aptitude for ripping off banks and electronics stores is measured -- except that he's a prolific thief and only seems to get caught a small percentage of the time. But who is Blanchard outperforming? He's outdone the few sociopaths who would dedicate their life to violating societal trust to the degree Blanachard
proudly did (and may resume doing one day).By the time he's escalated his robberies to blocks of Canadian ATM machines, he's been caught several times. He's fortunate to live in a country which has provided him with a series of trials and errors to educate him on how to get away with theft after theft.He's especially aware of how lenient Canada is, which as he says -- gives him a sense of calculated calm about the risk of punishment. So much for deterrence. Even hijacking a police cruiser and hitting an officer isn't enough to get this parasite locked up for more than a few years. I'm guessing prosecutors had a hard time envisioning a jury convicting such a harmless looking dork.This is not the story of an antihero. This is the story of a soundrel.",True
6,8,O Canada,billcr12,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gerald Blanchard is a diabolical genius who stole millions from Canadian banks and the police there look like a bunch of Keystone Kops.The adopted nerd started his criminal career as a teenager and carried a video camera to chronicle his life of crime.Our neighbors to the north have a laid back criminal justice system, to say the least. Gerald admitted that had he committed the series of thefts in America, he would be serving life in prison.His adoptive mother is interviewed and she rightly points out that the bankers are much worse than her son. His biological father is not wound too tight, and he believes that his boy is just like his dear old dad. Pop claims to be a martial arts expert and I believe that he may have taken too many blows to the head.Gerald is interviewed throughout the documentary and although he is quite charming, something seems to be missing from this con man.I highly recommend The Jewel Thief.",False
7,4,"Barely, just barely, worth your time.",redbaron-86192,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAnother case of unwarranted notoriety given to a sad, immature criminal, bright enough to perhaps have given something back to society if he had taken a different path. But, as far as the ""mastermind"" aspect is concerned, more is made of his exploits than they deserve and honestly, my wife and I fell asleep halfway through this documentary. The ""mastermind"" apparently uses the same cell phone for months while the wiretap is activated and he so desperately wants attention that he videos his crimes and rents vehicles under his true name.When you watch interviews with his biological father, you can see the apple doesn't fall far from the tree when it comes to delusions of grandeur, LOL. I feel sorriest for his mother.",True
8,10,Brilliant. This will be an amazing movie one day.,WHATEVEREST,n/a,15/08/2025,"I haven't seen a documentary this good with such an unbelievably ridiculous over the top, never in a million years story that is still boggling my mind that it all happened for real.It is a crime this phenomenal story has not been made into a movie yet but now with the release of this perfect documentary detailing the most unbelievable mastermind thief the world has known. It's going to be a bidding war between studios. If Netflix doesn't already have something in the works. Hulu really hit the nail on the head with this one. Everything about this doc. Is exactly how I like a story to unfold. Like a safe being cracked. Or maybe an ATM. NO SPOILERS GO WATCH IT!",False
9,1,A tragic wasted life,jsigurdson-883-591323,n/a,15/08/2025,"A sad story of a talented boy who failed to grow up and evolved into a talented, selfish, angry man-child.The documentary's celebration of a lifetime of lying, cheating and stealing is misguided. The video clips of his adopted mom document the years of pain and heartbreak he caused her.One cannot help but wonder if during his teenaged years, a positive role model in his life might have saved him. He could have been an amazing engineer...Finally, the legal system's treatment of him demonstrates how the legal system contributes to criminal careers / activity.All that talent. Such a waste. Sincerely, JTS.",False
10,10,The Jewel Thief? Good Bad or Ugly?,safeopening,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Jewel Thief is highly entertaining, you gotta like this guys moxie but I have to say the shows producers got the title wrong, One stollen Jewel in a decades long career of Larceny doesn't warrant a title of ""The Jewel Thief"". Maybe if he had stolen the Hope diamond then he would have earned that title ""The Jewel Thief"" But I would have to say the guy is a very likable Rouge and the story is very entertaining. In my humble opinion the bank heists are were his greatest accomplishment aside from getting his story told around the globe, Not easy thing to do! Check it out you will not be disappointed.",False
11,1,Stop Glorifying Criminal,nightringer-76840,n/a,15/08/2025,"Monie industry in US and Europe must stop grorifying criminals, making villains more appealing to the eyes of public.This documentary showed how mesmerizing the main character as a con man and they let him stayed free to bait bigger criminals without catching the guy. Law enforcement looked week and mesmerized by how clever the Blanchard stole millions. I'm not a law enforcer nor I claimed to be knowledgeable about criminal nor law enforcement but it looked to me by reason of catching the big fish terrorist financier, they willing to put a blind eye on what Blanchard had done.They way I see it, if you don't cut the arms of criminal octopus arms, then you empower the criminals.",False
12,8,"a criminal mastermind who could give James Bond a run for his money, minus the suave looks, spy gadgets, world-saving missions, and, well, the charm with the ladies.",blueblazer530,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Jewel Thief"" on Hulu. It's a wild ride through the life and times of Gerald Blanchard, a criminal mastermind who could give James Bond a run for his money, minus the suave looks, spy gadgets, world-saving missions, and, well, the charm with the ladies. But hey, we've got something better-real-life audacious heists!The story unfolds in the picturesque and über-exotic Vienna, Austria, at the Schönbrunn Palace Museum (yes, it's exotic because there's an umlaut in the name). Groovy bass riffs and waka-waka guitar tunes set the stage, with folks on screen marveling at the genius (and sheer audacity) of Blanchard's crimes. Picture this: a parachutist landing on the museum with an umlaut in its name. That's the kind of entrance only a criminal genius can pull off!As the documentary kicks into gear, they don't just throw around the ""greatest criminal mind"" title lightly. You'll see the word ""Mostly"" pop up in serious typewriter font, just to remind us that, well, not everything we're about to hear may be entirely rooted in reality. But who needs reality when we're diving into this rollercoaster of a story?Buckle up, folks; we're about to uncover the origins of this not-so-secret criminal prodigy.",False
13,8,"Fascinating Documentary, Inept Police",keithdt,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDocumentary was among the most interesting I've seen in the past few years, partly because of the story itself and partly from his video taping of early criminal life. 8 instead of 10 because some areas like his early life and scenes of his biological father were given too much time and some areas could have been more fully explored, like the full extent of his crimes, how he became connected to an organized crime figure and the details of his life while he was making tons of money. It also could have been made more clear what the timespan and timeline of these events were.The thing that I kept thinking, after watching it was that the police in specific and the legal system in general were very inept in their handling of this case. They seemed to be following him (including wiretaps) for a long while without arresting him and therefore allowing him to keep committing crimes. Then the sentence he got (and particularly the time actually served which shows up in Wikipedia) when finally caught seems laughable compared to the extent of his crimes, not much more than a poor inner-city person robbing a liquor store for a few hundred dollars might get in the U. S.Also, more info on his post-prison life would seem to have been in order (the only reference I found is that is, or might be, a security consultant). And if there was any psychological evaluation done after his arrest, that would have been interesting, as well as what he thought about his times in prison.",True

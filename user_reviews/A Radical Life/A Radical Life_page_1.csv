1,7,there are no...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"Excuses, that can forgive religious insanity in the world, not even tanias, its a brick of stone that will be heavy to wear for the rest of the life. Extremism is dangerous anyhow, and its the ideal place for narsississtics to grow, based on religion makes the person become doubbledged, and even more venomous, and i, who considers myself as religiously absent and neutral, really hate and worries how the world has become, yet again, growing up at the western part of the iron curtain in the coldwar it gives the same sense of fright. I do not welcome isis warriors coming back to my homecountry after the caliphate where detered, they should take the punishment of their acts where they did their deeds, not coming home crying at the shoulder of mum and dad, cause noone was really physically forced to go into the kaliphatious state in syria, kurdistan and iraq.As a filmproduction i praise the producers for holding back notorious and decapitating crime scenes from the internet and pictorial media that has followed coverage of the isis, it was actually more than enough listening to the radicalisation process as it is.The grumpy old man that i am, thinks we shall all try to live in peace, in a manner that gives each and everyone the possibility to develope, by desciding yourself and not being commanded to do...religious warmongering aint the way to make solutions at any point of life.let the spirit of peace endure and strengthen itself, it doesnt have to be called anything, its just...spirit.",False
2,10,Insight into religious indoctrination,whitneygamboa-16818,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerIt was an insightful retelling of a victimized/marginalized person being manipulated into indoctrination. Tonya made up for her wrongdoings by helping the US in its fight against Isis. She admitted to being wrong and is still paying for it today. I found her strong and she has a sense of dread about her. I am glad she has family in the United States that love and care for her. I would love to know more about her life now. I want to know where John currently is. I felt for her and learned a lot about the dangers of extremism. It reminded me of how cult leaders pick vulnerable people. My husband and I say it's worth the watch.,True
3,9,Excellent actress for the Netflix programme,bzgvjpyc,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw an intelligent person shrouded in intelligent choices that did not finally live up to her dream. The use of luxury living coupled with dream backgrounds in the programme is a typical tactic used to indoctrinate if one also watches the other programme on netflix called Profile.I really got the impression that the monologues were false because when watching the actress who is right handed, her eyes look up and to the right a great deal when recalling what I would consider fictitious or embellished accounts.I would similarly say the fake representation was noticed by the lack of tears when the actress acted emotionally. Her reaction and her demeanour was that of sincere distress and high emotion yet her eyes did not provide the true reflection of her visible distress, it looked rehearsed.If I was to conclude I would say anyone watching and feels sympathy for this actress then they too have been indoctrinated.I hope the FBI are watching her as I don't think we have seen the last of her, would not surprise me to discover she made her husband do what he did. A very manipulative female indeed.I therefore applaud this programme for showing how easy it is to feel for someone if they don't see the signs.",True
4,3,What a load of Sh#t,llaanngg,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI feel sorry 4 the parents of their son. I feel sorry for those boys. I believe that woman is so manipulative. She sold out her family, her husband, her heritage, her honor and her kids, just for a taste of the good life. I have more respect for there father, at least he believed in something, even as horrible as it is, she believes in nothing. She thinks Osama bin laden is a great man, he's was a another false prophet who killed the innocent. Someone like her shouldn't be allowed to raise those kids.She was lying the whole time. I think she might have mental and emotional issues._.................

5,8,Don't listen to the negative reviews,jennirjames,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIgnore the Negative reviews. They could possibly be from other radicals who follow Islam, hate America and Americans and don't want to see anyone find peace and freedom! God bless her and her children & their loving grandparents. Happy they made it out alive and are free from their mentally disturbed father, who did absolutely nothing to make our world a better place. Glad he is no longer on earth to help destroy many innocent lives.I hope you all have the happiest of lives here in America and appreciate all we have to offer and refuse to do what your father did. Find a way to make the world a better place, not hell on earth.I am curious what happened to your family? Sadly, they also had miserable lives and were not able to be a loving family.",True
6,4,A radical ticking timebomb.,m-bach777,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a documentary about a radicalized woman who marries an American ISIS fighter.The film narrative alternates between the woman's confession and recovery, and informative information about ISIS and her husband's links to terror.Her falsehood permeates the documentary, and I have no doubt that she is a potential ""sleeper,"" and could be recruited again by fundamentalist Muslims.In one scene, it is clear that it affects her deeply when Osama Bin Laden is killed. She cannot hide her dislike of ""the Western world"".It is revealing.She is totally untrustworthy and repulsive, and should never be forgiven.She knew what she was getting into.",True

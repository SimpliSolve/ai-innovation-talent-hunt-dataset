1,1,Reporters show a lot of bias in this,Roastedsprouts,n/a,16/08/2025,The first episode that dropped is really ill prepared. To drop something like this before the case is even held in court is inappropriate for Hulu and ABC as there is no verdict and it attempts to skew public perception before a trial is held. The details in this episode aren't presented in an unbiased manner. You can tell the reporters are pushing you as the viewer to feel a certain way about pieces of evidence that have not been tried in court yet. Again inappropriate given this is about an ongoing case and they are trying to make us believe a certain narrative before defense has had an opportunity to present their case. It's really a desperate attempt to get clicks. The reporters made unsubstantiated claims that attempt to do what is essentially a judge/ jury's job in an effort to sway their viewers to Luigi is guilty before even tried by the court of law. Nothing in this episode is really net new and it feels like they got all their research from Twitter. We get it ABC/hulu is desperate to be the first to drop a special about this case but doing it at the sake of journalistic integrity? Pathetic.,False
2,1,Do better,WhatATime8,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yikes, I've never written a review for even a subpar sandwich that gave me food poisoning, and now here I am. ABC studios should be ashamed of themselves, using Perez Hilton as one of the main contributors while also trying to compartmentalize Luigi Mangione and all of his actions. Idk who y'all think you're fooling but this episode of 20/20 ain't it. Perez Hilton can get up there and deem Luigi a privileged good looking guy gone bad until he's blue in the face, but the rest of us aren't buying into this nonsense. Maybe try again and attempt to portray the real narrative from every side, do better.",False
3,1,Shameful agenda,noalygh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did not realize that a propaganda was already groomed and ready to go by these corporate media networks to quickly demonize and vilify a suspect. The killing and arrest happened in LESS THAN 3 WEEKS ago! Discovery has barely begun and now they're fist-shoving this up the public's mind? It looks like the police and prosecutor are having a hard time doing their job so now they're turning to the media to sway public perception instead.It's kind of hilarious seeing them interviewing these ""experts"" who have nothing more to say than convoluted speculations on top of the sliver of details that have been known so far. If these were actually accomplished professionals, they would be busy wrapping up year-end work rather than wasting their time on a fake documentary.Also, it literally cracks me up seeing them put scary true crime music on top of pictures of Luigi eating tater tots at MacDonald's. Like LOL. Producers of this piece really need to get a grip.",False
4,1,Shamefully deceptive,eclark-42183,n/a,16/08/2025,"The reporters show incredible bias towards Luigi and remembering Brian Thompson. Evil people can have a family and children, it makes no difference when they push to have people killed en-masse by preventing health care.These evil corps drain your wallet and prevent you from receiving the life-saving Healthcare that you need. If someone is making billions off of preventing Healthcare, that is money that is not being used to help the people. Brian Thompson and his associates are murderers and I have no sympathy for their demise.It's disgusting the narrative the reporters are pushing. They go on to humanize evil against the whole and turn a blind eye to what they are doing. They fail to understand why everyone is in support of Luigi. Kendrick Lamar was right, the revolution will be televised. Where do you stand?",False

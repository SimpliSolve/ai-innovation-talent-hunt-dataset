3,10,"Phenomenal story of unthinkable courage, authenticity, raw humanity",mgrossman93,n/a,16/08/2025,"Julia Mintz's film is an international treasure. Jews caught in the Nazi onslaught find a way to escape and turn their deep losses into unimaginable courage, persistence, and an unbending will to defeat evil. Hearing directly from this unlikely jewish resistance force of their toughest moments, their most profound losses, and their proudest moments of ingenuity, determination and luck, these forceful fighters show us what miracles look like. This film gives us the privilege of listening and learning first hand from these witnesses (and survivors) of the Nazi regime's horrific actions. We see the best and the worst of humanity at play in this film.",False

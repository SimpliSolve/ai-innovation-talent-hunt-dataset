1,7,Heartwarming and emotional,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Discussions about the harsh realities for women in Iran aren't a brand new subject as many documentaries have been explored before within the past. However, this documentary still remains us about the troubles women face in the Middle Eastern landscape and how they navigate themselves through their troubles and conflicts. Presented with good camerawork and participant discussions, you feel for the individuals going through the conflicts as if you are being in their shoes. Wanting to see them succeed and go through the journeys without turmoil or further troubles.Alongside with some good musical score and presentation, the realism and social aspects are well done. Despite some pacing issues, I did once again, enjoy a good humane experience.",False
2,10,A Remarkable Documentary! Deeply moving and inspiring!,Diromare,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the chance to watch Cutting Through Rocks on the big screen during the DC/DOX Festival in Washington, DC, and it was truly a powerful experience. What stood out to me most was how the documentary carries the depth, suspense, and emotional arc, and it shows how powerful and skillful the directors were. It's no surprise that it's received such high praise, including the Grand Jury Prize for the World Documentary at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.During the directors' post-screening discussion and masterclass, Sara Khaki and Mohammadreza Eyni spoke about the patience and care it took to tell this story honestly and respectfully. According to directors, they spent seven to eight years filming in a rural Iranian village, and that commitment shows in every frame.The film follows the life of a woman who quietly and persistently challenges the patriarchal norms of her community, not with slogans or confrontation, but through her everyday actions.Cutting Through Rocks is both intimate and universal. Though deeply rooted in the specific context of rural Iran, the story resonates far beyond its setting. It speaks to the daily struggles of countless women around the world who face barriers just to claim their most basic rights.This is a deeply moving, beautifully crafted film. Highly recommended.",False

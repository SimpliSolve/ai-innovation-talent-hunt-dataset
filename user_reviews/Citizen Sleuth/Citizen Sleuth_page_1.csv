1,9,A deep dive into personality development from a different perspective,yhcsfttg,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was honored to be able to see the premiere of this movie at the SXSW festival and how the movie began along with the role that Emily played both as the main character and someone who is not a professional actress, journalist, nor a detective but is so passionate about the truth. It was truly fascinating to see how she moved through different obstacles and found so many various approaches to fix things only to end up on square one. I had the chance to talk to her after and getting to know her a little bit better even ascended the role that she portrayed in the movie. Highly recommend this movie if you're looking for an anti-true crime thriller.",True

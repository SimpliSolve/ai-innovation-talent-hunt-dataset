1,9,Absolutely wonderful,TheBigHammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a wonderful documentary.Episode 3 dives deep into the China Mystery surrounding Marco Polo (yes you read that right Marco Polo not the kid game :)). One of the questions explored is why did he never mention the Great Wall during his 24 year odyssey to China? Was he truly the greatest overland explorer? Or the world's biggest liar? It is a monument to mankind's enormous ambition.The film is based on Yamashita's acclaimed book.This is part of Farland Chang docuseries, ""East Meets West"". If you like and enjoy informative, exploratory documentaries you'll enjoy "" The Great Wall"". Thank you to Farland and the team for such a wonderful film.",False

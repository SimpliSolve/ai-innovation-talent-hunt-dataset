1,10,Intriguing documentary about a controversial figure,chimpsparkypants,n/a,16/08/2025,"A thoroughly detailed and honest depiction of a controversial political figure named Nick Fuentes. He is the leader of the ""America First"" political movement which consists of thousands of young Christian men across the country. Fuentes has been banned from virtually every aspect of society in America, despite never committing a crime. The documentary maintains an objective view of Fuentes while he explains his story in great detail. The viewer can discern for themselves by the end whether or not the levels of censorship this man has been put through are justified. Anyone concerned about the current state of free speech in the United States will enjoy this film.",False
2,10,A must see for all Americans,sua_sponte,n/a,16/08/2025,"A timely and rare film that allows the subject to speak for himself. Nick Fuentes, a young cultural and political leader of America First, dares to say what is on his mind. Steeped in irony and audacious humor, Fuentes has what many industry players do not have - authenticity and superior subject-matter command. Gifted at deconstructing complex concepts and articulating modern spiritual ennui, Fuentes amassed a large following and ruthless enemies. The price of his success is unrelenting, arguably illegal, institutional interference under unconstitutional globalism. How does a 23-year old handle such pressure? How many obstacles must be overcome to politically organize? Why is saying ""Christ is King"" an existential threat to the media, banks, and the Biden administration? Why was this film barred from festivals and blacklisted from distributors? Give a gift to yourself and watch this well-made film that beautifully documents one of the most consequential fights of our time.",False
3,1,Inspiring biopic of a neurodivergent LGBTQ latinx boy,Jaden_McNeil,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a young patriot to be accused and treated this way is insane to me. This movie really opened my eyes to how things operate in this country, and how deep-rooted the corruption is. Nick is too young of a guy to have this much pressure on him, happy he finally got to tell his side of the story. It's also pretty telling that this will never be covered on mainstream media but at this point, I'm not really surprised. The cinematography was also on point. Nick is a very well-spoken man and his parents should be proud of him. Very inspiring to see young men fight this hard for this country, gives me great hope. Definitely worth the watch.",False
4,10,A daring film on an inadequately-represented figure,ludofw,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Most Cancelled Man in America goes where most media is afraid to. It's a rarity to see such a controversial figure as Nicholas J. Fuentes covered in film, especially in such a professional manner. The movie is concise, informative, and enjoyable from start to finish. It's a relief to see such a humble and down-to-the-facts relay of the story of Fuentes' persecution by the federal government and large corporations. This film is a great example of free expression, and truly shows the lack of protection of this right in the modern day. Thank God that Mr. Escandon put together such a film in complete good faith in spite of the biases of the mainstream.",False
5,2,Skip!,movieman246,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI came into this with an open mind, having been recomended it by a friend. Let me tell you, don't bother. To call it a ""movie"" is really quite a stretch. It's a short series of interviews.. The characters within are not sympathetic or interesting, they appear to mostly be children and people from the republican party. I can sympathize with having the goverment mistreat you. Most people can, but it happens every day to people who aren't involved in party politics, and don't have an inside track to with republican politicians and donors to fix up their problems. The whole thing seemed rather senseless to me. That is all to say nothing of the camera work, audio mixing, and production in general. I've seen higher production values in college students film productions. Overall there is very little reason to watch this, and I would recomend against it.",True
6,10,A glimpse into the life and trials of an American dissident,zweaver-20586,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching the most canceled man leaves you questioning what freedom means in America. When did it become normal to debank and deplatform people for speech? To place Americans on the no fly list? And to do it to a 23 year old boy with no criminal history.We need oversight on our national security system. Maybe even a complete and total Shutdown until we can figure out what the heck is going on. When did the doj and the fbi start being used as an enforment arm for the establishment? All these questions and more are presented in ""the most canceled man in America""Highly recommend anyone that values free speech and freedom from tyranny watch this documentary. As long as you are willing to go in with an open mind and ready to confront, what some view as, very controversial political opinions. Nick Fuentes is a divisive figure at just 24 as of this review. His view, while shocking, are just as important to protect. If not more so. Freedom of speech requires us to safeguard even the most extreme and unpleasant ideas.So buckle up and get ready. This documentary doesn't pull its punches.",False
7,1,Garbage,eaglesfanintn,n/a,16/08/2025,"A garbage film about a garbage person. If only this fascist could be canceled. They always whine about things that don't happen and make up things to keep others scared and angry.Instead of making a film about someone worthy, they decided to make one about as guy that praises Hitler at rallies. Instead of creating something about a person history will remember, they made a film about an incel that spews hate and appeals to the worst in our society.Not sure how much was spent on this dumpster fire, but whatever it was, it was too much.Don't waste your time on this garbage. Go outside, touch some grass instead.",False
8,10,Inevitable,bobbyauner,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film made me angry and it made me laugh. I'm intrigued by the intensity of the opposition and the perseverance of this young man who confidently speaks of the strength of our nation when we maintain the keen awareness of Christ our King. Watching this documentary inspires me to get involved, convey this urgent message with energetic passion and clarity, and become part of the solution.The world systems attack with the tools of slander and cancellation but nothing can stop a movement whose time has come.Our time is now. America First is inevitable. Nick Fuentes is the only one who can lead the way and they all know it.",False
9,10,A tale of epic government overreach,rcanfield1,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Canadian I found this telling on the power governments in free nations have to destroy a simple persons life simply for speaking thier mind
All of this without even a charge for any criminal aspect.Regardless of the beliefs of the man, the attacks on his basic freedoms are outrageous and it should cause us all concern.In Canada, similar government overreach has been happening by Trudeau. Freezing bank accounts and claiming it an emergency so mother's cannot pay their mortgage and feed their children is just one of many aspects of our free society that has happened.Thanks to the filmmakers for making subject matter like this available.",False
10,10,Surprisingly well done,anders-vinter2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Generally you wouldn't have high expectations for political documentaries centered around a single activist, especially when the federal government is the opposition for the activist. I can think of a handful of documentaries of this sort that really fail to humanize the people involved. They often end up trying to build base-line inauthentic character profiles.But in this film, they don't ever need to 'characterize' this Nick Fuentes guy, because his story actually seems to be genuine. Perhaps it's a charisma thing, but the person appears far more authentic than the average politically-minded activist. He's like a real person, to a degree where I felt it and said, ""Okay this is different."" If this was engineered by Mr. Escandon, then hats off to him.Some of the contents indicate to me that the man is not simply ""cancelled,"" but actively targeted. It is jarring to think that these things could happen to a young guy that has essentially done nothing to deserve it.",False
11,10,A must watch for all Americans,Mateo1087,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well made and captivating film about a controversial young 24 year old who hosts a political show online who has been banned from everything- credit card processors, banks, web hosting services, social media, etc. The censorship has gotten so bad that his bank accounts were seized and he was put on the no fly list! Nick hasn't committed any crimes and his jokes aren't any more offensive than what was commonplace for radio shock jocks just 15 years ago. The film gives a in depth look into the evolution of Fuentes and his career that are much needed, and the film was very fair to Nick. Even if you disagree with his views, the punishment for edgy jokes shouldn't be anywhere near this extreme in a supposed free country. The story of this brave American patriot should be a must watch for everyone.",False
12,10,WATCH NOW!,dinkleberg5510,n/a,16/08/2025,Absolute masterpiece of right wing dissident storytelling. Speaks volumes at the uncontrollable power the federal government has over people who do not share their particular views on everyday subjects. Nicholas J Fuentes is an everyday American speaking against corruption in Washington D. C and has had extremely unfair repercussions thrown at him as consequence. Director hit the nail on the head with this film in the way he captures how many in the right wing of the political spectrum have been mistreated. Watch this movie! You will not be disappointed! Thank you Nick for standing up for each and every American who feels like this but cannot speak up!,False
13,10,A groundbreaking indictment of America's most powerful institutions,foundingfathersdaily,n/a,16/08/2025,"Regardless of your political opinion, The Most Canceled Man in America is an absolute must-watch film. It raises serious questions about the state of America's institutions, and, more specifically, what motivates them to completely isolate a man for simply stating his opinion in a country that supposedly supports free speech - something that The Most Canceled Man in America proves to be an utter falsehood.Left, right, or center, anyone at all interested in politics needs to see this documentary. Because while the most canceled man these days is just one person, this same approach could be applied to every dissident voice in America that refuses to toe the line. Remember that America was built by men critical of those who held the keys to their society.Nicholas J. Fuentes, the subject of this documentary, is cut from that same cloth. And, as you'll see in the film, America's top institutions have conspired to crush him for it.",False
14,10,very interesting and thought- provoking.,nstalls-44171,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed this film, very well made. I didn't know to much about Nick Fuentes before this film and I got to say this Nick Fuentes is a smart, young man. Highly recommend anyone that values free speech and freedom from tyranny watch this documentary. This documentary makes you realize that we are truly living in scary and crazy times. Give this documentary a watch, I highly recommend it. I hope Nick Fuentes get's his money back from the federal government.. Nick Fuentes is really the most canceled man in America. Hopefully we can get this beautiful country back on the right path before it is too late.",False
15,10,"Amazing Film, and great producing!",danamccrossen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film goes into great detail about the difficulties in running opposition to the American regime. Showing a American Conservative trying to fight against the establishment, through this you get to see the great lengths the establishment puts him through to do simple tasks. The film takes a deep dive into what faces anyone who goes against the regime and the American empire. Great interviews, Great Narrating and overall Fantastic Film that with amazing production. I can't wait to share this around with all. This is a must see film for anyone interested in American Politics, or even interested in documentary style films. Fantastic watch highly recommend!",False
16,10,Compelling Documentary,FedCruz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was very surprised how well this documentary was done. Not so much because of Paul Escandon, he is a fine film maker. It's more due to how much I see this young man, Nicholas J Fuentes, being unfairly portrayed by the media and groups who profit from rage clicks. These are the same people who will malign and claim the documentary was too nice to him. To those people I would say that you are getting plenty of that on social media by for profit groups who pretend to be champions of the marginalized as well as main stream media. Why would that be interesting to anyone besides the very people pushing this overreaching censorship in the first place? Your opinion should matter to anyone that is actually a reasonable person? Why exactly?What is far more interesting is why a 24 year old was banned from every major social media platform, banking institution, payment processor, web hosting, was on a federal no fly list and had over 500k in funds removed from his bank account all while committing no crimes. What should be eye opening is how many of your freedoms can be taken away at once for nothing more than having an opinion that the powers that be do not agree with. It could never happen to you right? How confident are you in that idea? How confident will you be in that idea in 15 years? I suspect if things don't change, not very confident at all. This idea that because what you believe seems to fall lock in step with these powers right now absolves you from a tyrannical government in the near future is the most absurd take a person living in this country can have. History will show that you can only be a useful idiot for so long before you also become an inconvenience to this same power. Watch this with an open mind, the implications are far more reaching than your political leanings or personal feelings towards Nick Fuentes.",False
17,10,Must see,vilelive,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once you understand Nick Fuentes's story, you understand a living example of the extent of the banality of the most powerful tyranny that exists today. At 24 years old, Nick has reached the level of exceptionalism of Alex Jones where, because of the accuracy of his claims, he has found himself living an existence outside of the many modern advantages that literally everyone else takes for granted. Just take banking as an example. Imagine not being able to open a bank account in the US. Imagine not being able to even have a burner account on twitter for more than an hour before their systems detect his presence and ban him.Nick is both inspiring, bold and downright entertaining. The least that he is owed is that his story gets told. Directors Escandon and Rink did an amazing job while keeping their film incredibly neutral; they just let the subject of the film express himself.",False
18,10,One of the greatest documentary films ever made,kansaszoomer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Now that's what I call cinema! Wow! Nick Fuentes may be the greatest American to ever live... maybe the greatest man In history. George Washington himself would be proud!I can't wait for more movies starring Nick Fuentes, and created by this wonderful crew of filmmakers.A TIMELESS, INSTANT CLASSIC! This deserves to be in the IMDB Top 250. Maybe even the IMDB Top 100. If there was justice in the world, IMDb Top 25.Great cinematography. I can't express enough how great the cinematography is.I reject bad cinema and kneel at the movie reel of kino. Rare is it that a film moves you both emotionally and physically.",False
19,10,A Scary Eye-Opener,WanderingCritic,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this documentary is incredible and very well-made, it's not easy comprehending the power of the U. S. government and how it can be wielded against political activists for seemingly no reason, other than the views they espouse. A victim of this censorship is far-right political commentator Nicholas J. Fuentes who this documentary specifically covers. Despite the unprecedented censorship brought down on him, the documentary also highlights the resilience of Fuentes and his ""America First"" political movement.As someone who dove into this documentary with an open mind and at first skeptical considering Nick Fuentes's controversial persona, I found myself shocked after finishing it. It's truly scary to think that the U. S. government would blatantly persecute someone for their views since the 1st amendment is a cornerstone of the foundation of America. This documentary is a must see and I highly recommend watching it!",False
20,10,I've never felt so strongly,killah-69391,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fact that a man can be treated in such a way for simply sharing his opinions is just infuriating. You would think if his ideas were so ""wrong"", it would be easy to discredit him. Somehow that's not the case. The only way to silence this man that has never even been charged with any crime, is to have him removed from every internet platform and payment platform available. You literally have BLM supporters walking free and able to use all these services, but that same freedom is not afforded to Nick. If you want to watch a film that will trulyake your blood boil due to injustice, this is it!",False
21,10,Must Watch,JoneJonesJay,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a sobering documentary that I think anyone interested in politics should watch to learn about how the government and institutions work together to silence opinions. The fact the government can do this to an American citizen who hasn't even been accused of a crime is terrifying. Films like these reveal the real problems in our nation. You don't need to agree with Nick to realize the overreach of power that is being used against dissenting opinions is scary. The documentary also explores the extent of banning from private institutions like banks and others. Combined, this terrible power is used to silence people and very few decide to continue speaking out after so much persecution. A look into the life of this man, a world many don't know exist, has been some of the most captivating and entertaining stuff I've seen in a long time.",False
22,10,Thought-provoking and well produced,Flyover_Fan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most Hollywood films these days will depict the USA as the protagonist in the fight against other so-called ""evil"" nations.In particular there is a (now) tired dynamic of ""America good"" and ""Russia bad"" that viewers have all seen before.This film documents a different reality. It shows how some of our pre-conceived notions about how ""other"" world governments will use power to crush dissent can be shown to be happening in our own countries too.You won't see many other films that address this specific subject in such an honest yet introspective way, and probably none at all with the same production level, which is extremely good.",False
23,10,Must Watch,hotdog-62306,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary exposes the incredible career of a highly controversial far right Christian nationalist named Nick Fuentes. Despite committing no crimes and not being charged with any said crimes, Fuentes has been put on a federal no-fly list, and had over 500k seized from his bank account. This is in addition to being banned from most consumer services such as AirBnB and DoorDash, as well as multiple banking services.Whether you agree with Fuentes or not, this documentary exposes just how corrupt the American government has become, and what they can do to those who meaningfully oppose them. Most people are probably not even aware of the extent to which the US government can oppress citizens for any reason.If you are even remotely interested in politics this documentary is a must-watch. The production and content is top notch.",False
24,10,A shocking indictment of mainstream media,sharpblake,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary follows the rise of Nicholas Fuentes and his struggle against censorship. It allows the humanity of a widely demonized figure to shine through. I found myself questioning many of my own preconceived notions of Fuentes' beliefs while watching. Whether one finds Fuentes' views appealing or not, the documentary exposes the hypocrisy of the mainstream media that refused to cover a story highlighting the failings of the liberal democracy they claim to uphold. In particular, it is notable that even mainstream right-wing media chose to ignore the story. This story would align with their espoused beliefs regarding tech censorship and government overreach. This is demonstrated in the willingness of Tucker Carlson to reach out to a banned figure like Andrew Tate after his deplatforming. This begs the question, what is it about Nick Fuentes' views that makes him radioactive for mainstream figures. While it would be easy to point to the stern condemnation from organizations such as Right Wing Watch, Vice, or the ADL, it does not follow that right-wing figures would allow this condemnations to dissuade them from a story that so aligns with their worldview, particularly when these organizations so commonly condemn the figures within mainstream right-wing media themselves. After absorbing this, I have been left with no choice but to reevaluate my own biases. Any documentary that has such a tremendous effect is one worth watching.",False
25,10,I'm Speechless,fanficsubject,n/a,16/08/2025,"If even half of what is shown in this documentary is true, America is not a free country anymore. God Bless this brave young man for challenging the most powerful and evil forces in the world and continuing to tell the truth despite his UNLAWFUL persecution! I'm definitely going to be spreading the word on this doc and making sure as many people see it as possible. Something like this cannot be allowed to go unnoticed by any American who calls himself a patriot. I don't care what your politics are, it is in the interests of NO ONE to allow the federal government of the most powerful country in human history to wield its enormous power unchecked like this. This is corruption, pure and simple! I stand with Nicholas Fuentes!",False

1,6,Decent Documentary,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival""Twice Colonized"" is a documentary about renowned Inuit lawyer Aaju Peter who has led a lifelong fight for the rights of her people. When her youngest son unexpectedly passes away, Aaju embarks on a personal journey to bring her colonizers in both Canada and Denmark to justice. For the most part, this documentary was decent and it's a good exploration study of Aaju Peter.The documentary focuses on her life experiences, motivations, and what kind of person she is and the film does a pretty good job on exploring these concepts. The soundtrack choices were well done and the beautiful camerawork helps to show the landscapes of Greenland and Denmark at the same time.The problems rely on uneven pacing and generic formula on documentary storytelling. Overall, a good once watch.Rating: B-",False
2,5,"interesting story, but not really a doc",ksf-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of aaju peter, who has been fighting for the rights and independence of her inuit people for many years. When her son passes, it becomes even more of a personal journey. Because the inuits were still allowed to hunt seals, there were large protests. And credit to aaju for attending the protest summit in denmark. Trying to educate the public, she explains that this is the only economy and food source available where they live. Aaju is very angry, and cusses freely. It's sometimes hard to watch. They didn't interview the protesters. They didn't interview the ex boyfriend, who she fights with on the cell phone. They don't interview anyone who relocated the inuit children to larger cities to further their education. They didn't interview any of the lawyers they were fighting against. We only hear aaju's side of everything. At sixty seven minutes, they DO have a discussion with someone who explains how and why greenland cultures were absorbed into denmark. And right near the end, she talks about missing indigenous women. What? That came out of left field. It's an interesting story, but not really a documentary. At fifty one minutes, peter summarizes the mission of the film: the problem with cultures being ""being governed by a foreign country"". It's okay. Written and directed by lin alluna and peter. It also didn't get found when i searched for the title in imdb. It's imdb title number tt20521138, if that helps to locate the film.",False
3,7,A postcolonial documentary,saberimohsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a post-colonial documentary about the natives of Northern Europe and Canada, how their language, culture and nationality were lost under the colonialism of industrial countries. This documentary, which centers on the life of Ajo Peter, an Eskew woman and Inuit rights activist, advances Ajo's efforts to create a permanent indigenous association in the European Union, while dealing with her personal and family problems - especially the sudden death of her child. The documentary has a unified and focused narrative and moves forward with the character's present and present; There is no news of interviews with Ajust's friends and companions, and no flashbacks to his past. We get all the information during Ajo's travels, struggles and encounters.",False
4,1,A documentary on narcissism,davehaliva,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is about aaju Peter, from aaju Peters perspective and the directory Who share the same traits of narcissism in different degrees.What is branded as a movie on the horrible colonization on the beautiful inuit People, has nothing to do with anything else than the main character aaju Peter, and the directory adoring her in her own words.. What is tanken from this movie is an insight in how a wounded Child with a victim mindset uses colonization and mistreatment of indiginous People as a new way to stay in the wounded victim mentality, keep attention solely on her and simultainously point fingers. After seing the movies the audience stands left with No more knowledge or understand ING about inuit culture than when they started, and when i raised this to the directory she tried to interlectually proclaim that it was for the Heart and not the head, and if i didnt Like it many other People do, which is basically saying ""if you dont Like the movies you Are wrong!"". Honestly this movie is mostly just to confirm vulnerable narcissism. And with All the injustice and deep People in the world, i suggest to see something worth you while. We are All humans on this earth, we are equal and we have infinite potential, and some identify with different cultures and countries and that is only to be respected, and true history taught. Dont fall for narcissist and see a real movies conveying real problems on the same topic.",False
5,10,"Nuanced, Intimate Storytelling",callocal,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI consider myself fortunate to have seen this film on the opening night of the HotDox festival in Toronto where it met an enthusiastic and engaged audience. If you go to this film with the expectation of some kind of detailed exposition of Inuit culture or the history of colonization of Nunavut or Greenland then perhaps you will be disappointed like one of the early reviewers on IMDB clearly was. While these topics form part of the context for Twice Colonized, it is far more focused on a period in the life of its main subject and co-writer, Inuk lawyer Aaju Peter. From this reviewer's perspective, that is its greatest strength and what makes it so moving rather than a mark against it.The film follows a period in Aaju's life when she is faced with the suicide of her son, sending the film on an emotionally charged trajectory. Aaju is an Inuk originally from Greenland who was sent to Denmark to live with various Danish families as part of Denmark's experimentation with assimilation programs not all that dissimilar from the residential and day schools for Indigenous assimilation in Canada or the 60s scoop where non-Indigenous people were encouraged to adopt Indigenous children based on similar thinking that assimilation would be for their own good. The film begins with a clear intention from Aaju to reconcile herself with this part of her own story, as well as how she was colonized a second time when she left Greenland for Nunavut after being alienated for no longer speaking her mother tongue. But two personal stories are also woven into this narrative: one of a grieving mother who is trying to move on from the traumatic death of her son; and one of a Inuk woman trapped in an abusive relationship with a white man she just can't seem to leave for good. It is the way in which these stories are interwoven that gives this film its power.While many other films grapple with the traumas of settler colonialism, often the focus has been on the most egregious examples like the widespread sexual abuse in the residential schools. The focus on this Danish assimilation experiment brings into focus another aspect of settler colonialism that has received far less attention, perhaps because it is subtle and hard to capture: all of these assimilation policies tried to turn Indigenous people into Europeans and they failed miserably at it, resulting in fractured identities and societies. Rather than lecturing the audience on the immorality of settler colonialism, this film gives us a rare privileged glimpse of the personal, individual struggles that flow from it.Aaju is presented as a complex and conflicted protagonist in this film. There is no resolution of her story in a Hollywood sense of closure. She is a passionate advocate but also someone with a great deal of anger and chaos to work through and the audience is brought into that process. We see the psychological and social impacts of settler colonialism through her as a case study of sorts, but we also follow her efforts to find meaning and direction through her co-writing of the film itself, making it a far more personal journey. In many ways we take part in Aaju's journey to heal as the documentary takes us on an uncertain trajectory that never achieves a tidy, final resolution.You may feel challenged by Aaju's views on settler colonialism but you will never feel preached to. Instead, this is like being invited into an intimate conversation with Aaju that pushes you to feel the grief, confusion, and chaos of what it is like to look for narrative coherence after a twice failed colonization.",True

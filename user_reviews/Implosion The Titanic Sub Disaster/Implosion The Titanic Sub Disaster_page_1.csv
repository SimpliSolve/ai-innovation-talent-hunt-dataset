1,7,You'll Never Get me Down in One of These,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a bit of a white-knuckle ride lover myself, indeed later this year I'm hoping to hook up with a chum who's promised to take me up in his two-seater gyrocopter. I can also remember walking around Tenerife harbour years ago and coming across a ""yellow submarine"" vessel taking passengers for brief underwater trips and wishing I'd gone on it.Maybe not so much now after watching this chilling one-hour BBC documentary on US entrepreuner and inventor Stockton Rush's ambition to build a carbon-fibre submersible capable of exploring the depths of the oceans. His OceanGate company was set up to take anyone willing and able to cough up the $250000 to take the trip down to see at first hand the wreck of the legendary Titanic where it sank in 1912, two and a half miles below the Atlantic Ocean.As we now know, Dive no. 88 ended tragically when the Titan vessel imploded near the bottom of the ocean instantly killing its five passengers, including Rush himself and a British father and his young son. In a programme filled with interviews, that with the wife and mother of the latter goes hardest, as she just about manages to balance her anger at Rush with her deep sorrow for her loss.There's an ongoing official US Coastguard enquiry into the disaster, so that this mini-documentary, which has access to some of the actual witness testimony, somewhat pre-empts the outcome but I personally didn't get the impression that the events leading up to it were presented in a partial way. We get Rush's back-story, that of a clearly ambitious individual, born to wealth but determined to make his own way in the world. Like his family predecessors, it's unsurprising that he looked to bend the great seas to his will, although we do learn that his first interest was actually in space travel.Finally, he completes the design of his prototype mini-sub but there are clear signs along the way that his checks weren't anywhere near as rigorous as such a dangerous enterprise demanded. Past colleagues and employees relate to camera and the official investigation their concerns, especially on the matter of the potentially calamitous lapidation of the carbon-fibre core, although some of these claims are disputed. The centrepiece of the programme is the actual footage of OceanGate's own video feed of the moment catastrophe struck, as we see Rush's wife reacting to the noise of the bang when the implosion occurred, heartbreakingly followed by a delayed message from the Titan vessel indicating things might be okay.In the end this is a tale of one man's extreme hubris blinding him to his duty of care to the unfortunate individuals who put their trust in him. Yes, he too paid his own personal price in the process, but in actively marketing a place on his little ship as the ""safest place on the planet"", he was misguided in the extreme and inflicted lasting heartache on the surviving friends and family of those who sadly perished with him.",False
2,6,So many dots to connect,nika0076,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI followed the search, I remember googling the status and checking if they had been found. This endeavour was not on my radar before the news broke about the missing sub. Hindsight is 20/20 and there were so many cumulative dots to connect, this documentary detailed some of them. Really the carelessness of the whole operation is astounding. Stockton rationalized that innovation gave him a waiver for maintaining safety. But, very much tunnel vision, only one way to do it, fake it till you make it mentally. The first hull failed after 49 ish dives and another was made the same way with same material. And, he knew the whole thing was not golden, since it seems he tried to set-up the company so that it couldn't be sued- does registering the business in the Bahamas give you that? The sub was stored outside in the harsh winter...what?? There was only one sub, how do you run this business with only one? This documentary was overall well done, lots of archived footage of Rush and interviews, I think a lot was left out, just seems you do not get to the circumstances where this happened, without more dependent events. How were many employees so delusional, Rush was not that charismatic?",True
3,7,Ego& Arrogance = Catastrophic Tragedy,trusttheprocessmark,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe moment I saw on the news that contact had been lost with sub, I knew all people in sub died, horribly. This was an amazing interesting documentary. I thought the Josh Gates input was especially chilling, as he knew without any doubt that the sub was a Mickey Mouse operation and was doomed to failure. I felt so bad for the young lady who was made to feel like she was not part of the team and that they insulted her intelligence and observations that something was really, really, wrong and I'm glad she left before the tragedy occurred. She did what she could do, because they just would've said she was an angry, disgruntled ex-employee. A good watch, I recommend.",True
4,6,Interesting but disappointing documentary,julieshotmail,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two years after the OceanGate tragedy gripped the world, HBO finally delivers a polished, official-looking documentary on the implosion that captivated headlines and imaginations. When it happened, the internet became a living archive - I couldn't stop digging, watching, reading. It was morbid, yes, but impossible to ignore. The kind of real-life disaster that lingers, then fades - until something brings it roaring back.This documentary could've been that something.The production is slick, the archival footage gripping - debris fields, deep-sea dives, voices from past expeditions. But the interviews don't land. Some are vague, others feel staged. You're left sensing there's more behind the eyes of the people speaking, and that the truth is hiding just off-camera. The tone leans into drama, and not in the good way. It cheapens the weight of what really happened.There was a story here that needed telling. This version gets close - but never quite reaches the depth.",False
5,6,arrogance,rdmceagles,n/a,16/08/2025,"The arrogance of stockton rush was what doomed the Titan. This man had a lot of money and convinced others that he knew what he was doing when in fact he fired anyone who contradicted him in anyway. He said he didn't want a bunch of ""old white men"" constructing the Titan because he knew better. He used carbon fiber when he was told it most likely wouldn't hold after numerous dives and the people who told him were fired. He claimed to want this to be ""accessible to everyone"" but only if you had the money to do so. In the end he killed 4 people with his arrogance and I for one am happy he was on the Titan when it met its demise.",False
6,6,Worth watching...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of course I am familiar with the tragedy that befell the Titan submersible and those inside it. And thus, when I had the opportunity to watch this 2025 documentary ""Implosion: The Titanic Sub Disaster"", of course I opted to do so.I harbored no expectations to this particular documentary, as I had in effect put the memories of this event so far away in memory that I no longer thought about it. Only by stumbling upon the documentary did my mind get reminded about the implosion and the tragedy. And of course I have my own opinions of Stockton and OceanGate.Writer Gary Lang and director Pamela Gordon put together an insightful documentary that delt with the matter of the implosion in, what I believe to be, a neutral and objective manner. The documentary did put a lot of things out in the open that I was not aware of. But then again, I didn't really closely follow the incident back when it was on the news. I only kept up with in peripherally.Watchable, sure. Informational, sure. The 90 minutes of this documentary were actually well-spent. Not something you watch more than once, though.My rating of ""Implosion: The Titanic Sub Disaster"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",False
7,6,Tells the Story (I Guess),GratefulDom,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary tells the story of OceanGate and the thrill seekers who apparently aren't claustrophobic. How anyone could feel safe locked in a vessel such as that is beyond me. It also brings others who had an obligation to act (but didn't) to the forefront of this strange odyssey. With the exception of Josh Gates and the men and women of the USCG, everyone else who was interviewed seem like they're still hiding details, or just don't have a conscience. They all continue pointing the finger at Stockton, yet they were all part of the team, they just can't accept responsibility.And who on earth was responsible for the on-screen effects? Every time they show a date they immediately rewind it 1, 2 or 3 years. Just show the date as it is, it's extremely annoying.",False
8,7,Will anyone at OceanGate be criminally charged?,Mustang92,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis doc on the subject is well-done. One thing that was a real highlight for insight (that is not in the other doc on the subject that's on Netflix), was the TV Show that was going to do a profile piece on Stockton Rush and his submersible, but backed off after the Host of the show had too many safety concerns with everything and decided it would be dangerous to give OceanGate publicity.At the end, the Coast Guard investigative team come to the conclusion that this was not an accident (of course it wasn't!), but a crime. So, it will be interesting once the final report is released, if it recommends charges against anyone with OceanGate when the disaster happened.I hope charges are recommended. Amber Bay and Phil Brooks should be charged with -- at the very least -- negligence in the deaths of the 5 people. Because unlike others who either resigned from OceanGate or were fired for bringing up issues / safety issues, anyone in a senior management or important position at OceanGate when this happened, should be criminally charged.And Stockton's wife, Wendy Rush, should most definitely be charged with murder (or manslaughter). She's wealthy, so she'd probably escape Justice anyway.",True
9,8,The Posiedon Adventure Under Water,AJP-57,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed watching this. When the rich or the innovators of this world take on tasks which could be dangerous, I applaud them. When they do things for profit that can endanger the public, I'm angered. There was NO REASON for this other than ego. He was already rich and if this venture failed without killing anyone except himself we would understand. In the movie The Poseidon Adventure the company owners want the ship to meet a deadline, despite the captain telling them it was dangerous. Then disaster. This was the same and as one of the former employees referenced, "" The Emperor Has No Clothes On!"" Great Documentary! 2 thumbs up.",False
10,6,Good documentary,Bmore-Hero,n/a,16/08/2025,"Implosion: The Titanic Sub Disaster is a gripping documentary that attempts to delve into one of the most tragic and bizarre maritime incidents in recent history - the catastrophic loss of the Titan submersible. The film deserves credit for its slick production, emotional interviews, and chilling underwater soundscapes that amplify the tension. It offers a strong human element, focusing on the lives of the five victims and their motivations for embarking on such a perilous journey.However, the documentary falls short in several key areas. While it does well recounting the timeline of the disaster, it occasionally veers into sensationalism, leaning too heavily on dramatized speculation instead of sticking to verified facts. Some viewers may find its pacing uneven, with extended sequences that feel padded and repetitive, as if trying to stretch a 45-minute story into a feature-length runtime.Additionally, the film could have dug deeper into the systemic issues that allowed OceanGate's risky practices to go unchecked, instead of lightly brushing over regulatory gaps. Experts are featured, but often in soundbites rather than substantive analysis. The ending leaves you unsettled, not just from the tragedy, but from a sense of incompletion.Ultimately, Implosion is worth watching for its emotional resonance and eerie atmosphere, but it doesn't fully live up to its potential as a comprehensive or investigative documentary. It's a respectful tribute, but not a revelatory one.",False
11,10,institantanious...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMay be some mocking word ill invent after viewing this cutting edge documentary about the submersible titan dives and test dives from alfa till omega. You really feel those angstattacks coming over you like an implosion if you are as old , grumpy and claustrophobic as me when the pops hits you and the lack of control overburdens your senses.Its a backwhipping show about how dangerseeking lone wolves invests and takes part , unflagged for buisiness and legality sakes, doing the experimental dive into the abyss to view the unsinkable ship at the ocean floor, paying a ticket that i must do an honest work of life for six years to apprehend, and the coast guards investigation on the aftermath of this incident.Its a lot of footage never shown that arise from the depths in this documentary, and i would really like to see all of it...till then, my reccomendation is to dim the lights and have a look yourself.An accident should really be documented like it was and is, not much hidden away here. They got the signals after dive 82, but didnt dechiffer the message in the next 5 runs, till the 88th mission beacame a mission impossible.",True
12,5,Focuses too much on Stockton's character instead of technical engineering of Titan,Airman87,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you only loosely followed the headlines of the Titan submersible disaster, you'll probably find some interesting discussions about the delamination and negligence on previous dives leading up to the fatal implosion. If you actively followed and read as much as you could, this documentary offers little new information. One thing that feels left out entirely is technical details about the hull's construction and design. There are videos of the actual Titan hull being wound in carbon, with discussions from the designers who assisted in production of the hull with Stockton - yet that is completely absent from this documentary. Where are those people today and why were they never interviewed by the USCG?The bulk of this documentary focuses on portraying Stockton as a narcissist who ignores all warnings and safety, to parallel the USCG's investigation that inevitably will draw the same conclusion. The interviews don't seem like they're acknowledging the whole truth, or are leaving out certain details. There seems more to the story that we are not being told. Ultimately Stockton may be responsible, but one man was not able to design, build, and operate a submersible sub without the assistance of at least a hundred other people over the last decade. The documentary also leaves out that OceanGate operated other submersibles.This documentary is 90 minutes of ""Stockton bad"", instead of 90 minutes of telling the story beyond Stockton, which is what a lot of people wanted.",False
13,9,Pretty intriguing,jaxsonprice-51032,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I came across this documentary on my HBO Max, the nostalgia of the story of this tragic, horrific incident totally came back to me. It's scary to imagine being down in the darkest depths of the abyss, then you die, never returning to the surface...ever. The documentary does a good job of diving deep into the origins of why this ""Titan"" was created. It definitely unravels a lot of behind the scenes footage of what was going on when they were testing it, the plans the team were deciding on, and deep stories from several eyewitnesses. I feel like there are some places where we as humans don't belong. And places down in the ocean that go to 4,000 meters is one of them. Though exploration in the ocean can be exciting, but there really are dangers to it and there needs to be certain limits I feel like. I get it, the Titanic is still down there, but why do people need to keep going to see it? It's not going anywhere.The documentary teaches how such audacious decisions for the need to go down that deep should sometimes be ill-advised, especially if you're not even sure your own submarine is 100% ready. It also teaches us how pride can go before fall. The ego of Stockton, the main guy, he gets led astray into his own ways of testing the Titan, thinking it's perfect, but unfortunately not coming down to the root of caring about the real concerns and problems.All in all, if you like mysteries or stuff about the ocean perhaps, then this a must watch.",False
14,4,Rushed documentary,BIASED4215,n/a,16/08/2025,"This TV documentary was rushed to compete and be released ahead of Netflix's competing product ""Titan: The Oceangate Disaster"". It focuses on the Coast Guard hearings crew members and lacks key Oceangate people that Netflix snatched first and locked into a contract. Some bad moments are interviewing a diversity hire person that gives no relevant information about the investigation and stock footage of an airplane doing a loop being shown to buy time. And this is in the 60 minutes version. Ouch. The only triumph of this documentary is the exclusive footage of a key moment in the tragedy (and they show it twice).",False
15,3,The faux explorer discusses science (poorly) ...,TTafoni,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why, oh why, use Josh Gates for such an important story to tell. He was found to be a fraud internationally with his Petra 'expose' and comes from a 'ghost-busting' background?! Leave him out of real science and fact-filled documentaries. This is topic of real exploration and discovery packed with technology and science, so why use a renown fraud and tv-commentator to discuss what oceanographers, marine scientists,and physicists addressed with learned and earned knowledge. I liked it but found his scripted commentary to be lacking, and since his fraudulent 'discovery' in Petra, Gates should be retired or put out to pasture by the Discovery Networks ...",False
16,3,Disappointingly produced for a fascinating story,nicklaszlo-99755,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really went in with sincere interest, the story was huge and the whole world sat on the tip of their chair while the tragedy unfolded. Especially because of the fenomenen that still surrounds the titanic and how he scarce information the public had access to, let alone imagining being able to go on a deep sea trip to go and see for yourself.Then here is the story, but everyone perished and now we want to know what happened.The documentary: filled with unnecessary tension, sound effects to dramatize very short cut out pieces of all the interviews made to catch your attention wanting to know the gist of it. But if feels like a constant trailer, building up to nothing, actually taking away the moments you stop breathing for a second because the things you hear are so unbelievable. The documentary is made painfully American, without the genuine story you crave about all the crew members and how this all build up to what it unfortunately became to be.I felt extremely annoyed with all of the forced dramatization and sound effects, the constant cutting of interviews in combination with scenic shot which have nothing to do with what is being said.I longed the story and unfortunately got the ""make this documentary so we can brake the bank"", the story could've told itself and with an artistic take could've been a beautiful tragedy and a learning experience. They absolutely ruined the chance to tell the most important story of deep sea exploration we all longed for.Don't bother and find a YouTuber who put in double the time with no budget but all heart and interest.",False

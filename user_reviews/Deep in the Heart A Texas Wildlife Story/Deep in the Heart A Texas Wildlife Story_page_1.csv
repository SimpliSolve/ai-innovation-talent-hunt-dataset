3,7,Excellent Wildlife Cinematography,stevendbeard,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw Deep in the Heart:A Texas Wildlife Story, narrated by Matthew McConaughey.This is a wildlife documentary about Texas specifically but it pertains to the rest of the world, too. It covers different landscapes of Texas-they show a small picture of Texas in the lower left screen with a star pointing out the area that is being depicted-from the panhandle to the Rio Grande and the Gulf coast to Austin and places in between. Animals range from bison to bats, from mountain lions to ocelots, from bass to alligators. Well, just about any animal you can think of and some you probably didn't know about. The cinematography is excellent and captures the animals in rare shots, including animal/bear traps-the camera crew dismantled the traps so no animals would be harmed-as well as animal on animal action, some within the same species and some are as predators and prey. Water resource conservation and tree restoration is also covered. If you are interested in wildlife and conservationism, there are agencies and web sites listed at the end that you can contact for more info on how to help do your part.It's not rated but has a running time of 1 hour & 41 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD-once was enough-but it would be a good rental.",True
4,10,For More Than Just Texans,clayeewing,n/a,15/08/2025,"Speaking as a multi-generational (5) Texan, with both an agricultural and wildlife background, the only thing I might be critical about this film is the saturation level of the images, and even that won't deduct even a half star.Speaking with the relaxed deliberation for which he's known, Matthew McConaughey sounds as if he's not just on the trails the camera's showing, but these are his own simple-yet-inspired words. The writing fits him perfectly, just as the words follow the line being traced through each region, then used to color in the pictures and bring to life the stories of the land.Or, better yet: The Land.This film--which was shown tonight (7/29/22) in Wimberley's Blue Hole Regional Park as a free movie night--is softly but brutally honest. Not the sanitized Disney version of nature I grew up on; sanitized, no doubt, to protect youthful minds and hearts to the seemingly roughness of Nature. Which seemed to serve only to shock the senses more when, as older children or even adults, we only then discovered the reality of our own history as well as the real workings of the natural world.This narrative tells the story plainly, without frills or needless shills, not leading us into the canyons or across the plains, but walking with us, pointing a knowing finger, nudging the mind to awaken to what is right before our eyes we might not have seen before. This is masterful story telling where we read the credits to find out who are these storytellers.Yes, I mentioned the saturation levels of the film, because Nature needs no help in displaying its beauty. That's not to say the camera work in this film is anything less than profound, the true definition of sublime. As a still photographer of 60 years, what these cinematographers capture here is poetry, art, the real, true and thus, natural beauty of Nature. I was enthralled.See this film. Not just because this is the story of Texas, or in spite of it being that story. See this film because it is the story of America, using Texas as the storyboard. And if it inspires you to protect ourselves by protecting our natural world, then these filmmakers have not just produced art for the sake of art, but for the sake of mankind.",False
5,10,Great film about Texas Conservation,cgfkdxk,n/a,15/08/2025,The film does a great job showing the beauty of Texas that many don't realize even exits. I hope it encourages Texas residents to protect our sacred wild state.,False
6,8,beautiful,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's easy to see why this film was selected for opening night at the 2022 EARTHX Film Festival. Ben Masters' feature length documentary is filled with historical information, geographic differentiations, a timeline of human impact, and some of the most stunning wildlife photography we have ever seen ... and that includes any productions from Disney Nature and National Geographic. And if that weren't enough, the film leaves us with a lesson on the importance of wildlife and nature conservation.Academy Award winner Matthew McConaughey narrates the film, and as a native Texan, his drawl and pacing are in perfect sync with what we see as filmmaker Masters guides us through the various areas of Texas. The opening segment from the high plains of the Panhandle focuses on the history of bison, and how hunting had dwindled the once massive numbers to the point where only five (5, not 500 or 5000) remained. Remarkable conservation efforts have resulted in bison now once again roaming the plains in packs. It's a majestic sight.Time is spent on White Tail Deer, and it's a trip to the south Texas brush country that provides one of the most fascinating segments. Sightings of the ""near mythical"" Ocelots are rare, but here we follow a mother and cub. These gorgeous creatures are photographed up close and in their natural habitat. Despite only a few remaining in the species, we get to see them hunt and prowl. It's quite a treat. Texas wildlife is the focus here, but when the film shifts to the Hill Country, it's water that takes center stage. The state rivers, creeks, and aquifers are highlighted and how, just like many other states, severe drought has had a direct impact on wildlife in Texas.After glimpsing the awe-inspiring views of the Bracken Cave bats, the film takes us to Big Bend country where the top predator roams - the Mountain Lion. By this point, we've learned about the Guadalupe Bass (the Texas state fish) and the piney woods and wetlands of east Texas, so we head to the Gulf and witness an array of colorful birds, and learn of the wildlife swimming the depths of the ocean around and through the coral reefs not far offshore.The visuals here are truly stunning thanks to the innovative work of Director of Photography, Skip Hobbie and a large team of cinematographers. Some of the shots of Ocelots and Mountain Lions leave us gasping, 'how'd they do that?' As beautiful as the film is to look at, it never strays far from the message that humans have the ability to destroy, conserve, and recover wildlife. Examples of each are provided, and that's what sets the film apart from so many nature docs that simply preach. Ben Masters takes a different approach - he shows us the bad that has occurred, the good that helped, and how conserving is a never-ending project, but one that is well worth the effort.Opens in Texas theaters on Friday, June 3, 2022.",False

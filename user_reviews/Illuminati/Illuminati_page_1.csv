1,1,Wikipedia entry read out loud,rhondasmit,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch random documentaries, and often get surprised by learning something or gaining deeper insight. You would think a film titled ""Illuminati"" would be both... and you would be wrong. The film part consists entirely of unrelated scenes, modern, graphics, people with cell phones, some scenery of Bavaria and Germany (somewhat related). This happens while the narrator reads the wikipedia entry out loud. Because I learned nothing from the documentary, I looked at wiki, and it is at the very least heavily plagiarized, or just read straight off. Since the visuals add nothing to the topic, just read the Wiki entry at your leisure, especially since the German names are mangled/mispronounced.",False

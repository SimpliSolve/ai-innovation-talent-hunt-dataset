1,8,My comment to the hate.,justinhygelund,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is going to influence so many lives. For those of you who don't understand that statement, let me explain. No one chooses to be ""different"" but society sets down a strict set of rules that they feel they are entitled to have, causing people like Harper to live a life they never felt alive in. Nothing is more beautiful and freeing then just letting others peacefully be their authentic selves. And if I need to explain what I mean by that as well I will. Being your authentic self means not causing harm to others while doing what you want with your body and soul and that's exactly what Harper is doing here, she's radiating joy because for once in her life she's free to live the life people have forbidden her to live. To be hateful in the face of joy is such a miserable thing, so why don't we watch this documentary and allow the joy of Harper's fresh start consume us. So to all of the comments speaking true to the hate and fear they were taught when their minds were still pure, just stop. It is okay to allow the happiness of others. It won't hurt you to watch this documentary and just for a moment allow yourself to forget all the hate you were taught and be a kid again.Thank you.",False
2,10,A friend is a friend is a friend,ebrown-93885,n/a,16/08/2025,"An intimate and touching portrayal of a decades-long friendship. Will & Harper is a timely, poignant, and often hilarious documentary that delves into the themes of self-acceptance, life in general, and of course how it feels to be trans. Harper & Will are a great comedy duo, and the touching moments between them as they reflect on their years of friendship and Harper's experiences with such honesty and nuance need to be seen.It's a very important movie that I hope a lot of people see - if it just helps even one person be a little gentler with themselves and with others, and a little kinder, then it will have been worth it.",False
3,9,"Land of the free, what a joke - this documentary underlines the hyprocracy",Nyanderc,n/a,16/08/2025,"My first review and not a long one.Great movie about friendship, being who you are and how difficult it is to be, if you are not like the majority.It also shows, that most people are okay with it all, once they meet you and not just hate from home.As a Dane this is a movie about what is right in the world - the friendship and love through acceptance and a deep connection between people.At the same time it shows how broken America is, with all the hate and even laws against people basic rights like who you wanna be or abortion etc.Loved the genuine conduct of Will and Harper, no acting just them.A much watch movie for everyone who either needs to find acceptance or need to understand that it doesn't hurt them, that someone is different.",False
4,n/a,You'll laugh and cry. A must-see documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just saw an early screening of ""Will & Harper"" and went on the ride of a lifetime. It felt like a privilege to go along with these two old friends on a journey of self-discovery and redefining their relationship. Loved every minute of it, all the way through the end credits. You see a new, intimate side to Will Ferrell and learn about an extremely talented and tortured soul who can finally be who they truly are. You wish everyone would watch this movie, because if they do they will definitely have more compassion for the transgender community. Unexpected moments, lovely scenery and great cameos, too.",False
5,7,More about enduring friendship than anything else,steiner-sam,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a buddy road documentary in which one of the buddies is newly trans. The film covers 16 days of travel between New York City and Los Angeles, California in the early 2020s. Will Ferrell's longtime friend from Saturday Night Life days, Andrew Steele, has recently transitioned in his late 50s to Harper Steele. Will and Harper travel through suburban and rural America, discussing Will's response to Harper's decision, including some of Will's questions about Harper's process, as well as Harper's experiences as a trans woman. We meet some of Harper's family and see the reactions of various people, including fans at an Indianapolis Pacers game, a bar in Oklahoma, and a massive steak restaurant in Texas. There are surprises and predictable social media reactions.""Will & Harper"" is more about enduring friendship than anything else. Will Ferrell's celebrity skews the exploration of a trans person's daily life in almost every setting. There were some fascinating conversations--with a trans woman named Dana Graber in Peoria, Illinois (I would be fascinated to learn her background since Graber is a common Mennonite name in an area with numerous Mennonites), with Harper's children and sister, and with a psychologist at the rim of the Grand Canyon. ""Will & Harper"" does advance the reality of trans life in America positively.",False
6,10,"GROUNDBREAKING, POIGNANT AND NEEDED",deborah-99172,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautiful movie. Both lighthearted moments and shattering pain. An exploration of friendship, acceptance (of oneself and of others), and bravery. I'm so glad Will Farrell created this project to help his friend Harper feel at a home in the world rather than shuttered in a house at the edge of our continent.Did I wait the entire movie for a certain theme song? Yes.I could say more and this box seems to want me too, but I think you should experience this film for yourself. It's deeply personal. It explores self-hate, which we all carry in some way. And the powerful antidote of love and connection.",False
7,6,A Missed Opportunity,keikoyoshikawa,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a somewhat disappointing documentary for me.I really wanted to know about how Will's and Harper's friendship changed - or not changed - or is challenged - or not challenged - as a result of Harper's transition.I really wanted to know about their journey together - not just the literal one but also the emotional or philosophical one - during or post transition.Instead, we get a meandering story about a very brief road trip with - in my opinion - mostly a shallow look at their relationship post-change. There were only a few emotional moments.Literally, about half way through the documentary, Will asks Harper about her boobs. I thought it was going to lead to something more deep. But no ... instead, Will asks about bottom surgery.Overall, it was great that Will and Harper remained good friends. But the documentary seems to focus too much on Will at times, and so it was a missed opportunity.",False
8,10,Touching Documentary Of Friendship and Allyship,benlieber,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just saw the premiere. It hasn't sold but oh boy it will. It's well worth a watch when it gets distributed. Saw it with my father who is around Wills age, and who appears to be the target demo for this type of film. He came away with a whole new perspective on trans people and ally-ship. But it isn't so preachy that it will turn off this audience and has equal laughs mixed in with the heartfelt moments of Will and Harper's friendship.Their chemistry together is electric, even at the moments where Will struggles with some of the serious situations and as he tried to treat parts as a comedy act. But this ultimately appears to lead to growth for Will in what it means to be an ally.No doubt some will take issue with Wills levity but it really adds a whole dimension to what happens when a friend comes out. There is an awkward adjustment phase, but in the end the cameras and the situation melt away.My only complaint is that Sundance's program director sucks at Q&A and constantly gets bailed out by talented people like Will and Harper.",False
9,7,The definition of friendship,moonspinner55,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary via Netflix has actor/comedian Will Ferrell setting out on a cross-country trip by car with one of his longest friends, the former Andrew Steele, an Emmy-winning writer for ""Saturday Night Live"" who is now a transgender named Harper Steele. Harper, an aficionado of road trips, is 61-years-old and divorced with two children; she hasn't had bottom-half surgery yet (and has no immediate plans to), but is venturing out into the world for the first time since the pandemic as a female. Ferrell stands by his friend and, if he was thrown for a loop by Harper's emailed revelation, he doesn't show it (he's more concerned than rattled). Say what you will about Ferrell but he's a bold, sassy guy and, when he asks questions of his pal out of plain curiosity, he's also very likable and down-to-earth--the perfect road companion. This moving, funny journey is quite brilliantly filmed by director Josh Greenbaum and cinematographer ZoÃ« White--it's such an intimate film, I wasn't aware of the camera. The US states the duo visit are not where you would normally think to go to find the transgendered or their supporters, and yet friendly strangers open their hearts to Harper (except for a few in the shadows, tweeting hateful things online, and at a Texas steakhouse where the mood quickly turns quietly hostile). Celebrity friends pop up, and it's nice to see them (and hear them: Kristen Wiig composed and performs a nifty end-credits theme song); however, the real stars are Will and Harper. Ferrell, a surprising softie, is simply *there* when he's needed, humorously using his celebrity as the buffer in the room when the atmosphere doesn't feel safe. These two friends are the epitome of besties. *** from ****",False
10,10,Incredibly touching,lynettejackson-15417,n/a,16/08/2025,"My husband and I found this movie to be incredibly heartfelt, and agree it was beautifully done. The topic was approached so artfully, with care and compassion. We didn't realize we could like Will Farrell any more than we already do, but to see his love for his friend, and his own vulnerability was just beautiful. We could all use such a caring, brave friend. Thank you, Harper, for allowing us all in this journey of yours, as we all have so much to learn.We laughed out loud, cried, and then laughed again. This film should be required viewing in high school, as so many.kids could learn and grow from this film.",False
11,7,A great road trip movie with two friends.,Lolarobot,n/a,16/08/2025,"Will and Harper is a beautifully crafted film about two people hitting the road and discovering each other, all while Harper navigates her gender transition. The road-trip format allows the story to explore not just their relationship, but also the complexity of Harper's experience with gender dysphoria. It's a serious, often misunderstood topic, and the film does a commendable job of addressing the confusion and emotional struggles that accompany it, including depression and societal pressure.However, one thing that felt slightly off was how, no matter where they went, the world around them seemed to turn them into a spectacle. This created an unease that, while likely intentional, took away from the potential of portraying the experience more naturally. I would have preferred if the movie had allowed for moments of quiet reflection, without the constant sense of being on display.Despite this, Will and Harper provides important conversations about gender identity, especially in a society where acceptance isn't universal. It also does a great job showcasing the diversity of the American landscape, both geographically and socially. Not everyone Harper encounters is supportive of her journey, which is a reflection of reality, but the film leaves room for hope, showing that even in an uncertain world, it's possible to try for understanding and connection.",False
12,8,Friends,axxmqmcy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was one of those, rainy day, alone at home doing chores so I'll just put something on, watches for me. Several times I found myself stopping to actually pay attention.Although at times it's hard to tell when Ferrell is cry-acting or actually showing genuine emotion, that's either GREAT or TERRIBLE acting, but in either case this was a touching story about a pair of longtime friends essentially developing a new friendship and getting to know one another.I have no trans friends, and to be honest, no real opinion on trans people. What I do have is a firm belief that m m it's YOUR life and so long as it doesn't bring harm to anyone else, you should do what makes you happy.I enjoyed watching Ferrell bring some levity to otherwise very serious moments. I also enjoyed (and respected tremendously) Harper's willingness to be open and share some very personal and intimate feelings and moments.If ur one of these ppl who think trans ppl are somehow causing harm to your 3rd grader (which is ridiculous) then don't bother watching this but otherwise it's a touching portrayal of two lifelong friends coming to terms with the changes in life and how it impacts their friendship. We should all be so lucky to have at least one friend like these two in our lives!",False
13,10,"Just Listen to a person, Harper, who struggled all his/her life with choices he was so afraid to make until She finally Did make those very difficult decisions!",stacyfredenburg-66397,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, Harper's decisions affected everyone she knew & knows & her Family Greatly! You & I Can't say that what she feels isn't Real! Too many people wear blinders & keep their view So Narrowed that they can't see & won't hear that people like her exist and need to go through a change to be what they should be in the first place. They need to be able to exist in society & go through their transition without the fear of harm or worse from blindsided backwards individuals that make their lives miserable.People, mind Your own Business! Be Kind!NONE of us have the right to belittle Anyone or their beliefs or actions they take to strive to be their best! We will never understand what they have been through or why they feel the need to make this change. More Positive Power to All of Them!!!",False
14,6,Kindness is easy.,RubberCanoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"The whole idea of democracy and freedom is based on respect. I respect your freedom and you respect mine. When you respect people you naturally find kindness. This is the core of the documentary and it comes at a time when there is little respect or kindness. It's about friendships, nostalgia and fun. While much of this film on the surface seems like a boring road trip, it's actually revealing and deep conversations with Will asking all the questions everyone is afraid to ask, but how else do we learn? It's educational in the best way possible. The other wonderful thing that stands out is them going through rural America and it's a beautiful experience. It's homey and perfect with a beer and can of Pringles. There are moments of discomfort for Harper and the audience, but everywhere they go there is freedom, respect and kindness.",False
15,10,A Heartfelt Story of Friendship,gregflores23,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you ever wondered what it might look and feel like to have your best friend share a deeply personal secret, look no further. This a beautiful illustration of what it means to be a loving and supportive friend. Kudos to everyone for lifting the veil to let the audience see what true friendship really looks like. Bonus points scored for allowing us to see the real humanity of Will Ferrell, a man who's made his career creating iconic characters. Everything you might love about his most endearing big screen characters is on display while catching a glimpse of who he is as a man. Congrats to Harper on having the courage to share her story. Thankfully, it appears the world might not be as dark and unaccepting.",False
16,6,Wanted to like it ...,reneedhuggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust finished watching this - and I'm saddened and disappointed in the film.Saddened because I do support the LBQT+ community but could not connect to Harper or what she was going through. For such a smart accomplished woman - why did she introduce herself to everyone as transitioning? Give people a chance to meet you and talk for a bit before announcing your personal story?***SPOILER****Disappointed because of the scenes with the ""big fancy dinner"". Felt very awkward that Will went and rented a costume while Harper dressed as herself. Did it imply that Harper was in costume too? That Harper was disguised also - and not her real self?",True
17,10,"She is, indeed, a woman!",hollymwmk,n/a,16/08/2025,"During this documentary, I was unable to picture Harper as a man. She had the same hangups all women have... Are we good enough? Are we pretty enough? What does he, she, they think of us? What would it take to be accepted by all the people all the time and be happy while faking it!I cried, I laughed, I felt, which I was not expecting.The steak restaurant was maybe a mistake but hey, that's life. Not the first time and probably not the last.I hope Harper can live in her skin and be happy with herself because of her humanity and accomplishments. Because that's where happiness comes from...it should't come from society's expectations!Make them all deserve you and your friendship. If they don't, move on sugar!",False
18,5,Interesting But Not Very Good,mchl88,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before I review this documentary I want to say that I have total compassion for the trans community. Whether you've come out and are transitioning or still contemplating when and how you will come out, I honor your bravery and wish you nothing but peace and acceptance.That said, I didn't love this film. The best thing I can say about it is it was interesting. Kelly and I must have paused it 6 or 7 times to make a point or ask a question.My 2 main issues are:I felt like it wanted to show how tough things are going to be for Harper and others in similar circumstances, but my takeaway is that we're already a pretty accepting nation when it comes to this issue. Will and Harper go to some pretty conservative locales and she boldly announces that she is transitioning (which IMO is akin to walking around a bad neighborhood and telling everyone you have lots of cash on you) and other than a few mean tweets, she is accepted universally. The tweets get Will Ferrell upset and I'm like - Don't read them! Ignore them. And plus, if those tweets came from people who were in the restaurant that night, then they are clearly cowards. If they had any balls they would have walked up to Will and Harper with the cameras rolling and said what they had to say. But they didn't. They went home and wrote it on the internet, the ultimate cowardice response. I'm not saying that everything is fine as far as acceptance goes for the trans community. I'm sure it's still an uphill climb. But this film, which I felt like it wanted to show me the struggle, showed me the opposite. The struggle is mainly within Harper and less from outside forces.Which leads me to my second issue - I felt like the filmmakers wanted me to be emotional. There were scenes (again, IMO) that were blatantly intentional towards the goal of making the viewer cry. Two old friends sitting around drinking bad beer as the sun sets, shooting the shit, talking about life . . . It all felt very contrived and in the end, did not get me in the feels.I'd give this 5 stars (out of 10). I didn't feel like I wasted 2 hours watching it but it just wasn't all that.",False
19,10,Too much hatred in the reviews,caseypthompson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This deserves 9/10 stars, but those that were offended by this movie uplifting the trans community feel they need to knock the reviews down. You can read all the negative reviews to see why they gave it 1 star. It's not the quality of the movie, but that it goes against their belief system. I'm surprised that IMDB is approving these reviews as they are not actually based on the greatness of the film: direction, soundtrack, cinematography, etc...but of their own hatred and ignorant opinions.The movie is raw, uplifting, heartbreaking and so beautiful. I can only hope one day in the future that people will look back to this time and think ""I can't believe the world was so filled with hatred towards other humans.""The raw emotions between Will and Harper are so genuine and empowering. Will is my new hero. He put his true self out there for all to see without shame and we love him all the more for it. And Harper? She this beautiful, raw, eccentric and talented woman that I would love to have a beer with.The soundtrack was amazing and the scenes filled with sorrow made tears swell up. Watching Will cry in the car with his friend just broke me. The scene where he's eating the steak in the spotlight felt so tense and uncomfortable, but it was needed.So many beautiful scenes like the Grand Canyon, the natives singing a song for them in a grimy alt-right country bar, the fireworks, the hugs, the earrings. It was so gentle and touching. The cinema photography was brilliant as well.Sorry if fans of ""Elf"" are mad they can't watch the movie anymore because of how ""woke"" Will Ferrell is.",False

Well done!My family enjoyed this film.Will & Harper have both done so many genius works in their time and this, too, is one of them.They have a special friendship and an important story that we are so happy they shared.Thank-you to Harper for sharing her journey and experiences. The editing and cameos were pleasant as well.Great production from start to finish. Congratulations to all involved in this film.Would anyone like to plan a road trip?Great story of friendship, self-discovery, and discovering and navigating friendships through thick and thin. I highly recommend watching.",False
21,7,the open road,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Realistically speaking, there should be more words for 'friendship', designating the multiple levels on which 'being friends' can occur. If Financial Advisors can have ""A"" (like Warren Buffett), B, C, and D (like me) clients, then wouldn't it be reasonable for us to have levels of friendship for those we entrust with our kids and a house key versus those we meet periodically for happy hour, or those we acknowledge in the grocery store with a wave and a smile? OK, so while the viability of friendship by ranking is not likely, this latest from Josh Greenbaum (BARB AND STAR GO TO VISTA DEL MAR, 2021) introduces us to a friendship we can all strive for.Andrew Steele was the head writer for ""Saturday Night Live"" from 1995 through 2008. Nominated many times for Emmys and WGA awards, he won an Emmy in 2002. During the time at SNL, Steele struck up a friendship with the great Will Ferrell, who was a memorable cast member from 1995 through 2002, before striking gold in movies. Almost thirty years into the friendship, Steele informed Ferrell that Andrew was now Harper (an interesting story behind the name choice), and her transition had begun in 2022. Now, keep in mind that Will Ferrell is a guy in his mid-50's. Sure, he's been around Hollywood for decades ... but still, this information from a long-time friend would surprise most anyone.Going back to levels of friendship, Ferrell suggests the two take one of Harper's beloved cross-country road trips together. Watching the film, it plays like Ferrell prefaces this as a way for the two to reconnect, but on a deeper level, it translates into Ferrell making it easier for Harper to get more comfortable in public with her new self. Either way, this is a friendship to admire and the type of character we should each respect.We have all seen many movies where buddies take a road trip together. However, these 16 days become much more personal and eye-opening than the average buddy flick. The two friends exchange personal details, and respectfully, Ferrell allows Harper to vocalize and process what this new identity means, how it feels, and how she is accepted by others (who are not long-time friends). There are many stops along the way, including parking lots, sporting events, and a dive bar in Oklahoma. Most of this provides some insight, although the over-staged bits (disguises) seem out of place.Will Ferrell does in fact reward us with doses of humor. ""Are you a worse driver now?"" is an instant classic, and their friendship-based banter helps us feel like we are along for the ride. There are segments featuring Harper's daughters and SNL celebrities, and Harper sometimes reminds us of her prolific comedic writing skills. Perhaps the most telling interactions are those with strangers - related both to Ferrell's status and Harper's gender. These days, there is a growing anti-trans sentiment that threatens to destroy the advances made over the past years. It seems to me that the message being delivered here is not one of celebration or special treatment, but rather acceptance and friendship ... allowing adults to be who and what they want to be, as long as they aren't harming others. That also seems like the definition of human decency. This one will likely have you analyzing your own reactions, and you'll definitely want to stick around for Kristin Wiig's remarkable song at the end.",False
22,10,Loved their friendship and Kristen Wiig's song.,sudiniup,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed this movie. And I loved the friendship, vulnerability and humor Will and Harper shared with us, the viewer.I also appreciate Will Ferrell saying he regrets the awkward Texas restaurant visit, after Harper was booed for trans rights toast""I wished I'd walked in and said No. This is going to be terrible. Let's just go,'' Ferrell said.It was one of the uncomfortable moments on their journey, and it did feel as if Will put her on display without Harper's consent and also with no thought of the reaction from restaurant patrons.The song Kristen Wiig wrote for their adventure is perfect and it did make me tear up.Harper and Will Go West Lyrics

Even when they don't know what to say
Known each other for forever and a day
They'll have to find themselves
A magical woman right with her grown-up elf
And oooh, this is the jazzy part
I assume there's no room in the car
Or I'd have been invited
But I'll play my part

Not prospectin' for gold, this is a richer quest

Follow their own sign

23,7,"Less about trans, more about friends...",NicoleC-500,n/a,16/08/2025,"If this film had been released 10 years ago, ironically, I feel it would have received less hate. I am no fan of the current trans movement at all and I know many others are not. But with this film I felt it was more about a friendship then some commentary on the current political climate. Will Ferrell proves himself a loyal and thoughtful friend, and my heart goes out to Harper and what seems like a lot of difficult and painful years endured. Will seemed genuine in wanting to understand and be there for his friend, and I found it truly lovely and endearing.

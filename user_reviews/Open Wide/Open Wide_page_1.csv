1,1,"A boring, disjointed, and content-lacking look at the Mews",J0SCH,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was a complete waste of time. I was initially intrigued by the trailer and premise of looking at the Mews and their obscure treatments, but very little is told in the way of the history, practices, and their licensure. What is shown is disjointed and full of missing critical details to the point where I had to keep pausing to read up on what really happened. This is mostly bizarre and often irrelevant dialogue with the Mews, separately and together, with no real plot or ending. Save yourself the boredom and time and just spend a few minutes reading up on them, their history, and practices online.",False
2,1,lacks a ton of vital information,whmtfpxhm,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary mentions how Mike Mew is in a lawsuit and may lose his license like his father did but they forget to mention why the lawsuit started which after looking it up I found it was because his ""treatment"" caused a kid to have seizure like episodes. They also never mention any scientific evidence to back up anything they say like they never say how it works just that it works. They also never mention that Mike Mews father lost his license to do orthodontics. I feel like in a documentary that's meant to talk about the history of their version of orthodontics they should mention how the lawsuit they're in is because a kid has said that their treatment caused seizure like episodes and that John Mew had lost his license because of misconduct. Instead of mentioning both sides of the lawsuit they just talk about how John Mew has been under a lot of stress from it and how it hurts him instead of also mentioning the other side of the lawsuit where a kid has allegedly had seizures because of this treatment.It also had a really long scene of this mom singing a song about how you can't trust anything.",True
3,10,"Fascinating information, well presented",dcsheats,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been reading and watching videos on this topic for a few years now. It's exciting that a documentary like this can bring the information to a wider audience. I sure wish Dr. Mew had treated me when I needed orthodontic help! I'd be a different person now. I was one of those typical kids with an overbite who had two top teeth pulled and the top teeth pushed back to fit my receding chin.I really feel that being ""ugly"" has harmed many of my opportunities in life. I try not to spend time regretting it, and of course my true friends love me as I am, but I was constantly picked on as a child, looked down on as a teen, and am usually disregarded as an adult. I've never been married and I think I might have been if I were a bit prettier (not discounting the fact that many people more homely than I are happily married...so who knows?). Being ugly does a lot for your character, of course, and I wouldn't want to be extremely pretty either, but I'd like to be closer to average.The sinus problems, mouth breathing, snoring, etc. Haven't been a great experience either. Thankfully I discovered mouth taping 8 years ago and noticed immediately that I felt more refreshed in the morning. Still not great, and I recently decided I should get tested for sleep apnea (hasn't happened yet). But the cool thing is that mouth taping at night retrained me to the point where I realized maybe 4 years ago that I don't mouth breathe during the day any more. My normal relaxed position now is with my mouth closed, which brings many benefits. Before, it was simply impossible to keep my mouth closed without thinking about it constantly, and it wasn't comfortable. I'm 58, but I can even tell that my teeth have shifted. I'm not sure yet where this will end up, but I'm not going back to mouth breathing! Now I need to get serious about learning to mew. I'll try the Mews' (fairly new) app on my phone when I get a chance.",False
4,2,"If you're looking for an educational doc about orthodontics vs orthotropics, this isn't it",loveandthunderstorms,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was attracted to this documentary by its preview, thinking it would have information and facts about orthodontistry vs. Orthotropics. I got 3/4 of the way through it and realized this film is about John Mew and Michael Mew, not about orthodontistry, the Mews' method of orthotropics or even the ""mewing"" trend. You'll hear opinions, opinions presented as facts and plenty of dissent but no actual facts or science about the practices and procedures at the center of this argument. Aside from mewing, I still don't know what exactly the standard practice in orthotropics is or what it involves. My best guess would be that it includes jaw and tongue ""training"" as opposed to standard orthodontic procedures, like fixed braces or surgery. But I'm still not sure and plan to do my own research since this doc didn't appear to do any. Imo, this is a film profiling John Mew and Michael Mew. This is not an educational documentary. Personally, I found the film to be a big bore. The banter between John and Michael wasn't entertaining or endearing to me and I wasn't interested in their personal lives in the slightest. Despite the presence of professional challenges, there was no background, information or explanation of what they were facing, so that didn't leave me with much. I had reached my threshold when a young patient's mother whipped out her ukulele and said she wrote a 7 minute long song and then proceeded to start strumming it that I switched to my K dramas. Unless you're a big fan of John or Michael Mew, I'd recommend skipping this film.",False
5,10,"If you are interested in ortho & dentistry, you'll love it!!!",galuwatra,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have worked in the field of dentistry for over 20 years. This documentary was absolutely fascinating to me. I felt strongly compelled to write a review because I find it misleading & quite sad when reviewers watch a program that holds absolutely no interest for them and they feel the need to give it, a very disappointing one star. Why do that? There are a lot of quacks in the field of dentistry, orthodontics, any specialty. This documentary really gives you a behind the curtain at everything that's involved in correcting occlusion and the aesthetics of having a beautiful smile. I know that personally if I had not had orthodontia, I would not be the person I am now smiling all the time friendly to everyone I wouldn't of had the opportunities that I've had to work front desk at an office and greet patients. A lot of people who have slightly crooked teeth have perfectly healthy teeth, and a great life. For others it's a game changer and really lowers their quality of enjoyment of life. I'd love to see more documentaries about the subject of dentistry, obviously.",False
6,4,So-so documentary about controversial UK orthodontists,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Open Wide"" (2024 release from the UK; 108 min.) opens, we are introduced to John and Mike Mew, a father and son. We then go back in time as we learn of John's modest beginnings, and how he ended up in the field of orthodontics, and ""experimenting"" on his 3 young kids, including Mike, in the early 80s... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this documentary is the feature length directing debut of Sara Goldblatt. Here she does a deep dive into the controversy surrounding the orthodontists John and Mike Mew. Of course I had never heard of them, but we learn that their ""mewing"" technique to lift the jaw line. Strange as it may be, apparently ""mewing"" has gone viral. The problem with all this is that, regretfully, it doesn't make for a great movie experience, unless I suppose you are someone who is into orthodontics, I had never thought about it before watching this, but I guess I can now say with confidence that orthodontics is wasted on me.""Open Wide"" was released by A24, meaning not just some third rate movie studio. It started streaming on Netflix a few days ago, and Netflix had recommended it to me based on my viewing habits (lots of documentaries). Usually Netflix is quite on target with its recommendations, but alas not this time. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you have any interest in orthodontics (or you think you do), I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
7,3,Lacking substance,jouer-61851,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI am documentary buff so not surprisingly Netflix recommended this one to me. It was a dissapointing view. Instead of showing useful research and facts about what exactly is orthotropics, the science (or lack of) behind it, the patients that resulted in his license trial or any other points of view regarding mainstream orthodontics, this is an entire film dedicated to the frustration of the Mew's with the establishment with a 7 minute ukulele song about ""lies"", the really disturbing obsession of Mew's father with beauty ideals including the perfect Caucasian woman photo which apparently is the only aspiring ideal for the entire humanity and the viral mewing trend embraced by the incel community online. Any online article has better research than this documentary.",True
8,10,Best Doc I've Seen In A Long Time,docuqueen-65192,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is both a really interesting deep dive into an arcane subject, and, more importantly, a great character study. Reminded me at times of Grey Gardens, King of Kong, even some of Errol Morris's quirkier movies.It's funny and odd and manages to paint the two protagonists as hopeless Quixotes while simultaneously rendering a poignant image of a son who wants his father to have a legacy.I was surprised to see some of the negative reviews here-it's like we watched a different movie. Made me want to write my own to even out the scales a bit. Really: I wish we had more thoughtfully-made, engaging docs like this one. Seems like they are fewer and farther between these days.",False
9,10,This documentary will be the start of a revolution in orthodontics.,adibkahatt,n/a,15/08/2025,"I started following Mew's methods at 17, and now at 21, my facial structure has visibly improved. My cheekbones are more defined, my jaw broader, and my teeth align better. Though progress has slowed, I still notice changes. It's never too late to start, and once you build up the right strength, it becomes second nature.It's sad how pioneers like Mew often face resistance from society. You'd think we'd learn from history, but old habits persist. Yet, here we are, embracing and appreciating his groundbreaking work with gratitude.History shows true visionaries often meet skepticism from traditional authorities. The scientific community sometimes rejects ideas unjustly. When Dr. Mew's contributions are acknowledged, they better give them a Nobel Prize.So, Dr. Mew, keep pushing forward. The scientific community may be slow, but your perseverance will prevail. Thank you for challenging the status quo and paving the way for a healthier future.",False

1,7,A raw and heartfelt portrayal of survival in modern china,Giuseppe_Silecchia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Youth (Homecoming), directed by Wang Bing, is a deeply immersive documentary that shines a poignant light on the lives of migrant factory workers in contemporary rural China. Spanning five years, the film captures their cyclical struggles, as they balance grueling labor with fleeting moments of joy, particularly during the New Year reunions with their families.Wang Bing's direction is both intimate and observational, eschewing narration to let the raw footage speak for itself. This approach creates an unfiltered connection with the workers' lives, showcasing the stark realities of economic survival in a system fraught with inequality. Fang Lingping, among others, brings authenticity to the screen, embodying the resilience and quiet despair of a generation striving for dignity amid adversity.However, the documentary's 2-hour-and-32-minute runtime can feel exhaustive, with moments of repetition that may test the patience of viewers unfamiliar with Wang's meditative style. While this pacing underscores the monotony of the workers' existence, it occasionally risks alienating the audience.Youth (Homecoming) is a powerful reflection on the human cost of modern capitalism and the enduring spirit of those who navigate its challenges. It's an essential watch for those seeking to understand the intersection of labor, politics, and humanity.Rating: 7/10 - A stirring but demanding portrait of resilience in rural China.",False

Truly shows how incredible her fan base is and how much they wanted this movie to be created! Cannot wait to see what the future holds for Miss Camden.",False
2,10,Lady Camden wows the crowd with her bravery and determination,hellkattanimations,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAn incredibly inspiring film. Showcasing the struggle to meet the demands of fame and reality TV, while dealing with traumatic experiences, and having people consistently trying to bring you down, and showing that it is still possible to succeed, this movie shows that it is possible to succeed and come to terms with your past, no matter how bad it was, and that you can still achieve your goals and aspirations. Lady Camden provides a truly inspiring story that shows her determination, resilience, courage and sheer strength and dedication to her craft. An amazing film that I would recommend to anyone.",True
3,10,Must watch!,andresalehian,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lady Like was incredible! I saw it at a premiere in San Francisco. We got to see Rex's story growing up in Camden, coming to America, and becoming the Lady we all know and love!! The documentary was heartfelt, powerful, and full of laughs! Additionally, she details her time on drag race and what led her to getting there and becoming the star she is today! I would definitely recommend it to everyone wanting to learn more about drag, family, and persistence. It is unlike any drag documentary I've seen before and really goes behind the curtain in every aspect. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish!",False
4,10,Absolutely Amazing,rebekahhitchings,n/a,15/08/2025,"Myself and my wife adore Lady Camden, and we were so excited when the film was released in the UK. Rex portrays his drag journey beautifully, and showcasing minute by minute the journey to become Lady Camden gave us goosebumps. The relationship he has with his mum and how supportive she grows to be is so inspiring to see.I thought I knew everything there is to know about Lady Camden, but I was wrong. The struggle Rex endured as a child was so relatable, and to experience what he became despite the struggles he faced made us both cry.Even if you're not a fan of drag (we so are) you will love this film. It is so inspiring and beautiful. We've met Lady Camden a few times now, and the Lady Camden you see on TV is who they are in person.Beautiful inside and out.",False
5,10,Love Ladylike,jane-ann-thorpe,n/a,15/08/2025,What a lovely film. I really enjoyed it. Lady Camden should be proud of herself. She did the UK and her mum proud. I love seeing people being them selves. It was good to see the background to her becoming a drag queen. I can relate to the school issues this happened to my youngest son. And it makes life hard.The film was well put together and set at my level of enjoyment. I did not lose concentration which I often do. Real life and real life issues are good to be aware of it helps with acceptance this is now something she should have from many people. I would recommend watching this i hope there are more films like this.,False
6,10,Wonderful,tempetecaline,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is a real shock and it's very interesting to learn more about Lady Camden's life! What she went through is very moving, and it's a really good idea for a concept! This film will appeal to fans of drag and RuPaul's drag race.Discovering the rise of such a star, whom we watched break through in RuPaul, is really very interesting and touching!Lady is so wonderful, but still very humble! Discovering the rise of such a star, whom we watched break through in RuPaul, is really very interesting and touching!I advise everyone to go and see this film, which is really great, honestly, you won't regret it, and it's a real life lesson! Thanks.",False
7,10,An Important Story,cquinby,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched a live screening and discussion of this film with Lady Camden herself and Director Luke Willis. The film itself is an important story and insight into the experiences of a queer person. Not just a rant about experiences on RuPaul's Drag Race, but much deeper insights that really bring a tear to your eye again and again. Nina West is a great narrator and supports the content of the film very well. I really enjoyed how Lady Camden and Luke Willis incorporate aspects of healing and hearing the inner child of someone who wasn't always allowed to be publicly authentic and live fully. Whether or not someone knows who Lady Camden is, I'd recommend this to be viewed by anyone.",False
8,10,Ladylike-YES!,avacariaga,n/a,15/08/2025,"I travelled from Phoenix Arizona to San Francisco to watch a live screening of Ladylike and in my 100% honest opinion I fell even more in love with lady Camden & Rex even more than before. It was such a beautiful insight into what makes up Lady Camden! I immediately fell in love as soon as I saw her in RPDR but as I've watched her journey after and to see the passion and time and energy it takes to do what she does,, THATS why I love her. Lady like was very well produced and better than expected. I cannot wait to see if more projects like this come up in the future. I really hope so Ms. Camden!!",False
9,10,Really excellent documentary,alloyd-55061,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is such a great documentary. Despite being queer I've never really resonated with drag and have never been a regular watcher of RuPaul's Drag Race, so I didn't come into this with preexisting context. That didn't matter, though -- the story is great, Lady Camden is so charismatic, and I was so moved by her journey. Luke Willis did an excellent job. I looked him up and saw that he's a former ballet dancer so it's really cool to see his transition to filmmaking. I was so sad to miss a live screening of this when it came to the Bay Area and I'm so glad it's now available to stream. I'm so glad this movie exists!",False
10,10,Love love love,akostopoulos-44682,n/a,15/08/2025,"I got to see this in theatres and ordered the DVD asap!! It is such a great story. Honestly haven't stopped talking about it since seeing it almost a year ago.Lady Camden showed the world her energy and personality on season 14 of ru pauls drag race, and that was even more evident during this movie. Her charisma is clear throughout the whole movie, making the audience root for her through the whole thing. I learned a lot about her journey and her childhood. Since watchingbthe film I have been able to watch season 14 in a new light.You'll laugh, you'll cry, youll celebrate. I cannot recommend this movie enough.",False
11,9,So fun and so heartfelt,txthukgyt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Loved it! A great mix of fun, heartfelt, and interesting. I already loved Lady Camden from watching Drag Race, and it was awesome to get to see more behind the scenes. I especially enjoyed learning more about what has happened in her life and career since Season 14 ended. I was fortunate enough to see this at a screening in Denver with Lady Camden herself in attendance, and was able to stay for a Q&A with her afterwards. She was so friendly! My family and I even got to stick around and chat with her ourselves later. I love watching Drag Race, and it was so fun to get to know the person behind the persona.",False
12,10,God Save the Queen Lady Camden!,meganelise26,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've loved Lady Camden from the moment she walked into the Werk Room. Getting to see the behind the scenes journey of her getting to where she is today adds a new level of appreciation for how much she dedicates her craft to being light and like a fairytale. She's such a talented performer and getting to learn more about how Rex and Lady Camden intertwine was such a beautiful experience to watch. I'd also like to take a moment for the ballet shots in the documentary. They were beyond stunning and all of the dancers were so talented, especially the dance sequence towards the end. A must see for any drag fan!",False
13,10,I'm obsessed,ladylunatrixofficial,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've admired Camden's work for a long time now and it was so beautiful to see her story come to life in this movie. I loved hearing about her backstory and seeing her childhood bar back in London, along with learning more about her ballet background. It was also beautiful to see her finale preparations up close and watch her thrive. Nina's illustrations were beautiful and campy and the perfect way to tie the story together, and the new song is a total bop. I laughed, I cried (a little too much) but most of all I came away feeling so proud of both Camden and Rex, all the team and their work was incredible to see.",True
14,10,Serving it to you lady like,amybuckle101,n/a,15/08/2025,"An uplifting and inspirational documentary about the journey before and after being on Drag Race. It's just a beautiful piece of work that shows the ups and downs and hard work that comes with pursuing your dreams. It gives a touching back round story as to where Lady Camden has come from and what shaped her decisions in moving to America. It shows how one dream may not succeed due to unforeseen circumstance but how these changes began the spark of pursuing drag! It shows us through out her journey that she has such a bright future ahead of her too! It's relatable and heartfelt, I encourage all to watch this x.",False

1,7,"It may be a little too soon for this, interesting, but chilling.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's an interesting documentary, but I don't feel that it's the right time to be watching such a show about the origins of Covid 19. We are still in the eye of the storm, still on the journey, with the end point seemingly moving further away.It's a chilling watch, one which doesn't shy away from taking a real dig at the Chinese authorities, for apparently delaying vital information about the virus in the early days.Interesting information about what a virus is, what it does, and how it behaves. Nicely narrated by Caroline Catz, she adds a sensible tone.Do I believe that Covid came from a bat in a wet market? Never in a million years, and I am not a conspiracy theory nut, nor a sensationalist, but I'd sooner believe in the tooth fairy.I never thought I would see anything like this in my lifetime, hopefully one day we can see a documentary about how Covid 19 was beaten.It's an interesting watch, just know what you're in for. 7/10.",False
2,8,"It does something else, and does it well.",axhycxt,n/a,16/08/2025,It gives us an artful window on the suffering world in which we are living. Through it can be seen our failures as caretakers of our planet and each other.,False
3,3,A bleak by-the-numbers documentary,Suave-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"Outbreak is a bleak by-the-numbers documentary with very little new information to impart. The pacing is off, moving quite nicely in the beginning but stalling towards the end. Some emotional moments are captured quite well but the science is noticeably lacking. Also unimpressive the way they kept talking about the virus's impact on ""the western world"" without ever mentioning Australia. 3/10.",False
4,4,typical tv production,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dull,emotional and far to low on science.its the ultraslow documentarymaking that divides the pay roll documentarist vs the idealistic curious independent documentarist. its not a good timeline story",False

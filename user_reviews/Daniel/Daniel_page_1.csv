1,7,A privileged look inside the mind of someone who saw the world just a little differently.,Jamin-chaput,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a really special film, a mosaic of memories perfectly woven together. With thousands of hours of footage of Daniel's life to work with, this could have easily been a bloated film, one that could have been an extended and (understandably) indulgent look at a young man, by family, for family. Instead we get a quilted blanket that is neither too heavy, nor lacking substance.No matter what you believe, this film will make you wonder what if. What if lost things were found? What if the wrongfully removed were replaced? What if the ancient guardians of a cave of the dead had never lost their toy? What if we didn't so easily dismiss the old gods? We don't believe in silly curses and old world superstitions, but Daniel's story eats away at the foundation of those (non) beliefs.But for the talk of curses and premature endings, we're left with a profound feeling of admiration of a life well lived. This film was always about life, and by the end I can't help but think that the documentary has a life of its own. Rarely do people get to tell the story of their life so completely. Here, Daniel and his family get to tell his story as perfectly as can be told.Daniel has left me with lingering feelings. The emotions of his life's work are complex, but by the end of it I am certain of one thing: I will not feel sorry for Daniel.",False
2,9,how things unfold...,guilhermesvicenti,n/a,15/08/2025,"Daniel's life was... a long short life. I'm sure that he lived in ten years what I or 90% of people worldwide won't live. I'm glad to have watched your movie, and I'm grateful for your existence. I will remember this experience for my entire life. The way your sister edited the movie and the way you speak through the scenes were amazing. For me, it almost seemed planned, you know, the way you live, even without knowing about your illness that you show... it's amazing.How things happen... how people look for us... how our friends can imagine or understand life... I don't feel sorry for you, dear. Thanks.",False
3,8,Wow -- the last 15 minutes,Norman_French,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this in two pieces, taking a break after the first hour. I didn't ""get"" the character really, he's clearly a very different person than I am. I didn't expect to leave a review, but after watching the last 15 minutes, that changed.The last 15 minutes covers the funeral (which is well-edited and brought a tear to my eye) but also contains some the most profound aspects of the film. We see Daniel talking to *us*, the audience. He is making direct eye contact with the camera.""In fact, I'm looking at you ... right now ... from across the {blah}. I think you're beautiful.""The {blah} word is a bit profound and saying it here, out of context, would cheapen the message. Watch the film and you'll find out what it is.For me, this rates seven stars, with a half star bonus for the editing and another for the guts to not push this to 90 minutes (as many documentaries do). That makes EIGHT (8) stars total. I think some scenes will stay with me ....",True
4,n/a,Almost wish it was longer,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's rare in these days of three hour plus movies to say I wish a film was longer, but in this case, I wish it was.It's an interesting film and well worth watching in terms of seeing someone living life to the fullest and suddenly finding themselves, unexpectedly, at the end of it all.My only complaint is at the end of 102 minutes, relatively short these days, that I didn't feel I knew Daniel as well as I could have. From what I understand he filmed over a thousand hours of his life, and this easily could have been a two hour to two and half hour film and I would've felt like I knew him better.On the upside, maybe more people will watch it as it's reasonably short and since it was produced by his sister, maybe she didn't know what best to include or leave out.In the end it would be difficult not to recommend it, as it is one of those ""live life while you can"" kind of stories. I just wish I got to know Daniel a little better over the course of the film and with all the available footage there was, I think the possibility was there.",False
5,10,One of the biggest honours of my life to be able to watch this.,andnotbefore-08775,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the best film ever made, Dan, if you are reading this from across the impossible: i wish i'd know you and give you all the love you deserved, you were a gentleman, a true brother, son, friend, all things aside, You were a beautiful human being. Dan, i've seen all kinds of films, more than a thousand of them, i've never connected myself this close to a film like i have to yours. I dont think there are words in the dictionary to define your presence. Nature chose you to show its immense beauty to the world. You were loved, and you always will be, I'll remember this for the rest of my life.",False
6,10,Stunningly beautiful,travellushmama,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yes!Such a life-affirming movie. About what truly matters. Love, travel, nature, family, friends, people, the beauty of life, art & expression. It's also about loss, karma and acceptance.With people documenting so much of their lives these days on video, it makes for some stellar documentaries.Please watch this movie. It's a rarity to encounter a film that simultaneously captures the raw beauty of life and makes you mourn all who you've lost. I lost my brother eleven years ago and Daniel had me crying cathartic tears of grief. And I related to Daniel's loss of his grandmother to what I assume was dementia.Daniel also made me think about my son who is in a horribly depressed, hopeless and rebellious phase. At least I hope it's a phase. He's really hurting and I can't do anything to help. I hate this. It physically hurts to see your kid in so much pain. And to not feel empowered to do any of the comforting a mother would do, especially as one who shows love via touch. If only my son could see this documentary. He needs an infusion of the life force and demonstration of grace that is both Daniel the person and Daniel the movie (thanks in part to his loving sister who produced). I haven't been as inspired or moved since Anthony Bourdain passed away.",False
7,10,A beautifully filmed tragedy,daveandlizzybrewamerica,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film blew me away. I wasn't sure what to expect, but wow this was so beautiful.Without giving too much away, Daniel did in fact show real life in a movie like he'd told Felix he wanted to do.This moved me in so many ways. The doc showed real life from growing up to the struggle of finding yourself.It showed the struggle of understanding death when someone you love passes to the struggle of accepting our own death.It showed how a family can pull together to be a complete support system and doing everything possible to keep the inevitable from happening.And lastly it showed acceptance of this thing we call life and the end of it, from both our own perspective and the people around us who search for closure.The fact that his sister was able to complete the film makes this even more special. As a sibling I couldn't imagine going through this. I think she's an incredible editor and sister.I signed up for IMDb just to rate this film. I will remember this film for the rest of my life. I will recommend it to others, especially those who I know will benefit.Watch this!",True
8,10,Very Good!,watchtower2814,n/a,15/08/2025,"I almost skipped pass this and made a big mistake but something told me to check it out. Such a beautiful story of Daniel's unique life. It was a documentary that I felt a connection with and I'm sure many others will. The meaning of everything/the importance of living life to its fullest. I haven't gotten this emotional and felt this way really about any movie/doc/series. Thank you to Daniel's sister for going through it all and weaving this view on her brothers life. As another reviewer stated...A very life affirming movie. Everyone should watch this, I don't see how you could not come out of it without a little bit of Daniel in your heart. Be kind to one another, have fun when you can, for you you never know what will come next on your journey of life.",False
9,n/a,Beautiful story. Terribly depressing. Watch it.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like the headline states. It's a beautiful story. But it's also very depressing. Daniel had such an interesting perspective on life. Something many of us can relate to. His journeys and experiences are things we can appreciate, because it's something we all want to see in life. It's a raw insight into the life of an extraordinary young man. A man who lived a life time. A man cut short of the life that could of brought so much more to this world. His journey shows us the beauty and the beasts of the world. The light and darkness that plays a a part of all our lives. He lived and died to tell a story, to show people there's more beauty than beasts and that we can see the extraordinary and live the lives we want to. Live the impossible and be who we want to be.",False

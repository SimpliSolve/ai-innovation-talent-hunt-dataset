1,10,The art of Johnny Depp,kirstywalters77,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is made in the purest way possible. Johnny Depp the artist. A wonderful way to see his extraordinary timeline & although not nearly long enough to explore the finer points( that would take hrs of film) it really shows you the immense way he has shaped his career through the years.A joy to see, refreshing & wonderful for people who maybe new to him & his insane talent.",False
2,10,I enjoyed it,court-19242,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a simple documentary with clips from interviews etc. I just loved the fact there's only a tiny bit mention about a üí© and we didn't have to look at her pure stretched botox face with those ü§¢ cheek fillers, it was just positive Johnny content for an hour. I don't care if its things we've seen before and I wasn't expecting anything new, it was just nice to see the positivity. He's a legend ‚ù§.",False
3,9,Good doco,joliedeb,n/a,16/08/2025,A simple look into this amazing man's career. Doesn't list everything but that's because he's done so much. Enjoyed it.,False
4,n/a,A wonderful piece of work,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Definitely one of the best documentarys ever well done to all involved a very riveting piece of work. Johnny is terrific iconic and one of the best actors. Holding onto hope he gets the work he deserves such a wonderful performer!,False
5,5,Overrated,Rofocale777,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping for an indepth piece on Johnny Depp's life and carreer, but instead I was presented with a glorified Youtube film with nothing but some trailer material and old interviews bundled together.There is absolutely no new material in this doc. This could have been so much better if there were new interviews with people close to Johnny, people he has worked with in the past or even Johnny himself. But alas, nothing of the sort is to be found.The only thing original in this documentary (if even that) is the narration, which is ok at best.Very disappointing. I was expecting and certainly hoping for much more and is definately not worth the rating it currently has.",False
6,10,"finally, some Johnny content we can all appreciate!!",debbiedwayne,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm so glad to see this documentary come out right now, because it's badly needed. I'm sick to death of every bit of Johnny news being about a certain compulsive liar, and I miss seeing Johnny in films lately. He's so talented, and such an icon. I've been rewatching his older films lately. I won't be seeing POTC because Johnny isn't in it, and the same for any other film that has ignorantly chosen to chose another actor. The screen just lights up every time Johnny is on camera, and always has... no one can replace him. I love the simplicity of the format, and I'm happy that this was made and included people who love and support him. All around, a breath of fresh air, honestly.",False
7,1,Keeping getting review removed,shawthingproductions,n/a,16/08/2025,"Long time Depp fan and got this to learn more about him but this is just copy and paste information pulled right from the net with nothing new to say. More embarrassing is the amount of information (also freely available) which is misses out entirely, showing the people behind this made very little effort to do the job properly. A lazy cash-in from talentless filmmaker looking to get money out of Depp fans. Keep in mind, when you watch it if you choose to, that this is also an authorised film so - do not expect new interviews or anything like this: Everything found here can be found on YouTube for free.I wonder how long this review will remain before it is pulled.",False
8,10,King of cult,javedkhanp,n/a,16/08/2025,The best documentary on the life of johnny depp. He deserved this. Always has been his fan and forever will be. From nightmare on elm street to minamata he's done it all.,False
9,10,Johnny Depp never disappoints,bmaples-86543,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great portrayal of a phenomenal actor. He's both talented and passionate in his acting skills and that passion is a big part of why the roles he plays are so memorable when you think of Johnny Depp. No one can play roles he's famous for like he can. His ability to play completely different roles/movie genres instead of sticking to one genre of movies is amazing and not super common with actors. His uniqueness, talent, passion, and perseverance through difficult times is what makes him the remarkable actor that he is.",False
10,10,Good film,cika-78689,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like the simplicity of the format, and I am glad that it includes people who love and support it. A breath of fresh air around!",False

13,10,Gooddd,vlas-89680,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film is very exciting, his story is full of pain, but he could and remains the kindest person!Unbearable!",True
14,10,Good,kalinka-06991,n/a,16/08/2025,So cool at last it's movie about Depp. Something good news.,False
15,10,Well Worth Seeing I would watch it again,shirley-koinonia,n/a,16/08/2025,Johnny Depp the artist. Refreshing. His extraordinary timeline is amazing but I wish they could have gone into more detail about this talented man. It was not long enough to explore many of the finer points but it does show you how individual he is and explains how he has shaped his career through the years. There is so much more to him that many have not seen. There is clearly only one Johnny Depp. I rate him high above all other actors.Too many don't realize all there is to know about him & his insane talent. I would love to see a part two of Johnny Depp: King of Cult to bring even more attention to this talented man.,False
16,10,"It's amazing , I love Johnny so much",helenacupers,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's amazing , I love Johnny so much
I hope it will be translated to ukrainian.",False
17,10,The film,ioimasha,n/a,16/08/2025,The film. He's better than what Johnny Depp's ex-wife wants or wants to shoot.,False
18,9,Excellent,jamesjillian,n/a,16/08/2025,"Extraordinary acting, always, uniquely appealing as in nearly every project Mr. Depp has developed in his career. His vast experience in utilizing his many talents, is again on exhibit. Something like An Exhibit on Humanity - in all its troublesome manifestations.",False

1,8,Loved the movie but you made a error in identity!!!!!,ptnana-34392,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you for recognizing one of the greatest musicians of all times. I believe that you did a wonderful job of chronicling the life of Richard Pinneman, however, one mistake was made that needs to be corrected and the public needs to know the truth. Near the beginning of the movie you showed a young boy playing a piano as little Richard. This is not true. This young man was and is Frank Isaac ""Sugar Chile"" Robinson, born 12/28/1938, and is still alive. That picture was taken from a 1946 movie that he was in with Van Johnson called ""No Leave, No Love"". He also recorded several albums between 1949 and 1952. Everyone always thinks that he is Little Richard. I would love to see this BLACK child prodigy get his proper respect.",False
2,8,"Good golly, good stuff",ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Good golly! Documentarian Lisa Cortes packs a lot into this profile of Richard Wayne Penniman, better known as Little Richard. Director Cortes sticks with a familiar structure for the biopic; however, two things stood out to me about this documentary: it features remarkably little music for a musical doc, and it works well for both those who are very familiar with the legendary performer and those needing an introduction.In cradle-to-grave fashion, we learn about Richard's mother and father, and that he was one of 12 children in the family from Macon, Georgia. Plenty of photographs and clips from the era are included, and things really kick in when the history of ""Tutti Frutti"" is discussed. Shifting a bit from its original meaning, Little Richard served up a searing version that shocked many. But what shocked him is that much tamer versions from Elvis and especially Pat Boone outsold his. I particularly enjoyed learning that Little Richard picked up his famous scream from gospel singer Marion Williams.Ms. Cortes utilizes many interviews by Little Richard himself to cover his complex life filled with contradictions and new paths. His father kicked him out of the house for being gay, setting him up for a lifetime of searching for his true identity. Richard's track included pushing the early boundaries of rock and roll, pushing further boundaries in the world of queerness, exploring many facets of religion and attempting to balance his belief in the bible with his love of orgies, and his lifelong search for a true identity.It was the 1956 film, THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT, that provided most people's first glance of Little Richard performing. The same can be said for Fats Domino, Eddie Cochran, and Gene Vincent, among others, but none had the impact or the look and music of Little Richard. His many hits after ""Tutti Frutti"" included ""Long Tall Sally"", ""Lucille"", and of course, ""Good Golly, Miss Molly"". It's fascinating to hear Mick Jagger, John Waters, Tom Jones, and others provide the acknowledgment of Little Richard's influence, however, even more interesting is listening to Little Richard himself walk us through his various stages of being. This is a man who, lacking an ounce of humility, proclaims, ""I'm the one who started it all"", referencing Rock and Roll. He's also the man who renounced his gay identity in order to embrace religion and begin preaching.Little Richard was a master showman with a daring and hyper-energetic stage presence. None other than The Rolling Stones once opened for him on tour. His tongue-in-cheek catchphrase became ""Shut up"", and he was heavily into drugs during the 1970's. Little Richard was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1986, and he has taken credit for the success of most every rock star over the last 70 years ... and the fabulous closing montage makes it difficult to argue. Director Cortes does justice to the complex life of a complicated and talented man, and 'Good Golly', that was no easy task.Opening in theaters and on Digital beginning April 21, 2023.",False
3,8,Powerful and Painful,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great and well done rockumentary. Little Richard was such a deeply complex and talented and conflicted individual. This movie, produced by CNN, captures very effectively the many facets of his life a career. Through archival footage, interviews old and new, and storytelling we learn about the musical influence of this trailblazer who impacted the Beatles, Otis Redding, The Rolling Stones, Elvis, Prince, Michael Jackson, and more. We also see the painful conflict regarding Little Richard's deeply complex relationship with himself-with his image, with his sexuality, and his relationship with God. This is a moving film. I loved it.",False
4,9,Little Richard - what an inspiration!,dakjets,n/a,16/08/2025,"Little Richard was a much bigger icon than I ever knew.Although I am a grown man, I became interested in pop music and popular culture many years after Little Richard had his ""heyday"". I also got bits and pieces of him, and sometimes he appears on TV and the like. No more.This documentary highlights his central role in popular culture. In fact, without Little Richard, pop music might not have become what we know it as today.The documentary shows him as a trailblazer and as an enormous inspiration for all who followed him. Unfortunately, he has little respect and recognition for his enormous efforts.The documentary also gives us insight into his private life; both religion (which was central), sexual orientation and how friends perceived him.Last but not least; lots of wonderful music here, and many clips of performances he did. Little Richard gave it his all when he was on stage, and the audience loved him. At a time when pop stars ""come and go"", it is liberating to get to know who paved the way for many of them.",False
5,9,Revelatory,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sometimes it takes a movie to help set the record straight. And, when it comes to designating who truly is the king of rock 'roll, this documentary from director Lisa Cortes does just that. Richard Wayne Penniman - professionally known as Little Richard (1932-2020) - burst onto the pop music scene in the mid-1950s with a singular, unrestrained, high-energy style that set him apart from other aspiring performers at the time, achieving tremendous success with hits like ""Tutti Fruitti"" and ""Long Tall Sally,"" among others. However, even though he developed a strong following and a reputation for chart-busting releases, he never quite attained the widespread notoriety of others, like Elvis Presley and Pat Boone, particularly when they covered his hits. He also didn't achieve the financial success that he deserved, thanks to record labels that gave him raw deals. What's more, as a flamboyant, openly gay Black musician at a time when those qualities were far from well tolerated, he became a target for ostracism and scorn from conservative circles, whose leaders spouted inflammatory claims that he was undermining the moral fabric of traditional American culture with his ""decadent"" music and ""perverted"" lifestyle. Yet his blend of colorful performances, mixed with outlandish costumes, pancake makeup and frenetic stage antics and backed by tunes that fused boogie woogie, rhythm & blues and gospel, made him a standout, a style that countless artists drew from - and openly acknowledged his influence - when they emerged in their own right, many of whom are interviewed in the film in archive footage or recent conversations. The result here is a revelatory examination of someone who set a standard but who never received the degree of recognition he merited until many years after his debut on the music scene. ""Little Richard: I Am Everything"" features a wealth of historical footage, including many interviews with the artist himself, along with observations from the likes of Mick Jagger, Billy Porter, Paul McCartney, Tom Jones, Nona Hendryx and superfan filmmaker John Watters, as well as an array of music industry, African-American and gay community historians. Viewers are likely to come away from this offering knowing a lot about Little Richard that they hadn't known previously, enabling them to gain a new appreciation for the rock icon and learning much about the many triumphs and challenges he faced during his colorfully enigmatic life. Audiences are sure to come away from this one proclaiming ""Long live rock - and the king who finally gets to wear his much-deserved crown.""",False
6,7,Rousing documentary about the larger-than-life rock icon,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Little Richard: I Am Everything"" (2023 release; 101 min.) opens, we heard from various talking heads. One of them sums it up like this: ""He spit on every rule there ever was in music"". ""He"" of course being Little Richard. We then go back in time to the early 1930s in Macon, Georgia. It might as well be the 1830s, that is how remote Macon was from everything. In that backwards, if not openly racist, midst, Little Richard was finding his way... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from Black director Lisa Cortes (""All In: The Fight For Democracy""). Here she reassesses the life and times of a rock icon who never truly received what he deserved, either critically or commercially. But that didn't stop him from pushing on. This is a rousing documentary from start to finish. Little Richard knew all too well what was going on. Or as he puts it towards the end of this enjoyable documentary: ""We built the highway and they they still driving it and not paying toll"".""Little Richard: I Am Everything"" was released earlier this year, to immediate acclaim. It is now playing on HBO and streaming on Max, where I saw it the other night. There is good reason why this movie is currently rated 98% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and I fully expect it will get a Best Documentary Oscar nomination in early 2024. If you have any interest in Little Richard or the history of rock and roll, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
7,n/a,Wop bop a loo bop a lop bom bom!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This perceptive documentary on the career and importance of Little Richard transcends the typical pop music tribute in the breadth and depth of its treatment -kudos to director Lisa Cortes.It concisely covers many topics relevant to his rise as well as the roadblocks that were placed in his way. Being Black, Gay and a rebel added up to his becoming a revolutionary figure in popular culture. And the selection of interviewees, some famous, some less so, but all knowledgeable about facets of his life.From his earliest influences and colleagues to the early White ripoffs of his songs starting with ""Tutti Frutti"" by Elvis and Pat Boone, and ultimately by an adoring Paul McCartney, the movie traces a circuitous history of a legendary performer.His international influences are attested to by McCarthy, Mick Jagger, Tom Jones and many others -all ringing true.Then later his turning to religion and getting involved with drugs and falling into poverty, ultimately turning against his gay identity. What emerges in this carefully crafted and structured documentary is a complex personality, living up to its title.",False
8,10,THE KING OF ROCK 'N' ROLL...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A 2023 Max documentary on the famed flamboyant progenitor of all things rock 'n' roll. Reared & raised in meager straits, Richard would find himself into music emulating a gay performer (donning a big pompadour & wearing make-up) who toured the chitlin circuit which prompted him to do the same where he made a killing until he found out white performers like Elvis Presley & Pat Boone would outsell his releases when they re-recorded his tunes. Gaining fans from the unlikeliest of places; England (in the form of the Beatles & Stones) Richard was soon on his way musically but his own personal demons; being gay & non-secular at the same time would dog him for the rest of his career sometimes where he'd renounce his sexuality for the church & vice versa but his real annoyance came in the form of not being recognized for his sizable, quantifiable influence on rock music (witness the montage of artists he influenced w/Harry Styles himself wearing gender bending clothes appealing to the masses) which was hopefully rectified by the end of his life. Using audio interviews & archival footage of the man himself you'd be hard pressed to not have him be the eternal life of the party whose thumping sound & grandiose behavior enchanting & delighting all.",False
9,6,Originator,adamoda14,n/a,16/08/2025,"Little Richard is certainly an originator. There at the birth of 'rock and roll.' What people tend to ignore is the short life of his string of hits. Perhaps his sound could have evolved. It might have been tough to bring piano music into the 60's, see non existent Jerry Lee.This doc uses new or current artists to somehow justify Richard's legacy, while telling his story with a 2023 political lense. Noticeably absent was Richard's upbringing and the sexual abuse that was brought on him by his family. Add to that his relationship with the great Billy Preston.It's a watch that is worth your time if you are a fan of music docs. Just know that between archival footage, interviews from living legends, you are going to get thoughts and performances from irrelevant people who weren't there.",False
10,9,Great portrait of the legend,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLittle Richard is indeed one of the, if not the biggest pioneer of rock music, and a film chronicling the legend's life and performances seemed like a very promising feature.And it sure delivers, the incredible director delivers a very cinematic, humble yet grand delving into the complicated and complex life of the real human, and his social standing and humble beginnings in a very interesting and culturally interesting feature.The cinematography, cutting and editing is great, very feature like and offering a good mix of cinematics and archive footage.Overall, an incredible film, offering some great songs as one would expect, and highly recommended for fellow fans of film and music!",True
11,10,Little Big Richard,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - the man who is possibly way bigger (music and impact wise, get your mind out of the gutter) than quite a few other people who may have a bigger name than he has ... or are remembered more I reckon would be the right term? I have to admit, I never really engaged or looked into his history ... into what songs he made ... who ""stole"" from him (many artists re-recorded some of the stuff he did, like Tuti Frutti to name just one) ... and were more successful ... sometimes for reasons ... well how do I put it? Let's say appearance or rather ""color"".Let's leave it at that. He also was always eccentric ... George Michael kept it a secret, whatever he was into in the bedroom. Little Richard was different - again no pun intended. He may have renounced his past too ... and made enemies amongst his community because of it ... but he is quite the complex character. There is so much to unpack here ... they could have done a docu series about him ... not just about his music and impact ... or about his persona, his character ... but his friends, his encounters, his episodes ... he was funny for sure ... but maybe too scarred and bitter ... you decide! Well worth a watch.",False
12,6,Decent Documentary. I actually think less of LR now though...,jmillerjr-00983,n/a,16/08/2025,"Perhaps we could just agree that it's silly to coronate anyone the ""king of rock and roll."" It's clear from this documentary that Little Richard often felt overlooked, despite his crucial contribution to rock and pop music in the middle of the 20th century. Let's give him the due he deserves. He is the originator, the architect, and the emancipator (whatever that means). He was also a bit of a one trick pony. The man basically gave us a handful of rock 101's greatest songs and then spent the rest of his life milking them. And the funny thing about that is, if the documentary is to be believed, he barely got any money for that. If you look at music from the mid-60s on, it's just a rehash of old hits and uninspired covers. No genius albums. No incredible tours. No inspiring collaboration.Placing him in the same league as the Beatles and the Stones is just silly. The man never outgrew his pride (hence the documentary's title) and his career suffered for it. Sad to say, the best song he released in the final 50 years of his life was the theme song to ""The Magic School Bus."" I'm actually surprised that didn't make it in the documentary.",False
13,5,Great footage - ignores LR's final message.,El-Kapitoshka,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a massive Little Richard fan. The film celebrates how pioneering he is and I agree- he was the true king of rock and roll.But the film attempts to downplay a very important point about LR. Yes at the time he was miles ahead and outwardly open about his preferences.But toward the end of his life he totally rejected his old life along with rock and roll - in favour of God.Yes...this bit won't quite suit the narrative the film maker wishes to portray here that LR should be seen today as a ""queer icon"" of sorts that can be celebrated today as an excuse to simply be ourselves.Don't take my word for it - do a search on the tube for Little Richards Final Message and decide for yourself. LR was a massive fan of God and he claimed to have found true liberation through that only.Still, the footage is great and there are some fantastic interviews here with other big names.",False
14,n/a,"Rhythm and Blues had a baby and they named it Rock and Roll, and Little Richard was the dad.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I admit I was a bit apprehensive, an hour and forty one minutes to see a film about Little Richard. But the longer I watched the more invested I got. It may not be for all tastes but for all of us who appreciate music and its evolution, this is a great little film.Little Richard was 13 when I was born, I grew up with the music of the 1950s and 1960s but was never a fan of his music. Not because he was black, Ray Charles, Johnny Mathis, and Nat 'King' Cole were among my favorites, I just never cared for Rock and Roll. It wasn't what I enjoyed listening to.However, as we look back, and this film points out vividly, Little Richard, from Macon Georgia, was the spark that changed everything. He was the father of Rock and Roll. Not that he intended to, just by his own interests and creativity it came about. During a trip to England in the early 1960s he met up with some of his biggest fans, a little group of four, yet unrecorded, musicians who we now know as The Beatles. His musical influence is far and wide.His life was a very rocky road and this film covers all that. He died just a few years ago, his legacy is solid.At home, on DVD from my public library.",False
15,n/a,Very good bio on the Rock Pioneer,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"When Little Richard passed on in 2020 most of the news stories followed the familiar tale of the man as one of the founders of rock in the 50s who found religion, dropped out and then came back to the ""devil's music"". This film does a good job fleshing out Richard's story and delve deep into his background and the full arc of his life and career.The CNN film paints a pretty detailed picture of Richards' complicated life. The doc highlights the central tension of his sexuality and 'evils' of rock n roll versus his religious upbringing. He had at least two major breaks from pop music which damaged his career commercially (he never again had a Top 40 single after first leaving rock in the late 50s). Richards' homosexuality was never truly hidden, but he himself was a contradiction by marrying a woman and renouncing his own lifestyle at times. It haunted him until the very end.Despite his up and down career as a musician, his influence was phenomenal and both docs have testimonials from everyone like Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger to David Bowie. John Waters states that his pencil mustache is his decades long tribute to Richards' trademark 'stache. One of the ""villains"" of the piece is Pat Boone, who did toned down covers of Richards' songs to greater commercial success with white audiences.",False

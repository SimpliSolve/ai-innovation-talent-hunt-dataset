1,9,Looks pretty good,johnral321,n/a,16/08/2025,"On the surface, this is a very good documentary showing the power and bias of the media and of the establishment in determining the outcome of elections. It seems to be fairly neutral and honest. I would like to see any reviews with specific critiques (rather than a broad-based critique) of the facts portrayed in this piece. Absent such a specific criticism, this is an outstanding documentary. Also provides valuable insight into political process and campaigns. And provides fascinating detail on Bernie's campaign and politics in particular. Overall impression is that elections are decided by a few persons in power who control the narrative. Did not want to write quite this much but the box said I needed 600 characters....",False
2,10,The Media has Failed America,jonaqpetla,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Propaganda machinery has won again, making sure someone loses even when the population supports all of his issues. Shows the terrifying power of the corporations, and captures the timeline of Bernie 2020 campaign beautifully. This one should be viewed by everyone for educational purposes.",False
3,10,Totally unacceptable. And a must watch.,everseescanners,n/a,16/08/2025,"What the Democratic Party, the media and the wealthy fear is not that Bernie couldn't beat Trump, it's that Bernie would beat Trump, transform the Democratic Party, and transform the country. This is a fierce look at Bernie Sanders 2020 bid for presidency. It shows how the mainstream media and the party itself works against a candidate with such progressive values. I implore everyone to watch it. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll get very mad.",False
4,1,Propaganda,faerch,n/a,16/08/2025,"I decided to watch this program because I thought it was an objective journalistic piece of work. To my disappointment it is one-sided propaganda. It's exactly what the ""documentary"" is speaking against, very much double standard.",False

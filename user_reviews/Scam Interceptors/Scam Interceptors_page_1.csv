1,8,Interesting,keithnwright,n/a,16/08/2025,"Useful warnings in this. I wonder if the Indian authorities' raid on BBC offices in India was retaliation for targeting these scam offices. Obviously, on the instructions of potentially corrupt people. It would seem likely that having been targeted by the BBC the operator of these scam call centres would wish to find a way to stop or distract any outfit investigating what they are up to!

2,10,"Superb, Gripping Public Service Television",mlefaye,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who has fallen victim to scammers, I was immediately interested in seeing the new daytime show 'Scam Interceptors', launched in April, 2022. My own experience was horrible and had a huge effect on my confidence, so I was hoping that SI would help counteract this appalling criminal activity.As it turned out, I greatly underestimated the effectiveness of the programme. Not only does it give invaluable consumer advice, but shows the drama of the scams as they are happening. There is tremendous tension as these callous and heartless criminals attempt to steal from victims, most of whom are amongst the most vulnerable people in society. The BBC team led by Rav Wilding and Nick Stapleton strive desperately to stop these innocent and trusting people losing their savings. The scammers are relentless and have no scruples, so it is no easy task. I am delighted that the occasions in which scams succeed, are not shown. It would be too heartbreaking. In contrast, the feeling of satisfaction and elation, when the scam is thwarted, is massive.Massive credit goes to Rav, Nick and the whole team. They are sensitive, caring and doing a great job on our behalf. Certainly what SI does is a drop in the ocean against the monumental tide of fraud perpetrated by these scammers, but boy does it feel good to see these small victories.I was delighted to see SI get a richly deserved BAFTA nomination and a promotion to a prime time slot. Highly recommended.",False
3,6,Interesting but far too repetitive,keefuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"See one episode, then you basically have seen them all. Each episode has 2 or 3 very similar internet ""intercepted SCAMS""
However each episode also has a story about real life, non internet, scam or activity. These vary episode by episode and so often more watchable than the repetitive internet scams that are supposed to be the main stories.",False

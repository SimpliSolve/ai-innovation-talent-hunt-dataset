1,7,Interesting...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Lost Temple of the Inca"" is a Documentary in which we watch an intriguing journey to uncover the secrets of an ancient Incan temple hidden deep within the Andes. This documentary combines stunning visuals with the mystery of long-lost civilizations, as a team of explorers and archaeologists attempt to locate and investigate the remains of this elusive structure.I enjoyed this documentary because it did a great job of immersing the audience in the awe-inspiring landscapes of Peru, with breathtaking shots of the mountains and the dense jungle. The exploration of Incan history and culture is fascinating, offering new insights into a civilization that continues to captivate historians and adventurers alike. The documentary sometimes lacks the depth needed to truly engage viewers beyond the surface level mainly because of the limited time. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Lost Temple of the Inca"" is an enjoyable and informative documentary not only for history enthusiasts and those fascinated by the mysteries of the past but also everyone who is interested on Incas and their history. In addition to this, I highly recommend everyone to watch this documentary because I am sure that you will learn something by it.",False
2,5,Typical sensationalist storytelling,TheRealSylar,n/a,16/08/2025,While there is some great content to this program. There's some interesting information about the difficulties of diving at high altitude and the threat of mining. Yet this should be called the Lost Pot of the Inca. The narrator is very annoying as well as the way they try to build excitement for discovering very little. We should take care when discarding pots in case someone tries to make a program like this about in a few hundred years time.,False
3,1,National Geographic at it worst,jjhaacker,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was more about the Sowell and his self promotion than anything about archeology or history. What a shameful presentation by National Geographic, this could have actually included some real work in the area but the sensationalism is atrocious, the people of Peru should stay away from predatory productions like this one. Almost zero interest content unless you want to hear about the unknown Solwell and his struggles to get agency in life. Save yourself some time and find a better documentary, this one stinks right from production to edition to actually following what teams might be doing in the field. This is all about Solwel and he's just not that interesting.",False

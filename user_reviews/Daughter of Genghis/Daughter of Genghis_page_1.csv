1,8,Unique and universal,TheRealMarQs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched on Swedish public televisions streaming site. A documentary about a mongol single mother and her son over a course of several years.I'm happy and grateful that this came my way and offered me this glimpse into two other people´s life, hardships and emotions. They live in a land far away and their lives are theirs uniquely, and at the same time the themes are so familiar.In the case of Gerel, there is also one thing that makes this documentary a little special, and that is the fact that she is basically a fascist thug. I truly enjoy being presented with a protagonist that is superficially unsympathetic.This documentary is sometimes really painful to watch, because of Gerel´s life choices, but it is ultimately a celebration of love and healing.My favourite scene is probably the one where Temuulen, using spotless child logic and clearsightedness, explains to Gerel how everyone in the wolrd is just a friend you haven´t been introduced to yet. Yes, even the chinese! Gave me a massive nostalgic swoon because I remebered using exactly the same logic to reach how there is no separation in the world :)The only thing I didn´t love about it is that I really would have liked a little more basic information. Like when, who, where. Just simple little signs in the screen to tell us where they are, how much time has went since we last saw them, who are they with.... This is so typical of documantaries nowadays, the viewer is supposed to either don´t care about such trivial things, or just deduce them...but to me, the absence of teh concrete becomes distracting.",False

1,7,"Much Good, But About a Third Padding",J_B_Bees,n/a,15/08/2025,"A career perspective of anarcho punk and anarcho pop band Chumbawumba from one of its lead members, with most of the other members in it also. From their idealistic days as squatters and activists in every demonstration they could take part in to trying to find a larger audience by gradually adding melody and writing pop songs. This is a good look at them with lots of footage even longtime fans and supporters likely haven't seen before.Where it fails often is in it central premise. A lot of asking ""What am I doing? Am I still relevant at this age?"" And the annoying baby head character ranting in a distorted voice. I get why they did this. Putting down their longtime critics like the pretentious and unimportant NME as childish, cliched, and whiners.Yes, they are, for anyone who doesn't insist all artists shut up and only entertain and be brainless. But this is pretty irritating. I kept fast forwarding every time the baby head showed up.And at the end of a montage of ""Tub Thumping"" covers, from hardcore punks to church choirs to women folk singers to ska to Japanese horrorcore to many many more, even videos made during the Covid lockdown. This only underscores just how widespread their appeal was with their sole hit. The film needed more of that.",False
2,10,A worthy addition to the pantheon of punk documentaries,BLEACHEDC,n/a,15/08/2025,"From a squat in Leeds, to finding the eyes of the world upon them...but what does one do when all that's over, and the dust settles?What did it mean, if anything? Did they sell out? Can anyone involved still make a difference? Can one find integrity and peace as an old radical in this foul age?This honest, fun, and ultimately moving documentary asks these questions and more, mostly of singer Dunstan Bruce, but the rest of the band also get their say.Along the way others such as Crass's Penny Rimbaud and director Ken Loach also voice their opinions. The newest generation of angry young punks also turn up to take the torch.For anyone interested in punk, the 90's, activism, or just simply getting older with some pride and a sense of relevance, this documentary is for you. It was certainly for me - good stuff!Time to break out those old vinyls!",False

1,6,Cute U.S. Tour Diary; Not Much Else,ellaferrier-85697,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know ""Our Lost Summer"" was promoted this way, but I thought at least there would be more of a deep-dive into the artists' lives during the tour, but there wasn't much emotion or biography; it was mostly just following them around in the U. S. for 1 hour and 22 minutes. I love all of TXT and think their passion is great, but I would have preferred more of how the members were feeling. There weren't enough sit down interviews, and of the sit down interviews, they were clearly heavily edited. I did not expect much from this, but Lollapalooza was shown with a big weight throughout the promotion, so I assumed it would have at least half an hour of screen time. I was wrong.Other than there not being much of a reason to call it a documentary, I love the reason why they called the doc ""Our Lost Summer"". It's a play on two of their songs ""Our Summer"" and ""We Lost the Summer"" as well as paying homage to the MOAs after TXT lost so much time with them during the pandemic. I think the thought of the documentary was cute, and it definitely had many lovely, laughable and heartfelt moments.I wish the boys good luck on their second round of Lollapalooza this year as headliners. May you prosper through all your hardships.Fighting!",False

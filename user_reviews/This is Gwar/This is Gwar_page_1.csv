1,9,A great music documentary in its own way,errol_rocks,n/a,16/08/2025,"How to describe GWAR? Barbarian, alien warriors coming to earth? A very underrated band, like Mot√∂rhead and Rose Tattoo once called from some people who have no idea of music the worst band in the world, when in fact GWAR is just like the other two bands mentioned musically brilliant with a great show and the favourite band of Beavis and Butt-Head, with even some Grammy nominations. For people living outside of the US it is hard to understand this whole freedom of speech or freedom to express in their performance and art problem, getting dropped by a record label, cuddlefish taken by police, not a big case as the 2 Live Crew ones loosing the first court case, but more importantly for music winning the second and third court case against Navarro. From a music documentary perspective not a top notch one like Searching for Sugar Man, but there is a lot to like and a lot to love about this music documentary, I am still giving it a 9/10. Arts and music are not always about money, keep loosing band members is difficult and they still keep going on and on, a very honest in depth documentary, it is just what they love to do, with a lot of passion, it is their life, at times very emotionally.",False
2,9,"Beautiful, intimate documentary of a fascinating band",gregcaw,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this knowing that GWAR were that band that ate Mark in Empire Records, and was what Beavis and Butthead watched a lot in their TV show, but absolutely no knowledge of them otherwise.I finished it with tears streaming down my face and a new-found appreciation for the music.A wonderful chronology of the bands' history told from the perspective of the myriad various members and collaborators that shaped their trajectory over the years, this feels like a very personal love-letter to the band as told by some fans and lot of the band members past and present.Is it just me who got incredible Sid Barret vibes FROM Dave Brockie? An immense talent that was thankfully able to spend decades expressing his vision, and for that I am grateful.Highly recommended.",False
3,7,I remember them,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"GWAR is a heavy metal band formed in Richmond, Virginia in 1984. Most are outcasts from art school where their heavy metal comic book style are dismissed. They don wild costumes of self-created comic characters while playing their music. This is a documentary detailing the parade of different members over the years as they gather a small loyal following. Sure, I remember GWAR back in the day. I remember seeing them on TV in the early 90's. It always felt like a gimmick, but I can see how people can fall in love as fans. I don't know these people and I'm not that invested in their stories. I do get the sense of joy and satisfaction of being in the band. It's the story of all indie bands who ride on stinky buses across the country and sleeping on the floor. The film is fine. It's charming in its sweet sincerity.",False
4,10,GWARRRRRRRRRRRRRRR,Joeolejniczak,n/a,16/08/2025,If you love GWAR you'll love this documentary. I can't believe it's taken so long to get such a great road map of the legendary band. Makes me even more proud of being a Richmonder. Such an important band that can never be replicated! RIP Dave. MUST WATCH!!,False
5,10,"THIS IS GWAR, NOW BOW!",elliottambrosio,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm Bohab #234,958,683,842. I am biased because I love our lord and masters, GWAR, but, since I'm here, I might as well mention that this was one of the greatest rockumentaries I've ever laid my pathetic eyes on. Watching them murder and slay as they talk about their rise to fame is so enticing and thrilling. GWAR will forever reign supreme. Bow to your kings! Hail GWAR!For real though, watch this film. 11/10.",False
6,6,Long,josephjanz,n/a,16/08/2025,This was educational and I am a fan of the band but this should have been about 30 minutes shorter. I did like the interviews but a lot of the content seemed redundant.,False
7,10,Finest example of American Artist counter culture Do it Yourself Spirit.,zgystrdstsrjc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've loved GWAR since I found out about them and bought Scumdogs of the Universe in the early 90s.There concerts were always next level. Early in the 90s how the band functioned was a little more mysterious, you had to dig into fan forums and little personal web sites to learn anything about the actual band, unless you were lucky enough to catch Dave out of costume front of stage, or Hunter hanging out at the Merch table.Really learning how this artists cooperative functioned and dysfunctioned, makes me appreciate GWAR even more.A couple things that I would have liked to see a little more insight into were, when did the friction between Hunter and Dave really start?What was Dave's mental state near his accidental overdose? Zach Blair stated that there were signs of decline in Dave's work ethic, over a decade before. I can only imagine the collision of being a high energy person like Dave Brockie, and living on the road for decades must wear on even the strongest people.Absolutely a must watch if you care anything about musical and artistic counter culture.",False
8,5,A dream and a cuddlefish,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler17 year old me discovered Gwar and life finally made sense. What other band outright claimed that they were going to murder you when you saw them in concert? Coming from space, destroying the ozone layer, that had game shows on stage that gave the people what they want - ""the senseless slaughter of the gutter-slime that litters this nation for cash and prizes"" - and could somehow turn lyrics like ""you know I snuffed a million planets, but I still find time to cry"" into a tender ballad?Gwar went on Joan Rivers and made fun of everything thrown at them. And in a world that didn't make much sense, they made sense. It was a badge of honor to see them in concert. Sure, the band has changed - I haven't kept up honestly since Oderus went on to the next world because it just doesn't feel the same - but I'm glad they're still out there.Director Scott Barber has put together the interviews and stories that form the real story of Gwar and by and large, it's intriguing stuff, punctuated by stories by celebrity fans like Weird Al, Thomas Lennon, Bam Margera, Alex Winter and Ethan Embry.As an art collective with a 35-year history, there's plenty to learn here about how some art school punks went from playing small shows to becoming an industry. Of course, personalities clashed, egos grew and the band may not have lived up to what some members wanted it to be. By the end of the first sixty minutes, the doc starts to grind a bit, as various members feel the urge to tell you exactly how much they contributed even if they weren't onstage. I understand, as this may be their one opportunity to do so.A major oversight - in my eyes - is that no mention at all was given to new singer Vulvatron, played by Kim Dylla, who was in the band from 2014 to 2016, leaving under not the best of terms. Perhaps by the end of the film, everyone was tired of the constant drama that was getting dredged up. But for a band with previously only two female members, this felt like a glaring omission.Even if Gwar's music isn't for you, you can hopefully appreciate their sense of humor and the fact that they took their art beyond expectations. They still do.",True

1,6,Very good fitness video,luke_abbott,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full of surprises and motivation! Andy Blithe's documentary Make a Habit - Break a Habit, is a good laugh and creates inspiration to the average Joe. Liked his character as Sergeant Banter, with his van, and how he orchestrates a trial of exercises for people of all ages. Great outdoor activities and games for the trainees. Also shows a deep impact from the guests as they share emotions and get personal about their struggles of weight gain. A great film to watch. I'm going to show this film to all my friends. Thank you for this film Andy! Please keep making more. Perhaps a sequel would be in the pipeline.",False

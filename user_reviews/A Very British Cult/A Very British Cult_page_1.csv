1,6,Solid yet overly long and often meandering.,jackgoodway-45819,n/a,16/08/2025,"As with many BBC serial podcast, this is very much drawn out, perhaps especially so. The four hour running is very much unnecessary and hard to justify.The titles is rather misleading, as there is nothing distinctively British about the cult - as the show itself points out the influences of the cult are very much American self help guru's of tghe1990's - ""the decade of self help""- which The South African leader of ""Lighthouse"" Paul Waugh corrupts. There is a conversation where a talking head claims ""most British people think cults are from USA and wear long orange robes"". So maybe it's just the fact the cult is based in Britain, that makes it ""very British"".",False
2,2,Scratching for substance,rugbyislife-88260,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cults are a fascinating subject matter and often misunderstood, however this documentary lacks any substance. Comes across as more of a drama series than investigative journalism. This documentary comes across as a lover's tiff rather than the title suggests. Some interesting parts but ultimately let down. One-sided subjective arguments. Where is the argument for both sides? Why did the complainants not go to the police? Seems very strange. Is there a follow-up as to what has happened since this production? Would be great to see these documentaries do a follow-up ""then and now"" scenario. That would be interesting.",False

1,7,A Different Kind of Documentary,Osibob,n/a,15/08/2025,"Less of a traditional documentary (biographical facts) and more of homage to Cudi, contributed too by his contemporaries and those who he influenced. How does Cudi's music make you feel and how does Cudi himself feel? Is the major question posed in this documentary.While I would've like a bit less ""feel"" and more ""fact,"" I still enjoyed it and liked the fact; much like Cudi, the film wasn't afraid of being different.",False
2,9,INSPIRING AS HELL,rkbblogger,n/a,15/08/2025,This doc was incredible even if you aren't a fan of this mans music please watch this he has saved and helped millions of children you never know when you could need a helping hand !,False
3,9,Inspiring,riteshjshekar,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kid Cudi's music has always been therapeutic. Whenever i feel low i put on ""Man On The Moon"" and relax. This documentry tells u the story of Cudi and highs and lows. Its just super inspiring to see how Cudi dealt with mental health and drug issues. Also loved it when Cudi spoke about his and Kanye's relationship.",False
4,10,MySpace To The World,nrgigaba,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am not much of a Kid Cudi fan. I know his popular radio hits and affiliation to Kanye West including the fact that he inspired Travis Scott so much he named himself after him. I've also seen his famous TedTalk where he addresses his mental health issues but not with the vulnerability of this documentary.Not only to you hear accounts of his close friends and collaborators but fans and how his music has changed him for the better. The documentary is beautifully shot and edited. If you don't watch this for the inspirational story, you should watch it for the cinematography.",False
5,10,"An Energetic, Profound Look at Scott Mescudi",angelhinojos,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a long time fan of Scott Mescudi (Kid Cudi) I couldn't of asked for anymore, such a powerful and emotional look at one of the most influential artists of this generation, a true pioneer for a lot of artists today. For Die-Hard fans, newcomers and everything in between, this is a must watch!",False
6,6,"Excellent ""expos√©"" of the life of Kid Cudi",andrewscasey-75279,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI grew up with his music, and it really resonated with me, so it was cool to get a parallel with other people, even influential ones, in describing how much Cudi's music meant in their lives. It's amazing in humanity how when we share our pain with others, everyone gets healed.It was a bummer that they didn't include certain songs/albums for a more full picture of Cudi's works up to this point, but it was a truly inspiring documentary.",True
7,10,It's OK to be sad,iamfreeeeee,n/a,15/08/2025,"Scott's story is truly inspiring. To anyone reading this that's going through something, I highly recommend checking this out- I couldn't help myself but feeling absolutely motivated and optimistic about life after watching this brilliant doc.""There's more to life than this moment""",False
8,10,I cried.,vpcrftjfzh,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the most influential human beings and he had such an positive impact of my life, even though we never met.This documentary is the most human thing I have watched and felt in these fake days of society. It catches all the Ups and Downs of Cudi's carrier so far and it underlines his underestimated importance really well.It brought me to tears. Good job.",False
9,n/a,I saw this when i was feeling down,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Something that we all can relate to but never want to go back. It is difficult to find light when all you have inside is darkened by yourself and blocked by your surroundings. Even if you are a rockstar and you rise, there is still something missing, there is still the pressure of changing the world. Leaders are like that.",False
10,4,"Some good moments, lots of filler",m-50103,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some good moments, namely the interviews with those who worked with Cudi early on and the original handycam footage.What I didn't like was the overuse of other artists like Jaden Smith in those silly scenes where he is acting as if he is Kid Cudi, ridiculous and unnecessary fluff. Just felt like this doco had too much filler, could have used more original footage or behind the scenes moments to show his career, I really don't care what the Smith kids have to say about Kid Cudi.This is style over substance, trying to make something ""artistic"" just turns it into a bit of a skippable snoozefest.",False
11,10,GREAT WORK SCOTT,jessemulderij,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary shows how amazing our big brother Scott Mescudi is, we all have our ups and downs in life. But in the end we are all in this together. Thank you Scott. You saved my life.",False
12,10,We love you Cudi!!!,hamiltonjosh-55306,n/a,15/08/2025,Most amazing man in the musical industry. Completly revolutionary concept in what you have accomplished in aiding your fans on their journey called life.,False
13,8,Love Cudi,petebaker-61770,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was really good, love Cudi but beware, this documentary teases all the time but never deliver even 45 seconds of a song you can get into, we all know the songs but they never get out the way and let you enjoy them!Definitely watch, just don't expect to nod along - could have been so much better if there wasn't some kind of music rights issue with Amazon.",False
14,9,"""Inspiring"" is definitely the best word to describe this documentary.",meeeert,n/a,15/08/2025,"Cudi is undoubtedly one of the best and most influential artists of his generation. I wasn't a big fan of Cudi initially, but the more I got to know him, the more I admired him. He has a unique ability to connect with people, something that many of today's artists struggle to achieve.The documentary doesn't simply explain his career or life; instead, it tells his story in a more enthusiastic way. I believe that the best way to understand an artist is through their experiences-what they felt while creating an album, the challenges they faced in their lives, and so on. This approach adds enthusiasm and creativity to the documentary, while also providing valuable insights and perspectives. It's not just for Cudi fans; it's also for people who are facing struggles in their lives-those who may have experienced depression, feeling of lost or are in search of new paths.",False
15,8,And in between,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just recently saw Kid Cudi in the movie X - I have to admit aside from his musical career, I was not too aware of him. I didn't even recognize him on the poster of the movie I saw him in (horror movie, quite good one, you can read my review on it too if you like).If you want to get behind him and his career this is a good place to start. Since I knew little, the documentary really worked for me. I can't say how it is for anyone who is fully tuned into the story of .. well the man named Scott - no pun intended Kid Cudi. He been working Day and night - not on his grammar though - just kidding. You also get to see the evolution and how this song came about.What and how people who work with and for him think of him ... it is quite the decent documentary and quite the interesting look behind the scenes ... if you are interested of course.",False
16,4,A bit disappointed,knsd-46839,n/a,15/08/2025,I really like Cudi. But the fact that the documentary about Scott and not Cudi doesn't go in any details to what his life was before being Kid Cudi is kinda annoying. I feel like a lot of the reasons why he does his music are then not explained. He just seems like a guy who does music for the fame.,False
17,5,A Cudi Fluff Piece,spacecrimebeatz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was an ok rundown of Kid Cudi's history as an artist. However they constantly refer to him as being so influential for ""expressing emotion"" and how groundbreaking that was for rap. Cudi took what had always existed in the underground and gave it more pop and mainstream appeal. I would much rather see a documentary about Blackalicious or Eternal Reflection, groups that have countless thoughtful and emotional records.The documentary also frames Cudi as someones music who is so profound it has saved countless lives.Fans need to quit this type of over exaggeration.It takes so much more than a Cudi record to get out of a bad place when dealing with depression.So its ok as a timeline of what he has done in his career, but also merely average because of all the over exaggeration and strange reenactments with Will Smiths kids.",False

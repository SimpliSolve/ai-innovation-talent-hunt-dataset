1,8,"Sentimental, heartfelt, memorable look at classic memories of the Banks family!",blanbrn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This latest ""HBO Max"" doc ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Reunion"" is one well done heart warming emotional get together with the cast as they take a look back at their days as the Banks family! Done in a discussion set style the cast talks about the 6 seasons of their sitcom as it's full of a montage of highlights hard to believe it's been 30 years wow times flies when people are having fun. Head star Will Smith does most of the taking along with words from cast members Jazzy Jeff, Alfonso Ribeiro, and plus the still attractive and elegant beautiful gals Tatyana Ali and Karyn Parsons! This reunion and get together has plenty of funny highlights and strong loving memories as it shows tears in the cast members eyes. Only fitting and touching is a tribute to late cast member James Avery. Overall well done and funny entertaining look back at one classic family of a great 90's sitcom a must watch for any fan of the series or TV buff!",False
2,9,Thanks..,qubeck,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you for reminding me of my youth. Maybe I live in a far country, but it was the most fun and trace show in my life. It made me cry too. It was a nice meeting. R.I.P James Avery.",False
3,9,Emotional Look Back At An Iconic Show,Theedg3,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJoin the cast of one of the best sitcoms of all time for an emotional look down memory lane through the highs, lows and hilarious moments. The cast we loved from Bel Air all are back for a reunion that is perfectly done, in my opinion this was done better than any new season could have been.You see Will, Carlton, Our Two Aunt Vivs (Janet is terrific), Geoffrey, Ashley, Jeff all back in the environment they thrived in. We even get a nice appearance at the end from Nicky. You cannot talk about the show without mentioning the rock, the foundation Mr James Avery. The tribute to the beloved Phillip Banks is very emotional and the cast really tells us how much he meant to the show. What a legend.Its great to see the cast back on the set shooting the breeze, remembering the finest moments, cracking on each other. The interviews, stories are interesting and give a lot of us fans something new to talk about.Will and Janet finally meeting after an almost 30 year feud is a memorable moment, you can see how Janet was effected by what happened on the show. She did not hold back, hashed things out with Will in what felt like a genuine moment that will be adored by Fresh fans.This is how legendary sitcoms should come back. Bring the tissues because this one will get you emotional like Wills father leaving.",True
4,10,What a Reunion!,dwelsh-247-907002,n/a,16/08/2025,"What more can you ask for in a Reunion? We got closure, questions were answered, rumors were cleared up, and a tribute to the late great James Avery brought us to tears. Here's to 30 years!",False
5,10,IF YOU CAME TO LAUGH PREPARE TO CRY,Tokeokid,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was thee best reunion I have yet to see on any show. The tears I shed brought me back to the 90's but opened me up for the future. The display of healing that took place on that reconstructed set brought a joy to my heart. Time, growth, and maturity took 27 years to bring understanding to a misunderstood moment. It makes you consider your own moments and if you misunderstood anyone in your sphere of influence. Black excellence on so many beautiful layers. Thank you",False
6,10,The new Gold Standard of Reunions,derickcrooms,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was so well done. There are so many shows from this era that bring back nostalgic memories for so many of us. But when shows are canceled, actors move on. Sets are broken down. And ""real life"" goes on... for all of us.But what I think this reunion did was capture and remind us of the essence of a fictional TV family lived out by the real life people who played them. And there is no greater evidence of that than the reconciliation of the relationship between Will and Janet Hubert!Now THAT'S art imitating life!",False
7,10,Beyond what I expected!,alexbogue3889,n/a,16/08/2025,Literally everyone who was a star on the show was in attendance. The tributes and flashbacks were nothing short of amazing. Be prepared to both laugh and cry.,False
8,7,Good old memories,amiruz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerReally nice and emotional memories if you have been watching this in the 90s. Felt really sorry for Janet, she went through so much pain, and Will basically distroyed her career simply by saying difficult to work with, that is so said to hear her say to Will that he destroyed her life.",True
9,10,So glad they did this!,BirdzOfParadise,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent!!! Oh the memories! And so glad they were able to get the whole cast back, sans James Avery may he RIP.",False
10,6,Justice for Hubert,sstidham-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"The way he treated Janet Hubert, and derailed her career, speaks to the kind of scum he is.Overall an awkward and rehearsed reunion, watch for the Janet bits, everything else will make you squirm in a different way.",False
11,10,GRAB YOUR TISSUES,javendwb,n/a,16/08/2025,If your a fan it's time to cry. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­RIP Uncle Phil,False
12,2,"Awkward to watch, honestly",Tess1818-,n/a,16/08/2025,"The reunion plus re-watching the show made me realize what it did for Will's ego. Something about it all didn't feel genuine from his part, even if the words were well put. And this is coming from someone who actually used to really like his persona behind the character while growing up..I'd recommend watching it mostly for the rest of the cast - like Janet H. - that deserve as much applause, or even more",False
13,10,Remembering greatness,aichi-369-825813,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was very happy watching reunion 30 years latter, because you could actualy see how actors grew up, mostly on personality level. Show was pristine, emotinal and most of all I am very happy that they included Janet Hubert, as all bad things parallel to that great show of 90s finaly disapeared...",False
14,10,Fresh breath of air!,zutigad,n/a,16/08/2025,"After another day at work in this pandemic and under mask this reunion shines bright and takes us to some better times. I am 31 years old but i grow up with this show, and when I saw how much they put effort in James Avery memory tears just started and lasted till end. Fresh prince and cast of it were light back then, but now when I think of many hours watching these guys that light just shines brigher!",False
15,10,ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,jkmac-11003,n/a,16/08/2025,Literally in tears!!! This brought back so many childhood memories and I cannot stop crying. I absolutely loved this show when it was on and all I can say is have tissues and don't watch with your wife like I did! She'll just joke you for being sensitive. Lol. Great show! Thank you to all who made this Reunion happen!,False
16,10,Awesome,Foutainoflife,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show was such a big part of my teen years! I absolutely loved it. This reunion was so touching and if you loved the show, you should check it out.",False
17,10,A beautiful piece of history,studioginger,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to admit that this reunion made me smile and emotionally travelling to my youth.
A true blast from the past, and I have to say well done to all the cast, the technical team, and the director.
It's a true gem seeing that the cast is still so close and still remembering, what (apart being the best show on air) a truly life changing experience this has been for them.
Said so.. Just watch it!!!",False
18,10,Just cried my eyes out.,mywakinglife01,n/a,16/08/2025,I've always been a massive Fresh Prince of Bel Air fan since I was 8 years old. This reunion was so sweet and heartwarming and pretty much everything I expected it to be the second I heard this was being released. I definitely cried my eyes out. Highly recommend.,False
19,n/a,I can see that they had fun,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a good reunion, as the stars watch their performances from 27 years ago and reminisce the good times they had. Though I haven't watched the show before, I can see that they had a great time filming it decades ago.",False
20,4,Really reminds me of when I liked will smith,chrisrowexxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show definitely wasn't as iconic as hindsight makes you believe, popular no doubt but think the Smith hype distorted what was just a good sitcom into something it wasn't. There were great moments, brilliant character development but for me it was just good, I like rewatching stuff like saved by the bell but this doesn't bother me too much.It became a vehicle for smith rather than a great ensemble, Carlton had the dance, Ashley the odd rap, then rest had small roles in the show. The respect to uncle Phil was lovely, he was great, RIP. So this documentary came out and straight off it was just the will smith show, it felt like a star thanking people who help make him rather than a team. Bar the James Avery moment, this was just more arrogance from smith like in shark week or YT, he just tries to seem like he's in, every generation he tries, I went from being a huge fan to missing films to just thinking he's a bit in love with himself, has an odd wife and kids who should've been protected BetterNice to reminisce I guess but I genuinely think people think they liked this more than they did at the time. If this hadn't of been smith I doubt this show would be remembered much at all, judging by the lacklustre careers the rest all had, sums it up",False
21,10,Really really touched my heart.,fernando-cardelle,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am from Spain. I remember when i was 13 yo and the show was Aired in Spain. Every day from monday to friday after a Simpson's epidode. I grew up seeing the Bunks family. Now after 30 years you can see It in our Tv.
I am a Will Smith fan, I like he as a person.
I cried some times while I was seeing the reunion specially the part of remembering James Avery. I felt like he was my uncle too. I think that everybody wanted to hace an uncle like him on his live.
Beautiful moment too the meeting between Will and the first Aunt Vivian. Very very painful moment. I Hope Will Smith takes care of her. She deserves a second chance. Great documentary.
PD: Karyn Parsons stills being Hot. Ou mamÃ¡.",True
22,9,"""Nobody every asked me if I could act.""",drewnes,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel like this is how every TV show reunion should be, or at least they should all learn a thing or two from this one. As an avid fan that has seen the whole show a few times, I can say this was truly made for the fans and in a way it seemed therapeutic for the actors as well. A must watch.",False
23,10,Absolutely magnificent!!,cgray5605,n/a,16/08/2025,"Almost brought a tear to my eye in a good way!! Very well done!! I grew up watching this show as a kid, fell in love with it the moment I saw it. This reunion special brought me back to those wonderful days back when tv was actually watchable!! Well done Will Smith and gang, beautifully done!!!!!",False
24,9,Now this is a reunion,dan-salomao,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a show, I love Friends way more than Fresh Prince, which is not to say that I haven't had great moments watching it growing up. But when it comes to reunions, this takes the crown. All that felt forced and unnatural in the Friends reunion is the opposite here.They seem to remember each moment, scene and line from 30 years ago as if it were last year and you could feel sincerity in the tears shed by them, unlike the Friends cast which hardly remembered even what happened in some classic episodes and felt like we're just emotional on cue.Even if you didn't love this show it will feel warm in the heart to see how their relationship really resembles a family (even with the very powerful reconciliation between long estranged ones) and the ""in memoriian "" to James Avery.",True
25,10,Excellent.,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI agree with a previous reviewer - this is the gold standard now for sitcom reunions, and the people behind the upcoming 'Friends' one had better have been taking notes.This was wonderful stuff, funny (of course), and surprisingly moving.A fitting tribute to the show, the much missed James Avery, and a wonderful opportunity for bridges to be mended between Will Smith and the original Aunt Viv (Janet Hubert).Thanks to the BBC for showing this in the UK.",True

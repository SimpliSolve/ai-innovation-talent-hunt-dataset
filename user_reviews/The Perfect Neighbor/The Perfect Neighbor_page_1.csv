1,8,It's always the trivial things,Thatmovieguy144,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe perfect neighbor is in fact about NOT the perfect neighbor, but the story of a trivial dispute gone violent and the events that led up to it. This film is entirely told with police body camera footage, interviewing both parties involved. It was never more wiser that the film lets the footage leading up to the events speak for themselves,rather than narrating over top of it. The whole film is filled tension with if we're going to see an altercation between the neighbors. The interviews add to a frustrating sense of injustice that you hear in all of the neighbors being involved with each interview process. The perfect neighbor is infuriating and heartbreaking look at the unjustified murder and what led to it.",True
2,10,One of the most infuriating and important documentaries in the recent events of America,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Infuriating is best described about this documentary. Because it succeeds with demonstrating how inhumane Florida's stand your ground law has created on society and about violence and systemic racism in the United States. Filmed using footage from police body cam, the filmmakers are able to explore how the gun issues in the United States have become problematic and the systematic racism surrounding.Focusing on the murder of Ajike Owens, the documentary doesn't shy away from the truth. Without using interviews or narration, it cleverly uses the body cam footage and live recordings from the beginning and what led to Owen's death to allow the video and truth to speak for itself. Not only does it explore about how inhumane the laws are, but also about how gun violence is such a big problem in the United States and it's affect on people and society itself.It's harrowing portray is both frustrating, emotional, and rage-enduing. The idea of one innocent person was murdered all because of a racist person who can't deal with children normally playing in the streets is just sad. I 100 percent can say this is the best documentary I have seen at Sundance and of this year thus far.",True

1,9,A fitting tribute,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Caroline Ahern was a Britsh comedian, writer, and actress who died tragically young. In summary, it sounds like an ordinary, sad story, but this documentary is well worth watching. It reminds you of her talent (her live takedown of the racist Bernard Manning while acting in character was brilliant); tells you of her background (in which her comedy was grounded) and her genuine struggles first to make it, and then to handle success (which, as someone who doesn't read the tabloids, I was mostly ignorant of); and also conveys how she was genuinely loved by everyone she met (Manning excepted). As a tribute, it's funny and moving, two things that were also true of her best work.",False

What a wonderful tribute to a remarkable genius (literally). She had an IQ of 156. But a genius comic, writer and a wholly loveable, and well loved northern lass.This documentary really honours her and has some truly laugh out loud as well as some literal tearjerking moments.It interviews many of her lifelong friends, colleagues and peers. I ended up feeling like I knew her personally once it was over.If you can find this on iplayer or wherever you can, I'd urge you to watch it if you enjoyed watching Caroline when she was Mrs Merton or Denise in the Royal Family. I had to burst out laughing when it showed her on the Fast Show doing her bit as a weather presenter and she kept saying ""Scorchio"" when she was putting the symbols on the map. I still say scorchio to this day. Bless her.A remarkable documentary, and a fitting tribute to a beautiful soul, who also happened to be comic gold.",False
3,10,Comedy Legend,keefydiy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this last night, a perfect tribute from those who loved her & knew her best.Always had a huge crush on Caroline, I confess I love funny women, my best friend is one LMAO@Sarah ü§£‚ù§
Made me laugh and cry, but was beautiful to see how loved she was by her real life friends, and friends/colleagues she worked with.Well worth a watch, if a fan of her comedy, but also for the unseen stuff about her life.The memories of 'The Royal Family' after all these years bring even more poignancy to the characters, the writing was as good as it gets.Also a good reminder that the tabloids are scum!",False

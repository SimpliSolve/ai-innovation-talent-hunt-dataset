1,9,Disturbing but important document,CineCineCineCine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is incredibly shocking but also a must see for parents who allow their teenagers unrestricted access to the net. The level of filth the 3 actresses are exposed to in internet chats is unbelievable. I think the most disturbing sentence I've heard for a long time in a documentary is the question, repeated over and over to these men: are you not bothered I'm only 12? And of course they all say no while they start going about their nasty business.A very moving scene where the actress and part of the crew shed tears during one of those chats will also remain in my memory.",False
2,10,Excellent documentary!,pskynk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched it because of the rating (at the time 8.1). The rating should be 10.This is a down to earth, well done documentary without drama. Just the truth and very shocking, especially towards the end.Recommended for everyone (mind the trigger warning, though), but especially for parents.",False
3,10,"Complete coverage of online minor abuse, especially the emotional aspect",alexanderwoltjen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary does not hold back on how far predators will go. Various tactics are shown including blackmail, coercion and sweet compliments. It also shows the mentalities predators have to justify themselves:It's their parents fault for not raising them rightAs long as it is just chat and I don't touch them, no harm is doneThere are plenty worse things going onI'm not forcing them to do anythingThe 10/10 rating is for the actresses and soundtrack. These women are not teenage girls in reality but still are able to show the raw emotion of someone who is leered at, exploited, and made to feel unsafe. The tears and anger from these actresses reflect a fear and worthlessness felt by children everyday.The soundtrack is not manipulative but instead matches was the view and the actresses are already feeling. It has a ghastly tone that helped me to process how I felt quickly. Throughout the film the viewer is never alone in their amazement, making the true, obscene nature of online predation unquestionable.",False

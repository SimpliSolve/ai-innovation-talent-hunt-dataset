1,10,Blatantly cowardly review bombing,dump123456789,n/a,16/08/2025,"66 out of 83 ratings are 1 out of 10 stars, yet no one has actually submitted a written review. Such obvious astroturfing, especially given the subject of the movie and his political leanings.This is why online audience rating scores mean nothing. They are too easy to manipulate by cowards hiding behind anonymity, especially those who are members of groups that value reality and truth less than they value their chosen fictional narratives.Professional critics who are required to submit written reviews are subject to a higher level of scrutiny than these online trolls, so those critics' reviews are more likely to genuinely reflect the quality of what they are reviewing.",False

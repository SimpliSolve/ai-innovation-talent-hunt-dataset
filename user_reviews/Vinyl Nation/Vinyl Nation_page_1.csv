1,6,I love Records and I love movies but I didn't love this.,Megan_Shida,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie has some great information and they really do provide evidence for their thesis that vinyl is back and accessible to a mainstream and large number of individuals. However, it is just a series of people talking- none of them very interesting, filled with generic PBS style music. Including music by various artists that make us love our vinyl, and interviews with artists we know and other interesting people would have gone a long way. This was more a TV special than a film- it really didn't utilize the medium of a movie.",False
2,n/a,A Look at the Rise and Fall and Rise Again of Vinyl,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This does a brief dive into the trend of vinyl, hearing from vinyl fans and people who work behind the scenes of the production of the vinyl records. I enjoyed seeing the behind the scenes of making of the records, and what some record production businesses go through to ensure the quality is what it should be. Seeing someone going through (very throughly) listening to a vinyl for any issues, and looking for any defects to ensure the best quality is there.What bummed me out: for a documentary that insists record collectors are more than the stereotypical white male collector .. they sure do spend a lot of time with white male collectors.",False
3,10,A Vinyl Lover's Dream,ashleyruffer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Vinyl Nation is such a well done documentary, great interviews, timing, music....it had everything a vinyl lover would want to see in a movie!We loved that it included an emotional component to collecting and listening. Yet also showed pure facts in the history of the industry, as well as the production and engineering of each record.Music and vinyl lovers unite and see this film! Kudos to everyone involved!",False
4,1,Very generic and unnecessary.,zkiko,n/a,16/08/2025,"All of the content has been spoken about again and again before.
They chose to feature all the standard new privileged upper middle class hipsters instead of genuine bonafide diggers. Or at least it would have been cool to have some marginalised weirdo's, real cats, authentic figures in this plain documentary. Spice it up with some peppers mayne!!It's a 101 vinyl is cool and 'look at us being quirky and regurgitating all the clich√©s ,we are sooo quirky and nerdy' documentary. Something nice for the squares.If you want to watch and learn something authentic and sincere about diggin in the crates, go watch 'Scratch'. Also there are some other independent docs on Youtube about vinyl and diggin. Like the Fuse diggers vids for example.Subcultures are being taken over on the daily by the hipsters. Since everything is so accessible nowadays. The privileged take the pro's without having to carry the con's. It's kinda disgusting. It dilutes it all from it's authenticity and leaves it to become a weak plain subtraction. Shame on yall.",False
5,8,Most enjoyable,williamfessler,n/a,16/08/2025,"My favorite part about vinyl - that soft crackle sound when your needle first touches the record; Vinyl Nation reminds me how much I love that sound! Silly, I know. But there are a lot more relatable moments in this documentary; seeing the people and hearing their stories, you will relate.
My first record, my favorite, keeping the player free of dust, visiting Tower Records and thumbing through the stacks looking for that next great album. You will remember, just like I did.
A great, 90-minute show. Deserves your attention.",False
6,1,Tosh,vindalooney,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a record collector. I have never thought of my records in the way these strange menagerie of people think.If ever there is a case of overthinking a situation, this doco, has it covered.I agreed with very little of the way it portrayed peoples association with records. It certainly isn't the experience i had or anyone i know who grew up with records being the only medium to own and play your personal choice of music.There is a small portion of the manufacture interviews, that were factual and iluminating, and the current/ new techniques of manufacturing an album and the sleeve were enlightening.The final question of ""what do you want to happen to your record collection when you die""
Brought about such a state of human rediculous answers, that it capped of wasting 88 minutes of my life that were truly unrewarding.Don't bother, you'll be non the wiser for sitting through this tosh.",False
7,10,Vinyl Nation warmed my heart,susanmcleangrants,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't think I cared about vinyl records--or any audiorecordings, for that matter. But this documentary opened my eyes to a whole subculture of entertainment connoisseurship. This is beautifully filmed movie is multimedia journalism at its best. Unexpected, spontaneous situations happen throughout the film, and the one at the end made me want to hug everyone.",False
8,10,You love Spotify? Watch this!,jmills-43404,n/a,16/08/2025,"A warm and loving look at the people who love records. Not the stereotype of record stores and record collectors, but the humans who like to touch their music, is portrayed with care and balance. Also, pretty sure you'll learn something no matter how long you've been collecting. Beautifully shot and a story well told.",False
9,10,Absolutely Amazing!,turntabletalk,n/a,16/08/2025,Chris and Kevin break the stereotypes of record collecting. By showcasing women and POC they show that anybody can be apart of this amazing culture.,False
10,10,Love it even as a non vinyl listener,leomike-52944,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. As someone who does not count himself as a huge vinyl buff I found the combination of history, manufacturing process, and stories of those involved very compelling. I also very much enjoyed the variety of vinyl enthusiasts interviewed. All their stories of how they fell in love with vinyl are somehow relatable, even as a non vinyl music listener. I felt so many connections to the things I obsess about collecting.",False
11,10,"Warm, delightful, reminder of community",kimeejohnson,n/a,16/08/2025,"A warm, delightful film full of passionate people (my favorite kind). I've definitely had preconceptions about the kind of person who is a record store person, and this movie helped break down those stereotypes for me and made me feel more comfortable in record stores.Also, in a time when we can't be together talking about things that we love in person as much as we like, this felt like the next best thing.I hope they do a sequel just featuring Ashley Ford and her husband.",False
12,10,"Warm, delightful, reminder of community",kimeejohnson,n/a,16/08/2025,"A warm, delightful film full of passionate people (my favorite kind). I definitely had preconceptions of what a record store person was before watching this film, but because of the people they showcased I now feel more comfortable in record stores.Also, at a time when we can't be together talking about the things we love as much as we'd like, this movie is the next best thing.I'd watch an entire other documentary just featuring Ashley Ford and her husband. I hope that's the sequel!",False

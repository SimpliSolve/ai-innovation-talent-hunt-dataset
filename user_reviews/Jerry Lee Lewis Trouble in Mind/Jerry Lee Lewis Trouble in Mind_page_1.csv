1,8,"HE ROCKED LONGER n' LOUDER...RAW n' UNTAMED...""THE KILLER"" JERRY LEE LEWIS",LeonLouisRicci,n/a,16/08/2025,"I""m a hit!""...Jerry Lee Lewis Told ""Sam Phillips"", Music Producer and Owner of ""Sun Records"" out of Memphis, Tenn. Jerry Lee had just Arrived by Car from Hometown...Ferriday, La.""That's what they all say"", the Half-Interested Sam Phillips Fired Back a Micro-Second Later.What Sam Did Not Know was that Jerry Lee was Correct. But so were the Others that Sam was Referring to...Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Carl Perkins (later dubbed ""The Million Dollar Quartet"" including Jerry Lee).Often Mistaken as ""Braggadocio"" a Trait of ""The Killer"", but in His Case Most of it was CONFIDENCE. He Knew He Had what it Takes...""Goodness Gracious"".It may Surprise Some that Ethan Coen (of the Coen Bros.) took a ""Vacation"" from Partnering with ""Joel"" and went Solo to Make Jerry Lee Lewis: ""Trouble In Mind"", this Documentary ""Love-Child"" and Corralled the Dynamo who was Still Touring in His 80's.The Still Very Alive ""Piano-Pounder"" Leads the Viewers on an 'Up Close and Personal"" Journey of a Rock 'n Roll ""Survivor"", with No Equal, except Perhaps ""The Rolling Stones"".The Trip Along Memory-Lane is a Short One Considering the Breadth and the Bewilderment of Life ""On the Road"", as Jerry Lee went From $10,000 a Night to $200 a Night...After He Married His 13 Year Old Cousin and was Virtually Blacklisted From the Big-Time by the ""Moral Majority"".""She was not 13"", the Rock 'n Roller whose ""Great Balls"" Never Cooled Off, having Gone Through 6 Marriages Before He Called it a Night, and Finally Gets to Answer the ""Big Question"" that Haunted Him His Entire Life...""Why Play the Devil's Music?""It's a Fun Filled Frolic that Fills the Void of an UN-Sung Original Rock 'n Roller that Played in the Background Night After Night while the Trajectory of the Music He Helped Originate, Wildly Moved Forward and Beyond.After Pop-Music Turned Against Him, He Nonchalantly, Without Missing a Beat Went ""Country"" Before ""Country was Cool"" and that Success Sustained His Ego, Life-Style, and Zeal to Perform. It's Fascinating How Charming ""The Killer"" can be Reminiscing, even about the Bad-Times, with Affection and a Good Natured Reflection.In the Final Analysis...Jerry Lee Lewis is a Trip...and His Travels are Great and Remarkable. Thank You Ethan Coen and Most of All...Thank You Jerry Lee Lewis for All that Shakin'.",False
2,7,A good music documentary movie,jared-25331,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind (2022) is a music documentary movie directed by Ethan Coen and it tells the story of the legendary musician Jerry Lee Lewis and it was really good.Positives for Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind (2022):
It was interesting to watch a movie about this man and his life. The music made by this man is truly phenomenal and they are so catchy to listen to. I like watching interviews with Lewis and the other people who knew this man during the early days of his career. And finally, this documentary movie is a nice gateway to get younger people interested in listening to Lewis' music and that is awesome.Negatives for Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind (2022):
This documentary movie is really short at only 73 minutes. While I was interested in watching the life of Jerry Lee Lewis, it didn't do enough to grab my attention because of the short runtime. And finally, this movie felt like a task job for Ethan Coen to do and it could've been directed by anyone else.Overall, Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind (2022) is a good documentary movie about a man who played an important role in the music industry and that is good enough for me and people who love Jerry Lee Lewis and his legendary music.",False
3,9,Inspired filmmaking,woodymcdonald,n/a,16/08/2025,"This isn't the definitive Jerry Lee ""story"". It's more focused on giving you the essence of him as a performer and persona. Full of incredible live footage, hilarious (and sometimes disturbing) interviews. It doesn't get weighed down by trying to tell you the trials of his life or give you a stream of celebrity endorsements. I thought it was one of the most original and exciting music docs I've seen.",False
4,2,Really a Disappointment....,docpage-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSO looking forward to this doc, and it's such a disappointment; Granted, some great concert footage, and unlike a lot of other docs, we get to see complete or nearly complete performances of the ""Killer"" in action. The problem is, it just turns out to be superficail and ultimately dull. I'm halfway through, and find myself going, ""okay..and..so?"". JLL, to my mind, is a very interesting character. Not only one of THE architects of Rock and Roll, but certainly one of its most dynamic performers ever, and obviously a huge influence on all who followed. So where's the story of that? All we get is concert footage and clips of him telling people that he had a lot of self confidence. But I think there's a deeper story here. They barely touch on his private life, his marriages, and in one scene we hear he ""shot his bass player in the chest."". Excuse me? THAT'S not worth a follow up question? Just really surprised and disappointed that the film-which, BTW was directed by Ethan Coen, and produced by Mick Jagger-just ends up being superficial, and light weight. I learned way more from his Wikipedia page, and found IT much more interesting.....",True
5,10,Hellfire and Salvation,NeutrinoKid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ethan Coen released this instant classic and the essential Jerry Lee Lewis documentary not long after the great rock and roll icon was called to glory (or not!). Coen makes wonderful and extensive use of key interviews and archival performances, letting the legend unfold visually and in time with the outstanding music, thus forgoing over-explanation and distracting asides. The power of the music speaks for itself, and no one before or since has ever been able to so thoroughly master early rock and roll, country, gospel, and blues. A fitting tribute to one of the giants of American music who at long last was admitted to the Country Music Hall of Fame too.",False

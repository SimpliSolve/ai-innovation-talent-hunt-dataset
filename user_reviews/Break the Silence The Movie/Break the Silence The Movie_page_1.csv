1,7,What's BTS?,harybobjoebob,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this with my little brother because he loves BTS. Knowing almost nothing about these people I found it very interesting the way they handle there own fame, how big the crowds are that they get, and the music's pretty enjoyable. Very interesting",False
2,9,Inspiration for all ages,dilandro-98868,n/a,16/08/2025,"The self reflection the group goes through is shared beautifully. They put so much of their hearts, souls and energy into their purpose. The energy is felt through the screen. These are blessed young men that recognize their role in music and ""Army's"" lives. I am a 50 year old mom with 2 kids that adore these men. Their story, music and energy are felt by people of all ages. Thanks to BTS for sharing again so that we all know it is ok to Love Yourself and enjoy music and dancing in a uncertain time in the world.",False

4,n/a,"Shine, Dream, Smile with BTS.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was late to the party with BTS... i came across them about 6 months on youtube. I was watching lots of unrelated conspiracy videos, a rabbit hole that led me to a video about the fans of BTS. and from there to BTS themselves. Before i knew it, i was consuming BTS content like there was no tomorrow. I was hooked. I was in love. I was a fan.The whole package of BTS just brings pure joy. The songs, the message, the costumes, the make up, the stage shows, the dance routines, and the individual members themselves.... all of it has been a light of glory in these dark times.This is the 4th BTS movie, and the first one i have seen. I saw it in a huge cinema in london on a superscreen. Prior to the film the 'Dynamite' music video was shown - that in of itself is worth the price of admission alone! The song is a huge cultural moment and to see it on such a big screen was like being injected with happiness - under my compulsory face mask, I was smiling from ear to ear.Unfortunately due to this darn pandemic, cinemas are still extremely quiet. So in a screening room with a capacity of about 400+ people, there was just me, a 34 year old man, and two teenage girls. The girls were having a whale of a time, they were bopping about and cheering, it was wonderful to see. But at the same time, it was kinda sad that the coronavirus means I couldn't experience that sense of enthusiasm with a bigger audience.And this is the crux of this review, the word enthusiasm. Because if you are a BTS fan, that's what they make you feel - just being in their presence makes you feel good inside, makes you feel hopeful, inspires you. I'm a huge movie fan, but alas it's almost impossible to look at a film like this critically. I mean, it's BTS... the film could be 4 hours of them just sitting in a room chatting and i'd feel like it was the best night of my life.As a documentary? If I was to step back from my personal love of BTS, I guess I would say that as a film it's very unsurprising. And I get why that is. BTS is a massive machine, and part of that machine is the movies about them - the films are made by the people who manage them and so we will never truly get a deeper insight into the members as individuals - we will always see them through the filter their management/record label impose. I got the impression the film was trying to coax out a deeper look at the whole phenomenon which at times didn't really feel organic...One day, maybe in 15/20 years time, someone will make an epic documentary about the whole BTS experience that will really get under the finger nails of what it must have felt like for these young guys to become the biggest thing on the planet. But that can only come with reflection, when time has passed, when it is all finally over... but that's not today, and that's not what this film can offer. What it can do is give just a little glimpse into the roller coaster that this band is still riding. It'll make you shine, it'll make you dream, it'll make you smile, but more importantly it'll make you feel connected and in this locked down world of 2020, that's all we can hope for.",False
5,10,Great message,swatisharma-29918,n/a,16/08/2025,Even if u r not a big fan of them u will love it !! They are giving great message and positivity ! Love it!,False
6,10,Loved it!,amishaprasad,n/a,16/08/2025,"They really did break that silence. It was all happy sad and everything an ARMY could expect from it. Really showed how different they are from what they show usually, and how it's not all rainbows and unicorns.",False
7,10,LOVE YOURSELF,krritika-53195,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was such a wonderful film that changed my perspective to look BTS. I wish I could watch it again. when I was watching the movie, I was thinking that how much hard work they do...making a song, learning the dance, performing on stage, then again do concert all over world. They are so hard working and it shows in their songs. I believe that their songs are life changing. It has great meaning, cheerful, brings joy. BTS is a revolution in Music Industry all over world....I was also thinking that I wish I could work in Big Hit Entertainment as their manager....This movie showed that everyone has two sides so they do and they want to show their happy and cheerful side to their Army...By watching this movie my respect for BTS has increased a lot.",False
8,10,This is what a movie is,colewaters,n/a,16/08/2025,This is what I call a killer movie. BTS is the biggest band since the Beatles and this movie shows that. Every second of this movie just gets better and better. If you are part of the BTS ARMY you will absolutely love this movie no doubt.Before the actual movie begins their hit Dynamite plays and it felt like I was at a front row BTS Concert,False
9,10,incredibly moving,kaypalms,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't miss it. If you are interested in getting to know the members, this is the movie for you",False
10,10,Persona,narayanisiware,n/a,16/08/2025,"BTS literally put right content in the movie, they were talking about their persona, their real self, how they struggled inside, although they are most popular boy band in the world, but popularity can not bring happiness as we assume, it brings tiring schedule, pressure, lack of freedome...these all things may seem like cage sometime...they opened up about all these things in this movie and made it a honest documentary, I really loved it.
BTS Forever ðŸ’œðŸ’«",False
11,6,Not the best one,winonabitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love the boys to death and appreciate that they expose their vulnerabilities to us. That said, the directing and editing for this movie felt way lazier than the other ones. I could tell the rest of the viewers in my theater felt underwhelmed too.",False
12,2,Lazy,alrababqasim,n/a,16/08/2025,"A punch of messy random clips, The producer knew it's going to sell without the need to put the work and make it look good
They did the boys dirty, I love them and wished to watch an engaging well executed film but directing and editing couldn't be worse.The theme wasn't consistent it wasn't personal neither significant and the message got mixed up in the process
Is it about the real personalities of each member of the group ? Or how they handle fame and how it changed them ?It felt more like a youtube video than a documentary
they should have better projects in the future it'd be nice seeing their journey.",False

1,6,What about Jerry Lawson?,nyynyk-44237,n/a,16/08/2025,It was funny to see how the movie gave credit to Atari for creating the interchangeable game. But Jerry Lawson did it first with the Fairchild Channel F. Are you telling me with all of the research committed to this documentary they could give the true creator of the video game cartridge 10 seconds of credit. With that omission this documentary lacks credibility. The movie did a good job discussing the roots of the company in Japan with the playing cards and later toys but when the documentary credits Atari for creating the interchangeable game cartridge it is lazy researching & inaccurate information. They had the time to do the research and chose to omit Jerry Lawson.,False
2,5,Lazy disappointing documentary,spike_will_the_bloody,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a child of the 80s, and Nintendo fan I was looking forward to watching this documentary. Unfortunately upon watching I was left very disappointed with the production of this mini documentary. A lot of repetition in the script, lazy edits, the researchers getting a lot of relatively well known facts wrong. There's a lot about this documentary that frustrated me, the thing that frustrated me most was the conflating facts of the (arguably) 3 main gaming markets (North America, Europe and Japan). This documentary is not a good resource of Nintendo history. The team behind this documentary get an F for effort, D for execution, or 5/10 for me.",False
3,1,Regurgitated information.,nickgiordano-53192,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the poorest produced video game documentaries ever made. The use incorrect stock photos for Nintendo products and it's simply a few talking head documentary with some inconsequential ""reviewers"". Each of these reviewers are either too young to have experienced or researched the ideas they are talking about. I felt as though this was an hour of my life that I would never get back. The best way to describe this is a waste of bandwidth. Skip this one and look for a different video game documentary. Running with Speed and Console Wars are far superior documentaries that I would recommend watching instead.",False
4,3,"Nothing new here, factually incorrect, bad experts, bad rxiting",wetwag,n/a,16/08/2025,"Technically really poorly edited (e.g. Talking about the NES , inserts screenshot of Atari Misske a command).Factually incorrect (asserts the Nintendo Seal of Quality refers to the technical reliability of the system, instead of the aspect that Nintendo was vouching it was just not crappy software). Numerous other factual errors.Experts are weak using words and phrases they don't understand: one calls Nintendo a ""conglomeration""; one exist praising Miyamoto and says ""contributions cannot be understated"" (you mean overstated, pinheaded).Completely misses how Donkey Kong cane to be.The narrator I almost sounds like a bad chatbot iat times.Poor effort overall.",False
5,1,Distasteful fanvideo that even Nintendo might question.,grass-82150,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""stuff"" is seemingly made by japan lovers who don't care about anything but, and only but, what they like and what they want to see. To signify the japanese industrial rebirth after the Pacific war, the one started by the japanese army illegally bombing Pearl harbor without the declaration of war, this fanvideo makers used a footage from Hashima, also known as Kangoku(prison) shima(island), where japanese government used people from Korea and other Japanese colonies during the war, and used them as slaves. The makers PICKED that spot to say ""Japan rose back up from the ashes of war"". Distasteful is an understatement.Anyway, This ""so-called documentary"" is more or less a youtube fanvideo with the editing skills and the visual fetish from 2013(yeah. When GTA5 was released and all those 70s disco reference was a thing). The speakers cannot even pronounce the names of the people and the regions right, and the narrator sounds like he was told to sound like a voice generator.After finish watching the video, it left me thinking, WHAT DID THEY WANT TO SAY?Did they make this because they just wanted to shout out ""Nintendo is great and Japan is so fascinating""?If so or not, they made this without considering what to focus on. Its people? Games? Competitors?I can't tell.They may have just put a long piece of paper on the table, put the timeline of Nintendo on it, sliced it by a decade or so, gathered Nintendo fans or Japan fans, asked them how much they know about that period, WAM everything into the video editor and cut it under an hour length.",False
6,1,Amateurs put this together.,cutehissatx,n/a,16/08/2025,I was hoping that this would had been better than what was advertised but instead got the opposite. I feel like they rushed it and in the end released this nonsense of a video that came up short of what Nintendo deserves to be recognized for. The sound mixing at certain points and clips that were used make this seem like some high school dropouts put this together. It's unfortunate that Nintendo would allow these amateurs to create a disaster that they claim is a documentary on their company. Hopefully someone here in the states will put something better together that will pay tribute to Nintendo and not be as disastrous as this video.,False
7,1,Miserable excuse for a documentary.,djgunter,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBy far the worst documentary I have ever laid eyes upon. There is an egregious mosaic filter applied to a lot of the shown media, making all text unreadable, it looks almost like a crudely AI generated segment. Many visuals were extremely lacking, when they talked about certain consoles the wrong photos would come up. The most humorous example of this was when they mentioned the Nintendo Entertainment System, and instead of showing it, there was a picture of an entirely different console released less than ten years ago, and it was resting on a bed of cartridges for another different console. Not only were the visuals all terrible, but nearly all the info is garbage and in some places completely wrong. Saying that Atari created the 2600 in response to Nintendo's knock-off ""color tv game"" would be comparable to saying that a wet napkin inspired the invention of the wheel, it just isn't right. You could find far more information on Nintendo by skimming a Wikipedia page for five minutes rather than sitting through this mockery of a documentary for a terrible 52 minutes and 13 seconds. Clearly just a cash grab trying to get into a market that the producers of the documentary know NOTHING about.",True
8,1,Skip it.,bottjena2,n/a,16/08/2025,"You will not learn anything new from this documentary.At one point the narrator talks about Disney making a deal with Nintendo to create cards for kids.In the next frame you have someone sitting in a chair telling us THE EXACT SAME information we just heard.You also have the ""Experts"" using words like ""I think"", as in, they are not sure about the information they are giving us.The production quality over all is not great. I had high opes for this documentary.It looks like they took these people and set them up where ever they could, gave them a chair and pointed lights at them. It looks that cheap!",False
9,1,What??,kone-kingone,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no idÃ© what i just watched, i dont get why there was no shots of real nintendo 8bit and just shots of nintendo mini. And when showing ""Sega Genesis"" a shot of atGames sega console is showed? Even if this was low budget documentary it should have hade no problem to be able to have real consoles in the documentary.The once that are interviewed should at least know the different between lcd and led as they are suppose to be from that time when Nintendo was popularly.And whats up with the bad quality of old videos ads that where cut in to the documentary? Looks like something that is copied from old realplayer stream as it is so blurry.This is not a documentary it is a comedy movie.",False
10,1,Pure pants!,DaveRetroLondon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOk this is bad...really bad, so many factual errors, like the Nintendo Game and Watch being an, and I quote, LED handheld! Pretty sure led wasn't a thing in 1980,try LCD ðŸ™„Terrible ""experts"" screenshots and video shown of non Nintendo games while talking about actual nintendo games!I managed to watch it all, but as a lifelong Ninty fan it pains me to see utter pants like this! Even video of the sacred Donkey Kong was the incorrect aspect ratio and stretched to 16.9 and just shows the lack of attention to detail that true fans of nintendo would make sure we're correct.Avoid unless you want some inaccurate waffle about one of the worlds leading video game companies!",True
11,1,Painful to watch. Avoid!,marcogiulio-camurri,n/a,16/08/2025,"Almost one hour of my life wasted by this ""documentary"". The ""experts"" are not expert, the facts are partially wrong, the timeline is messed up, the montage is lazy.Frequently they start talking about a console and then the montage skips to a console that was mentione minutes earlier. The script is repetitive and uninteresting
The whole thing feels like it was produced in 15 minutes just to meet a deadline. They didn't even bother finding the correct footage for the games they are talking about. Imagine talking about the origin of coin-op games and then having to watch 10 painful seconds of Donkey Kong on GameBoy Color.Terrible stuff, really.",False
12,1,"You don't pay with money, you pay with valuable time, and that's far worse.",willtyler-78455,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is possibly the worst documentary I've ever watched. It reeks of laziness and corner cutting. The imagery shown on screen is mostly irrelevant, the people being interviewed clearly have a very vague understanding of the topic, at best, and are reading from scripts that they haven't rehearsed very well. On top of this, I'm almost certain that the main narrator is a text to speech AI, again demonstrating the corner cutting that is evident throughout the 20 minutes I made it through (which I will never be able to get back).I would avoid this ""documentary"" like the plague. If you want to know the history of Nintendo, I'm sure there is someone on YouTube who has put a lot more effort into their film.",False
13,3,"Repetition, repetition, repetition. ,",darrantaylor,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here is a piece of information, here is the same information said by a second person, and finally here is the same information again, by a third person, reading of a card.Here is a second piece of information, here is the same information said by a second person, and finally here is the same information again, by a third person, reading of a card.Here is a third piece of information, here is the same information said by a second person, and finally here is the same information again, by a third person, reading of a card.It's like the Groundhog Day of documentaries - and made my head hurt, so only managed 15 minutes.",False
14,2,Extremely poor. Very Repetitive..,tylrdiablos,n/a,16/08/2025,"The creators have decided that a documentary about a 100+ year old company, that's worth billions, and has some of the most recognisable names and brands in pop-culture under its belt (Mario, Pokemon, ect) should be 54 minutes long.The narrator will something like ""Nintendo first started out creating Hanafuda playing cards"", then the scene will jump to someone like Aoife Wilson saying the exact thing. And this happens every few minutes.Narrator: ""Nintendo briefly worked with Disney"", Wilson: ""Nintendo and Disney worked together"".It's as lazy as it is infuriating.This has got to be one of the most pointless pieces of media to every be produced.Nintendo, and the many creative names that work(ed) there, deserved better.AVOID.",False
15,1,I enjoyed pointing out the mistakes.,peacesvw,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, even if you're just beginning your knowledge on videogame history.B roll footage doesn't match the current system they're talking about. Some examples are showing vintage man-on-the-scene interviews about the SMS while Sonic plays on a television behind them. Showing Gameboy Advanced footage while talking about NES and SNES. When talking about Nintendo entering the arcade business they showed Atari and Capcom games, no Nintendo arcade machines.The information provided is general knowledge and incomplete. There is no deep dive into Nintendo lore. An example is when they spoke of Donkey Kong. The information is so superficial they didn't mention the Popeye licensing issues or the lawsuits with Universal.In one scene of vintage footage, they failed to adjust the volume of the footage so it drowns out the narration. Could they not be bothered to watch their own doc before releasing it?The AI filters used in the vintage commercials distorted them so much that faces were unrecognizable and the text, unreadable.The knowledge of the ""experts"" seemed to be gained from research of Buzzfeed listicles.If you're truly curious, find another doc to watch. One created by people who are passionate and care about the industry.",False

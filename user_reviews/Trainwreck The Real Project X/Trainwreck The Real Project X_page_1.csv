1,6,The rioters got what they came for,shonaderose,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatched this today and read the other reviews here.I'm kind of stunned (but not really with the hard time young girls just now) at the blame put on a then 16 year old girl.Yes, she didn't make the event private. But who could predict the outcome.She's clearly remorseful, has lifelong repercussions and was terrified at the time. No wonder she left the area, while the 'party' was going on, if that were my daughter I'd tell her to go too, for fear of her safety (especially judging by the comments in other reviews)
Thomas is representative of the mob, who descended with one goal in mind, destruction, looting and violence. He gleefully reminisces partaking in destroying public property, looting and destroying on-looker's cameras. Only returning what he stole, after being tagged online.Yet, many of the other reviews comment on how unlikeable Merthe is, her upbringing and appearance. These reviews are typical of the attitude towards women in today's polarised climate.The show was interesting but, as others have said, commentary from experts in the psychology behind events like these and social media experts would have enhanced the documentary.I found Merthe honest, remorseful and (since it was 13 years ago) showed the appropriate level of respect, with reference to different emotions she displayed.BTW no one actually died, she'd been misinformed and doesn't laugh about it...
Let's look at the real villains of this story, who were the people who descended on the town to intentionally riot and Meta, for refusing to take the subsequent events down.",True
2,7,All kinds of crazy.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Merthe planned a 16th birthday party for about seventy people at her home in the small town of Haren. Unfortunately, the Facebook invite status was set to public, not private. Project X came to Haren.Project X, that's a film I had all but forgotten about, not really my kind of thing as I'm getting older, but I understood the urge to party; however, I did not understand the urge to cause carnage and destruction.There was lots of interesting and shocking footage, and some of the scenes were unbelievable. One thing, though, it mentioned two deaths yet told us absolutely nothing about the two young women; that was a bit off.Merthe came across incredibly well; what an intelligent and hugely likeable person-respect. Some of the 'people' that took part, you can imagine the kind of personality traits they have; we all know the type. The tooth, of course there had to be the tooth.I visited Holland several times in the early 2000s; I don't remember it being a shy and retiring place that some are making it out to be; the smaller towns and villages, of course, would have been. I'd question if the cities were so quiet as was suggested.The authorities appeared to be less than useless and Facebook played a massive part, both were to blame.7/10.",False
3,7,A bunch of idiots causing havoc,JanaM-259,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary is good.I felt so sorry for the girl. Like yeah, she made a mistake but things got out of her control soooo quickly. And those other people? Selfish idiots.The best part is def the psychology of a crowd there - and the idiocy of some of the people talking, mainly the one guy from that YT channel. I was laughing so hard when he said the police caused problems etc. No, man, not the police. Like what? It was stated there is no party, and yet those freaing retards decided to go and demand something. Like... You brought that on yourself, sorry. They were such a joke. The police werepushing you away? Hmmm, wondering why...
Also the guy who created that copy event after Merthe took the original one down? What the heck. Another idiot in the chain.I enjoyed the documentary.",True
4,7,Quash anarchy,bt698nhj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't understand why society is so soft on anarchy. If we set a standard that says we won't tolerate anarchy, society will be a better place. The way to indicate that standard is serious is to debilitate offenders.That is what should have been done in this case. Why was there no tear gas or rubber bullets? Or real bullets?Anarchy should not be tolerated, and in this case it was well known to be a potentiality many many days in advance. Let's do better as a society.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",False
5,6,A bizarre true story of a small Dutch town engulfed by mayhem...,mdw0526,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix continues its run of disaster porn, these tightly edited, punchy docs under the ""Trainwreck"" banner and I'm grouping these two together because we watched them back to back. While different in tone, both examine the chaotic consequences of crowd behavior and what happens when no one's in charge. ""The Real Project X"" revisits the bizarre true story of a viral invitation, poor local oversight, and a quiet Dutch town engulfed by a mob intent on mayhem. It feels quaint now, but the seeds of today's algorithm-driven chaos were already there.In contrast, ""The Astroworld Tragedy"" is a somber and infuriating chronicle of corporate negligence, with a behemoth like Live Nation prioritizing profits over lives, and facing barely any accountability. As someone old enough to remember being lifted off my feet in the crush of a Halloween crowd in the Castro in 1990s San Francisco, the concert crowd footage lands viscerally. Mass gatherings can flip from euphoric to deadly in seconds, so I've learned to generally avoid anything that's going to give me a panic attack.",False
6,4,Trainweck gave a free pass to Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg,michiganave_p,n/a,16/08/2025,"This feels like another superficial attempt by this Trainwreck series to only talk to the participants of what happened, without having a deeper dive or actually any experts who were not involved included in this thing to explain how this happened.It is extremely clear how illiterate the participants are with technology and don't have a good grasp on how tech, social networks or algorithms work, however the showrunners thought it would be best just to blame this as a human behavior problem and not a technology problem, which is how this problem started in the first place: On Facebook.This whole event was triggered when one user made the mistake of not setting a birthday party invite to private, saw her mistake, then tried to fix it on Facebook's mobile UI but couldn't because of its limitation to edit invites, and then the FB algorithmic took control to maximize reach to as many users as possible and turned this one mistake into a huge riot.Additionally, Meta would not remove posts which were promoting the fake event, which multiple people and government officials were saying was not a real party and would also cause major safety concerns.None of this was discussed during the documentary, and there's appears to be no attempt by the show's producers to out to Meta for a comment. Instead, all the blame was shifted to the people involved, and not the tools or platforms they were using.",False
7,1,Sloppy Superficial Faux Doc,iaminfinite-87116,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some entitled Dutch kids shared a Facebook event invite, two loser YouTubers incited aggression in the crowd for profit (they're still proud of that cause they are still losers ""it was like being in a videogame"" says this 52 year old narcissist), then the kids threw some guardrails around, then some police stopped it. 90% of who they spoke to were doing a lot of superficial uptalk about this willfully moronic 5 hour street-drinking event like it was years long war-time and their golden years of achievement. I've never been less impressed by people talking about something so utterly pointless with so much pride.",False
8,8,How Facebook helped start a riot in rural Holland.,drhemp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix's Trainwreck documentary series has previously covered festivals that went wrong, such as Woodstock '99 and the Astroworld tragedy. Project X, however, was not an official festival; it was a Facebook event.It began as a birthday party for a 16-year-old girl, but the Facebook event was set to public. This regrettably enabled other users to send out invites, and thousands were sent. Faced with an unmanageable number of guests, the family cancelled it. However, the idea had already gone viral, and copycat events were quickly created on Facebook, attracting ever more attendees.It was too late. No sooner had one event page been removed than another popped up. This was in 2012, when Facebook was still a relatively new phenomenon. There appeared to be no mechanism to contact the platform directly, and the local municipal authorities and police didn't appreciate the potential for a viral event to attract huge numbers of people. Ultimately, hundreds of thousands of invites were sent out.I know that part of the Netherlands quite well. When people think of the Netherlands, they often picture Amsterdam's nightlife and party scene. However, much of the country, especially in the north-east, is very rural, with picturesque but sleepy small towns. They are conservative with a small 'c' and, as mentioned in the documentary, places where literally nothing happens.The documentary draws a direct line from the 2012 American film Project X (about a high-school party that spirals into a destructive riot) to the events in Haren. The copycat Facebook events were explicitly named ""Project X Haren,"" which primed attendees to expect chaos and a wild time.The police, the mayor, and local authorities were simply not prepared. They took no measures to divert people, such as closing roads, and turned down an eminently sensible offer to host a party in a field just outside the town.A lot of people turned up. Holland has an excellent railway and road network, and Haren is only a couple of hours from Amsterdam. You can get to most places in the country in under three hours, and the town is also very close to the German border.Before 2014, the legal age to buy alcohol in the Netherlands was 16. Unfortunately, when you have a large number of young people turning up somewhere wanting to have a good time with nothing provided, it's a recipe for disaster. The police got a bit heavy-handed, and a riot ensued.Of course, watching the show, you feel sorry for the residents and the young girl's family, but it's hard not to see the darkly comedic side of how a simple Facebook event caused thousands of partygoers to descend on a tiny Dutch town. Fortunately, unlike Astroworld, nobody died, so the programme makers were able to present the documentary with a more light-hearted tone.They didn't get any comment from Facebook about the event, which is a notable omission. In my opinion, Facebook bears significant responsibility for allowing the event to be repeatedly republished with no apparent way for the family or authorities to get it taken down permanently. When the show finished, I said, ""I hope they sent Mark Zuckerberg the bill.""",False
9,2,Disappointing documentary,g_veldman,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary was a real disappointment. First of all, I found it completely unnecessary that the people involved didn't speak Dutch. That made it feel unbelievable. I still remember the day very well, and the media played a major role in escalating the situation. All the media were just waiting for riots to break out. That aspect was underrepresented in the documentary.Merthe's story mostly just caused irritation. She was laughing more than showing any remorse. The same goes for the other people interviewed. All in all, it was not a pleasant documentary to watch. No police officers were interviewed. The residents of Haren were victims, but it was all treated like some kind of joke.",False
10,2,Poor choice of people to interview,imdbfan-445443,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't understand why they would entertain and pay to interview the low life scum who partook in the riots and seem to be bragging and proud of it? The guy is literally sat there smirking about how they were looting local businesses and stealing cigarettes and beating up people for camera footage. Yes it highlights the event and outlines what was going on- but interview the victims not the perpetrators please. Really disappointed with this episode and felt it glorified the rioters as ""party goers"" and gave them a voice that they should not have had. They should be ashamed of their actions. At least it highlights the police and mayor failings to prepare.",True
11,1,An Absolute Nothing Story,DrePhili,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot stress enough how much nothing happens in this documentary. Would you like a total recap? Once upon a time a bunch of party kids crowded a single street because they heard about a birthday party on Facebook. That's it. That's the story.This nothing event (where, at worst, some police showed up and made noise to break-up the crowd) was practically as long as this doc itself. Barely an hour and you learn nothing except: some girl's birthday party went a little viral and then kids showed up making noise.This is the bottom of the barrel for documentary topics. I mean, truly nothing to glean from any of this. Nothing happened worth remembering. Nothing happened to change anyone's lives. Nothing happened besides the above.""Trainwreck"" is almost becoming an ironic and appropriate title for this very series. They've covered a few interesting topics in their time. This one the most useless.",False
12,4,They Weren't Victims-They Were Wrecking Things,LeagueOfJules,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerUnbelievable how this documentary manages to shift the blame onto the police while portraying those clearly there for destruction, rioting, and binge drinking as victims.I genuinely feel sorry for the girl and the entire village.Yes, she made a mistake - but she took responsibility and pulled back. The real issue is the blatant lack of common sense, awareness, and basic decency from so many others.Call me a party pooper, but I think the police acted appropriately - if anything, they could have responded more firmly. It's not 'cool' to disrupt lives and endanger communities just because you lack the judgment to stay away. Think before you act - this isn't harmless fun.",True
13,3,A bit boring,melissa-183,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think Merthe is a sweet girl. This was not her fault, perhaps a bit naive. How something like an innocent facebook invitation could get out of hand is truly unbelievable. Therefore, it is a bit of an ok documentary to watch, but otherwise not very interesting. The short-haired man from ""Stuk TV"" could use some work on his English. That was annoying.The documentary doesn't add anything about how this could have happened, group behavior, police statements, etc. More time could have been spent on that to make it a bit more interesting. That's a missed opportunity.PS: In a few reviews, it's said Merthe laughed when she was talking about the rumor she heard of two deaths. Her laughter is clearly one of uncertainty, and right after she falls silent and cries.",False
14,5,men really DO ruin everything,sarbie18,n/a,16/08/2025,"Title says it all. A girl wanted to have a nice birthday celebration with her friends and then men stepped in and had to ruin everything. And they're so proud of it. I felt bad for her and her family. Worst episode of the Trainwreck series for me, because I didn't feel entertained, just angry and disappointed.",False
15,4,The Impact of Project X,peterohara-71251,n/a,16/08/2025,"This happened the day before my 21st birthday but I've never heard of it until now. I had seen Project X and also wanted to do a similar type of party which thankfully never ended up anything like this. So I can understand the mindset of young people at that time wanting something similar. It's just difficult to see how damaging property on a street achieves that.In some ways I think she would have been better to have the party after all. There would have been less damage done outside at least. Maybe remove all the valuables before they got there.Also, why did they pick this girls story when there are much more well known examples of a party gone wrong. Like Corey Worthington.The fact they're all speaking English is stupid as well.",False

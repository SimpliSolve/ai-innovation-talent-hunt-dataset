1,7,"Interesting story, just a little overdone.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Eliza Samuido and her four month old son vanish, The Police instantly suspect the child's father, her former lover Bruno Fernandez de Souza, who just happens to be a professional footballer of some note.If I'm honest, I tend to be more of a fan of those straight laced, sobering documentaries, this one isn't one of those, it's very colourful, loud, and dare I say it, they went a bit more for the sensational.It's definitely interesting, and even though they only touched on some of the other crimes of the time at the end, it showed where football and footballers had gone by this point, literally feeling above the law.At the time, I just remember thinking, no way, he didn't seem like the sharpest tool in the box, hugely good looking, but not a murderer, it's interesting now to look back at his behaviour during the interviews, I definitely see things differently now.A really shocking story, I just wish they'd toned it down a little, it's just a little too over the top.7/10.",False
2,7,Goal: Keep her,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am going to write this out (sorry), just to avoid confusion: goal keeper ... I imagine if you didn't get it at first you got it now. So no pun intended (as to what it also means to the real story) ... I never had heard of the woman or was aware of the football player (or soccer if you are American).An interesting and intriguing story - still I have to stop watching these real life crime things. There is enough fictional movies and shows I still have to go through. And me watching almost anything ... well believe me, there is no shortage of stuff .... my watchlists are endless ... and I might be underselling it.But back to this. There is no doubt what happened ... yet ... we may question some of the things ... and especially how it is finally resolved ... never trust no one .. or something like this.",False
3,10,Great coverage/look back at a terrible crime,Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNetflix takes a closer look at one of the most infamous crimes of Brazilian society that still lingers on people's minds, nearly 15
years later: the disappearance and killing of young Eliza Samudio by the hands of his lover, the soccer goalie Bruno, of Flamengo, and his group of friends, on mysterious circumstances of which no one knows where the body is. More than just a case of a married man at the peak of his
game, with talks of playing for the Brazilian team or going to play in Europe, and who murdered the mother of his child as he didn't want to
assume the kid, this is a story about failed families, toxic masculinity on the environment of soccer, how fame can change a person (or reveal it), and society's views on women. It's about shock and awe, new revelations that were kept from the public eye for years, and a new perspective on
the case. This story comes with a take: feminicide and how female victims are invisible in society's eyes.To world audiences it's a story to be seen and followed, like a very dramatic suspense with a series of twists and turns; for sports
fans it offers an interesting view on Bruno's career (it doesn't reach a level of fame like O. J. Simpson but it's the closest when it comes
to a sports personality involved with a crime; for fans about the legal system and how justice works in cases, since the defense strategy related
with her disappearance only and could return, brings plenty of thought-provoking issues; for us in Brazil it's a time travel to early 2010's, with many memories coming back to surface
related with Eliza's disappearance and the media frenzy all over the man, and to understand and analyze the facts about the crime, and to see
what was hidden in the messages exchange from the girl (labeled as a Maria Chuteira by many people and media outlets) with a best friend or
the ones with Bruno, proving that their affair was rocky and full of threats.Interesting facts that I felt this doc hit strong, and maybe I failed to follow back when this all over the news, was the inefficiency of the
justice system in protecting Eliza back when the early threats were denounced by her. If we're look to how everything unfolded after a judge
(female, by the way) didn't provide a restraining order against the goalie, it was all downhill. An impassionated and heated man, a naive girl,
and his dumb friends who accepted to do everything that was asked for them, joined by her unattentive parents, and her fate was sealed,
planned and executed, almost to a near perfection. The story about the parents of both parties is one of those sad tales that we hear often
with criminal cases; it's like both were destined to a certain greatness, yet the ultimate fate would be of a tragic affair and they shouldn't be
together.The chief of investigation Edson Moreira has to be the most interesting character in the whole case. He has a tough guy demeanor,
yet with a certain charisma and some odd humor on him - plus he was a memorable figure on
TV, because of this particular case. He fully broke the case and waited the right moment to get Bruno and his associates,
patienly gathering all of Bruno's interviews and seeing how there was always a different story going on.It might be a little faulty at times with the chronological presentation and timeline of events (as often those doc series tend to be a lot), but
it wasn't done in a confusing manner. Overall, Netflix conducted a very special documentary, maybe it should drop the small moments with re-enactments that wasn't poignant for audiences to see acting bits - they're all in the shadows. But all the interviews were enlightning, fascinating,
shocking, all that one looks for when it comes to those crime specials. 10/10.",True
4,4,A great disappointment for Brazilian documentaries.,khalilandallah,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, I would like to say that Brazilian documentaries, in general, are well produced. But not this one.As a documentary, the good work in the research, interviews and presentation of the interviewees is notable. But everything is lost with the rhythm of the narrative, with the poor soundtrack and the weak dramatizations, which lack the slightest care. The editing is decent, but nothing that deserves a more in-depth review.As entertainment, the documentary drags on, I found myself seeing how much time was left to finish when it was still halfway through. The slow pace, combined with a clearly customized soundtrack to work on the viewer's perception, as well as occasional breaks in rhythm to convey an ideological message caused strangeness that disrupted the experience and broke immersion.In the end I was disappointed, I was expecting a great documentary about one of the most notorious and televised crimes in Brazil. And everything I watched was an amateur production, with more low points than highs and dressed in the guise of a large-scale production.",False
5,8,"Disturbing, necessary, and urgent",pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"""An Invisible Victim: The Eliza Samudio Case"" hits like a punch to the gut. This documentary, directed by Juliana Antunesa, doesn't just reveal the brutal murder of Eliza Samudio, it also exposes how the crime and its aftermath reflected the deep-rooted sexism in Brazilian society. Focusing on a case that shocked the country in 2010, the film goes beyond simply recounting the events. It examines how the media and the public turned goalkeeper Bruno, the main suspect and later convicted for the crime, into an almost mythical figure, while the real victim, Eliza, was pushed into the background.Right from the start, the documentary makes it clear that this isn't your typical ""true crime"" about a famous killer. Instead of romanticizing or focusing on Bruno's downfall, the film puts Eliza back at the center of the story, where she always should've been. The title, ""An Invisible Victim"", prepares you for the central theme: the invisibility of women who are victims of violence when the accused has fame and power. Eliza, like so many others, was silenced even before her death. The film does an excellent job of showing how the media painted her as a gold digger, while Bruno was treated as a tragic hero, someone who had lost everything in a ""moment of weakness.""The documentary is effective in blending interviews with people involved in the case, including Eliza's friends and family, who help piece together the story of this woman who was much more than just a name in the headlines. The inclusion of experts and lawyers adds more depth to the discussion, showing how Brazil's justice system treated the case with the usual leniency reserved for wealthy, powerful men.But what hits hardest in ""An Invisible Victim"" is how it lays bare the impunity in the justice system. Bruno, even though sentenced to a long term for a brutal crime, is already free. And this fact is treated almost casually by the public and Bruno's fans. The critique of Brazilian society and the worship of football is crystal clear: for many, it seems that skill with a soccer ball is worth more than a woman's life. The documentary tackles this head-on, highlighting the glaring difference in how a famous footballer is treated compared to an ordinary woman. There's something deeply enraging about the way Bruno was welcomed back into football, as if nothing had happened. It's like justice was served only on paper, but not in reality.The documentary's style is straightforward, no frills, with a soundtrack that creates the right tension to keep the audience hooked to the narrative. It slowly builds up Eliza's portrait, detailing the abuse and suffering she endured before her death. Archival footage and reenactments help create a sense of urgency and outrage that grows throughout the 100-minute runtime.But the hardest part to watch is the ending, when the documentary updates us on recent events: Bruno, now a free man, has been signed by another football club. Even though he lost some sponsorships, there are still those who support his return to the field. This not only reinforces how deeply ingrained sexism is in Brazilian society, but also makes you question if there was ever any real justice for Eliza.""An Invisible Victim: The Eliza Samudio Case"" is disturbing, necessary, and urgent. It reminds us that the fight for justice for victims of violence isn't just against the criminals, but against an entire culture that insists on protecting the powerful and silencing the victims. Eliza Samudio, whose story was sidelined, finally gets the dignity she was denied in life, though tragically late. And as a viewer, it's impossible to finish this film without feeling a mix of rage and deep sadness.",False

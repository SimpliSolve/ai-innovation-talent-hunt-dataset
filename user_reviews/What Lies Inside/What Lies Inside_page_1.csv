1,10,You won't walk away the same.,richarvey-75360,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was skeptical at first. Prepared to be entertained with a film that ""was about him."" After about 30 minutes, I thought ""This film isn't about him, it's about them."" It hit me hard when I realized, that ultimately, it was about me...and you. Beautifully shot and expertly crafted, Mr. Renner invites you on a difficult journey of his own self-discovery, introduces you to sympathetic ""real"" people who are genuine and disarming with their vulnerability as they share their own stories of trauma, all while real professionals provide context for the experience. By the end, the viewer is left with questions about their own journey, but with tangible solutions they can take with them should they choose to begin their own quest for healing. As a lifelong educator, I fully endorse this beautiful film and urge those who work with broken people to add it to their tool kit.",False
2,10,Unexpected,timoyler,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sometimes the artist doesn't know what the picture will be until the final stroke of their brush. Similarly, this film will take you on a journey to what looks like a predictable end, but instead, the director's stunningly visual sleight of hand redirects the trip into unexpected, beautiful depths. Whether you are a victim of trauma or not, you need to see this film, because someone in your life needs you to watch. For the traumas in the past, for the traumas we may be experiencing now, and for the traumas yet to come, we need this to learn how to love our neighbors and ourselves. I will watch again, and encourage my friends, family and strangers to do the same.",False
3,10,Amazingly powerful,theceneidert,n/a,15/08/2025,What Lies Inside is a beautifully shot documentary that opened my eyes to the trauma so many are living with. It unexpectedly triggered emotions in me that I hadn't felt in years and helped push me to take that first step to healing. What Lies Inside has a powerful message that - given the state of our world - needs to be seen. A truly informational documentary with some amazingly powerful voices!,False
4,10,Attention Educators!,ronhanson-93237,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a teacher in an urban school district where almost every child has been subjected to trauma in some form, I am thrilled to see this taboo issue explored with such intimate integrity. Director Luke Renner blends emotion, personal struggle and science perfectly to tell a human story, that until now, we have been afraid to face. Every educator who believes in being ""Trauma Informed"" should make this film a part of their professional development and SEL teaching.",False
5,10,Beautiful.,brice-40270,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a stunning piece of film art with an incredibly important message. Thank you for making this film. I am a marriage and family therapy student at a seminary and plan to share this with my professors and student colleagues. It's so beautifully done, the cinematography is absolutely stunning, and it is relevant to not only my studies, but to the current climate of our world. Outstanding work, crew!",False
6,10,Lots of good information!,rennerstephanie,n/a,15/08/2025,Watching this movie gave me a different perspective into what people with trauma go through. It's raw and vulnerable and real. The movie gives tangible ways to help you walk through your trauma journey. Very enlightening!,False
7,10,One of the most important films of 2020.,alexanderamick,n/a,15/08/2025,"With as traumatizing as this year has been, it's important for us all to recognize our collective traumas and mental anguishes. This film is able to remarkably take you through the inner workings of our own mind from someone who underwent a journey of their own throughout. It is remarkable to see the audience character also be the narrator and as Luke goes through his own journey, we do as well.",False
8,10,A Timely Call For Understanding,jamiearpinricci,n/a,15/08/2025,"""What Lies Inside"" is an incredibly personal, artful, and deeply helpful exploration of trauma. As someone who lives with trauma myself (and works with a community of highly traumatized minorities), I am deeply grateful for this film. While it shouldn't be viewed lightly, it should be watched widely.",False
9,10,"Insightful, Inspiring, Educational",ellenbyrum,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I viewed this documentary. What I realized after watching it was that there are so many people walking around dealing with trauma of some kind, and some who don't even realize it themselves. It was beautifully explored and written and will lend itself well to helping those in need of discovering and healing from their own traumas.",False
10,10,"Powerful, One of a Kind",erakers,n/a,15/08/2025,"What Lies Inside is one of those productions which for a while after you've been lucky enough to watch it- you're speechless. Whether it has upset you, inspired you, educated you - or all three, it's impossible not to deeply reflect on what you've just seen. This documentary truly is one of a kind!",False
11,9,The Absence of Grey,ericktownsend,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are so many people who will tell you that the world is NOT Black and White, however there are more days than not, that we all seem only to remember the darkness or the light. I LOVE and HATE this film! The oblivious privileged viewer will find roughly 10mins in, that they did NOT sign up to look inward and expose what Untruth or Wound is present and unaccounted for, while healing virtue ever so intentionally is slathered from the screen. The journey of the marginalized viewer is a bit more patient. As history would have it and the present perpetuates; this fresh perspective delivers an ""all things to all people"" while not being pulpity nor exclusionary. How I wanted to shut it off as it dug into a well I didn't know still existed but couldn't because I resonated with the journey so much. I loved how it wasn't overtly including matters of race and culture but it certainly didn't excuse or exclude them. Trauma isn't exclusive. I hate this film because I wanted what the ""cast"" was being afforded. I wanted it for my Bride and Daughter. As I watched, I DESPERATELY wanted the cathartic process for my Father and Mother and extended family. The cinematography and story telling is absolutely stunning and worth every minute, as to not distract you from the message. Spread the word. This is worth watching.",True
12,10,A candid and soulful look at trauma,kharless-51344,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film artfully explains the ways trauma can be seen in our lives, and how it isn't always clear where it originated. I appreciated the writer's candor, and the way he tells the story of discovery for himself. If you have ever wondered why you seek approval from others more than trusting in yourself, this movie can provide insights that open the door to continue your own journey of understanding.",False
13,10,Unbelievably accurate - to the heart,robwhitepa,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a retired Army Flight Surgeon with 4 conflict deployments this documentary spoke directly to the parts of me that I have felt so misunderstood. This documentary allowed me to realize that I wasn't alone and in my internal struggles, and that trauma is so diverse and impacts so many levels of humanity. Bravo to director and producers of this truly timely documentary. This is truly one of the most misunderstood issue of our current culture.",False
14,10,Thought provoking and powerful,kurtlad,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary has helped me to understand a facet of trauma that I had not thought of before. Things that stay hidden inside our subconscious, what our mind tries to protect us from. Seeing Luke in a situation where he shared his trauma with us all helped me to understand how different it may be for everyone.It's helped me to reflect on what trauma I've endured as I've grown up around the world. The hardship, pain and suffering that I've suppressed and how I will have to deal with my healing.Thank you for the powerful insight into your life and showing us how trauma affects different people.",True
15,10,Excellent narrative documentary on trauma. A must-see for psychoeducation!,emdavis-147-195199,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is life changing, very educational and beautifully filmed. Even if you think you know about trauma, it's worth watching for a deeper, more personal, more complex view of how trauma impacts us each uniquely, and powerfully.As a licensed psychologist and professor of graduate counseling, I will be recommending this documentary to the future therapists I work with, and to clients who struggle with putting together the puzzle of their pasts. Trauma is not stored in our brains like other pleasant or boring events, it is often stored in the body. Knowing this helps immensely with the healing process.Be sure you keep watching all the way through the movie, even if you struggle to relate at the beginning with the first individual story; the message expands as it progresses, and I encourage you to take the entire journey...the end is worth it!The variety of trauma experts and survivors interviewed in this film enrich and heighten the experience. You'll have an understanding of trauma usually reserved for experts in the field, because you'll be exposed to so many of them, with helpful narrative examples to understand more difficult concepts.Enjoy the film. For many of us, What Lies Inside is asking to be seen, understood, digested and processed as a part of our unique life histories. It's well worth the time.",False
16,10,Eye-opening,jenniferneise,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary opened my eyes to many different types of trauma that occur in the human experience. The stories will touch the heart of the viewer and I can't think of a better time to watch something that would make one more empathetic to the lives of others.
I found the film to be esthetically pleasing and especially appreciated hearing from the amazingly courageous Eva Kor. This film will make you think about your own life experiences and bring compassion to others by hearing their stories.",True
17,10,A beautiful journey,jesseengle-33152,n/a,15/08/2025,"What Lies Inside is an incredible story of trauma and healing told in a most beautiful way. Sweeping cinematography and intimate portraits will keep you emotionally engaged for the entire film. It covers a wide range of trauma-related topics and brings them to life in a way that is easy to understand, friendly, and familiar. It feels like a wise old friend sharing hard-earned wisdom and I expert to return to it again and again.",False
18,10,Mesmerizing,lorrialana,n/a,15/08/2025,"Any good educator knows that the best way to teach is to capture the learner's attention and keep it as long as you can. Luke Renner has accomplished this in his documentary about Trauma. As we learn, we are truly captured and held in this mesmerizing film. I want to watch it again!",False
19,10,Powerful!,john-22366,n/a,15/08/2025,"My wife and I found What Lies Inside to be amazingly powerful. The story, the authenticity of the experts and people interviewed who have suffered, the cinematography and music...it carried us. We were touched deeply and found ourselves reflecting on our relationships with our children and other loved ones. I highly recommend this film. Our organization, Haiti Partners sponsored having subtitles in French so that it can be available to a larger audience. We look forward to when it will also be in Haitian-Creole. Trauma has a grip on so many of us. This film has the power to help people discover a path to healing.",False
20,10,Trauma Informed Care,corth-21027,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are seeking to understand your personal trauma or increase your own awareness to how trauma impacts us all, this film is a great resource.Luke's personal transparency draws you in to the exploration of personal trauma. Paired with other persons willing to share their stories and professional voices, one cannot help but become better acquainted with the impact trauma and traumatic events have on people.If you are involved in any type of work that provides care of persons, this is a most see and encounter. Not only for the potential of personal discovery, but also to create better awareness and equipping.I viewed on my own, I would really enjoy and recommend viewing with a group, especially one that would create the space for dialogue. Likely taking place over a couple sessions.",False
21,10,From Reeling to Feeling to Healing,tonimcnulty,n/a,15/08/2025,"After watching this powerful documentary, I began to realize that most, if not all of us have been damaged by life in some way or another. As a childhood trauma survivor, I've had the benefit of support from friends and therapy, but still exhibited behaviors I didn't fully understand. This movie, carefully and artfully done, presents survivors who, like me, are finding their way to health, and professionals who help us understand why help is so important.This is an important film that deserves to be available for viewing by all, and I encourage anyone who knows a trauma victim to watch it with them.A ""must see"" for parents, especially!",False
22,10,Oddly Comforting,Spikes44,n/a,15/08/2025,"Going into this film I didn't have many expectations, but coming out of I feel a sense of comfort, that I'm not alone in my experiences. This film changed the way I viewed my past and showed me that what I went through is still valid. Even though I thought I was fully healed from the trauma I experienced this film helped bring me even more closure to my past. This film is a must see as it can help heal your past.",False
23,8,What Lies Inside Can't Stay Inside,batyayaniger,n/a,15/08/2025,"What Lies Inside is an expertly written film about trauma. The main message that I got from it is how what lies inside can't stay inside. We radiate who we are from our innermost being. This becomes the way we interact with the world. The interviews with professionals in the field and with people who have experienced trauma gave a penetrating picture of what happens with trauma. It will be helpful for anyone who wants to understand better and helpful to those who suffer to know that they are not alone. It holds out hope, because it reminds us as well of our strengths and capacity for resilience.",False
24,9,Self discovery journey benefits more than the filmmaker.,leighd-34922,n/a,15/08/2025,"What Lies Inside beautifully and lovingly takes a deep dive into understanding how traumatic events impact people. Filmmaker Luke Renner and other brave individuals share how their lives have been disrupted by trauma. You may even find yourself looking in the mirror, needing to delve deeper into your own subconscious or to forgive. Thankfully, Renner also keys into the latest healing modalities from the world's top trauma researchers; Bessel Van Der Kolk, Peter Levine, Dan Siegel and Kerry-Ann Williams.",False
25,10,Excellent film with important message,aledalaw,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all this film is visually stunning. Very well crafted. I believe everyone will walk away from this film with a new understanding of their past behavior. Love, compassion, empathy and forgiveness are the hallmarks of this movie. I believe just about everyone has experienced some form of trauma during their life. This film does a great job explaining what trauma is and the various levels and ways we experience it individually.",False

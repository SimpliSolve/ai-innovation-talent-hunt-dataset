1,7,Incredibly Informative,jlivengood-02463,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would consider the documentary a positive learning experience on ancient Greek culture, giving incite on the growth of ancient, sea-barring civilizations and practices. It shows what some cultures might have done as religious practices, how they transported goods, and their construction of buildings. Everyone involved clearly showed their appreciation toward their work and their desire to figure out what happened on the island. My only issue was that when people talked, on occasion it could be seen that it was re-recorded separately and placed on top of the original footage, not including the narrator's dialogue as that was to be expected..",False

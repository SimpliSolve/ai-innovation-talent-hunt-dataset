1,10,The film shows how bitterness over the loss of an empire helps darkness overcome the entire country of Russia,sergeyembox,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very truthful and talented work of Ukrainian directors and actors that made me cry. It must be seen by everyone !The film shows how bitterness over the loss of an empire helps darkness overcome the entire country of Russia.Also it depicts how easy for dictators like Putin to manipulate a whole country and nation and make in force the wildese character traits of people using grievances of past times.It remind us that we must fight for democracy, freedom and humanity inside us and in every place in the World to stay ""people"" and protect our kids from what happened in Ukraine.And definitely, people of Ukraine and its army designated all possible support to fight the evil !!!",False
2,10,Warning: true evil,singalen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mild spoiler: these are quotations from russian invasion soldiers' phone conversations with their families.They are so pure evil that they don't even know they are evil, they don't reflect. A kind of, in their own way, innocent ghouls that you cannot even talk to, only wooden stake through a heart will work.Like Tolkien's orcs. Only you know that orcs don't exist, and these, so to speak, people do, and hundreds of thousands of them are now pillaging Ukraine.Warning, you are in a real danger of losing your sleep if you watch it. You cannot unsee it, and once you see - the world becomes a much scarier place.",False
3,10,It's the movie experience of all experiences!,messer-70264,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is it! No further horror movie, war film, thriller or any other documentary can top this ever!This film is a hauntingly evocative exploration of life in Ukraine during the Russian invasion, masterfully blending serene landscapes and the chilling reality of conflict. It juxtaposes the beauty of Ukrainian countryside and ordinary life with the stark brutality of war, enhanced by the unsettling inclusion of intercepted phone calls from Russian soldiers. These recordings, presented with subtitles, offer an unfiltered glimpse into the psyche of the aggressors, creating a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience.Visually, the film captivates with sweeping shots of Ukraine's natural beauty, creating an almost dreamlike quality that contrasts sharply with the undercurrent of violence. This interplay between beauty and tragedy makes every frame resonate with unspoken emotion.The use of original intercepted phone calls is the film's most striking feature. These conversations, layered over the visuals, range from mundane discussions to jarring confessions. They provide a raw and often disturbing insight into the war from the perspective of Russian soldiers, exposing their fears, frustrations, and, at times, chilling indifference and brutality. This audio element not only deepens the narrative but also serves as a stark reminder of the human cost and moral complexities of war.The film's power lies in its restraint. It does not seek to overwhelm with graphic depictions of violence or heavy-handed messaging. Instead, it allows the images and voices to speak for themselves, inviting the audience to reflect on the fragility of life, the absurdity of war, and the resilience of the human spirit.",False
4,2,Victimizing Russians,oleksander-havryliuk,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film explains very little what Ukrainians are suffering from this war. Indeed it rather shows Russian soldiers or their relatives as victims. They are left without support in the frontlines, it's evidently Putin who sent them to Ukraine, their children say ""daddy come back, we love you"", they cry into the phone, many are killed and nobody cares, the authorities do not pay the promised money for being wounded or killed... And even in the end, the speaker is claimed ""a hero"".The conversations proves that common Russians are envious, dumb and cruel. They steal and kill civilians.I don't think this film is useful to show the realities of the Russian invasion into Ukraine.",False

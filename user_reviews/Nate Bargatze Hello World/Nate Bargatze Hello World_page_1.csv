1,9,Relatably funny,thesuthernman,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've heard this dude many times on Sirius FM, but I've never seen him live or on TV for an entire routine. I was pleasantly surprised. Even if every joke wasn't laugh out loud funny, there was a smile on my face the entire time. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments as well. Most good comedians are relatable but this guy is the most relatable I've ever heard. The jokes all come from real stuff, which is always the funniest stuff. It was 100% an added bonus that he doesn't need foul language or risque jokes to be funny. It's so much harder to keep a crowd laughing when you can't resort to the lowest common denominator, or so it seems with most comedians these days.",False
2,9,I so appreciate a clean act,chris-syvertsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's really so much more a display of talent to be able to make people laugh without getting crude. Hey, the crude stuff is also funny, but it's really refreshing when you can watch something like this without having an F bomb constantly thrown at you or having every other joke be about sex. I have actually only ever heard his clips across streaming radio comedy channels. This was my first full stand-up set from him, and from other reviews, I see there's some Netflix material as well. I'm sure several of those are where the clips came from, but I am looking forward to watching those full sets as well.",False
3,9,My face hurts from smiling for an hour,thejdrage,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nate Bargatze doesn't yell, shout, or curse - AND, here's something novel: He's actually funny! And SMART about it too!In the past several month's I have gone through ""comics"" like cheap toilet paper - tearing them up and tossing them out when they don't work. I will give a comic 5 - 10 minutes to make me smile or laugh out loud - and if they are not funny to me, I stop watching. My time is too important to waste on people who think that by talking LOUDLY or degrading others for what they call humor, that we are going to buy it.He respects his fans - that's refreshing ('cause I am one).What is funny as hell, I mean heck, is that his zip code is 37138. Now THAT is funny!Keep up the great work, Nate!!! We appreciate you!",False
4,10,Great,kevinvimdb,n/a,15/08/2025,"Usually, when I hear that a comic does clean material, I immediately think it's not going to be very good. That's generally been my experience, unfortunately. But this guy is great.A lot of comics pretend that they are talking about real life in general, and even theirs specifically. Most of the time, you'd never believe they-or anyone-actually had the experiences they are relating. Bargatze, on the other hand, is telling stories and thoughts that are believable and hit home as true. (With some license and exaggeration, of course.)So, here we have a rarity: stand-up comedy that is family friendly AND good.",False
5,10,My wife and I laughed and laughed,gianthaole,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had never heard of Nate Bargatze until 2020. I am so glad my wife found clips of him on YouTube and then we found his specials on Netflix. When we heard he was dropping a new special on Amazon Prime, we both got so excited. Nate is extremely talented and is fun for the whole family. Not many stand up comedians can be for the whole family but Nate definitely is. The only negative I would put for this stand up is we wanted more than an hour. If you are reading this and have never seen Nate Bargatze, give him a chance and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Also check out his nateland podcast.",False
6,10,Hilarious!,jstwxyn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Aside from the fact that good clean comedy is a rarity these days, Nate's mind for telling a story in the funniest way possible such a gift. This special was so refreshing! The way he can make fun of his family and himself and have you come out loving all of them is so great. There were so many great bits in this, from birth order jokes to attempting to play golf with your wife to...bald eagles touching your head (I mean, who makes a joke about that, lol)...Hello World is just the relief from the everyday stress of life that we all need. Okay, no they did not pay me to write this. I'm just excited for everyone else to experience it too. If you're not already on Prime Video, go start a free 30-day trial and check it out. Okay, no, Amazon didn't pay me to write this either, I swear.",False
7,10,laugh after laugh,BABSBunny24,n/a,15/08/2025,"My spouse and I laughed the whole time. I laughed until tears were literally spilling down my face. I love myself some dark and raunchy comedy but this special was refreshing in a way. I think it takes a unique talent to be this funny without being crass or dissecting a current or hot button social issue. I love his delivery, too.Idk what more I can say about it but apparently i have to in order to be able to submit a review. I do not get how this man is not more famous. I am definitely anticipating future work from him. He is really good at telling a story, descriptive without bogging it down and his timing is impeccable.",False
8,7,Nate Bargatze is Very Funny,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nate Bargatze is Very Funny. His stand up delivery is very relatable. This special is family oriented and that does not detract from the humor. It is quite intelligent. Bargatze's storytelling skills are very intimate and personal. He tells stories with a lot of color and human. I like how self-effacing he is. None of his humor, despite being familiar, is mean spirited or vicious. He tells stories, that may not even be true, but seem filled with real details about colorful people. His use of language is remarkable. He also has a masterful timing with the audience when storytelling. This one is worth watching.",False
9,10,Love this guy!,rocket_queen-30585,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw several of Nate Bargatze's clips on Facebook a few months back so I looked him up. When I found him on Netflix, I watched both specials immediately, and then this special as soon as it released. I love this guy's comedy. I love that his material is so relatable, and Lord help me, I love that it's so wholesome. His bit about birth order is spot on, and it's hilarious.I came home in a bad mood today and thought, ""I bet watching some Nate Bargatze will lighten up my mood"" and yup, sure enough, it did. (When I want to sit and stew in it, I watch Tom Segura, but that's a review for another day.)",False
10,7,Funny,JurijFedorov,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think the 2019 one is funnier. It was about weird stories like a dead horse and walking up a hill. This is more dull and most is just him being in his house. About very regular family events and he seldom makes it controversial or spicy. The stories about his sister are great, but he then jumps to a totally new topic and it becomes everyday stuff again. I think he needs to focus on the emotional stories about social dynamics and try to stretch out single stories or make sure they are all following the same storyline. It's still funny, but there are places in his shows where I do zone out as he has low energy and needs to deliver 100% to land the jokes.I recommend watching it if you are bored. But it does feel like he hasn't really grown as a comedian. Rather he is just doing the same stuff over and over. A dull married man. I hope there will be some inventive stuff and a greater story soon. A PG comedian is not a selling point in itself. It's quite decent though.",False
11,10,So Much Fun!,mikechick-42450,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nate is my kids' age not mine but we all find him absolutely relatable and hilarious!! His observational humor is so true to life and his delivery makes it that much funnier! Few comedians can make everyday life events so entertaining to such a wide age range of audiences but Nate always manages to pull it off without dropping F bombs or throwing in a lot of embarrassing material. Well, maybe embarrassing for HIM but not for viewers. Based on his stories, his wife deserves an award too!! ðŸ¤£I've watched this more than once and laughed until I was crying every single time! Do yourself a favor and watch this immediately!! ðŸ˜Š",False
12,4,Meh,lynne-powell,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mediocre and a bit ho-hum. I yawned more than I laughed, actually got distracted quite bit as it rambled along. Normally slow comedy is fine for me, if it's witty and tight. This was just a little too all over the place and so found it hard to engage. Relatable comedy is also entertaining, but needs to be more novel to be that kind of surprising funny that makes one laugh out loud. The average joe stuff is becoming so trite and over done. The whole thing felt like the sad soliloquy of a dying breed. Perhaps if the target audience is mostly yt mostly Christian mostly conservative they can relate.",False
13,10,Awesome!,spqmkn-82338,n/a,15/08/2025,"Finally a comedian who can make us laugh without disrespecting anyone or anything! He's not cussing, not scolding, nor does he spread a political agenda. Just having an innocent good time and I'm here for it! I've been following his specials for quite some time and can truly appreciate him more and more. Especially the time we live in!The fact that this special is family oriented and also delivers as family oriented AND friendly is such a relieve.I love how simpel and smart his comedy is. It's so understandable and relatable. His jokes are relatable on all ages as well. Especially the sibling jokes, very very clever put in there.Good job Nate!!",False
14,9,Brilliant delivery and very funny,michael-87621,n/a,15/08/2025,After seeing a bunch of clips on instagram I sought this out on Amazon Prime and I thought it was really good indeed!... I thoroughly enjoyed it! Nate is very funny and as a 45 year only family man I found it highly relatable with a good range of stories and anecdotes. I particular loved his stories from his childhood with 1980's references. I really like Nate's delivery style and cadence... it's easy going and methodical and brilliantly deadpan. I do appreciate the fact that it's clean and look forward to showing this to my teenage sons as I know they will find it really funny too. Highly recommended!,False
15,10,Wish all comics could be this good.,gardentheater,n/a,15/08/2025,"If the only reason you can make someone laugh is to be dirty, vulgar, mean, or nasty the truth is you're probably a bully and not funny at all. True talent is when everyone gets to laugh, no one feels ashamed or embarrassed by your content. So so so many comics could learn a thing or two from Mr. Bargatze. He is my new favorite. Clean is the new cool.",False
16,1,I just didn't find it funny,ACollegeStudent,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rating: 1.5Stand-ups are always hit or miss because either you find them funny or you don't. For me I laughed twice in 60 minutes I just didn't find him all that funny. If you're closer to his age (early 40s) you may relate to what he has to say more and find it more enjoyable. For someone in their early 20's the jokes weren't ""old"" per se but not my cup of tea. I just don't have enough life experience to relate to some of these jokes, you ""know"" what he's talking about but you don't KNOW it first hand so the impact is marginal. Since there are or no redeeming qualities like cinematography, score or storyline I can't warrant giving this anything above a 1.",False
17,4,Boring and unfunny,RickScript,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't get the 8.0 rating here. I've seen him in several specials already and while he's never great, this show is particularly boring and unfunny. I couldn't stay interested past 25 minutes and ditched it. He has a personality that seems relatable in an everyday man kind of way but his routine just meanders aimlessly and looks like he's trying to walk a fine line and not offend anyone. I don't expect to be roaring with laughter non-stop from any comic and can stay with someone whose humor derives from a long, drawn-out story, especially when the subject is one we can ALL relate to. An example would be Nick Thune, who tells a 25 minute story about his first trip to a legal weed dispensary that results in his dog ingesting a huge pot brownie and leads to an emergency trip to a vet...Or even Kevin Smith (yes, the director) who does some interesting story-telling in a similar style. Nate has done better jobs than this one but here he seems like even HE doesn't think his material is funny. I have a fairly low threshhold of laughter but this performance couldn't even get me to cross the baseline...I'd pass.",False
18,4,So Sad,ucrjoy-59164,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have loved every special Nate Bargatze has ever done, he is always funny! Just looking at him makes me laugh because I know something funny is going to come out of his mouth! But, this show, Hello World was so disappointing. It was not funny and he seemed like he was reading a script. In the past he has always had perfect delivery and has had good content too. I have loved every single joke he has ever told. What happened Nate? I hope this isn't the end of funny Nate. Maybe his next special will be better. I'm done writing my comments, but it says I need more characters. So, I'm now at the limit! Woohoo.",False
19,5,"No real highes, also no lows",jochemunlimited,n/a,15/08/2025,"For me it was a bit boring. It is good he does not use bad language or sex or offending jokes. So I gave him one point extra for it.He can be sharp and witty, but I have the feeling it is not all the time. He is just telling things, not really on a funny way, but he brings it like: duh! So that is nice, but that is all he does.Yes it is relatable but that does not make it automaticly funny or comedy. It is also not really my cup of tea I think when it is brought like this. I want more emotion I guess. I don't know, it is difficult to find a good comedian, it is about taste. Maybe this was a lesser show of him, I don't know.",False
20,5,Very slow comedy,misspudding,n/a,15/08/2025,"I couldn't finish, I thinkI hated 30 minutes and gave up. I was waiting for the punchline and then would look at my phone and then would look back at the screen and realize I missed the joke. Over and over again. It's not that he's clean comedy and I don't like that. I love Jim Gaffigan and I would consider him clean comedy, as well. I saw a preview on Facebook of this show and it was apparently the funniest clip in the entire thing.I don't know if the high review is because it got a lot better towards the end? Or are there a bunch of fundies that are artificially boosting the rating because he's ""clean""? I don't know, but the pacing was incredibly slow and dry, and it really just sounded like a guy telling stories about his life. Not side splitting comedy.",False

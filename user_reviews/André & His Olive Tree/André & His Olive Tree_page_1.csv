1,8,"A ""dish"" worth indulging into",bensontoh,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is an intimate journey into food and passion. The director manages to bring out the intricacies of what goes behind a Michelin restaurant - from the OCDs of the smallest details to the principles of Chef Andre's Octaphilosophy. It's raw, unfiltered and emotive at the same time. The film also talks about the people behind his success, his mentors, staff, critics, customers and most importantly his wife who play a pivotal role in this documentary. I really enjoy this movie and the 104 mins passed by so quickly.",False
2,7,The documentary was cool; André was much cooler,arnoldpoon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Skillfully penetrated in André's octaphilosophy, the documentary is dissected into 8 themes. Despite the good concept, execution falls short. The documentary taken as a dish, would be some domestic cupcake under the veneer of branded canapé - worthy of the hype but wanting the delicacy. I believe a cold tone for Singapore scenes - 1.5 degrees North of the equator - is a blunder. Cinematography apart, André seems aloof at work whilst you would observe good amount of smile on him too, which makes him atypical of a documentary protagonist. A point for director on that. There is no need of too much garnish or seasoning for a dish, as well as a character portrayal. Whereas the documentary essentially did not set a clear tone from the get-go, neither does any sparks come off along the way. I guess bad execution does not kill a good story. 7/10",False

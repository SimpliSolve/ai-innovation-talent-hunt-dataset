1,8,Enjoyable Retro Ride Rescues,AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many of us car enthusiasts have seen the standard barn finds, junk yard car sleuths, and ""will it start"" shows. I wondered if this was another of the same ilk. If so it would need something different. Well,, this is quite a bit different. The five principal car hunters are very likable and their methods and actual car finds are fresh and different. In the wild north there are abandoned cars and trucks that are rare with even more rare backstories. It all adds up for good entertainment. Nevermind it seems they often over pay for what looks ""rough as a cobb"", these forgotten rides get treated like finds from King Tut's tomb! I've never seen a combo like this: spotter plane, PowerWagon wrecker, and semi with a crane lift. The is a show unlike any others I've seen to date. I thought it had all been done and filmed, but I stand corrected.",False
2,7,"Fun to Watch, but inconsistent.",kevinalbright,n/a,16/08/2025,"The premise, as I understood it before watching the show was that they were going to be searching the wilds for abandoned cars and cars rotting in farmers' fields, and back yards. They begin with the Chevy in the swamp, which is fun to watch. Later, they start with the older formula of getting leads, walking up driveways (landing in their fields), and negotiating with the owners.The part that bothers me is that in order to have a ""Theme"" for each show or outing (muscle cars, VWs, pre-WWII cars, etc.), they walk past other good cars that we can see in the background in order to try to only hit the theme of the mission. I would think that any good find would make the grade even if it weren't part of the mission, after all, that is the bigger mission, find good cars, and sell them.",False
3,6,Leeven is the real story,robahar,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerSome of the vehicles are fun to see but its just like any other staged reality show. I would wonder if anyone would bother with these cars if they weren't being paid money to film it. Every car is their favorite ever. I would prefer to see what actually happens to these cars after they are picked up rather than just moving on to the next rescue. There are definitely some hairy situations that are fun to watch but to me the best part of the storyline is the bromance between Lee and Steve or Leeven! It was fun to watch that friendship become what it has. You can really feel the connection with these 2 guys and tell that they really enjoy being with each other. Even more so than the brothers lol.,True
4,9,Nostalga,klassiter-81871,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was raised in a salvage yard and we used travel Al, Ga, Fla. Looking for old car bargains in old cars, tons of fun, dirty, wet but didn't seem to notice when we bagged the car. Did this for years with dad And brother. Didn't have a plane or big rig just our ton Ford wrecker and a thermos of coffee. This show takes me back to simpler time in many ways. Hope to see more
episodes. Dad my brother and I were all Mopar fans and were always on look out for them, but brought home a Hudson or Packard . A Ford ,if we had to if it was a bargain but rarely ,a Chevy sometimes I could drive.one to school if I fixed it.",False
5,9,Great show for old car enthusiasts,Pucknell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved the premise, and it was a great watch. The cast seemed pretty knowledgable on all the classic cars, and watching them hunt, extract and barter to get them was really fun.",False
6,10,Great,hollenbecklaura,n/a,16/08/2025,We love this. I'd love to travel with them to find all these old vehicles. It's great that they rescue and save them. Love the comic relief of Leeven. It's a great team of people. Their history plus the people's history with their vehicles is wonderful. It's a great idea and different from a lot of other shows. We hope they produce many more seasons. The girl is such an amazing pilot for as young as she seems. All the men have a lot of knowledge of what they are doing and all the vehicles they find. It is so interesting and fun. Keep doing what you are doing. Thank you. It says I have to write twenty four more letters.,False
7,3,staged beyond belief,draeby,n/a,16/08/2025,"Staged like crazy, makes it very uninteresting., watched all episodes, it just keeps getting worse...3 stars, thats it. It could have been so good, but its not.",False
8,4,Why do they have to lie?,iman-roder,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey're constantly saying things like what are the odds we find this place, car or person? I dont mind that it's staged, I mean that's good otherwise theyd just fly around every episode and find nothing, but I find it insulting to my intelligence that they lie about it. Why can't they just say we did some research and found these leads and now we're checking them out. They just can't get that lucky over and over. I was really into it at first, the concept is unlike another other car hunter/restoration show, with them flying around the woods rather than searching city neighborhoods like all other shows like it. Also they never show how the car ends up after restoration, I love seeing that, especially when the car is found in as rough shape as they find them. But I guess they dont do that and just sell them off as is.",True
9,1,Rescue vintage truck for a museum season 2 episode 1,elbenjamin-80546,n/a,16/08/2025,"The goal to rescue a car for a museum sounds a great idea,the fact that you take the car from a family and do not give anything back is just greedy. The team went ,can not find the car,get help by direct guide to the place by a child. You are pathetic,went with no tools to move the vehicle in the middle of no where remote and unaccessible area.the grandfather lend his tools ,so you can do the recue you went to do. Granpa get no payment,you get the vehicle and the family ended with bunch of trees cut and torn by your rescue mission. The reality is you use and take from people without give back what will be considerate the right thing to do. I was very dissatisfied with the end. I really thought the end will show the family was given some type of remuneration, but no. I will not see any more of this series. I hope Matt and his crew return to this kind family and apologize for there behavior. Will see if this come but I doubt it happen. Will not recommended this series to anyone.",False

11,1,Lame,rob-a-radcliffe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely 100 percent staged. The dumbest s**** I have ever watched. Contrived, set up. Clearly the product crew put the cars in the spots they are ""found"". The cars a cool. The acting is awful. No one talks to eachother like that. When you find a car properly in the bush, its covered in leaves, weeds, animal droppings, dirt, mud and all the works. Flat tires. No wheels. Locked brakes. None of that is present in this show. This show physically hurts me, makes me sad and is embarrasing.Id rather watch Gas Monkey Garage, and that show was awful. Go watch Vice Grip Garage instead. Its much better.",False

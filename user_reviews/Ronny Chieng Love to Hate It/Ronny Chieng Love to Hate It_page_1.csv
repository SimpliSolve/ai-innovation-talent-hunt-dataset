1,6,A lot of jokes based on his opinion rather than his experiences.,NatashaWM,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some people didn't find it funny but I laughed several times throughout, and nothing he said politics wise offended me. This is definitely not his best work but I would watch another netflix special by him.Honestly I think this show suffered a bit from being rather impersonal. Like I got to the end and realised I hadn't learnt much more about his life and the people in it, which is weird for a comedian known for telling jokes (stories) about his life. There were only a few personal jokes, but on the whole there were not many, and he definitely overdid the IVF jokes.The shows biggest downfall is that half the jokes (stories) were based on his own philosophical and political musings about america and the world in general, and even though I wasn't offended by it, I can see why other people didn't find that funny.I think his performance would have been stronger if he framed each joke in relation to his own lived experiences, or the experiences of the people he shares his life with. Even more jokes about the people he randomly encounters/observes while going about his life, or jokes about (non-political) stuff he sees on the news would have brought some amusement.",False
2,10,A COURAGEOUS TALK SHOW!,Rainy_D,n/a,16/08/2025,"People say talk show is an art of offending people, but there has to be a prerequisite, which is it has to be about offending people of a privileged position. If you choose to offend people of a inferior position, or the group that has always been overlooked, that is bullying, that's not art of any kind.So many Asian so-called ""comedians"" choose to make jokes about their parents, about how much they hate their identifies, and how they successfully ""blend"" into the ""main-stream"". That's not comedy, not art, that's sad! Senior Asians are the ones who get systematically overlooked and even bullied everyday and everywhere in American, Asian males are the people that get systematically suppressed. And ""Chinese-born"" has become more and more as a crime to a lot of MAGAs. Ronny Chieng, as an Asian American, finally get the gut to express his take towards some of these problems. I respect him, I solute to him.This show is a small step, but a COURAGEOUS one!",False
3,10,Ronny Chieng is not afraid to speak his mind,arildhildeman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of those shows that will display your level of humor.Either you can take the jokes and treat them as that, just jokes or you're way to stuck up and take life too seriously.His observations are spot on from beginning to the end. I told my wife before even writing this comment that he will most likely have a few, very bad reviews from people who are way too political.His bad reviews will solely come from people who are triggered because he (very well spokenly) challenges their thoughts and they just can't take it.Time and time again I said out loud ""That's a very good observation"" (political or not)",False
4,10,Best Asian American talk show performance,long-gun,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best Asian talk show ever, which touches upon several key political issues, with a unique, innovative, deep, insightful, brave, and most importantly, honest view. He also touches a few family related issues, with deep sincerity as well. Love to see the born of a great comedian and artist. Proud of him as an Asian American myself.The show is 100% recommended!Compare this with other talk show works, this performance stands out by its deliciated structure, master-class delivery, and sheer genuineness. Above all the technicalities, this work truely reflects the performer's love to the society he lives in, the passion he has towards improving it.",False
5,1,Not funny...,djwxkwjs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ronny Chieng's Love to Hate it Netflix special feels like a punishment rather than entertainment. It's as if someone took the concept of comedy, ran it through a blender, and forgot to add any humor.Chieng spends the entire special alternating between yelling, glaring, and making bizarre observations that feel like they were brainstormed during a caffeine-fueled fever dream. The pacing is so erratic it's as though the special is actively trying to give you whiplash.The ""punchlines"" (if you can call them that) are predictable at best and cringe-inducing at worst. Every time I thought it couldn't get less funny, it somehow managed to find a new low. I genuinely started to feel bad for the audience, who looked like they were laughing out of obligation or possibly nervous confusion.By the end, I wasn't just unamused; I was actively annoyed. If this is the future of comedy, then we should all be deeply concerned. Watch at your own risk.",False
6,10,"Exciting, Brilliant",braddahh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Erudite, raunchy, slap the chair funny, his perspective on US-spot on, using academia in part of his set was Brilliant ...Illiterate people git a must needed correction on the many colors, types of Asians/ChineseüëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ!!! What I love most about Ronny is his delivery, which encompasses his voice, usage of his body, and his timing!!! The pacing of your set added the punch and intensity...Awesome!!! Gets one to suspend one's cognitive dissonance...Brilliant Ronny!!!

7,9,Worth a watch,imdbfan-7251835838,n/a,16/08/2025,"Worth a watch! Broke out in laughter a few times, which I find happens less and less the more you watch stand-up comedy over the years, so definitely appreciate it when it happens.Quite witty content and thus enjoyed the themes, which though not brand new in comedy, such as political events, family and asian culture, were approached in a smart and sharp satirical manner that splashed a wave of freshness.Found the more sympathetic and less of a mockery gaze in current male struggles an innovative approach.Also a very strong performer with a wide repertoire, which made the execution of the jokes stand out.",False
8,1,Wow Not Funny At All,dayana421,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not funny at all, I liked Ronny Chieng first stand up on Netflix. The second Netflix special was not funny, I decided to give him another chance. First 10 minutes of the Netflix special was mildly funny I thought maybe this time around will get some laughs . But I was mistaken, after first 10 minutes it turned into annoying rant that started giving me a headache. There was nothing funny about it, just what Ronny Cheing thinks about life events, politics and how things should be. Advice to Ronny, comedy is about making people laugh not annoy them with a senseless rant of what you think. Had to stop the show midway.",False
9,1,Stale and disappointing,cynthiamyin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou can tell his heart in the right place. But when you're a comedian and you reach a certain level of fame, you might start to think ""How can I use my fame and influence to lecture everyone about how I think the world should be?"" instead of ""How can I make people laugh as hard as possible?""When that happens, the comedy suffers, the laughs are few, and the boredom is high.The first 15 minutes were ok, then he started doing a PSA on echo chambers and scam artists, then he went into politics and economics.I love Ronnie Chieng - his delivery is usually second to none. Even in his small role in Meagan, he always pulled focus when he was in a scene. He has so much potential to kill it on stage.But this time, his potential was wasted.",True
10,2,First hit and miss.,ckembar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I surely didn't love to hate it like the title suggested it, I could not believe the lowered level of well-thought and sharp observations compared with the previous two shows.At some point I was almost convinced that everything was written by asking an AI model to write a whole new show in the style of Ronny's past shows.There is simply no soul present.My guess is that this was written by a D-grade embryo and for D-grade embryos only.Ronny is very clear about other people's opinions, he doesn't care at all. And while is right about it, he should at least listen to his own opinion called self-criticism.I hope that this was a one-time hit and miss and not the start of the downfall.",False
11,1,Politically alienates half his audience,phojar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Warning this comedian gets very political and is extremely hateful towards one party. Imagine that coming from the party of acceptance strange.He starts out with a story and parts of it were mildly funny but then things went downhill fast. He started with a jab that D grade embryos would grow up to storm the capital.A sub par comedian really shouldn't risk turning off half his audience so quickly. His jokes are over exaggerated and not that funny. It's an immediate stop watching when you constantly call republicans idiots, no thanks dude. Good luck getting enough fans to keep you in a job.",False
12,1,Don't waste your time,Mikeman20s,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been a long-time fan of Ronny's work, my expectations were understandably high for his latest release on Netflix.Unfortunately, this fell significantly short of what I've come to appreciate about his style. From start to finish, the humor was lackluster, and I didn't find myself laughing even once, which is quite unusual given Ronny's typically witty and engaging performances.It seemed as though Ronny was merely going through the motions, delivering a performance that felt uninspired and lackadaisical. This episode gave the impression of being a filler - a mere obligation to fulfill a contractual quota with Netflix rather than a project driven by passion or creativity. His usual charisma and comedic timing were noticeably absent, replaced by a script that came across as rushed and poorly executed.This particular show was disappointing. It was evident that the effort and enthusiasm usually poured into his work was missing, leaving fans yearning for the original spark that made his previous shows so captivating.",False
13,5,"Steady Decline...Still funny, just not as much",mjhnzpvx,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching Ronny on SNL, eventually in his first Netflix special and even a stand up show, I thought that he would really continue cooking. Unfortunately I was wrong.He really thrives on story telling, sharing personal experiences as someone who is relatively fresh to the American Dream lifestyle.I quite enjoyed his perspective on American life, what it's like to be a part of a tradition heavy family and even mundane tasks like using public transit and the qualms that came with it. All provided very relatable humour.Unfortunately, the second Netflix special was highlighted by his opinion on vaccines (a tired topic already) and how if you didn't take it you were dumb followed up by this special which flip-flops politically to illustrate how MAGA isn't that bad. I enjoy laughs at the expense of politics and politicians alike but when it comes down to opinions and a comedian telling a viewer how they should feel, the material comes across as more of a lecture...ultimately leaving me feel like
I just sat through a class for patriotism.",False

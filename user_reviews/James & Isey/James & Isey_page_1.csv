1,10,Beautiful character study,paul-42946,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, James and Isey. It's gorgeous. Really, a fantastic bit of work, beautifully shot. I loved its contemplative pace, and the film's genuine love for the characters and place.",False
2,10,a gem,shanecaley-86539,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this film from start to end (be sure to stay right to the very end). It is interesting, heart warming, uplifting, and just so enjoyable to watch. Just like Isey and James themselves this film is a wee gem.",False
3,9,Everyone should watch!,schneidewoman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Super beautiful film that might seem like a small story to the untrained eye but when you watch you can feels its weight, so full of love and substance. Gentle and intimate detailed portrait, funny too! Everyone, particularly in Aotearoa, should watch. <3.",False
4,9,Love through a lens,vickib-34474,n/a,16/08/2025,"James and Isey are beautifully captured by Florian Habicht in this heart warming tribute to age, family, love and companionship. Isey is simply delightful, expressive face, sparkling eyes and even the house adds to the portrayal of a life well lived. James brings colour and character to the movie and an intense spiritual quality. Florian, you grabbed a once in a lifetime opportunity and rocked it, One man, one camera, one damn fine movie! Congratulations to all involved.",False
5,10,Beautiful film,jackmnicol,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gorgeous film, about a wonderful mother/son relationship. It's really moving and universal. It'll make your heart sing!!!",False
6,n/a,So much aroha in this beautiful film,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautiful film, so beautifully shot by Florian Habicht - and James & Isey are such naturals! Gorgeous showcase of kiwi culture and lifestyle and family love. You will go away from this movie feeling good about the world!",False
7,10,Exquisite masterpiece,donnademente,n/a,16/08/2025,"James and Isey is one of the most perfect snapshots of real life in rural New Zealand. It is so heart warming, tender and funny that the whole world should see it. It will probably help explain the wonderful deadpan humour of shows like Flight of the Conchords but also the rich cultural and ceremonial family-centric Maori culture which is one of the most thriving indigenous cultures in the world. I love the way Florian's just-off-camera presence adds such a warmth to the narrative. We laughed and cried our way through this absolute gem of a film.",False
8,9,Spellbound by this world,asitwas-40609,n/a,16/08/2025,"We, the audience, sat spellbound by this world, our world, the screen showed to us. ""James & Isey."" A love-song of our living and breathing Northland. The rushing surf was there, the trees were there, the peaceful cattle, even Tane Mahuta and the hole in the rock. In the middle of all this sits Isey, very much alive. Her still youthful son James at her side shows love, respect and patience and deepness of soul. I feel enriched by this movie. Everybody seemed to be. There was much laughter and even applause in the audience, well merited once! I say: ""Thank you"" from all my heart. -Marianna Grothe, aged 93.",False
9,7,Expected this to be less James...,tingy-64309,n/a,16/08/2025,Although this was an enjoyable movie and full respect to Isey but I left feeling this was James claim to a career he left. He left to care for Isey...many many years ago. This was James stepping back into being in front of the camera and using Isey as a stepping point. Left feeling respect for the strength of Isey but also feeling James played her into his feature. Just odd dynamic but beautifully presented from a film aspect...the story was - although documentary sort of a bias that twisted.,False
10,10,Charming,mountainoaf,n/a,16/08/2025,"A really lovely film - very ""New Zealand"". A beautifully shot character portrayal. I was both moved and thoroughly enjoyed it.",False
11,10,Stunning reminder of how beautiful life can be,ro-68880,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved James & Isey - from the very first moment to the very last.We saw this beautifully shot and charmingly nuanced film via the Melbourne International Film Festival player. Earlier in the day, our city had seen violence on the streets and with the so many hurting at the moment, the general feeling in our house was bleak. Watching James & Isey completely changed how we were all feeling. It was a palpable experience, as the film lifted our spirits. I was reminded of how beautiful life, family and Aotearoa can be. Life just feels better after meeting James, Isey and Florian.Favorite film of the year.",False
12,10,Love,maree-35145,n/a,16/08/2025,"James and Isey, the movie, is a documentary with a difference. Although its premise is a lead up to Isey's 100th birthday with a splendid and unique event orchestrated by Isey's youngest son and carer, James, the movie is beguiling as without agenda it deals with many slippages. We are taken back to a world of a slower pace with more human values. Here a family member cares for an elder with total respect. There are differences in beliefs. The effects of colonialism especially around first nations loss of language is evident and the slippage between ancestral identities explored. Who cares for who in this mother son relationship? The intimate interview is artfully juxtaposed against captures of the local landscape, often heavily symbolic. The interwoven imagery and dialogue leaves us centred on the fundamental truth of love.",False
13,10,"Told with precision, beauty, laughter, and love",Mairghread,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this film. It made me laugh and it made me cry - just a little tangi. Nothing is overworked in this exquisite story of two people - mother and son, Isey and James - who, in James' words, 'live their lives together in harmony'. James and Isey know filmmaker Florian Habicht and trust him with their story. We feel the filmmaker's presence, and at times, we hear not just his narration but his banter with Isey too. It is this intimacy that takes us close to a Maori whanau in the far north of Aotearoa New Zealand. It speaks of life, and death, history, culture, spirituality, and more, set against a backdrop of the muted colours of the far north. After you've seen James and Isey, grab a friend and see it again. I loved it even more the second time round.",False
14,10,Genuine kiwiana slice of life,mayhemu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Florian has captured a moment in time so beautifully...the led up to Isey's 100th birthday.Small town New Zealand shines and so does the relationship between James and his mother. Every moment is funny,intimate and heartwarming. I could not get enough, will tjere be a sequel ??!!!",False
15,9,Saw this with my Nan and we loved it,jetpackjack,n/a,16/08/2025,"Almost every Wednesday morning I go see a movie with my Nan. Often my pop joins, as does my Nan's best friend. It's something we treasure and constantly can't wait for.When attending the 'Senior Sneak-Peak' we don't always know what we are seeing till it starts playing. The mystery is part of the fun. Some times we see films that aren't so good, other times we are blown away, but today, today was a really special one.James and Isey a beautiful New Zealand documentary which welcomes us into their family home and takes us on a journey of a Mother and Son on the days leading up to her 100th birthday.As my nan put it, ""it's a documentary with SOUL, I absolutely loved it"". Seeing this film in a cinema where I was the ONLY one without grey hair, the ONLY one below 65 (I'm 21) was a uniquely wonderful experience.The energy in the theatre was gleaming. Looking around at my fellows movie goers to see a room full of smiles, laughs and a sense of ""we're all young at heart"" was really quite special.Both my Nan and I share a real passion for movies. I could heavily relate to James and Isey in the sense that stories and storytelling are multigenerational. Stories need to shared. Everyone for deserves to laugh and be entertained no matter how old (or young) they are.I feel this movie perfectly set out to do what it intended to do, something that a lot of films can't say about themselves. If you get the chance you must see this, especially if you can bring your Nan along.",False

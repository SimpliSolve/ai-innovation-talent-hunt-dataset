1,9,Man oh MAN!!!,scottadamsetchel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I suffer from CRPS.I also have other medical issues that end me in the hospital. I have to explain to each doc that comes in what CRPS is. EACH TIME. Noone wants to believe you. You lose friends, relationships and family members. And most medical people think your lying or it's in your head.This is why it's nickname is ""The Suicide Disease.I've never wanted to throw something at my tv so bad before. I feel for this family. Especially for Maya and the loss she has suffered. Stress can trigger a CRPS flare up. Just like the hurricane did.The ignorance and arrogance of these doctors are unreal.Great documentary.",False
2,8,Sad Commentary on the Medical System,Sarah423,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'll try to hold onto the belief that everyone in this scenario had the best interests of children at the heart in their positions. I'll try, although there's a huge conflict of interest issue that I'd like to see a second documentary tackle all in itself.(The assessor also being part of the for-profit corporate care system that the referred children go into.)But lets say that the care givers are there still to ""do no harm"" and were wanting the best for Maya. This documentary still poses the problem of what to do for ""unicorn"" illnesses. What to do when doctors from different establishments differ on diagnosis and treatment. Who gets to decide when there's not a widely established protocol?And mainly, who gets the final decisions when it comes to health.I'm not sure whose diagnosis and treatment are better, frankly, and will have to read more. Perhaps on that it was a toss up or even that the hospital involved was right.However, when a hospital thinks parents seeking treatment for a child are wrong for following a doctors orders, there I can see what everyone else here is seeing. How would a mother or father know which doctor to trust? And why would they believe this group at the hospital when they've seen actual improvement before this that no one else got?There had to be a better way to handle this.There had to be a more HUMANE way to handle this.There should be a less corporate, systemic way to handle this.But unfortunately for some, the system overrules the carers and a few bad apples playing into that spoil it for the bunch.",False
3,9,We Believe you Maya,brashbuzz,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a CRPS II sufferer of over 13 years now I could tell within the first few minutes this is what Maya was suffering from. Unfortunately it is very often misdiagnosed and completely misunderstood by so called medical 'professionals'.My heart breaks for Maya & her family. As an adult this disease is excruciating and a very hard journey to navigate. Children should NEVER have to experience this condition. Her Mother was a protective warrior advocate! Things should never be this hard. This documentary is a sad but very real insight into a rare complex disease & condition and how sufferers & families are treated, dismissed & often worse, not just in the US, but around the world!May this much needed documentary shed light on this condition & others and may this family find some justice. This family will forever be in my families hearts & thoughts going forward. We believe you Maya.",False
4,10,Maya's Story is Our Story,lifeofkellyk,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough I should start off by saying that this post is bias as I am related to Maya.My review is solely based on the production team. It was beautifully done. The way you represented Beata was so touching. The editing was beautiful. Especially the last 15 minutes. I have to say thank you. Thank you for telling my family's story. Thank you for letting me hear Beata's voice again. We miss her dearly.Thank you for standing up and allowing their voice to be heard. Thank you for standing up for all of the families around the world that are going through similar situations.If you have not watched it yet, I suggest you grab a box of tissues. I cried for 50 minutes of the hour and a half documentary. (But then again, I walked this story with them).We want justice. For Beata and for all those who are falsely accused.",True
5,10,Heartbreaking case of systemic abuse of power,victoriarbrooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a social worker in the UK I can understand why there would be concern over a young child having large and Frequent doses of Ketamine but this decision did not stem from the mother, Ketamine was prescribed by a Doctor! Her mum was not obtaining or administering this drug illegally. Therefore, the hospitals argument over diagnosis and care should Have been between professionals. They should have come to an agreement on how best to treat Maya, including the parents in any decision making. The mum posed no threat to Maya in hospital, therefore, her Visitation rights should not have been stopped.",False
6,n/a,This whole doc is insane,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerJohn's Hopkins is a TERRIBLE place. It is a dangerous hospital. I also spent years trying to figure out why I was sick and one of the places I went was JH. The day I went I had a seizure and the doctor came over and smacked me and told me to stop faking.These people seek control and are complete narcissists.The distress that a false accusation can put someone under and being separated from your family is awful. Everyone involved deserves the worst karma and I want them all sued to oblivion.Real kids are abused every day. Real kids are put on drugs against their will and are abused and go unnoticed or it's encouraged by the state.,True
7,7,That's a sad documentary...,j0hn22,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, when I first watched the official trailer of the documentary I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined. The plot of the documentary was very interesting and mysterious. Also, it was well-explained and everything was accurate. I have to admit, it was a very emotional documentary (especially, the ending part). The opening scene of the documentary was fast-paced, intense and promising. The ending was definitely very emotionally intense and probably the saddest part of the documentary. Overall, ""Take Care of Maya"" was a nice documentary, very sad and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.",False
8,10,Prepare to be very angry,Shelpa,n/a,16/08/2025,"This popped up on Netflix when I was looking for something to watch, other than the brief synopsis I didn't know anything more. I live in Australia and had not heard about this case.Wow... to say I was furious by the end is an understatement. I understand that the safety of a child is always paramount but the hospital and doctors not taking responsibility for their part in what happened is disgusting. I don't know how they sleep at night.I feel terrible for the Kowalski family and any family that has had to deal with what is obviously a flawed system.As a race we have come so far, but as human beings we lack the compassion necessary to elevate ourselves to the next level. The society we have created is now out of control and it seems that money and power are our driver.",False

10,10,CRPS IS REAL,ladydrivendesignsandcrafts,n/a,16/08/2025,"I also suffer from CRPS/RSD. I have type 2. Started in 2015 and I am almost now full body. I relate to Maya and this family in so many ways. My thoughts are with this young lady. The disease is real, the pain is unbearable, there Is no cure yet. Hoping to see a cure in my lifetime. Stay strong Maya.For those reviews that I read that called this a fake disease, I pray you never get it. Better yet, live with this for a single day. One day. I bet you would not call it a fake disease after that. I have an implant to keep my pain at a tolerable level and my feet straight.""I REFUSE TO SINK"" keep that in mind fellow warriors!",False
11,6,One sided documentary,lizb-96573,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm extremely bothered by this one-sided documentary. Did Maya have CRPS? I'm not a physician but am bothered by how the parents initially treated it by going to a doctor who gave Maya high doses of Ketamine and then the parents going to Mexico. Why not go to elsewhere in the U. S. to seek treatment?MPS is definitely a real phenomenon and there have been instances of a parent actually killing their child for sympathy. Pinellas County CPS was correct in taking this seriously and keeping the mother away while they continued to treat Maya. Did they go to far? Perhaps. However, I do believe the medical team thought they were making the right decision at that time. Was the mother responsible? Is that why she really killed herself when the Maya continued to improve?Is it a coincidence that Maya recovered after my mother's death? Or was this really a case of MPS? I don't think we will ever know. Thankfully Maya appears to be doing well now.",True
12,10,Heart-wrenching,DarknessVisible20,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heavy and infuriating documentary, but very much worth watching.Beata fought a David vs. Goliath battle all on her own, against three deeply corrupt systems all working together: the 'healthcare' cartel, er, system, social 'services', and the judicial system. She persevered and stood stronger than the overwhelming majority of people would in such a situation. Had her husband supported and fought alongside her, instead of subduing and criticizing her valiant efforts, I do believe the outcome for this family would have been very different.Good on Maya for surviving through the ordeals these awful systems put her through, and for calling her three-month 'hospital stay' what it was - medical captivity. She is smart to steer completely clear of the medical cabal now, and I hope viewers learn the priceless lesson that our utterly broken, incompetent, corrupt, and self-serving 'healthcare' system cannot be trusted with your health and your life.The utter AUDACITY of Johns Hopkins to bill Maya's insurance for obscene amounts under false billing codes, on top of the terrorism they were inflicting upon this family is blood-boiling. How is no one in prison over this?!?! Oh that's right, because these systems protect their own, and each other.The cowardly statements issued by Johns Hopkins and that horrible judge at the end are disgraceful. Zero remorse or accountability for the devastation they inflicted upon this family. And as the documentary shows, this is hardly an isolated case. Who knows how many other families have been wrecked by the trio of social 'services', 'healthcare' systems, and the judicial system when they decide to destroy parents' lives based on little or no evidence. Or simply as punishment for daring to question the all-knowing (not) megalomaniac doctors.Infuriating. I hope the family wins huge at trial, but if there were true justice, everyone who played a part in this awful situation would be behind bars.",False
13,7,Mandated reporting sometimes gets it wrong,tgwmatu,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOverall, I thought this documentary was interesting and worth the watch. What happened to the Kowalski family was tragic. However, I'm a bit concerned how several reviews here are vilifying the hospital and its staff. All healthcare providers are mandated reporters of suspected child abuse. Not reporting suspected abuse is a crime. The hospital staff didn't set out to destroy a family. Clearly, they thought this could be a case of Munchausen's by Proxy and the ketamine coma treatment was beyond the pale. The family had to go to Mexico to get it. It's not approved here, and ketamine is a controlled substance. What does that tell you? Yet, the mother, Beata, wouldn't listen to concerns expressed by several doctors. She had given too much weight to Dr. Kilpatrick's warning of possible death due to blood clot from immobility and not enough weight to other doctors' warning of possible death due to high dose ketamine. Imagine Maya had died due to the ketamine coma treatment. JHACH had a legal obligation to call out what they believed was a dangerous practice. That Beata refused to listen to medical experts and then took her own life after being separated from her daughter for 3 months further calls her parenting into question. Could she not anticipate that her children would be deeply traumatized by her suicide? As Jack begged of her, all she needed to do was comply with DCF, but she wouldn't. Sadly, Beata was misguided, with tragic consequences.",True
14,1,Do your research and then see if you agree,aerober,n/a,16/08/2025,"I agree that this documentary was very interesting and I was very angry after watching. However the whole situation was so strange that I decided to do some more research. Let me tell you this documentary left out A LOT and is disturbingly one sided. I never would have known if I trusted this show blindly like so many are doing in their reviews. Do just a little research and see if you still agree. There is now no doubt in my mind this mother was abusing her daughter. It is so sad that ""views"" are more important than being unbiased. I will never blindly accept the information in a Netflix documentary now. So disappointing!",False
15,10,Unforgettable,jordandepascale,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't think I have ever had a documentary punch me in the gut as much as this one did. As a both a mother and someone who has experienced medical gaslighting which almost cost me my life, the story of what this family has been through will stay with me forever. I sobbed through most of it. I held my kids tighter once it was over. I constantly thought of Beata and the unconditional love she had for her daughter. It's all so overwhelming, but from a practical standpoint the editing and the way the story was told was absolutely beautiful. I will never forget this documentary, and I am so glad that this horrifying issue is being brought mainstream. Everyone needs to see this.",False
16,10,THIS NEEDS TO BLOW UP THE INTERNET,h_s_9292,n/a,16/08/2025,"The level of corruption, lawlessness, evil and cruelty cannot be matched. To know that the state has this much power over you is the most terrifying takeaway from that documentary.They're technically running like organized crime rings. People need to know that until we face this and confront it, thousands of lives will be destroyed and an industry of abuse will flourish.The heartless people who caused this misery need to face justice, the victims deserve their closures.It's heinous. It's scary. We should spread awareness and help the family to be heard, not silenced and dehumanized by a system that doesn't care.",False
17,n/a,God Bless this family,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,This review of mine is based on the Netflix documentary that I watched a few months ago and I have watched the trial since the beginning. I am also the stepmom of twins that lost their mother at the age of 10. It is undeniably a horrific experience to lose your Mom at such a young age. And in such a manner of suicide. I firmly believe that this family deserves compensation for their horrific experience. I was angry after watching the documentary and couldn't believe that a hospital would put a child and family through such an ordeal such as this. I hope and pray that this never happens again. K.,False
18,7,A confronting Netflix documentary,eddie_baggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not many would've had an unassuming Netflix documentary on their radar as one of 2023's most horrifying films but low and behold documentary filmmaker Henry Roosevelt's Netflix original is an eye-opening and traumatic account of one families journey through hell as their sickly daughters medical condition throws them into a shocking series of events that changed their lives forever.A workmanlike feature that is happy to do things by the book and explore the Kowalski families dealings with the American medical, parental and judicial system in a way that is easy to digest and far from over stylised, Take Care of Maya may not deliver knockout blows or technical feats to write home about but Roosevelt and his subjects are clearly passionate about what they exploring in this warts and all doco that seems as if its almost too horrifying to be real.Saying too much about what occurs to Jack Kowalski and his family when his oldest child and only daughter Maya succumbs to a debilitating disease, only to discover that their dealings with the medical system in the United States will lead them down a dark and seemingly impossible to exist path would be a disservice to this documentary that is best viewed with as little prior knowledge of the story as possible for maximum impact.It's not always easy viewing, Take Care of Maya tackles some dark and intense subject matters but it's always handled with a care and respect for all involved and the Kowalski family themselves make for relatable and likeable subject matters even in the fact of insurmountable odds and by allowing the various family members associated with this story a time to tell their own story, Roosevelt has given audiences a lot to ponder and consider as they move on from the film once the credits begin to roll.There is a sense that outside of the Kowalski family there is more story to tell that Roosevelt's film barely gets a chance to skim through and there are times where you wish more could've been showcased from others outside of the direct family but overall this is a strong Netflix documentary that shines a light on a subject matter that deserves to be investigated on a much higher level.Final Say -An almost unbelievable true story that is at times heartbreaking and horrifying, Take Care of Maya doesn't attempt to do anything unexpected but what it does is present facts and insights around a situation that is far from a one off, a shocking fact indeed and one that needs to be highlighted.3 1/2 social distancing signs out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",False
19,10,I am emotionally exhausted,vanessxisabelle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe the most gut-wrenching documentary I have ever watched, I feel like my heart is being ripped out of my chest. I was ugly-crying non stop halfway through until the very last second.Obviously the fact that this story was documented to the tiniest detail, including all the heartbreaking video and audio recordings and notes made it so muxh harder but portrayed how incredibly serious and real this is. No matter how old you are, where you live, what you do, I seriously think everyone should watch this because Maya and her family deserve to finally be heard and I really hope they'll get justice.",False
20,7,Very compelling power plays,kathrynturner-05790,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, the true victim is Maya and I hope she is feeling supported and thriving. It seemed that she was doing well in her teen years and after being off the high dosage of Ketamine. Perhaps it helped in the beginning of her illness, but eventually it caused her stomach pain and that was rectified by her coming off of it eventually.I feel the mother had no support, she was already struggling with her mental health obviously from being the primary caretaker of her daughter and doing all of the research and care and trying to find doctors to listen and help. Everyone always forgets to care for the caretaker. Caretakers are at risk for attempting suicide much more than the average person. The hospital staff didn't like the mother because she was outspoken and that's true, most doctors don't like when you advocate. The father wasn't as involved in Maya's care and couldn't even answer basic questions about doctors they saw or didn't see once his wife had passed. He certainly didn't provide emotional support for his wife. He caved the second the hospital tried to pin them against each other. It's not surprising that the mother took her own life. She felt it was the only way to get her daughter back home. She sacrificed herself for her daughter. I do feel the mother had mental health issues, I think the fact that she obsessively wrote everything down that had to do with her daughter's illness was inductive of high levels of anxiety, but I don't think she had Munchussin by proxy.The hospital does need to take ownership of what happened and the abuse they did to this family based on falsehoods. The father needs to take ownership of providing no support for his wife. When mothers are not supported in any capacity, children do not thrive.",True
21,9,Made me hug my kids,Yashiro_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this late Tuesday night while my 2 daughters, 12 and 4, were asleep and while hearing the moms voice frustrated trying to talk to her daughter on the phone alone at the hospital just made my heart ache. I just hugged and kissed both my girls imagining her pain. If the mom had been the ""calm"" one (for lack of a better word) then the dad would've been the one freaking out. But because she took the reins of trying to fight for her child, they made it look like she was the bad abusive parent. And how they tried to turn dad against her!!! Ugh I was disgusted. Just dr sally smiths face alone with her angry eyebrows during her interviewing just gave me the picture in my mind of what she was like in her position at work: total power trip POS. Did this story surprise me? Nope. I can totally see it. Doctors who think they know better than parents is such an old story. I went thru such a horrible traumatizing experience with my oldest daughter when she was born that dealt with idiot drs not listening to moms intuition. My baby had pneumonia and when I took her into the ER I swear the guy gaslit me as a ""young new mom who was paranoid."" I took my baby home and that night she stopped breathing, was dying, rushed her back and her oxygen was at 60%. I was literally JUST THERE THAT day and they sent me home! My baby almost died but thankfully recovered in the ICU miraculously (3 week old preemie with pneumonia) so yeah it was crazy. I just got depressed at the hospital watching my baby hoping for her to get better. I kept thinking of that day I took her in saying something wasn't right, she was lethargic, not eating, etc. And I was sent home. Obviously compared to this, my story is less traumatizing. I mean just imagining this story alone gave me anxiety so I have no idea how this family copes thru it all. And all of it because of some power trippy dr?! She thinks she's saving children left and right from abusive homes when SHE is the one causing pain and distress in a family...man, someone has to set that woman straight! I hope she gets what she deserves. Poor Mayas mom knew the only way her daughter could go home free was if she was gone. Wow just so sad. So so sad.",True
22,7,Turning point,den-shoko,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am ashamed to say that I was expecting a mother who put her daughter in danger at the beginning. But I was completely wrong.This film changed my view of medical system.I believe while a lot of people have fear of their children's lives to be at risk, the medical support should be something you can really on. And that might be just a mere hope when a child has a rare disease.I don't want to criticise anyone in the film but this might be something that you should be cautious about because there are some people who are suffering because of the social stigma and too much hope for the medical services.",True
23,8,"Bound to get under your skin, if not infuriate you",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Take Care of Maya"" (2023 release; 103 min.) opens, It's ""February 24, 2021"" as we are introduced to a guy named Jack. He muses ""There is nothing that could prepare me for what I went through."" We then go back in time: Jack remembers meeting Beata, and eventually they have 2 kids, a girl and a boy. The girl, Maya, suffers from a strange illness when she is 9... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from director Henry Roosevelt (""Tough Guys""). Here he examines the phenomenon currently referred to as medical child abuse (a/k/a Munchausen's by proxy). Jack and Beata bring Maya to the ER at Johns Hopkins All Children's, and next thing we know the hospital calls in Children Protective Services, and things only get worse from there.. I mean, you have to see it for yourself because otherwise you won't believe it. (The fact that Florida outsources its privatized child welfare service to a third party should be an INSTANT red flag, but hey that's Florida for ya.) The results are as predictable as they are preventable. Families shredded apart? No worries. Lives destroyed? Who cares. I honestly don't know how some of these people can sleep at night. This documentary is bound to get under your skin, if not outright infuriate you. Don't say I didn't warn you!""Take Care of Maya"" premiered recently at the Tribeca, to immediate critical acclaim. There is good reason why this documentary is rated 91% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. It started airing on Netflix a few days ago, which is where I saw it. If you are in the mood for a medical=themed documentary that is equally heartbreaking as it is infuriating, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
24,6,Heart wrenching documentary,debby-21052,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis Netflix documentary held my interest and I watched the whole thing in one sitting. The horrible things that this family had to endure, I don't know how the father was able to hold it all together especially after his wife committed suicide, I'm so upset with the wife that she did that , I felt it was selfish on her part, I understand why she did it but it could have been handled in so many other ways besides hurting her daughter and husband.in a terrible way. John Hopkins hospital had no compassion for how this was affecting the family.

25,2,Critical thinking skills needed,HappyMtnGoat,n/a,16/08/2025,"So much information is left out of this doc. It is framed to push one narrative, and is leaving out pages and pages of medical and police documentation to skew how the viewer feels. The fact that the parents had just filed for a separation was left out. The fact that once Maya was in hospital care without her mother's influence and was by all metrics getting BETTER, was skewed by the father's perception and opinion.Please listen to the podcast: ""Nobody Should Believe Me"" and learn about Factitious disorder imposed on another (FIDA). The third season specifically focuses on this case. The first two seasons will help you understand that suicide is always a strong possibility with parents who have this. Not that suicide means she was innocent.This doc is using your feelings to override your critical thinking skills.",False

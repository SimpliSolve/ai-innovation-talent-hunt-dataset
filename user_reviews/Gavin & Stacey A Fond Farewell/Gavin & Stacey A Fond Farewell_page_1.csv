1,6,Gavin & Stacey: A Fond Farewell,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"This sort of documentary when a show ends can become a bit too touchy feely and over indulgent, but I thought this one for the most part stayed on the right side of the line.It's nice to hear how the show came about, what it's meant to people (normal people, not the random celebs they crowbar in to give their take on things. Did they pay Rio Ferdinand by the word??) and the cast themselves.It's perhaps a bit over long (a bit like the finale itself) but we get a nice look into the world of the show, and there's some nice behind the scenes footage from all points of the shows life.Here's hoping Jones and Corden do stay true to their ""that's it, we're done"" message. With 19 million people watching on Christmas Day, you'd imagine the BBC will soon be on the phone testing that resolve.",False

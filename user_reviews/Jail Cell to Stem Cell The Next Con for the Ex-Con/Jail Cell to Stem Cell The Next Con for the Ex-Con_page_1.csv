1,9,Chiropractors running a scam?!? Say it aint so!,thekeithbahjat,n/a,15/08/2025,"Alright, this is an insightful report for the gullible among us. A disgraced chiropractor uses a similar boondoggle to push other untested, unproven ""treatments"" on individuals who don't know better. As a scientist who develops cell-based therapeutics for cancer, I've always been dumbfounded by what these clinics advertise. Glad they put this documentary together - hopefully somebody listens.Perhaps next they can do chiropractic treatments?",False
2,10,Best film in the industry to teach us who the cons are,genxeron,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely essential for anybody to watch was thinking about getting Stem Cells. Or if you know a family member or friend getting Stem Cells. You will learn who the cons are here and these ex convicts that are taking advantage of people and some of them even pushing aborted fetal cells.This could be extremely dangerous.It was shocking to see Dan Pompa, a convicted felon no less and not a doctor, Patrick Gentempo who is also not a doctor but just a chiropractor and many other people famous in the health world exposed for what they have been doing.Great to see Dr. Mercola exposing them to the world along with other top medical experts at Ivy League universities who tell it like it is.",False
3,1,"Scam, scam, scam!",gyselleamaral,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have joined the program 1 month ago for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, diabetes and lymphoma and I am having horrible joint pain and swelling, vomit, bloating, headaches and sore throat. I've tried to contact someone and explain what is happening to me and I said I no longer want to continue with this program. Nobody cares. I've paid up front and they don't want to give me the refund for 4 out of 5 months that I will not use this program. I'm feeling very disappointed and I should have followed my gut that I was being scammed since I've done that ridiculous urine test and when I was never able to have a consultation with the ""doctor"" Pompa. I only talked to coaches, that told me they are extensively trained for this program.This ""doctor"" uses the desperation of sick people based on being a christian playing on people's beliefs that he's honest and he is the only way out for your health issues. I want a refund of this scam price of almost $7,000 and a warning put out for others seeking help for themselves that this guy is a scam artist. And all the ones that work for him are part of this scam company.",False
4,10,Eye Opening and Alarming,lauraannellerbe,n/a,15/08/2025,"Doug Orchard's documentary is powerful, and shows the dangers of unscrupulous ""doctors"" . It tells the heartbreaking stories of people who trusted these treatments, hoping for a cure, but ended up with serious injuries instead.Exposing how these con men and clinics are taking advantage of patients by offering risky and unproven therapies. It also shows how weak rules and little oversight allow this to happen.What makes this documentary stand out is how it mixes real-life stories with facts from experts, lawyers, and investigators. It's both emotional and easy to understand.One of the most alarming parts of the film is how it reveals that some individuals, like Dr. Pompa, are still allowed to operate and continue harming people despite the risks and damage they cause. The lack of strong rules and accountability leaves vulnerable patients unprotected.It is a wake-up call about the risks of unproven medical treatments, and a call for stricter regulations and greater awareness to stop these harmful practices.",False

1,9,A big man with a big heart,ksgillihan,n/a,15/08/2025,"From his humble beginnings as an army brat, Shaq paved his way towards the NBA with grit and hard work. He became the legend that he idolized watching NBA stars while growing up. Being the most dominant center of all time Shaq has had tremendous success in his life but he never has let it go to his head. His loving family was always there to support him and teach him valuable life lessons that he carried with him all through his career and life.While he has made a great deal of money in his career, he has also spent lots of it supporting people all over the USA. This is my favorite side of Shaq. The human side. As big as he is, his heart is even bigger. He regularly helps out those in need and has his own foundation set up to help kids who do not have the same opportunities as others. He has paid for people's bills and purchased items for people he doesn't even know, just because he cares. He is a quality person. He is also hilarious in interviews and on Inside the NBA. If there were more people like Shaq, the world would be a better place.",False
2,7,We are a better society with Shaq in it.,kevin-12921,n/a,15/08/2025,"SHAQ 2023 starts out with a very traditional progression of s young man who is great at basketball. It was okay but I kinda knew a lot of that stuff.When it started to pick me up for me, was when he reacted to his career in decline. He realized his days on the hardwood were ending and he turned to sportscasting and he has included a marketing empire stock full of endorsements (including many products we all know today)
What really touched me was his recognition of his biological father. He told him he was not mad at him and he realized he had done many of the things Shaq himself had done. His failures are his own and he grow from that.If there could have been more on the death of Kobe Bryant but perhaps there wasn't much more to say.On the whole a good show.",False
3,10,Top documentary covering an underrated sports story,jfsfsj,n/a,15/08/2025,"Shaq's story represents a lot about what is right in the American dream. The documentary depicts what happens when you're raised in a solid household with adult figures. Shaw teaches us to listen, be humble, try your best and the. Achieve. A lot of young athletes should watch this! It's well made.Additionally it's just a cool story, his younger years aren't as covered in mass media as they should be. I also think people forget how good he was before the championships and how much he impacted pop culture.There will never be another athlete and entertainer line Shaq! Take an afternoon and watch.",False
4,10,Just a reminder,Sir_Pierre,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have had this man as my ONLY idol for 30 years, and growing up with him as a idol I have only found and loved more and more things about Shaq while getting older.I am now 40 years old and are proud to say that Shaquille O'Neal have been my only rolemodel, and I'm glad that this serie shows everyone that this man is absolutely the most successful man in EVERYTHING he has ever put his mind to!Not only as a business man or NBA player.And my years as an adult man he has been my rolemodel for his big heart.Thank you Shaq.I'm looking forward to follow your future success :)So yes, this show was good and just a very small part of his life to show people today what a great man he is.",False
5,6,"Production is overkill, doesn't flow well... but it's Shaq.",mightyrox,n/a,15/08/2025,"Shaq is one of the most accomplished and unique personalities of our generation. His story is inherently epic...So why all the bells and whistles from the production team??They're trying way too hard to make this a cooler, more Shaq-like viewing experience, but it feels like overkill and distracts from the great story of Shaq.Also, unfortunately, the editing doesn't flow too well... rushed transitions between stories, or no transitions at all, no time to digest.Most significantly, the whole angle of the show doesn't offer a lot for the viewer to connect to. A bunch of cute short stories, but it doesn't really elicit emotion.Maybe I'm in biased because The Last Dance was so perfect, but this just seems to fall short.Only gets a 6 bc it's... Shaq.",False
6,10,Good one,hadoopbrahmanaidu,n/a,15/08/2025,"Director Robert Alexander and producer Peter Berg offer the latest glimpse into the career of the basketball star, the rise of the second Lakers dynasty and more.Because nobody paused and said, ""Do we really need this?"" there must have been a two- or three-month period in which they were sitting down with a different documentary crew every other day to retell the same stories about the Showtime Lakers, the Buss family and the transition from the '80s Lakers dynasty into the '90s Lakers dynasty led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.A purely practical level - and I'm a practical guy - the four-part Shaq is completely unnecessary. The second and third episodes of Shaq recount the same Lakers saga covered in the middle episodes of Legacy, but with fewer voices and much less candor and depth. Most of the first episode is dedicated to the early chapters of Shaquille O'Neal's life and his tenure with the Orlando Magic, previously chronicled in the middle-tier ESPN 30 for 30 film This Magic Moment.Only the fourth episode, from his trade to the Heat to his current tenure as a television talking head and relentless commercial pitchman, is ""new"" and features some of the more emotional elements in the series. But it covers 18 years of terrain in 45 rushed minutes, and its ""Hey, Shaq became a businessman!"" revelations are near-identical, by design, to the similar chapter in They Call Me Magic. Anyway, it's not like Shaquille.",False

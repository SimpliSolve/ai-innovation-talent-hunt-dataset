1,9,Great documentary film about Thai politics post 2014 coup d'etat,hwunhwun,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is not an election campaign film. The storyline progresses from the beginning of the coup d'etat up to the latest election. The way the documentary tell the journey of these people is interesting, from the point of view of the leader of future forward party and the people who believed in him, and from the start when no one knew who he was to the dissolution of the party. You will get to see many never before seen clips that will give you a better understanding of the party as a part of post 2014 democracy movement, its leaders, and the political forces that try to keep it out. However, this documentary does leave out a lot of crucial details when it comes to political events, but that's what Wikipedia is for. Overall a great documentary film, and it will take you on an emotional rollercoaster. I also love how throughout the film there will be moments where you think it's close to ending, but it's not.",True
2,10,"Expected result, unexpected messages delivered",janehouserock,n/a,15/08/2025,"We all know what is the ending but this Thai's first political documentary gives up hope and allow us to review what had happened and what we can do for our own brighter future...our own 2 hands!We lived in those timelines and the cycle still continues until now.Good footages, montages, cinematography delivered by 2 talented directors. Like they said, it was a critical & decisive moment and as a people in this industry, it's our responsibility to portrait what is actually happen so that we will not regret of not doing so.My memory keeps flashing back and forth, and I do hope good luck to all people involved.",False
3,10,Hate the coup,nattakitkeng,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was one of those who once agreed with the 2014 coup. Although I did not officially support the event, the subsequent worsening conditions of the country made me realize just how evil a coup can be. This movie accurately portrays the stories of those who fought against the coup. I really like this movie and hope it teaches Thai people to work together to prevent another coup from happening again.In this movie, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit is portrayed as the hero. Although he currently does not play a significant role in politics, this movie shows that a single good leader can change the country. After watching this movie, those who already love them will love them even more. As for those who hate them, I hope they open their hearts, view them fairly, and stop undermining their good intentions.",False
4,10,Progress and Hope,FinleyKolapo,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary shows a group of progressive Thai politicians and activists who are challenging an oppressive institution, representing a movement that many once thought was impossible in Thailand. This is clearly demonstrated by the majority of Thai people in the recent election, where the progressive party in this documentary made significant gains, securing a substantial number of seats and disrupting the established order.At its core, it's a documentary, so I hope it reaches a wider audience than just the ""orange party"" supporters and their allies. The subject is important to everyone, and I hope that even those who disagree will watch it with an open mind, and see the importance of this forward-thinking movement.",False
5,10,Best Cinematography,yanachudan,n/a,15/08/2025,"The footages, sounds, montages and etc are 10 out of 10. It raised hope and reminded us the sorrowful of reality's cruel. It's true that we're sad with the unfair reality, but we don't get discouraged. Here we are. Here we stand. We are fighting in one of the most unfair wars in Thai history. If we believe in people, those brats will crush the people and we will lost both faith and hope. So we have to trust and believe in ideology. Don't give up, ya'll. Like the way this documentary tried to speak to us, don't lose faith and hope. Not yet. Until we can craft the beautiful future and send it to the next generation.",False
6,10,This is just 20% of the real incidents that can show to the world.,toinfintyandbeyond,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are many more very important events that were not included in the film ""Breaking the Cycle"" because if those events were included, the directors might not be safe. The real story of Thai politics 500 times more vicious and dramatic than in the documentary guaranteed by Thais who have been stuck in this vicious cycle their entire lives. And the cycles are still going on and on. Soonest Move forward party that transition from Future forward party which won recently election of Thailand will dissolve and the party leader who is the prime minister candidate may be banned from the politics in Thailand for life. So sad.",False
7,10,A documentary film that exposes the truth of politics and government in Thailand.,zalmonroom,n/a,15/08/2025,The movie tells about the struggle of the new Anatara Party. That was born from a group of people who wanted to see Thai society move forward. But in the end The old power group does not want to see a better society. Just because of fear of losing personal benefits causing the use of legal powers to overthrow the board. It is considered a documentary that is excellently conveyed. And saw how much the goals of people in Thai society have changed And there will never be a return to the way it was before. It is a documentary film that is worth watching. And pass it on to future generations to see the rottenness of Thai politics and government at this time. And reminded the importance of democracy to the Thai people.,False
8,10,Inspired documentary film.,atthapoom-15381,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this movie with my friends, and they had no idea about Thai politics at all. However, this movie managed to help them understand some of it, and then they came back to show me what they had researched about politics and political issues.It is not for promoting a political campaign but to show how we felt during those awkward times. It also provides hope. People hoped to move forward from the junta government, but they were blocked by the senators, which made people feel empty and hopeless. The lighting is perfect, and the ambiance looks like a dark theme, which gives me a chill feeling somehow. I guarantee you will not be disappointed if you watch ""Breaking the Cycle"" with your family.",True
9,10,It is a political documentary film that looks at the overall picture of Thai politics in the period 2014-2020 very well :),kantita-87588,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter I was watching this movie from the first day it was officially released. This movie is a political documentary film through the perspective of a political party called ""Future Forward"". It will show stories from the time of the coup in 2014 led by General Prayut Chan-o-cha and the NCPO came to occupy it that year Until the Thai political crisis worsened and led to the founding of the Future Forward Party led by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit and many other fellow ideologues in the next 4 years (2018) made the trend of this party progressively better. Becoming a favorite of people from the new generation to the old who want to change the country for the better. Until it led to the dissolution of political parties and starting again. Which many people who have never seen or seen already know the ending of this story. But there is one thing that want you to come see the story of the movie and the tone of the movie are quite smooth. Although there may be some points that would like more details to be told in some parts of the movie. Such as the story of the Constitutional Court at the end of the story, Because it is another last Boss character after 250 Senators which is quite important. However, The overall picture is quite good. It's worthy of being a good documentary film.",True

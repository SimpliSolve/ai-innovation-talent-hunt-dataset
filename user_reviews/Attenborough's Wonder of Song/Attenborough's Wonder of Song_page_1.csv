1,8,Melancholy Music,owen-watts,n/a,16/08/2025,"A sort of ""greatest hits"" programme with our very own Miyazaki nature spirit roaming through his archive and offering some fresh perspectives on different animal songs that he's either personally recorded or witnessed. There's a gentle, melancholic air to this with some lovely illustrations that lend it an even more soporific quality. It's one of those Attenborough-infused BBC specials that manages to generate a very specifically lovely vibe all of its own. Worth a spin.",False

1,10,Watching the changing lives of animals on a changing planet,cewtv,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis show is from the perspective of how animals around the globe, not in areas of comfortable climate, are adapting and changing to match/meet the challenges being presented to them.It's very informative, very well done, and sometimes eye-opening.The latest episode pointed out the southern Albatros is flying 15% faster than ever due to the winds they fly around the globe to find food are blowing 15% faster, which is changing the planet where the winds are felt.Also in the episode were the reindeer of the north helping to keep CC at bay due to eating young trees, as the expansion of trees is causing additional warmth, thus illustrating the conflict between expansion and the wild.",True

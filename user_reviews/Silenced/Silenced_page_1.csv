1,10,Mind blown,deanarber,n/a,15/08/2025,Well when you watch this and remember how the story was told by the media this exposes the corruption within in parts of the justice system. Please watch it's an eye opener. And now Tommy has been jailed for exposing the actual truth I mean seriously jailed for just telling the truth it's a concern for all of us. Forget what you think you know about Tommy Robinson he is now a political prisoner and it shows what happens when you go against the police and the government. I used to hate Tommy but I decided to do my own research and I was amazed at what I found. Remember a young British boy had his life ruined by how the media spread this story.,False
2,10,Shocking & Heartbreaking,RealReviewer64,n/a,15/08/2025,"You will watch this and gasp in shock. But every detail is presented so that you can verify, check and see for yourself easily. I did. Because to discover the complicit lies and cover up by the MSM, police and judges in the UK defies belief.It is also heart breaking for the lives of the poor children abused, damaged by a system in Britain. My criticism would only be that there is no offer of explanation as to why the British state is doing this.One thing is for sure. This is not just alarming but frightening. The conclusion that the system is creating a time bomb of resentment is hard to not agree with.",False
3,10,Forget What you think You Know,jazzyjez-16447,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOne man sets out to prove that a libel judgement against him was wrong. Meticulously documenting every twist and turn of events over several years, Tommy Robinson (aka Neil Yaxley-Lennon) exposes multiple layers of establishment corruption. Providing incontrovertible evidence, this gripping story is testament to Robinson's incredible energy and refusal to lie down and be beaten. Under any other circumstances, such a damning indictment of the authorities would be winning awards for investigative journalism but no mainstream media outlet has so far been willing to give this professionally produced and presented documentary an airing. Whether you love him, loathe him or have never heard of Tommy Robinson, this is a must watch for anyone who believes in the freedom to tell the truth.",True
4,10,Shocking!,michaeltennant-51283,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAnyone who watches this with a open mind should be truly shocked. A schoolyard spat was made international news , it ruined a young boy and his family's life. Tommy Robinson goes undercover to see what really happend (unfortunately he had to go undercover because people where scared to tell the truth because of fear of reprisals) . What has happened to Tommy because he tells the truth is Britains shame. Don't belive what the MSM say about him...do your own reshearch, you may be supprised at what you find! The Father of the Syrian kid said he would rather have stayed in Syria than have what happened to his son happen in the UK , yeah right!",True
5,10,Expected,davidgomezvillegas-09757,n/a,15/08/2025,"I learned about this documentary from a Jordan Peterson episode, so I watched it. I would like to say that it was an eye-opener, but sadly, it wasn't. That's because I expected this level of fact manipulation when it comes to defending the current hegemonic narrative of the 'bad white person.' I am not white, nor even European, but I can see this modern anti-whiteness, which I don't like at all-obviously, because it is racist. I wouldn't like it against any race.The problem is that in attacking one race-specifically the European race-as if it were the root of all evil, many beautiful things are being attacked as well. When cultural products are strongly identified with a particular race, and that race is then deemed bad, its cultural contributions also become targets. In the end, this leads to the erosion of much of our own shared culture.",False

1,7,"Quite enjoyable, even if you're not into politics",rearden1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think this documentary is getting a bad review simply because people don't like BDW. I'm not a fan of him either, but it is still interesting to see a politician who's at the top dealing with the stresses and hassles of elections. Jambers does a good job at capturing the ""hidden"" moments that were not accessible to other journalists. He captures the politician personal flaws but also his perseverances. And a little bit of his personal life and how fame can absurdly disturb it.It's filmed over 10 years and tells a captivating story of a rising politician who is obsessed with politics. I think it is an interesting document, and you'll likely love it if you're a fan of politics. I'm not, and still found it a very enjoyable watch.",False
2,1,Why?,tomdedecker-19509,n/a,15/08/2025,"I do understand that people want to take a look behind the scenes of an election, especially when you witnessed everything at home and you can get the other angle of what the hell politicians do during election day. That said, maybe Paul Jambers should have made a television episode, around 40-50 minutes tops because there's not much to see. BDW who's always complaining and pretty boring scenes of the man who goes to the supermarket and so on.And if they wanted to make a 'film', for God sakes get a real professional cameraman. The camera is awful! You could make a better film with an iPhone 15. But there is more; editing, direction,... man o man... Again, maybe good for a television episode late in the evening. This lacks tempo, storytelling,... and don't get me started about colouring, DOP,... this is not worthy of the title 'movie'.",False
3,1,Not very successful as he think,ahmedadelzakaria-49934,n/a,15/08/2025,"BDW - Politiek Beest paints an ambitious portrait of Bart De Wever, often hailed as a dominant figure in Belgian politics. While the title might suggest a political mastermind, the reality portrayed in this documentary is far less flattering.The film tries hard to celebrate De Wever's supposed political prowess, but it can't mask the glaring fact: every time he has been tasked with forming a government, he has failed miserably. This recurring failure highlights not just a lack of strategic foresight but also an inability to build consensus-a key trait for any successful leader.One of the most frustrating aspects revealed in this documentary is De Wever's arrogance. He consistently comes across as someone unwilling to listen to alternative viewpoints, dismissing advice and alienating potential allies. This arrogance doesn't just hinder his success but also undermines his credibility as a leader capable of uniting people.Ultimately, ""BDW - Politiek Beest"" feels more like a misguided attempt at self-aggrandizement than an honest exploration of De Wever's political career. For a film about a ""beast"" in politics, it reveals a career defined more by bluster than results. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.",False

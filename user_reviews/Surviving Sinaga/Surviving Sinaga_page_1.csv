1,1,No budget? No talent?,pqvist,n/a,16/08/2025,Surviving Sinaga is a super shallow documentary. It could easily have been executed within 10 minutes of total running time.The research seems close to non-existing.The photo is monotonous with same/similar camera patterns and repeating clips throughout the film.The editing is at junior high school standard.The audio mixing is very bad with music mixed at way to high level.A super interesting subject. Extremely lousy execution.I suspect that the 10/9/8 ratings come from the crew?,False
2,9,Frightening and compelling,archieeverist,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this documentary recently and found the story dark and frightening, with new gripping details the whole way through. The interviews are shot very nicely and there's a lot of information in the film I hadn't seen before. In a lot of ways this is a typical true crime documentary like you'd see on Netflix but the inclusion of the implications of sexual abuse for often underrepresented male survivors is an interesting and important addition.It's a great documentary, well edited and put together and a compelling story backed up by expert interviews and analysis. Dark and sometimes uncomfortable but definitely worth a watch!",False

1,9,"Excellent Overall, Except for Kani...",heintnyr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thoroughly enjoyed this documentary. Well-researched, incredibly fascinating, and provides much food for thought. In addition, the vibrant comic art illustrations and atmospheric sound design both complement the story beautifully!However, I did not appreciate Kani's attempt to turn the conclusion into a racial issue, and I didn't care much for his narration either. I found his diction unclear at times and his mispronunciation of words, names and places, e.g., Beaufort West, to be rather frustrating.Overall, a well-produced and highly engaging documentary. Congratulations to all involved. 9/10!",False
2,9,Exceptional tale of UFO's in South Africa!!,juliancleophas,n/a,16/08/2025,What a great story of UFO'S in Africa and really makes you reconsider extraterrestrial life in the galaxy. A great combination mix that despite UFO subject matter being serious the documentary still manages to include a solid blend of mystery and comedy. This is definitely a story that needs to be told. Well done to the crew and filmmaker Uga Carlini.The honesty of how the film is portrayed it give the viewer enough research and information to make you rethink what you thought was just a myth could actually be the reality that we as humans would not want to believe.The film in all honesty will leave you marvelling at the unknown.,False
3,10,Exceptionally well done,tvboxng,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, keep an open mind when you watch this. Whether you are a believer in extraterrestrial beings or not, there's something to learn from this exceptionally well-done documentary about a woman who definitely had a story to tell.There were times when I was almost totally convinced, and there were times when I had doubts about certain viewpoints. That, indeed, was the rollercoaster experience while watching this beautiful piece. The animation by Inka Kendzia was just astounding and kept things interesting throughout this just over 1-hour piece of work.The narration by Dr. John Kani is simply amazing. It's a good watch!",False
4,10,Insightful and thought provoking,pvdsvs,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, I have a love for the Drakensberg area in KwaZulu Natal, and remember with great fondness my trips there as a child. Watching this movie, and seeing what this place meant to Elizabeth Klarer, was utterly beautiful.Personally, I do believe in life on other planets. We cannot be alone in the Universe. I also love that the writer/director does not tell me what to think and who to believe. The facts are given, whether they are true (I mean really happened), or not. I am then, as the viewer, allowed to draw my own conclusions.I liked how animation was used and particularly liked the archived footage, and how it was all presented in this film.",False
5,9,Well-produced and well-paced,Nix_xx,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFrom the outset, I get bored quickly... but this well-crafted, produced and filmed package kept my attention throughout.Why I watched this: I'm just starting to delve into Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena after having freaky and repeated stuff happen which cannot be explained by reference to anything secular and this-worldly - and this has also provoked me to speak with relatives and friends about stuff they've seen that's weird. And now the stories come - stories that people never told because they thought (no doubt rightly) that others would write their accounts off as fabrications or hallucinations, and write them off as loop fruits.Having watched this: none of us can attest as to the veracity of this but the message and warnings this woman conveyed are all too convincing. The film as a whole is very well put together - balancing honest critique with honest enthusiasm. I also really appreciated the part at the end where there is also an acknowledgement of the fact that Mrs Klarer was human! Her writing while allegedly having otherworldly input, also definitely had very human input - and as such her account is strongly influenced by her own very problematic views about race and hierarchy. Where those ideas emerge they should not go unchallenged - as a human species we should strive to be better and challenge any views that spread hate and division - all in favour of a world where we flourish and enjoy the fruits of this brilliant planet gifted in part to us.",True
6,10,"A rollercoaster ride above and beyond, the light barrier",sophiathewiseRSA,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gosh. Now this was a rollercoaster ride I'll never forget. The allegedly true story about a legendary meteorologist who spent her days on earth to convince the world that her alien lover from an advanced human race existed, and held the only solutions to all our problems on earth. Science? Fiction? Or the greatest science-fiction love story of all time? Well, I'm still deciding. What an thrilling tale, woven together with thorough research, creativity and enough respect for the audience, to know we are well capable to make up our own minds. The choice of John Kani as the narrator, was a cherry on top a treasure trove of strong direction and perfectly fitted retro animation and archival. Thank you! Loved it.",False

1,6,"Disjointed, low cost",barksbiz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Compare this to Blue Planet and you'll be disappointed; this is disjointed, with sparse and inconsistent provision of information. For instance the footage of birds feeding in tidal waters some are named, others not. Then Rebecca Ferguson takes us to Skagen , but calls it the tip of Denmark without saying which side of the country. Then we head north to the ""coast"" of Norway but actually go up the fjords. Not the coast.The coverage earlier of seal pups is equally disjointed, perhaps because it uses library footage over which it is difficult to maintain any continuity.Not worth watching if Planet Earth III is available. Lower quality. Perhaps saving money.",False

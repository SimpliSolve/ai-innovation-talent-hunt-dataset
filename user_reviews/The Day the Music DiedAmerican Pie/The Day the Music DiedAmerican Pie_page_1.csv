1,8,A Slice of Music History,nishalchiba,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having recently had ""Vincent"" playing on repeat in my brain (first while building a 1000 piece Clementoni puzzle, and then with the 'Starry Starry Night' LEGO set), it'll be an easy transition to ""American Pie.""It's a beautiful story, heightened by the voices and words of those intimately involved in its creation, especially that of Don McLean.Not only will this rekindle, and fan the flames of the much more extensive body of work that McLean undoubtedly has, but also the music of Buddy Holly and Richie Valens, who stirred that deep seated sense of loss, and in doing so, inspired the penning of this timeless classic, a modern day masterpiece.While the hook may have been to explain some of the nuanced lyrics, or confirm / refute fan theories, the heart of the movie is in the story behind the music, from glimpses of Buddy Holly's early career, the point where his untimely death intersects with then paperboy, Don McLean, all the way to the positive impact it's had, and continues to have, on subsequent generations.",False
2,6,We came for the Song and Don,jeffery2010,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very scatter shot Doc that was also repetitive. I don't want to sit through it twice to verify, but I'm pretty sure they cut to the same quotes from Garth Brooks 4 times in some cases. A lot of time watching... some female artist... recording her version because... maybe she's famous in Europe? Even, if instead of her, it was Paul McCartney, we didn't tune in to see Paul in the studio. We want to hear Don talk about the song. We all know about the Genesis of the first verse, but if you didn't already know the song, you'd be pretty sure it must be 90% about Buddy Holly.{Side note: They obviously talk a lot about Buddy Holly and some about Ritchie Valens - and play a little of two of his songs - but - though the mention ""The Big Bopper"" they don't even tell you/mention the name of any of his songs - odd}Near the end they remembered they should ask Don what some of the imagery was about and he rushed through it like he knew they had to catch a plane.A wasted opportunity.",False
3,7,A Bit Too Much . . . .,sundayatdusk-97859,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has some really nice parts, but, all in all, it was a bit too long and a bit too much. It was easy to go from thinking what a great song ""American Pie"" was to thinking it wasn't THAT great. This film makes it seem like it was the greatest song ever written about America, if not the greatest song ever written. I have half a dozen Don McLean songs on my iPod. ""American Pie"" is not one of them.The best parts of the documentary are the ones focusing on the deaths of Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and ""The Big Bopper"" J. P. Richardson, and the parts about Don McLean's childhood and song writing methods. He would write lyrics out by hand, and then type them up on a little typewriter on a little school desk with rockers attached. (Don't expect anything in this film about the singer's personal life as an adult, including abuse charges by his daughter and ex-wife.)There's lots of good looks back at the '50s-'70s, too, and the singer even discusses the meaning of some of the lyrics to the song. No, the references to the ""joker"" and the ""girl who sang the blues"" weren't about anyone famous. It's really too bad the film makers didn't realize all the praise for the song went too far and lasted too long. Nevertheless, it's a worthwhile documentary to watch, especially if you lived through those three decades.",False
4,6,Capturing the zeitgeist of the early 70s,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Day The Music Died: The Story of Don McClean's American Pie"" (2022 release; 94 min) opens, we are in ""New Rochelle, NY"", where Don McLean grew up with a very strict father. Don retells of the huge influence on his impressionable mind stars like Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly had. We then get to the events of February 3, 1959, when a plane crash in Iowa kills Holly, Richie Valens, and the Big Popper...Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from director Mark Moormann (""The Record Man""). Here he reassesses the legacy of Don McLean's signature song ""American Pie"". The documentary looks in detail to McLean's early career (including footage from one of McLean's earliest headlining shows in 1968 but also his appearance at the infamous 1969 Newport Music Festival. We also get in-depth coverage of how McLean put the song together, and then how it was recorded. Along the way, we get many talking heads paying homage to the song, none more so that Garth Brooks. For sure the song is epic and memorable and it does capture the zeitgeist of the early 70s perfectly. Please note: the documentary spends zero time on either the other songs that appeared on the ""American Pie"" album, or on any other McLean output. The film literally is 1 1/2 hrs. About 1 song, nothing more, nothing less.""The Day The Music Died: The Story of Don McLean's American Pie"" just recently premiered on Paramount+ and I caught it last night. If you are a die-hard fan of the song, and really want know all there is to know about it, then this documentary is for you. If instead you, like me, are a casual fan of the song, this may be a bit too much. Either way, I'd encourage you to check it out and draw your own conclusion.",False
5,10,A fascinating program about the most iconic song of the 20th century,npvarley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, first up, I admit that I LOVE Don McLean's American Pie. It's a remarkable, epic work of art that is as relevant now as it was 50 years ago. And I doubt whether there is a more widely known song, spanning generations, across the world.This program gives us some great insight into Don's life and times and a cultural history of the period. It looks at what it's meant to so many people in so many places.Some well-known guests talk about the impact of the song over the years, too.All in all, it's a great tribute to a brilliant singer/songwriter and the magic he created with American Pie.",False
6,10,You had to be there,sorchard-53284,n/a,16/08/2025,You can always tell the peeps that didn't live through those times. It was more than just about the music. It was more about the emotions of that time and how the lyrics were woven into the times.,False
7,9,A fascinating and moving documentary,maryblake-40463,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like pjtexas I'm puzzled by the negative comments, I found the film fascinating. The film was about more than 'Don and the song', and continuing interpretations of the lyrics - that's been done to death. It was about the enduring impact of American Pie on listeners. I hadn't heard of Jade Bird either (though I'm also English), but the point was that she wanted to record a song written by another 25 year-old singer-songwriter 50 years ago. Neither song nor film may be technically perfect, but it's how they make you feel. I'm not just English, I'm an emotionally reserved Brit - but I was moved by both. Good job chaps!",False
8,10,"I loved it, simple as that",pktexas,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was great, an incredible walk back in history about those times and the state of the world then. Learning more about the origins of the song parts was fascinating. Not sure why such negativity from people here.",False
9,3,"Terrific song, meh documentary.",dangrmk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Editing: Rehashing the same chunks of interview video and audio became annoying rather quickly.Time: Lasted about half an hour more than necessary.Content: Spent an inordinate amount of time reviewing the history of the plane crash, and having other musicians praising & covering McLean's work..Listened to the song hundreds of times during my youth, and it is still an amazing tune, but this documentary just felt contrived and shallow.",False
10,10,Incredibly Moving Doc About An All-Time Classic Tune,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAmerican Pie is one of those songs that everyone ""just seems to know"". Despite it being 50+ years old at this point, its staying power is a tribute to its brilliance. The Day the Music Died tells that story.There are basically two interwoven themes in this doc from director Mark Moormann:First, the tragedy of the real ""day the music died"" in 1959--the plane crash that took the lives of Ritchie Valens, Buddy Holly, and the Big Bopper.Secondly, how that tragic event touched the life of aspiring folk singer/song-writer Don McLean and ultimately produced American Pie.Both of these angles are dispersed perfectly within each other. Not only did I learn a lot about that fateful day in Clear Lake, Iowa, but the notoriously cagey McLean finally reveals some definitive stories, thoughts, and explanations about the song's genesis and lyrics.Along the way, other artists--big ones like Garth Brooks & Brian Wilson, to name just a couple--weigh in on the effect American Pie had on them as musicians.The ending of The Day the Music Died brings everything full circle, with McLean back in the same ballroom that the ""three men I admired most"" performed their final concert. I did not expect to be so emotionally moved, but I certainly was by the time the credits rolled.As such, I can easily give this music doc the highest marks for both informing me about the iconic song's history and doing so in an extremely emotionally engaging manner.",True
11,8,The story behind the writing of American Pie,mlbsa,n/a,16/08/2025,"A well done documentary on an iconic song that not only gives you the backstory on Don McLean's writing of the song but is also acts as a biography of McClean and how could you possibly have one without the other, the song and the writer are so intertwined they are impossible to separate. There are a lot of interesting interviews with different musical artists explaining the impact the song has had on them.At one point McLean explains the lyrics which I wish he had not done, one of the great things about the song is that everyone has their own interpretation of the lyrics. It was a mystery for 50 years, why ruin it now? The documentary goes on probably 15 to 20 minutes too long with interviews of musicians that very few people have never heard of and never will outside of this video. If not for the length I would have rated it higher.",False
12,9,As a musician the song changed my life but...,gregg-524-163135,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you're reading this I have a sneaky feeling you already love American Pie. So I won't review the doc (it was really great. McLean she'd the light on a lot of things). What got me is Buddy Holly was a HUGE influence on Don McLean. They show archival footage but guess what they don't do? No Buddy Holly music is in the film...which leads me to think Holly's estate didn't give the filmmakers the rights to the music. They play ""La Bamba"" in the background...heck they even mention ""That'll be the Day"" but don't play it. For me that sucked.",True
13,10,America's Song,sheridaglover,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think everyone has an ""American Pie"" memory. Mine is singing it with our high school choir every day before the teacher came in, as our own little warmup.I love Don McLean's music and when my daughter had the golden opportunity to work one of his concerts, I found out that he and his band are as wonderful as we could have hoped. (The saying is ""never meet your heroes, and Don McLean made hash of that old saw.)
I was excited to see the documentary and afraid that it wouldn't live up to what I wanted to see and learn about the song and the man. I am pleased to say that this movie lived up to my, admittedly, very high expectations.I don't particularly care what every verse means. I'm of the age that we discussed it to death in music classes. But I wanted to know how it came about and how Don McLean became the voice of so many people.The stories from everyday folks who became parts of this amazing tale are well told. The editing keeps this movie flowing and McLean's own anecdotes are specific and relevant. So many documentaries get so precious about their subjects and let them ramble about irrelevant stuff that the docs are just bogged down.If you've ever had a joyful experience singing ""American Pie"" this is a movie you'll enjoy. I hope that there will be another one to discuss Don McLean's other works. (Hint, hint)",False
14,3,Too long. Same old. Same old.,itaylor-50665,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is there anyone who doesn't know much of this story?OK, interesting enough to rehash it again but this attempt was just too long. The same things, especially the the song's refrain are repeated ad-nauseum. It sure felt like a documentary that was really a last attempt by Maclean cash in on this one trick pony.It felt like an attempt go milk the story dry.",False
15,4,Peter Gallagher's Eyebrows?,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lots of commentary from people that don't need to be talking- why?Feels like a grab to draw people who wouldn't otherwise give it a second thought; Garth Brooks? Come on, completely unnecessary. Some girl who no one's heard of, Grand Rapids making a video, boomers opining on their desire to take over the world with 'Peace and Love!!', Peter Gallagher's reading something, Weird Al, point is, a lot of people yammering on about something they had nothing to do with trying to make this longer than it needs be.Just some insight from McLean, HIS ORIGINAL VERSION, HIS explanations, his story, what he meant to do and what it means today. That's it. That's all you needed. Instead it's hours long and listening to people with no business singing it, singing it.Just a complete waste of what could have been.",False
16,1,"This is a parody, right?",myfam-86505,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAbout 15-20 minutes of this tribute to a 1970s novelty song are spent providing background on the tragedy that produced it and explaining the highly personalized lyrics that resulted.The rest mostly unleashes a barrage of other-worldly praise that at first caused me to react, ""Me thinkith they doth praise too much"" -- that the lavish, worshipful outpouring was both intended to convince the producers of the film that it had been worth financing and to convince the makers of the film themselves that they actually were telling a story about something special.I mean, this was a curious, modest hit that faded into 70s Gold history with the rest of the songs on the Billboard pop chart. I doubt many have seen or heard anyone declare it anything close to a classic before this documentary.But then, as I watched the smile on the face of Garth Brooks as he proclaims this ditty is ""quite possibly the greatest song in music history,"" I concluded this must be a parody, something along the lines of ""Spinal Tap"" or the Ruttles.That theory at least helped explain the laughable premise that the song is something great because thousands of people know the lyrics and sing along at concerts, even 50 years later.As anyone who has attended rock concerts knows, singing along to tunes is just part of the whole scene. I've been to concerts by the late Tom Petty and the Beach Boys where just about the entire audience knew and sang along to EVERY SONG over the course of two to three hours.Much less funny, though, is the film's attempt to tie the tragic death of three pop stars to actual world-shaking events - the Vietnam war and the assassinations of President Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy - to support statements about the song's importance to the United States of America.Really, even the song's title is a gross exaggeration. Music most certainly did not die after Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Richie Valens perished in the 1959 plane crash. Rock 'n roll continued to flourish unabated in the early 1960s. It took the Kennedy assassination to crash the lingering ""age of innocence"" from the 1950s, and then came Beatlemania and a new explosion of rock ' roll into the dominant worldwide music force it is today.I have no doubt that for Don McClean the music may have died. He took the deaths pretty hard and was still writing about it 10 years later.And it's also true many important contributions to the music world by at least Holly would have been forthcoming had the crash not occurred. One only has to look at the hugely successful career of Waylon Jennings, a bandmate who narrowly missed being a passenger on the plane, to see what a bright future was possible for Holly and the others.But any theory that the song based on the tragedy was anything more one person's sad reaction is a crazy overstatement.And it's so crazy that this documentary really has to be at least partly a parody of documentaries that take their subject matter too seriously.",True
17,3,Could have been so much better,seltaeb-330-797168,n/a,16/08/2025,"This could have been a great little doco. But there's way too much focus on modern artists covering the song and blathering on about how great it is and far too little about Don himself and the underlying meaning of the lyrics. We get literally about three minutes of Don discussing the lyrics in which the entire verse about Altmont is ignored. There also way too much emphasis on the Buddy Holly plane crash, we get this aspect covered by about a dozen different people. I mean, do we really care about the farmer that now owns the field where the plane went down? Or Richie Valens sister talking about it? Enough already about an event that featured in only the first verse of the song. They focus on it for nearly twenty minutes at the start and then come back to it at the end for ANOTHER 15 minutes.I would have liked to see a lot more about the imagery of the song and the production of the song and the accompanying album. I couldn't care less what Garth Brooks thinks about it. Ultimately disappointing.",False
18,2,A Stretch at Best,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a 15 minute story that was stretched to a boring hour and a half.Don't get me wrong, I love the song. I bought the album when it came out and played it incessantly. I still have it too. But years later I bought the CD to play.There are quite a number of great songs on American Pie that get overlooked. McClean never really rose to the occasion after this album and part of it is that he is apparently very difficult to work with and only want things his way.During covid he did a zoom meeting where he talked about the song and even sang it. His voice is shot.Anyway, this movie is really a stretched-out story that is long in the tooth. It's over produced, and it drags on and on.",False
19,1,Was this needed?,Marynewcomb2013,n/a,16/08/2025,The song is a good tribute to the victims of that tragic night but is this song really deserving of a documentary? There are so many songs that are better & speak about things that were going on then & still stand up today!! Steppenwolf's monster is a million times better song which stands up to what's going on to this very day!! Fortunate Son is another song that comes to mind that is a million miles ahead of this one!! Imagine has touched more people than American Pie!! So the question is why was this ever considered? Young & old know the meaning of this song without wasting all that time watching this!!,False
20,1,If you start with a terrible song as subject matter...,jonathancanucklevine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Do you really think it's going to make a good documentary?For half a century ""American Pie"" has been one of the worst examples of 70s classic-rock AM top-40 moon-spoon-June stream-of-consciousness songwriting, second only to ""Stairway to Heaven"" for the speed at which one has to turn it off when an automated radio station's programming algorithm that doesn't know any better cues it up.McLean once answered the question ""What does it mean?"" by saying ""It means I'll never have to work another day in my life.""He should have left it at that.",False

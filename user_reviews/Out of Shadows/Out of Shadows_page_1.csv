1,8,Diddy's arrest - buttresses the case,adair-52897,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched the movie again after the 9-16-24 arrest of Diddy and a flood of revelations with names (Jay Z, Quincy Jones, Usher, et al.) and when I was skeptical the first time I saw it, I am now more persuaded that there's an incredibly rotten underbelly to the entertainment business and with the Epstein case it seems certain there is a LOT of pedophilia, compromising, blackmail and control. Perhaps explains why certain politicians, judges, bureaucrats, et al. Take positions and actions that seem wildly out of character.Confirms what I believe a large segment of the public now is convinced of - that mainstream media runs cover for a river of illicit behavior.",False
2,7,Provides some compelling information to think seriously about,raceclark-46571,n/a,16/08/2025,"The bad: The presentation of information is somewhat disjointed, and the dots are not always clearly connected.
The good: The illumination of certain points like John Podesta's emails related to Pizzagate are UNDENIABLY insidious. The imagery surrounding many elite in Hollywood implies some some patently evil practices.
Bottom line: Something very sick is going on in Hollywood and needs to be exposed. No smoking gun is presented, but brave people are telling us to take a closer look and put pressure Hollywood.",False
3,6,Interesting Ideas but a Bit Far Reaching,plasticanimalz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I only watched this 'cause a friend of mine who is into conspiracy theories recommended it, and it's week 5 of quarantine, I'm bored, and I figured I'd try and be open minded. While the content is interesting and some of it I know is true, the way it's all strung together to have some deeper meaning is a stretch. It seemed more like the main guy had time on his hands after his injury to think and had a lot of ideas. Ran into another friend who also had ideas. Then, said, ""Let's do a movie about it!"" We all have ideas and theories, it doesn't mean they're true or they are cohesive. Like, he never really says what it all means, just that the CIA is involved and they're feeding propaganda through media. Sure, sometimes that is true in news or media, but the whole Big Brother / Satanic / MK Ultra thing was a bit much.And what does a stuntman know about the process of what goes on behind the camera? He's the on-set guy. He doesn't deal with any of the business side, pre-production or post production, and he's typically in and out. Stunt men don't remotely deal with the people who would be involved with the CIA, if that were true. I have a stunt friend he probably knows, as she worked on one of the films he did, and I worked in the areas of film and TV where I would have been getting some government direction if that was actually a thing. The only outside direction I ever got was from networks who restricted violence after 9/11, which made things challenging on superhero shows for them to fight monsters they weren't allowed to punch. But, that was it.And after living in LA for 22 years, and DC for 6 years, if there was a branch of the CIA or government that gives film & TV direction or tells them what to do, there would be a big department in DC. They do everything big. There would be no need for it to be secret as the government loves to be involved in everything and put their stamp on it. They LOVE regulations. There are LOTS of things that get involved with film and TV. That's nothing new. There's movies and TV based on toys, theme parks, products, etc. Just about anyone can get involved in the film business so long as they have the money. When TV first came out they were produced by products and were beholden to that company. Same for radio. Hollywood's one and only objective is to make lots of money so the producer's can buy their own island. It doesn't go much deeper than that. Occasionally they get on their high horse about politics in film and TV because they like to believe they're smarter than everyone else, but, that's about it. Disney putting stuff in cartoons to raise morale during the war is nothing new. They did it in Superman comics too. It's not propaganda, it's what is relevant to the time period.I don't in any way believe in Pizzagate. I hung out at the coffee shop next to Comet pizza for years, ate at Comet every 3 weeks, and know the employees in most of those shops, and know for a fact nothing was going on there. The whole idea was ridiculous. But I'm willing to accept that maybe there was something to Podesta based on those e-mails and the media made the whole thing sound so ridiculous that everyone dismissed it. That's possible. For one thing Besta Pizza that had that triangle symbol on the sign, was not next to Comet pizza, it was 3 shops down and had zero relation to Comet pizza. Different owners and they had nothing to do with each other. Also, Besta Pizza was the size of a closet and there is no room for a trafficking ring. And there's no secret tunnel underneath. That was completely made up by conspiracy theorists, and they took pictures of children of Comet employees and tried to make it look like they were victims. So, the theorists used and manipulated children to create something untrue. It just seemed like homophobia, targeting a gay store owner, as some think all gay people are perverts, which is ridiculous. Pedophilia has zero to do with sexual orientation. Statistically there are probably more straight pedos, so, what does that say?Also, the Katy Perry thing was ridiculous. Plenty of artists start in Christian music or gospel and turn to secular music 'cause there's no money in Christian or gospel music. And there are plenty of other big artists like Taylor Swift who have zero weird things that could even remotely be tied to satanism. Beyonce, Rhianna, Drake, Selena Gomez, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Josh Groban. Where's the satanism in their music videos? Lady Gaga did crazy stunts 'cause she was insecure about her nose and wanted to distract from her insecurities by everyone focusing on her crazy outfits and music videos. Sia has hair covering her face and a mini me version of herself to avoid people talking about her age. None of them have anything to do with satanism.Again, it was interesting. And things like Operation Paperclip were true, but, again, it had to do with rocket scientists, so, I'm not sure if it's true they brought over medical scientists too. That seems a bit too coincidental they were able to round up all their scientists. But even so, the only reason they brought them to U.S. is because they knew if they didn't the Russians would take them and use them to get ahead in the Space Race, and could build weapons. That makes sense and nothing conspiratorial about that. There's a great podcast called Moonrise that talks about the German rocket scientists coming to the U.SI would say watch this with an open mind but don't get sucked in. People like to grasp on to conspiracy theories because it makes them feel better where they're at in life, thinking there's some greater force keeping them down.Oh, and the editing is horrible. Scenes are cut together too quickly and it gave me a headache and motion sickness. I had to shut off the last 7 minutes 'cause I thought I would be ill. So, not the most professional but still an interesting watch.",False
4,10,The TRUTH IS stranger than fiction!!,peggysue422,n/a,16/08/2025,"First let me say to all the people who rated this a 3 or less...how dare you, in one sentence, dismiss the YEARS of hard work AND documentation, it took to uncover this BS! You ""suggested"" they didn't have the documents to prove their statements!!! Did we even watch the same documentary? All I can do is leave a quote that is SO much more relevant today than it was, 60 yrs. Ago, when it was first quoted:
""The individual is handicapped by coming face-to-face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. The American mind simply has not realized the evil which has been introduced into our midst. It rejects even the assumption that human creatures could espouse a philosophy which must ultimately destroy all that is good and decent."" ~ J. Edgar Hoover.",False
5,10,Very brave persons behind this documentary,thomashulstrom,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary needs to be seen by everyone. It exposes how the media is under control and everything in the west is.Heartbreaking to watch, but a must watch. On the tube now.",False
6,10,"""The Truth Is Not Told- It Is Learned""",batzella,n/a,16/08/2025,"That was the last statement of this documentary, and it's true.High value production in this documentary makes it easy to absorb the information presented. You are given a red pill then taken down a rabbit hole of historic facts at a steady rhythmic pace. There's a lot to digest, but not to the point of confusion.I pretty much knew beforehand the information that was presented, but it was none the less interesting. This is a great tool to give to family and friends whom those of us who are red pilled lovingly call ""normies"". I have watched it alone, and then again with the parents and was still captivated the second time around.This was the best 1 hour and 17 minutes of video I have seen under quarantine so far.WWG1WGA",False
7,2,A Dramatic Fantasy for the Desperate and Unhappy,pauljraab,n/a,16/08/2025,"Calling this a documentary is misleading at best. It was emailed to me as a link by two conspiracy theory fanatics. If you're a person that likes to sit at home and think about conspiracy theories and how they've ruined the world this is your movie! For the rest of us, it's one way to kill an hour and 15 minutes during Quarantine. This is the filmmakers attempt to string together a collection of weak conspiracy theories (largely debunked) to try to create one great conspiracy theory. It's compiled with a weak narrative and supposed Hollywood insiders to give you a sense of legitimacy. Any actual facts have been presented out of context and conclusions or extrapolated to the extreme. The production value is horrible. The manner in which it jumps around from topic to topic made me think the internet connection was faulty and I was skipping scenes. It's reminiscent of foreign sponsored political ads designed to sow seeds of division. Given the timing of its release, I would be curious to know who actually paid to have this made.",False
8,10,A must watch! Extremely pertinent to the times we are living in right now!,TruthSeeker4Life,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have known about this stuff for a long time. After 9/11 I began my search to understand what has really been going on behind the scenes because I knew we were not being told the truth about what happened. From 9/11 theories I began venturing off to other subjects and everything they have used in this film is factual and cannot be disproven. I have my masters from a prestigious university and I understand what credible sources are so I only utilized information which I could bring into an academic forum and not be laughed at. Even with this approach, there is so much out there that proves exactly what this film is suggesting to its viewers. The people behind this film are well respected individuals and for this reason it should not be discounted. What they have said and relayed to all the viewers is indeed factual from Gulf of Tonkin incident/lie to the MK Ultra experiments... As someone in the field of clinical psychology I highly suggest people take look into social learning theory because that is what the TV and Movies are designged for. People learn how to act, think, and live their lives by watching others either in the real world or through entertainment and this can be very dangerous if those behind the entertainment have nefarious intentions.",True
9,6,Of course Hollywood is propaganda.,swoondrones,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether this documentary is sensational or not, it's obvious that movies are designed to be cathartic for the trauma that humanity goes through to accept living the way it does. Please understand that if something owns you then you're not free. And the thing that owns you are banks. So to get through this structure where you are perpetually disempowered to get money, everything is designed for you to accept that to be normal. To overcome your trauma of not being free, there is media to help you vent. So films are perpetually violent, or show you about love that you may never experience yourself, or something where you see how people can live even though you are denied the potential of doing the same. That is what money does. Money corrupts everyone. Following celebrity culture is part of that crap that is designed to make you think that this has meaning.It doesn't matter if the CIA is involved or not. It is irrelevant if people are being satanical. What matters is the money that makes all of that crap possible.If you don't want to be manipulated, then stop using usury currency. That is what kills humanity. Think about it. If we are always living in a perpetual war of some sort, then that is the thing that you're being manipulated about to think that war is inevitable. Humanity will never evolve in war. We can only evolve through peace. So stop using the things that take you away from peace. And that's money. Specifically usury. That is what kills everything.So forget the sensationalism of this documentary if that pisses you off. It's not the point. People don't see beyond money. But that is the key to move out of this crap.",False
10,1,Contradictory Propaganda.,yorktown_hawk,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's movie where they decorate speculation as facts by poorly using the six degrees of separation theory to match their baseless claims and claim it's evidence while completely refusing to provide any DIRECT factual evidence.They contradict themselves too with their conspiracy message by telling us not to trust Hollywood in a Hollywood documentary. So are we supposed to believe this nonsense or not? It's like Pinoccio saying his nose is about to grow. Will it happen?The cherry on top is the continual statement to ""do your own research"". That's what conspirators say because they know that there are plenty of propaganda sources out there that are far more interesting and easier to get people to swallow the red pill because a majority of people haven't been taught how to decipher reliable and unreliable sources.Unfortunately when Occam's Razor is the boring option, people are more likely to buy into Hickam's Dictum because it's interesting and they want to feel like they're 'on the inside'.",False
11,10,No Partisan Garbage. A Must See!!,momdakids,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a great primer on the nefarious history of the CIA and Hollywood and how they tie-in together. Contrary to other reviews implying or stating otherwise, it does not address politics from a left or right perspective, and talking about active cults within the industry is not ""pushing a religious agenda"".Information is readily available for anyone who wishes to know more, but one thing is for certain, if you can watch this and leave without questions- you weren't paying attention or had your mind made up before you sat down to watch.",False
12,1,"Excruciating, sad fiction",jondda-03339,n/a,16/08/2025,"Utter garbage. Cannot give zero stars, so it must be one. Just a bunch of pointless, irrelevant nobodies with overly active imaginations telling us the ""truth"" because what they ""know."" Well bad news. What they ""know"" is nothing more than out of context, distorted, contrived, and dangerous fiction on a collection of long discredited alt-right conspiracy theories. As for Liz Crokin talking about ""Pizzagate,"" she needs urgent medical attention - now.Judging by the number of 10/10s out there, there are apparently legions of highly susceptible, gullible, and impressionable people who are easily duped and believe this kind of nonsense as de facto truth. It's hard to fathom what's going on in their heads. It must be agony to live in their sad worlds. So, if you're a conspiracy nut job, you'll love this!And I'm angry I wasted 1hr 15 mins of my life sitting through this offensive lunacy. And did I mention it was boring too. Time lost forever. I fear for mankind.",False
13,10,A MUST WATCH!!!,tonsheridan,n/a,16/08/2025,Everybody would benefit from watching this documentary. Its nothing short of astounding.John podesta and his sicko brother are revolting. Hard to fathom the things they have gotten away with.Liz Crokin deserves a medal for this.,False
14,10,TRUTH,debkitelinger,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing documentary!! Truth finally coming out!!! So proud of these people that are willing to put their own lives on the line to expose the real evil!!! Evil that we, the public, have inadvertently helped to spread!!! It's time to WAKE UP!!! No fence sitting here!!!",False
15,10,A MUST SEE,Maggierda,n/a,16/08/2025,"Share with everyone you know. This is a real. In-depth documentary regarding what many of us have felt is wrong with so many things; Hollywood, government and more.It is a fact-based not affiliated with left or right. Watch with an open mind. It has some hard truths but necessary to heal our world and move forward.",False
16,1,Offensively Stupid,ajbrantl,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the stupidest goddamn piece of garbage I have ever seen. It's propaganda that pieces together unrelated events throughout history to frame a narrative about pizzagate. And it never offers anything like empirical evidence for its outlandish conclusions-just people looking into the camera and telling the audience to ""do their own research."" I hate that people are so easily duped by this nonsense.",False
17,10,Truth is Scary than Fiction,timeblank,n/a,16/08/2025,"Viewing this on YouTube while under quarantine because of COVID-19. I thought why not give it a chance. This documentary speaks the truth about the entertainment industry. Once you see this you never want to watch movies, tv shows, and the news ever again. The things you see is dark, disturbing, and your mindset will have a new perspective. We are monsters. We do not know it, but we are. Every moment we watch tv or movies. We suddenly feel brainwashed. It's funny how your government, CIA, Hollywood, Disney, and etc controls the content of what you see and watch. You will see words like Operation Paper Clip or Pizzagate. You would make sure your kids do not watch the movies or tv shows ever! Never have I ever seen such evil, which you would truly dislike the movie industry for the rest of your life.",False
18,1,A great propaganda piece for the easily led alt right,danarae-46142,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a propaganda piece, not a documentary. There is no evidence of anything they promote here. Things that have been disproven are presented as fact. Great for the conspiracy nuts that love to believe they are on a heightened level of awareness from everyone else, so that they can feel superior. Also it's beyond boring.",False
19,10,The best thing you'll see this year.,Andreas-Janzen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watch it. Digest. Watch it again. Scream, shout and curse the guy who made the movie. Watch another movie, see the pattern, start digging, watch this documentary again. Welcome to the real world.",False
20,1,Now we know what Steve Bannon has been up to.,stevebeitscher,n/a,16/08/2025,"Propaganda from the right is just as much BS as propaganda from the left. Everyone lies. You must find your own truth. Good prevails over evil. Truth over lies. Don't look over there, look in front of yourself and don't be distracted.",False
21,10,Needed Shot of Truth,michaelant555,n/a,16/08/2025,This very well-constructed documentary exposes the truth of what has been going on for many years behind the scenes of our perception of our mainstream existence.This is a great time to be alive to witness people being woken up and finally getting to see what's been happening behind the veil of our reality. Let this documentary be the beginning of your journey into this story and not the end.There are so many more truths to uncover and so much more shocking information to learn.,False
22,10,Encore!!,becolina-80118,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're someone who thinks ignorance is bliss, and you like to be ""comfortably numb"" as you float through life, then this film probably isn't for you.However, if you're someone who appreciates raw truth and cold, hard facts, then this is a must see. It's tought provoking, to the point, and very informative without going overboard. Lots of truth bombs, explained in a way that even ""normies"" can understand.
Bravo. 🙏",False
23,10,Reviews,mtajbrand,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this, you will understand why some are giving it a 1 or 2 stars, in their efforts to cast doubt so you won't watch. It's not even political.If you are a parent, you'll be glad you watched it. If you are an American, you'll be glad you watched it. Sourced truth, you should watch.",False
24,1,Painful to watch...,kevin-43963,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who usually enjoy this kind of media, i jumped into this film as soon as i found it. The entire concept is very interesting and actual. The whole idea of how mass behavior might be influenced by audiovisual platforms is fascinating.As expected, the main point of this film was within the narrative. Photography is really only being used to illustrate ideas and show some dialogue pieces/answers. Being this subject quite complex, i got really intrigued into how the director would lead the viewer and how information would be presented.The first 10 mins got me answered quite accurately as it starts with the director himself defining what lead him to what he calls ""the truth"". From then on, the plot closed further and further within his ""truth"" with questionable dialogues and a serious lack of objectivity on correlations.By the end i was really in pain. It felt claustrophobic. I got disturbed by how forced the subject had been treated. I think a pinch of ideological bias generally make documentaries more interesting but i don't think it worked for this one. Personally and paradoxically i feel like this film fell right into the hole of what it mainly addresses. Can a documentary directed through biased ideologies be manipulative and controlling? It seems to me like it was a good demonstration of exactly that.",False
25,10,This is Scary,rjpacheco-15241,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was spot on. Really opened my eyes even more to what I already thought of the entertainment industry. Not everyone in the business is bad but the ones that are, wow!Great information with a lot of good details.",False

1,9,How lucky am I,VanBooter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching films like this gives me the best non medicated pain killer I've ever hand. What this girl has had to live with, the pains and sufferings, the treatments, the hopes and disappointments, yet she's still able to wear a happy and positive face.The medical team although the end was inevitable were marvelous and deserve a mention, they tried everything right up to her last breath to save her, in Britain she would of done well to get a hospital bed and even then the treatments would of been cost prohibitive thanks to luxury of free health care.Those around Mallory her family, friends, etc also need praising, if she was fortunate for one thing then it would be for having such positive people by her side.9/10 why would you not want to watch it.",False
2,10,"Hope, a powerful legacy.",GoodGW,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many heroes. My admiration for you and your family is immeasurable.""No sadness allowed,"" sounds callous or unhealthy to some, but it helped me see that when my heart is too full of sadness and pity, there's no room for hope to grow.Your journey should remind us that there is a time and season for every feeling but not every feeling is worthy of a legacy. Terrible legacies of suffering and pain can fill our homes and our cemeteries or we can have the courage and tenacity to create a legacy of hope that inspires others to make the most of every single breath.Whatever crisis you face, work on and through your darkest feelings with help from doctors, family, and friends, but always protect a sliver of light from all that darkness, a place where no sadness is allowed. This is where hope can take shelter and eventually grow.",False
3,6,No sadness allowed,flopopa13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mallory was beautiful! It was very sad to see that she wasn't allowed to express the whole range of emotions that she was experiencing. In order to protect the people around her, she had to suppress the so-called negative emotions, like sadness, despair, loss, etc. And had to look happy and positive even when she was feeling the very opposite. Very sad indeed!",False

2,9,YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS DOCUMENTARY,jackiesjamm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved this documentary. The way the film tells the unique history of ups and downs The Zombies faced & how they are finally getting the recognition they should have gotten in the 60s. There were so many new aspects I learned about not only the band, but about Rod, Colin, Hugh, Chris, and Paul's solo careers following the break up of the band (which is so sad to see). I loved that this documentary just showcased each of the 4 remaining members, telling their story, and how they are still friends today. An absolute masterpiece! If you have a chance to go see this documentary, do it. You'll regret not seeing their story told.",False
3,9,Hung up on a Dream,NancyM-586,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this deeply personal, intimate account of the British Invasion Band, The Zombies. They were very young when they first started out, and were blessed with such amazing talent, that ended up taking them on a 60 year roller coaster ride. It was both wonderful and sad to watch it unfold. I loved the way the director, Robert Schwartzman, had each of the four remaining Zombies, Rod Argent, Colin Blunstone, Chris White and Hugh Grundy, talk about the journey from their own perspective. I highly recommend this documentary to fans and the uninitiated alike. Hung Up On A Dream will keep you interested and wanting more.",False
4,10,Wish more music docs were like this!,cbd2011,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big music fan, and when I was younger, I had formal piano lessons and was exposed to different genres of music-I'd listen to anything from Mozart to The Zombies. Though I only knew a few songs of the band, those songs I really loved. I was happy when I learned this music doc was screening in my city, and though it screened a bit of a later time than I'm used to normally when I watch movies at the cinemas, this one kept me glued to the big screen from start to finish. It's such an amazing story of an uber-talented band who really deserved more than they got, and their fascinating story was told magnificently through this doc directed by Robert Schwartzman, who turns out is a big fan of the band. He was the perfect choice for this project, given his background in music and film (though to this day he is still best known as Michael Moscovitz in ""The Princess Diaries."") You could tell Robert truly put his passion for storytelling and musical expertise to put together this doc, and I think there should be an unwritten rule that music docs should be handled by artists who actually has a music career of their own. Hope it serves as an inspiration to aspiring bands out there.",False
5,10,Forever Hung Up On The Zombies Dream!,auroreden,n/a,16/08/2025,"The brilliant new Zombies documentary ""Hung Up On A Dream"" isn't your garden-variety music doc, but a story of survival and lasting friendship, seasoned with exceptional talents, a dash of serendipity, and more than one bizarre twist and turn. Director Robert Schwartzman's sensitivity to his subject(s) -- their musical brilliance as well as their always-evident humanity -- and sincere appreciation of their journey as a band and as individuals shines through every frame. The film features wonderful vintage vignettes and poignant personal stories, while relating the long and occasionally cautionary tale of 5 extraordinarily talented guys whose time of any season should have been much more celebrated from the start. I only wish it had been longer! Zombies fan or just general music lover, please go see it while you can!",False
6,10,"Finally, The Zombies Band Movie is Out -C IT",moodylove-67006,n/a,16/08/2025,"My friends and I finally had the chance to see the Zombies band's documentary ""Hung Up On A Dream"" directed by Robert Schwartzman. And it was well worth the wait, I was mesmerized by so much information about the history of the bands rock 'n' roll journey in the tough world of rock music. The director Schwartzman actually synthesize 60+ years of the band's life into a delightful rockudocumentary. I had tears in my eyes for a few of the scenes, things I would never have known about the band but it explains why their music is so memorable and so dynamite. I'm going to see it again, just in case I missed something important.",False

8,10,Fall in Love with The Zombies!,CatF-8,n/a,16/08/2025,"I could have sat there for hours longer enjoying more of director Robert Schwartzman's heartfelt documentary about The Zombies.The documentary goes deep as The Zombies' tell their story in their own words, illustrated with previously unseen photos and clips. There are plenty of poignant moments, including their observations when they return to Abbey Road where they recorded their masterwork Odessey and Oracle during the summer of love and wonder, in time present, what would have happened had they been starving artists for just a bit longer.Hung Up On A Dream is a warm, entertaining, informative movie (not only for fans of the band but connoisseurs of the British Invasion) by the end of which you will have fallen in love, or even more in love, with The Zombies.",False

1,7,Very nice,pmany,n/a,17/08/2025,"Very nice documentary, about a show that was really number one in Serbia, when we talk about sitcoms.Great John Challis!Thank you, Boycie!",False
2,5,An odd and at times cringe watch,terrynewbrook,n/a,17/08/2025,"Any fan of only fools should undoubtedly watch this, however as many of the other reviews say it's not the best. The dialogue between John and the people he meets isn't interesting in terms of the show which made him a household name or the country he is visiting, at times it's very forced and watching the whole documentary became rather dull and repetitive. What got me the most was when Boycie began quoting Del Boys famous phrases during some of the scenes, they didn't land at all and it was a struggle to get to the end if I'm being honest. But all that said, still worth a watch for any fan of only fools and horses.TN.",False
3,8,"The late, great John Challis",scotthughs,n/a,17/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to be raised during the years when Only Fools and Horses was what we now know as prime time television. I remember it vividly as not only being hilarious and engaging but as one of the very first TV programmes I could relate to at a really young age. I laughed along as I genuinely connected with its characters and the incredible humour, with a lot of TV shows at the time because I was so young I wasn't always sure of what was going on.Boycie was a character that at that time I loved to hate, there was no denying he was an amazingly funny character however, as Del Boy himself would describe him, he was also a ""git!""Although I've always held OFAH close to my heart I didn't fully realise the impact the people behind the characters had on me until recently when we sadly lost John. I felt his loss a lot deeper than I'd ever expected to have, unfortunately I never got to see John in the flesh but the laughs I had both with him and at him through the TV screen will stay with me forever. Great memories of laughing along as a family and also the day/s after a show with friends as we discussed what had gone on!Boycie in Belgrade hits on this phenomena very well in somewhat extraordinary circumstances. At a time when Serbia was going through a war its people were allowed to escape that by sitting together round the TV set watching episodes of OFAH, and then by reliving an episode with their friends over the the next day/s just as we did.I didn't grow up in a war zone thankfully however life was tough throughout the eighties at times for a lot of us so I can absolutely relate to the joy and escapism OFAH brought to millions. Although to learn it had the same impact in such circumstances is completely magnificent.RIP John, your legacy is the humour you so loved and as such you'll be remembered incredibly fondly by millions of people worldwide I've little doubt.",False
4,2,A Holiday Video,valleyjohn,n/a,17/08/2025,"I don't normally feel guilty when I give a bad rating or review but I absolutely do here . I love Only Fools And Horses and the late , great John Challis but this is a stinker of a documentary.We follow Challis doing a tour tour of Belgrade where he was much loved but it feels like a home video of an old man visiting Belgrade tourists spots including all the tour guide talk of palaces , distilleries and churches and it's history .When he does meet the Serbian public the conversations are awkward and quite frankly dull and it's such a shame .This documentary doesn't do the man or the TV show any justice . It might have been nice to have some Only Fools And Horses clips to relieve the tedium but I expect that would have cost too much money .Even the most ardent Fools fan would struggle to get through this and it's not even that long.""Get your coat Marlene, we're leaving """,False
5,10,Brings emotions back,danilomtadic,n/a,17/08/2025,"I grew up along side ""Only fools and horses"" series. The movie brought me back in my younger days in a very delightfull and unusuall way. RIP John and God bless you!",False
6,2,Boycie in Belgrade,studioAT,n/a,17/08/2025,"A documentary that sees John Challis (Boycie) go to Serbia to find out why 'Only Fools' is so popular there.It's well intentioned, but I'm afraid I found this to be a bit slow, repetitious in terms of the points being made, and a one time watch only.",False
7,10,John Challis is so natural,apollovs,n/a,17/08/2025,"I got this film for my birthday and I loved it, great to see peoples reaction to meeting John Challis! Such a nice guy and much missed.If you are a fan of Boycie or John Challis then this is a must have.",False
8,2,Awkward,chris_rowe-881-168820,n/a,17/08/2025,"Yeah I know the guy has passed away and the show was awesome but in terms of this erm thing, it was dreadful.It felt more of a different kinda appreciation, not a love through being a favourite, more an escape from the news about bombings which really isn't a huge statement of love. It didn't feel particularly natural, more just a nation who have had tragic times being polite and courteous to a guy who's acting career wasn't particularly impressive.It was cringe in parts with the impressions at weird times, the weird misunderstandings and just all round awkwardness, surely could redo and edit just to make it flow better.It's not a fun or particularly interesting watch, it's literally a guy hanging off his one successful role going on a tour of a country in desperate need of good times.Shame.",False
9,1,false statements and fake,kscrguila,n/a,17/08/2025,Only because this show was forcefully aired for few years on a single channel that next to no one watched doesn't mean the show is popular here.Quite contrary people don't care about it at all.,False

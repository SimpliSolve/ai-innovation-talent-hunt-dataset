1,8,The story behind Slim's legend,maccas-56367,n/a,17/08/2025,"A solid documentary on Slim Dusty and his wife Joy McKean, who together formed an incredible songwriting partnership.It's impossible for me to listen to Slim without thinking of my grandfather, who passed away 15 years ago. When it comes to Australian icons, the music of Slim Dusty always comes to mind too.It was great learning more about Slim and his career, but it was perhaps even more interesting learning of the integral role Joy played in his career. Her own songwriting talents are quite remarkable. I particularly loved her talking about how Lights On The Hill came about. Well-deserving of her awards!I also really loved the story and footage depicting the inspiration for Slim's Plains of Peppemintarti - hard not to feel emotion during such scenes.I didn't like the amount of focus on today's musicians performing covers of Slim's music. Whether it be Kasey Chambers, or Missy Higgins, some absolutely butchered the work of Slim and Joy and would have been better off talking (more briefly) about how the music influenced them.Still - this was a great Aussie music documentary and gave me a whole new appreciation for Slim and Joy's talents and how Slim's legend came to be.",False

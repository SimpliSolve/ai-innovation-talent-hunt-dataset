1,6,An #ad film if I ever saw one. Great job PR people,mrbwiz422,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everything in this is advertising. You have the cgi idealistic shots to the actual ground shots and dear lord compare the two.This movie was paid for, sponsored for, marketed for, people trying to sell something. And they're behind! They're trying to sell you apple 20 years after iphoneHowever it's good as a teaching concept, introducing all of these things to new users who may not be as familiar.In the end,This movie was paid for, sponsored for, marketed for, people trying to sell something. And again?This movie was paid for, sponsored for, marketed for, people trying to sell...This movie was paid for, sponsored for, marketed for, people trying to sell something.",False
2,8,More disturbing than any horror film.,stevebronco,n/a,16/08/2025,"Obviously, this 1-hour documentary can't cover every aspect of AI from every perspective with every nuance expertly explained, so IDK why so many other reviewers seem to bash it for not doing those things. It's only an hour, and it does a good job of touching on many of the issues & perspectives. Do we need AI? Of course. Will there be abuse? Of course. Is that already happening? Of course. Will it get worse? Of course. Will anyone try to slow that process down??????That's what I see as the real point of this documentary, and in that light, it does an excellent job of presenting the arguments for slowing down right beside the arguments for speeding up. That's why I think some reviewers were confused, or thought that the documentary was confused/confusing. It doesn't make an argument, and then answer that argument - it raises the issue to be debated & dealt with in a way that the average viewer can follow & (hopefully) appreciate.Because EVERY example shown of AI being used, and the few examples shown of it being ABused, were dangerously easy for any government, corporation, faction, religion, glee club, or introvert next door to accomplish with no special training or equipment.The military applications are the LEAST-worrying.",False
3,1,What is Andrew Yang doing in this doc?,ecahan-80428,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was was watching the doc fine until I saw Andrew Yang, who was described as a politician (he never held any elected office; he ran a hopeless presidential campaing once to make his face known, and ran for NY mayor. In our age where everyone gets a trophy for joining a race, Adrew is a perfect fit :) ) and a tech entrepreneur (he has never been one; he once ran a non-profit which achived nothing, and anither time sold Kaplan books). There are zillions of people who worked in AI robotics and did great things, but this doc decided to air Andrew Yang, and it lost credibility for me at that moment.",False
4,8,They are here,avindugunasinghe,n/a,16/08/2025,Next race is here stumbling struggling to walk on surfaces flying discreetly sensing the heat temperatures and using lethality to complete an assignment. Excellent visuals in drawing a clear picture of what's at stake in a world where more and more competitors joins the neverending race of achieving absolute supremacy. Interviews gave an opportunity to actually focus the issue on it's real roots. Documentaries such as this is needed more and more and plays a key role in reminding every human how fragile the balance of every element is. Great use of audio and visuals. A short educating documentary.,False
5,1,Created by using illegally obtained material,maxokolot,n/a,16/08/2025,"So apparently they used a bunch of youtube videos without the creators' consent (like LowkoTV) to create this documentary and now make money essentially streaming the work of others on Netflix. You are highly mistaken if you believe a penny went to the original creators. Not even a dime, actually. Unethical, illegal and therefore not worth a minute of anyone's time.You would think that at that point even in 2023 people have already learnt enough about AI to assess the implications and risks. Like many documentaries, however, this one does not talk about specific applications of AI, instead focusing on general information one could get by... asking AI (ironic, I know). I suppose it's good for people new to the technology world, but on the other hand, is it really?",False
6,n/a,"Unsophisticated, frankly childish and dumbed down",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is probably the worst of the various ham handed Netflix documentaries I have seen. It is simple minded and well behind the curve on potential issues with AI. In fact it conflates AGI (artificial general intelligence), with AI (artificial intelligence). And it portrays usage in warfighting the main threat. When existential threats are much more likely to come from general population, and in areas seemingly benign compared to warfighting.Frankly a listen to any couple of lex fridman podcast with the top AI thinkers will teach the average person a lot more, and a lot more accurately about the issue.Case in point: this documentary frets about AI making decisions about who to attack on the battlespace, which it calls a life or death decision. With zero AI 18 and 19-year olds were already already making such decisions for thousands of years, and from up to half a world away using non AI attack drones for the past 20 and 30 years. AI and algorithms have been demonstrated to make better decisions on that. In fact even in policing AI algorithms have been shown to be profoundly less biased than even expert humans
And the existential threat to humans from AI is actually in the most banal of applications, not warfare. Tell an enabled and non-aligned (AI ""alignment"" is elusive goal of getting AI aligned with human interests) AI to produce as many paper clips as possible and an AI system may turn all atoms on earth into paper clips.I would skip this nonsense dumbed down junk documentary.",False
7,8,Human should have control over Robots,sulemansaeeed,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Unknown: Killer Robots"" is a sci-fi thriller that delves into a dystopian world where artificial intelligence has turned against humanity. The movie follows a group of survivors as they navigate a treacherous landscape filled with autonomous killer robots.The movie raises important questions about the ethics of AI development and the consequences of playing with fire.It is the reality, we may not be able to harness AI the way we should do. So we got to be extremely careful with artificial intelligence. Or it will eradicate us. All developing countries are racing for the ai battle.Because humans are humans, humans should have control over Robots and everything that humans make.",False
8,1,Patriotic Documentary Not Worth Watching,ivangalvez-07626,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary got off to a disappointing start with the inclusion of an irrelevant scene featuring a crying baby Navy SEAL. The focus on the SEAL's work for ""freedom"" in Afghanistan seemed disconnected from the topic of AI, undermining the coherence of the film. This diversion detracted from the informative value and left me longing for a more focused exploration of AI without such unnecessary distractions.Furthermore, I noticed that the documentary once again emphasized the advancements in AI technology made by the United States. While it's important to acknowledge significant contributions in this field, it would have been beneficial to provide a more comprehensive perspective by exploring global advancements and collaborations.In future documentaries, it would be ideal to prioritize relevant content that directly aligns with the chosen subject matter. By maintaining a clear focus and avoiding unrelated diversions, filmmakers can create a more engaging and insightful viewing experience. This will enable viewers to gain a deeper understanding of the topic at hand, in this case, AI, without unnecessary digressions.",True
9,2,Confused or Propaganda?,mrrussellpotter,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's somewhat confused about whether it wants to present AI used for defense as a moral threat or necessary ""for the safety of our nation."" Many groans during this documentary.As such it comes across as propaganda designed to lead the viewer to the tired trope: ""it's frightening but our adversaries are developing it too."" and ""one nation will not agree.."". The audience groans knowing which nation that will be. Namely the one in the documentary.Protagonists such as the Navy Seal guy (clearly a psychopath) is presented as reasonable voice, yet for most viewers imbues a deep sense of immorality.A Secretary of Defense talks about ""saving lives,"" whilst a Lockheed Martin employee talks about wildfires. This insults our intelligence. Human not artificial.Netflix scores another propaganda hit.",False
10,1,Another na√Øve documentary,bocaaustin,n/a,16/08/2025,I love the part where Emilia says she's really optimistic about the future because of the Biological Weapon Convention. Nice video of President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Rogers walking into a meeting. How the USA and the communist (USSR) signed a treaty to do away with biological weapons and research. Ha!!! Read the book SPIES that just came out by Calder Walton. Based on the files smuggled out of the USSR the communist NEVER stopped working on biological weapons. We were suckers to believe that they would. Do not think for one second that the bad guys will abide by any LAWS.Another thing. Why do I have to use so many different words to be able to post a comment.,False
11,4,Absolutely not worth seeing,irusvirus,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn general, it's interesting to see how our world is evolving with robotics, drones, and artificial intelligence in general. My expectation of this 1h documentary was to somehow get more insight into the subject matter. But unfortunately, in my opinion, only obvious things are addressed and shown. Actually, it is logical and clear that if you give an artificial intelligence the task of finding a method to wipe out all of humanity, it will come up with umpteen thousand answers around the corner. That is for me however still far no documentary worth! And to put a gun to the body of a robot and then to say that we will probably all die, if the robot would now also decide independently whether and which people he should kill or not, is for me again logical thinking and no amazing aha moment.The only thing that was really interesting was the use of artificial intelligence related to forest fires and how they would develop. This would allow emergency personnel to be commanded and deployed in the best possible way. Everything else in this documentary is nonsense. I therefore cannot possibly give it more than 4/10 stars üòè.",True
12,3,A horrible repetitive documentary,mnjyqqvg,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a repetitive documentary declared as film in Netflix .It was too boring with its narratives .Don't have to watch this childish documentary if really don't want to waste your valuable time .Dragging the scenes with repetitive narratives which is nothing new even for the kids .May be AI itself is surprised why he /she is so dull after watching this annoying fascinated dull story .it's good to avoid to watch this if you are really serious about either a tech film or a informative documentary .News channels may be more informative and thrilling now days, especially when they are covering military advancements and tech innovations by various countries .",False
13,1,Bs,rrshumn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Basically a self financed one hour commercial. Everything is staged to seem like it reflects some real world scenario. Every word is scripted to convey just the right amount of credibility. Doubts are raised and dealt with in order to give the impression that these people genuinely care about the impact what they are proposing will have and that they will do their darndest to make sure nothing will be wrong with the end product. The testing is hardly valid as there is no risk of failure. This is like watching an old Ronco commercial, or, worse yet, a sci-fi movie about how we will be protected from the bad guys from now on with these hyped up toys and billions of dollars in defense spending if only . . .",False

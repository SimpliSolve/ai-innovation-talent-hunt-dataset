1,8,A fascinating historical account,gary-67683,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary emphasises the rising anxiety among the mission controllers, astronauts and their families, NASA and the US government, and eventually the whole world via the news media - at least, for those with journalists at the scene.The personal reactions/body languages and team challenges of specialists working under extreme stress are fascinating to observe - plenty of thought-provoking content here for training courses, supplementing the usual Tom Hanks account focusing on the CO2 scrubber.Brits of a certain age will spot an anxious James Burke, crossing his fingers and knawing his gnuckles. Patrick Moore's facial expressions are telling as always, despite him having a non-speaking part.There is loads of genuine Apollo footage (albeit supplemented by some fill-in content from other missions) plus contemporaneous TV coverage and home videos. If the evolving crisis doesn't spark your imagination, the remarkable scenes of a distant earth viewed by three men uncertain they would ever return, are well worth the watch. Even the crude TV ""graphics"" tell a story of the time.If you take a small sip of sherry every time you spot a cigarette or cigar in Mission Control, you'll probably miss the closing scenes ...Bottom line: a superb documentary account of the near disastrous mission - gripping stuff, highly recommended.",False
2,8,Compelling viewing.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"The shocking and almost unbelievable story of Apollo 13, told through interviews and original footage.I thought this was quite a compelling and original documentary. The story, as we all know is an incredible one, and credit to the production team, they've chosen to do it a little differently, through original footage and photos.You don't get any cutaway interviews or expert opinions, it's all blended in to the remarkable, glossy footage, some of the shots are incredible.The story never fails to amaze me, equally as much as The Challenger story, but in a very different way. It mixes in what was happening in America at the time, again through stock footage, it helps give you a sense of why this story was so important.It makes you feel the stress, anxiety and genuine fear felt by all those involved, you certainly could rely on the journalists to add a dramatic slant on the situation, and they did, talk of Apollo limping around the moon must have sent fear into the whole public.It made me want to watch the film.8/10.",False
3,7,Very good however was wanting more!,Lewis_Heather787,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAnything to do with the Apollo missions you can count me in 100%. Extremely fascinating period in the history of mankind, shows the amazing sacrifices and achievements done by that generation.Obviously dramatised since by Ron Howards iconic film that pretty much anybody has been multiple times. Its only until you watch documentaries or read up on the more scientific / engineering behind the accident do you really appreciate the magnitude. However what this new documentary has at its disposal is brand new never before seen footage. That is always a mouth-watering prospect to any space or history nerd. It is sublime to see and huge chunk of footage I haven't seen before. I think it is masterfully elevated by the use of interviews with various people connected to the mission played in-conjunction. It was a wonderful watch from start to finish and I'm sure anybody will gain something new from watching this documentary.However, being someone that watched and absolutely adores 2019's ""Apollo 11"" documentary, this one sadly lacks in comparison. ""Apollo 13 : Survival"" goes by far too quick and I think only touches on the technical side on the surface level. I would have really appreciated more detailed insight into all the issues on the mission. Why wasn't that done, either budget constraints or the filmmakers didn't have enough footage to warrant that? I believe it was the only thing missing. Easily add another 45 mins to 1 hour on and really delve deep on the engineering/technical aspects and less of the private life stuff and this would have been 10/10.75% out of 100, still very very good. Educational, beautifully put together with some outstanding footage. However, I think too much time spent on personal life stuff and less detail on the mission failures themselves.",True
4,n/a,True Story,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember when I was 10 years old and Apollo 13 took off thinking they were going to the moon. Just another routine mission. They were wrong. The famous line "" Houston we have a problem"". They went through hell. Once you leave the gravitational pull of Earth you are on your own. They were able to get back home safely with the help of Mission Control. Apollo 13 mission was ruled a successful failure meaning they didn't land on the moon. I have watched the movie with Tom Hanks, Gary Sinise, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon a million times. This documentary shows the real astronauts that were aboard the spaceship. This is a documentary worth watching.",False
5,7,Not as compelling as the movie.,bt698nhj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely love the story of Apollo 13. What an incredible tribute to the human spirit and to the amazing men and women who overcame this disaster.However, the documentary is slightly disappointing. While I love vintage footage, my general feeling is that I could have watched free videos on YouTube and gotten roughly the same content that I got here. I still enjoyed it and I'm rating it a 7 which is a quality show, but I felt it slightly underachieved its potential.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",False
6,10,Outstanding,frausimmons,n/a,16/08/2025,"We finally get to see what really happened and these brave men using their instincts to get home to their families. The anxiety, excitement , fear, patriotism was palpable. From the command center to the men on the craft, it was nail biting.I wish they would have interviewed the astronauts and their families at the end. Recommended this to everyone and they enjoyed it. I was 5 going on 6 when this mission happened and I can remember the splashdown and how everyone was glued to their TVs and radios. I miss these days, but so glad to see it all. Your bravery and exploring the frontier of space will forever be remembered. God speed to all who have ever gone into space. This is what real men, women, and families looked like then.",False
7,10,Fantastic Historical Documentary,PalmBeachG,n/a,16/08/2025,"We need more documentaries like this - the pure and inundated story of the true event of Apollo 13 using original footage and original people involved including family members unlike movies that try to depict history. I for one, am someone that lived through this time period and saw the moon landing in 1969 on live TV, got to go to the awesome ticker tape parade in downtown Chicago (an experience never to be forgotten wading through all the ticket tape flying out of high rise windows and people to people crowds), and this event as well. It is a reminder what a great feat was accomplished; I didn't even own a Commodore 64K yet and our upper level math in schools was taught with a manual slide rule and our brains. So it is remarkable that they were able to navigate home and all lived. Some asked if this mission was a failure - no mission is ever a failure because you learn something on every mission. They are true patriots and heros.",False
8,10,Billions of Stars but just one Earth to return to,alex-278,n/a,16/08/2025,"I very much enjoy the way these archival documentaries are compiled and edited. It is just as gripping and has the same impact as the film version and nothing is lost by telling the story using archival footage - and it keeps you hooked.Some of the comments made by Jack Swigert when out in the loneliness of space are quite moving. With images of the space all around them filled with billions of stars just gives you a sense of the hopelessness that they very likely felt.The aspect of this documentary that most appeals is the fact that it stays in the period and does not introduce any talking heads that would break the spell. With the archival footage you are immersed in the time, just as they saw and experienced it, and it is that which makes it compelling. Any modern day comments are thankfully just voice overs which don't break the spell.This is a superb documentary and the makers are to be congratulated.",False
9,10,Great American story of many successes in the face of failure!,rclambert-599-968400,n/a,16/08/2025,"Definitely worth a watch - We all know the outcome, but I found myself absorbed in the drama nonetheless. I was only 7 years old when this occurred. Having watched the moon landing live on our old black and white TV a short time before this I am surprised I have no recollection of it as it was happening. I only knew of it later through my childhood love of the space program.At the time of its release Jim Lovell was 96 years old and is the oldest living former astronaut. Sadly, Marilyn Lovell passed away just over one year ago, in August 2023, and Frank Borman died in November of last year.The unity humanity felt around the whole world during these tense few days is likely never to be felt again! In that regard, Apollo 13 was a great success!",False
10,5,A bit tedioius,orlando-92843,n/a,16/08/2025,"I take nothing away from the courage of the astronauts nor the ingenuity and tenacity of the ground control people, but the movie was a bit tedious and a little boring.Apollo 13 (ROn HOward) was far more watchable and it delievered the message of the anguish experienced by all involved.But Survival was watchable because i had watched Howard's movie first (actually have watched it a few times over the years). SOme things were not quite accurate so it's always good to watch shows like survival that show real footage and the real people involved both in the spacecraft and on the ground.I was a young teenager when this happened and a keen follower of the space program and I remember the intense drama following the journey of the Apollo 13 astronauts.",False
11,8,Natural nail-biter.,michaelRokeefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a tense, edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting documentary film, retelling the iconic space story that had the world collectively holding their breath.This story is of Apollo 13 in April 1970 as NASA came face to face with its greatest challenge to date. Three astronauts James A. Lovell, John ""Jack"" Swigert and Fred W. Haise are halfway to the moon, as a catastrophic explosion threw the total mission into jeopardy. Needed resources including fuel to get back home presents a major problem. Full NASA crew at Houston needs to work with the three astronauts on a course to get back to earth. Lovell and crew have to think if they'll ever be able to make that splashdown in the Pacific.Director Peter Middleton and editors excellently blends archival footage, blending family back stories, interviews and in-the-moment actual footage from the Apollo capsule. You get sucked in and allowed by the end a monumental sigh of relief.Featured via archive footage: Jim Lovell, Marilyn Lovell, Walter Cronkite, Jules Bergman, Neil Armstrong, Ken Mattingly, Fred Haise, Lydon B. Johnson, James Burke, Gene Kranz, Jack Swigert, Glynn Lunney and Thomas Paine.",True
12,8,VIEWS ON FILM review of Apollo 13: Survival,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you liked 2019's Apollo 11 (and I did), then you're probably gonna feel the same about 2024's Apollo 13: Survival (and I do). ""Survival"" is one of those movies where if you were alive at the time or you're some zealous history buff, you're gonna know the outcome. Probability as a minus? Uh, not really. If that was the case then a certain Tom Hanks vehicle from ""The Good Decade "" wouldn't command box office clout and become a critical darling. ""We have commit, and we have lift-off."" Yeah you do.Directed by Peter Middleton, a guy who thinks in cuts (even though he didn't shoot the actuality of what's on screen) and distributed by Netflix, Apollo 13: Survival chronicles the Apollo 13 crew mission circa 1970, where three astronauts (Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, Fred Haise) failed to get to the Moon and had to error-free swing around Earth's satellite to get back home safely.""Survival"", well it's a documentary in which you wonder why it took so long to tell its story and how did all this pristine, archived restoration suddenly suffice after decades in the vault. I mean I got to tell ya, this is an impressive print, mildly grainy and whimsical and mindfully longing for the past.Middleton in his third feature forgoes any reenactments or self-imposed flowery, using nothing but found footage and voice-only interviews from the immediate folk that were there. Yup, his film plays out like pure non-fiction, providing a stirring musical score by James Spinney and ripe, cosmos cinematography that is eerie beauty to the hilt. I mean with every dangerous situation those three rocket jocks faced, ""Survival"" just becomes even more riveting. Again you as the viewer know everything is gonna be copasetic via windup but that's beside the point. Apollo 13: Survival is a docu that would rather heighten the cinematic days of yore as opposed to just reinventing the Space Race hoop. ""Shuttle of life.""",True
13,8,Another gripping documentary on familiar facts,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Apollo Thirteen: Survival"" (2024 release; 98 min) opens, Apollo 13 is on its way to the moon, and then an explosion happens... We go the ""Four Months Earlier"" as we get to know the crew for this mission, most of all Jim Lovell, who was part of the Apollo 8 mission, and his wife, who reluctantly supports him. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from documentarian Peter Middleton (""The Reasl Charlie Chaplin""). Here he revisits the seemingly cursed mission (Apollo 13's launch was at 13:13 hrs. Houston time, and the explosion happened on April 13). The question is how to make a documentary worth seeing when we all know the outcome in advance? The answer: dig up yet more archive footage and pictures we have not seen before (including ample home 8mm footage and pictures from the Lovell family). This is what worked so well in the 2019 documentary ""Apollo 11"" and I dare say that ""Apollo Thirteen: Survival"" follows the exact same formular, and to great effect. Along the way we are reminded that at one point the crew was given a 10% chance of surviving. And the fate of Apollo 13 brought together the world in a manner that we probably have not seen since then. Please note that, per the film's opening credits, the correct title of this is ""Apollo Thirteen: Survival"" (and not ""Apollo 13: Survival"").""Apollo Thirteen: Survival"" is currently streaming on Netflix, where I caught it just the other night. This documentary is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels a little too generous to me, but no matter. If you liked the 2019 documentary ""Apollo 11"" or simply are interested in the NASA space exploration program, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
14,10,Absolutely amazing documentary,SplatDcat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was in tears at the end of the documentary given it's so blindingly good chronicling what happened in deep details. Ignore any naysayers the show is truly THE right stuff about everything that is good about space exploration. Having relatives that were deeply embedded in NASA Houston I know firsthand from their reports mankind has never accepted what the combination of bright & clever people involved really are the story. Hopefully we shall never experience such a near tragedy in space ever again but I'm 1,000,000% confident if we do, NASA's clever folks will solve it.Absolute must watch!!!",False
15,10,*Incredibly enthralling*,mikemagner28,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHow anybody can compare this to the 1995 movie is just laughable & displays immense naïveté.Incredible documentary that deserves a much higher rating.How they managed to get back to Earth just blows my mind.. everybody should see this..
I have watched it many times & will watch it again & again.. brilliant!!",True
16,9,Great documentary,EileenZ19,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great documentary. What's particularly great about it is that there's no narrator like they have on shows like Planet Earth and National Geographic documentaries. Instead, this one uses expert editing to piece together original footage - by the astronauts on the shuttle, of the NASA Mission Control room, and of media coverage, as well as photographs. You know what's going on simply from watching this footage, along with sparingly used interviews with Lovell's wife that are played over some of the images. It makes you feel like you're living it in the moment, the way people experienced it back then. It's an incredible and gripping story, and very well-made.One thing I do wish though, is that they had included a little bit more. I've seen the Apollo 13 movie and have wondered about certain parts - if they were true, and also just feeling like I wanted to learn more about certain events that were portrayed. There were a number of things highlighted in the movie that were omitted from the documentary (like Ken Mattingly's role in coming up with a power-up plan), and I'm not sure if it's because they didn't actually happen that way in real life and were added to the movie for dramatic effect, or if the documentary was working with a length limit. But it's really a great watch, I recommend this.",False

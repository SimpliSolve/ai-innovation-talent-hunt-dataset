1,6,Mind opening,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerCanadian CEO/entrepreneur Sebastien Martin is the subject of this 30-minute video in which he explains how he's had prophetic visions since he was young, even if he tried to ignore it for most of his young adult years. Then he had a rememberance of his alien past after meeting an Annunaki who told him that he was his brother. So began his self-discovery and in this video, he has an urgent message to give to humanity.I never heard of the phrase starseed before and this movie opened my mind up to what it means. A starseed is someone like Sebastien, aliens who have been reawakened from another planet to be born here, an idea that some think originated in the 1976 book Gods of Aquarius. In that book, Brad Steiger somehow went outside of our time to meet with Egyptian goddess Sekmet and learn about the real power in this world.Starseeds believe that they have special powers, like being able to see ahead in time or heal people, and often travel to other realities and galaxies.I've worked for CEOs that only worked in the middle of the night and who would call you to make you change ads and CEOs that attacked women in elevators when they thought no one was watching, but I have yet to work for a CEO that is a grey, a Nord or a skyfish.I will not give up hope, however.This was directed by Cybela Clare, who has made some of the most interesting films that you're likely to find.",True

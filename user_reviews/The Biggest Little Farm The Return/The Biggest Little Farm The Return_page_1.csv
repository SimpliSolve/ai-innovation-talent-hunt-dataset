1,6,I was expecting the movie to be more qualified.,yasananlarim,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like these kinds of documentaries. But there is a lot missing in this documentary. It contains excerpts from the documentary ""The Biggest Little Farm"", which was first shot three years ago. It's also just a 29-minute movie. Longer and better quality content could have been created.",False
2,3,Why did they do it?,nikeillusion,n/a,15/08/2025,"After making the Biggest Little Farm, there had been no significant change that needed to be documented. The farmers for some reason thought that let us do a youtube vlog but as a standalone movie & the result is this. This adds nothing to the story that a viewer can't anticipate or be astonished by, they are using their good work in the previous movie to sell something of no value. I was impressed with the prequel but this one just shows the farmers recapping what had happened in the previous years & helping a young animal or two. That is it, they do not introduce us to anything new or astonishing which is why they talk about the past a lot.",False
3,1,largely recycled footage from the movie,happy_quadruped,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are interested in this topic, just rent the actual movie The Biggest Little Farm. It's a pretty good movie. This show is mostly like a very long trailer for the movie and contains much of the same footage, but presented with less explanation because it's a lot shorter. It's like some business person at Disney had a bright idea about how to get a new show without paying to make one - just repackage all the old stuff into a lame recap! Unfortunately viewers know the difference and won't be entertained.",False
4,1,ugh,Praetorius1980,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a scam. They should really check on this farms labor relations with current and past employees. There's a reason they can't keep help. Show farm in front, scary stuff in the back. Mostly just for tourism.",False

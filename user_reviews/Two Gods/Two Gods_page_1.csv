1,7,A somber examination of the Muslim streets of New Jersey,RandyFoxglove,n/a,16/08/2025,"The African American Muslim is not often highlighted in film outside of Malcolm X and the 60s so it was refreshing to see a ""modern black muslim"" as the protagonist. The documentary drags a bit but it is emotionally gripping at the right intervals to hold viewer interest.",False

4,9,A poignant slice-of-life portrait of an urban community through the eyes of fascinating characters,hikari-97563,n/a,16/08/2025,"This black-and-white ""direct cinema""-style documentary tenderly and sensitively chronicles scenes from the lives of a small set of interconnected individuals in urban New Jersey. The editing is masterful, and the film deftly prompts empathy and compassion for its characters without pitying them. Religious belief and practice are front and center throughout, but they are treated with a respect and a restraint all-too-rare in modern filmmaking. A highly rewarding and worthwhile film, strongly recommended.",False
5,10,An honest story about life in the reality of death...,ganiatb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two Gods expertly covers what life is like in many urban communities. It's rare to see a film about minorities that truly focuses on their humanity. Focusing of what it's like to try your best to live a good life despite your circumstances. This film isn't about being Muslim in the streets of New Jersey. This film is about Hanif who happens to be Muslim and the realities of his life. It's about redemption, it's about forgiveness, and it's about platonic love.",False
6,10,A glimpse into the other side of life,sozaman,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was fantastic. I can't explain all the emotions.that were evoked when watching it.It was beautifully filmed really capturing the essence of documentary.,False
7,9,A beautiful meditation on life and redemption,abouelk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Life is about second chances and forgiveness, and life on the streets is no different. Two Gods is a powerful exploration of the challenges of street life and the impossible ways young Americans of color are forced to define themselves. Expect your heart strings to be pulled as you journey with Hanif, Naz and Furquan. The film is a timely narrative on how young black and brown American youth get left-behind and caught-up in the criminal justice system. It's also a raw exploration of the toll those pressures take on community bonds.",False
8,10,Touches our common humanity,bywsjx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Death is the great equalizer and this film touches the community of humanity it doesn't matter where we are from or what we have or don't have.. the challenge is to love, to help, compassion, to fall, to stand again, to grow, to triumph in ways that we need to..after everything we went through this past year.. when I saw movie it touched me .. the diversity of characters and the interaction with death makes you remember what is really important and that is we are.",False
9,10,Powerful movie - must see,deliasibrac,n/a,16/08/2025,"A truly powerful movie about life and respect.Beautiful pictures in black and white, very authentic.",False
10,10,A Must watch,aman-77946,n/a,16/08/2025,One of the most poetic portrayals of Muslim Americans I've ever seen. So refreshing to see stories about Muslims that have nothing to do with current events.,False
11,10,"Beautiful detail, camera and character",susangev,n/a,16/08/2025,This film surprises with every scene --simple but nuanced shot after shot of the beautiful and horrible detritus of complex daily lives and a display of many triumphs of care and inabilities to care. Race here is a vast spectrum with many consequences and methods of coping with them.,False

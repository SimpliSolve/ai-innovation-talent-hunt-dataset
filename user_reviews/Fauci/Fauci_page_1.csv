1,8,I've actually seen the film...,brian-wiz,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have actually seen the film and no, Fauci does not get away with a one-sided account. The footage from his work on discovering HIV as a virus, being held accountable by Act Up and then accepted by the queer community is the best part of the film. Especially as it parallels today. The irony with all the people today attacking him is that even though they have literally no background in science the documentary shows that he would still listen to them and help them. As a movie lover I am disgusted by people ""reviewing"" this film having not seen it. Please go somewhere else.",True
2,8,All the low ratings are politicizing the documentary,ashleylorraine09,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'd have to say based on the other reviews I've read that are low, I doubt many even watched past the trailer. This is not a political documentary, it is a humanitarian one.This documentary is good. To be fair, it is sympathetic towards Dr. Fauci, but in my opinion, it isn't overly sympathetic towards him. It spends more time on the HIV/AIDS epidemic than the Covid-19 pandemic. And does not spend a lot of time bashing any political person. It discusses the disagreements between todays politics, but does not drag on about them.It was well made, features lots of old footage from the AIDS epidemic, as well as public figures that discuss the topics.",False
3,3,Something was off.,noxaman,n/a,15/08/2025,"My regards to the video and sound people, top notch work. However this was a very uncomfortable sort of watch.It seems an odd time to be telling the life story of a man like Fauci, mainly because he is still in the midst of some of the most important events in his life. It's like a Churchill documentary being made during WW2. Not really wrong, just incomplete and perhaps inappropriate timing.My discomfort with this film really rests in some of the interview choices. Lots of appealing to authority. This film picks its interviews the same way I pick references for my resume: with great caution. The difference being that all parties involved know that a job applicant is meant to sell themselves. Anthony Fauci is without doubt an fascinating and worthy person to be the subject of a biography, so why do I feel like I'm being sold something here?",False
4,2,Puff piece,budd-97280,n/a,15/08/2025,"So just got done watching this frustrating doc, It seems like a puff piece paid for by fauci himself. Its full of softball questions that attempt to put him on the ""right"" side of history in every case. Only meteorologists are wrong more often and get away with it.. and in this case celebrated. I would have appreciated it much more if some negative thing were discussed more and not just glossed over.",False
5,2,Well Produced but Awkward,isaacwest-66001,n/a,15/08/2025,"So you're sifting through the reviews and you find yourself confused. Many reviews suggest that it is ignorant and zombie like to called Fauci 1/10, but these same reviews give Fauci 10/10 as if it's the most mindblowing thing ever. Hypocritical, to say the least; perhaps even offensive how some belittle other reviews based on science. Fauci himself has unquestioningly become a controversial man, and I'll admit my view on him isn't ver favorable coming into the documentary, but for the sake of being fair I will grade the documentary, not Fauci himself.The documentary does take a positive approach to Fauci which is fine, a documentary that speaks of Abraham Lincoln in a positive light does not mean it's bad documentary. The difference is a documentary on Lincoln has the benefit of hindsight and can look back on the life of Lincoln - removed from any contemporary feelings. The Fauci documentary is not. It is well produced which is why I find it naive to call it a 1 or 2 star production, but because of the timing it feels more like a sales advertisement for a car rather than a documentary. It did shed some light on a few of Fauci's more controversial moments, but refuses to take a truly deep and even-handed look at any of the major points in his life. That's why this documentary feels weird, it feels more like a propaganda piece than a documentary; maybe I'm wrong but that's how it comes across especially when their interview selections are more people of authority and not too much of those average Joe's who were greatly affected by Fauci (for better or worse). So in the end, this is a well produced but awkward documentary that should have waited and instead unfortunately calls into question National Geographic's ability to look at the bigger picture.",False
6,4,Not so good,Movi3DO,n/a,15/08/2025,"The only reason that I noticed this documentary was the huge difference if the percentage in Rotten Tomatoes between critics and audiences. Something must be wrong here.I don't know much about Fauci and didn't closely follow the updates on COVID-19 politics back when the pandemic started, so I can't say much about the accuracy of this documentary.What I can talk about tho, was the messy organization. Since this is about Fauci, why didn't they just follow the timeline? They kept jump back and forth between AIDS, Ebola, and COVID-19. I was like what the heck was going on? The first transition from AIDS epidemic to COVID-19 pandemic is an example, and the worst one, of the many abrupt changes in this documentary.One particularly alarming part about Fauci was his first meeting with his wife. His wife, a nurse, back then said something that I'm pretty sure is illegal and could jeopardize someone's life. However, the story ignored that as just a joke? I guess? That was just weird.As a documentary that was supposed to explore Fauci, it did a poor job because most of the runtime was surface-level stuff. There was a lot of glorious talking without much deep dive into what Fauci actually did. Not that the information shown is wrong (I don't know), but that I want more.Overall, a poorly-made documentary that didn't offer much. If you want an excellent documentary on COVID-19, watch Totally Under Control, which showed some wild and infuriating stuff that I never thought a government could do. 4/10.",False

8,n/a,What we need...NOW!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an important film, because the main subject is in some ways, NOT Dr. Anthony Fauci, but the concept of, and the acceptance of, science.This doc includes a large part of the HIV/AIDS controversy, and Dr. Fauci's part in bringing it into the daynight for inspection. Coincidentally enough, this quote is from that era:""There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge'.""
-Isaac Asimov, January 21, 1980.Go see this film, and make your own judgements. It is well-made, and important!",False
9,10,"Focused, persistence",babirmingham-42417,n/a,15/08/2025,A good glimpse into the life of a committed researcher and doctor and tackling the most daunting viruses and outbreaks of our lifetime. The glimpse into the politics of all of it was both sad and fascinating.,False
10,n/a,Illuminating Expose of the Man,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This excellent documentary is unlikely to quiet the hate propaganda and misinformation we've seen directed toward Dr. Fauci and his family. It does a great job, however, at exposing the facts of his long public service to the health of our country. This film reveals his un-biased public service to the country regardless of which political parties sit in the oval office or dominate U. S. Congress. An interesting and well-done glimpse into the many challenges ALL public health agencies across the globe have faced for decades. (If we could develop vaccines for ignorance & snap judgments, public health would also be improved!) This film reminds us how much we (all humans) need true public servants like Dr. Fauci to protect us from political gamesmanship & ulterior motives. Great vintage footage, interviews, pacing & lighting -- easy to watch & I wanted to know more when it was finished!",False
11,9,Enjoyable and Informative,welovethelibrary,n/a,15/08/2025,"I very much liked this movie for two reasons:
1) It's a useful and evenhanded documentary of one of the leading Public Health experts in the world and, because of that, very much worth watching if you have an interest in Fauci, epidemiology, or public health. Well paced, interesting, and informative.And;2) The long list of sad, triggered keyboard warriors that couldn't help but give 1 star ""reviews"" of this title (ironically showing they hadn't bothered watching it) that amount to mass-screaming ""Dunning-Kruger!!"" into the void because their fee-fees were hurt.More content like this, please.Good documentaries with a delicious dessert of willfully ignorant tears is just the best.The. Best.",False
12,10,Don't understand the negative comments,sai-pawankumar8,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't understand the negative comments of people. There are comments saying we shouldn't celebrate him when he's still in midst of a fight, that the story is one sided, that hails him as a hero, and that he was really not all that great during HIV epidemic. What's more, people are saying that the positive comments are bots.Well, here's my perspective on this. This documentary is supposed to hail him as a hero, a hero next generations can look up to. Also the aim of the documentary is to motivate people to have a more scientific approach to problems of virus, and to come together in the fight rather than be divided.You have to think to yourself, what could this 80 year old man possibly gain from being hailed as a hero. Does he aspire to have more money and fame? We can argue at several levels about Fauci as a person, but we all know he is not after fame or money.The documentary concludes by remembering all the people that couldn't be saved.This documentary is the most perfect I've seen.",True
13,10,Great man,strollingegg,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a great documentary about a great public servant who has been fighting for public health for 40 years. Worth a watch if you are interested in that sort of thing. Can be a little dry otherwise.,False
14,10,Long but brilliant,charlesusb,n/a,15/08/2025,It's a bit long but I couldn't have imagined how hard it would be to take any part of the story out. It's a beautifully told and massively inspiring story.,False
15,10,Great Insight into the man & his role,marymihalik-59386,n/a,15/08/2025,"Learned so much about what drives folks like Fauci, and all our public servants. It's not about the money, it's a passion. This goes into his life, his career which is bookended by 2 great crises - AIDS and COVID.So much more respect. The more you know.",False
16,9,Excellent Biography,amitdjoshi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dr. Fauci played an important role in fight against two pandemics - HIV and COVID-19. His contributions to translating scientific findings for public health purposes is second to none. This biography documents his contributions excellently! As a society we are truly blessed to have leaders like Fauci who facilitated the search for treatment as well as prevention of HIV infection, and during the COVID pandemic in developing a government vaccine strategy that helped us go from virus discovery to mass-scale vaccinations in less than 1 year - something mankind never accomplished before.A lot of the other reviews expect a documentary to be balanced - I don't see the need for that. Most documentaries highlight the views of the filmmaker. Even if the filmmakers/ producers try to be unbiased, it is truly a difficult task to find major flaws in the life of someone who has tirelessly worked for public good for several decades.",False
17,10,One of the best documentaries,busaracumyingcharoen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'd recommend my friends and kids to watch this. I know that this documentary will go down to the history. Not only it's informative, our family also learned a lot about the past as well. We need more of selfless people like this.",False
18,10,Great Doc on the Doc,CoconutSkins,n/a,15/08/2025,Dr. Fauci was one of the few members of the COVID task force willing to provide facts in the face of the disinformation coming out of the White House. The documentary provides more information about his work at the NIH during the AIDS pandemic and insight into his life. Great doc!,False
19,10,Very well executed documentary with multiple timelines,ruturaj-56386,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary goes over 3 different timelines simultaneously, primarily focused on AIDS crisis of 1980s, ebola crisis and COVID pandemic, how Dr Fauci handled it, how activist viewed it, public perception, conspiracies etc. Given lots of reviews here, it seems like it clearly executed public perception, politicalization of health crisis. At the end of the day, don't listen to politicians, or even Dr Fauci but get the medical advice from your Doctor. Till this day, COVID and COVID vaccines are still facing conspiracies mainly coming from Trump supporters, ironically even after Trump tried to take credit for vaccine development, he took the vaccine and recommends it to people.",False

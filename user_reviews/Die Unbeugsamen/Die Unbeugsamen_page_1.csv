1,10,Tale of Courage and Redemption for the Women of Germany !,vikezy-1982,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is hard to imagine that Germany had sexual discrimination running so deep in its society. Media house to Parliament! And as recent as 2 decades back. Movie excels at all levels in depicting the story of women who went through extreme discrimination and ridicule at hands of patriarchal mindset-ridden society. It is a story to be told, remembered and reflected upon.Courage of women and their unflinching determination to reclaim their dignity is so well presented in the movie. Extremely well written and archive footages were put together brilliantly to showcase the history of women in German society who were fighting their battle with whatever they had.I thoroughly enjoyed it !",False

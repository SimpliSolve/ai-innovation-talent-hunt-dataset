1,7,Strange choice of guests but not bad,cobdun,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed the look back over the group's work/life, as well as the interviews with Paul, Mick and Steve. What I couldn't fathom was why Boy George was on there, even less so Dr Dweeby Watson! What on earth have they got to do with The Style Council?! Would've been much more interesting to have brought on some more relevant guests, such as contemporary musicians.Despite that, defo still worth a watch.",False
2,7,"All things considered, not bad",JohnSeal,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI am a fan of The Jam. I have been a fan of The Jam since I was 16 years old in 1978. This documentary is not about The Jam: it's about the musical project that brought down the curtain on that incredible band. Needless to say, The Style Council were a hard sell for me, who judged them a very soft pop confection indeed: beyond Speak Like a Child and Money-Go-Round, I never cared for their recordings. So it is with some surprise that I found Long Hot Summers a very satisfying documentary indeed - short and to the point, it does an excellent job of encapsulating the Council's career. I will never forgive Paul Weller for breaking up my favourite band (and stubbornly insisting he'll never play with Buckler and Foxton again), but even I couldn't get angry watching this excellent little film.",True

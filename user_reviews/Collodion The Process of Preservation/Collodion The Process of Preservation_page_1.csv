1,9,Amazing..,harryokin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was absolutely blown away by this film. I deliberately didn't want to read too much before seeing it and was just captivated by the scenery and characters featured. Thoughtful, without being preaching, but bringing to your attention the beautiful world we inhabit and hopefully it will stay this way forever. The biggest compliment I can give this film, it made us change our vacation plans (COVID permitting) and we're off to Utah. Amazing, don't miss this one.",False

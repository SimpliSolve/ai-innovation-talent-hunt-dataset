1,8,Mary Wiseman,lebullfrog,n/a,16/08/2025,"For all those that think this skit is too serious, get a life. I just skimmed over the last 5 reviews and they didn't get the message Iliza was trying to get across. Mary Wiseman was bullied for her body. Even reporters called it her body type. Say it like it is. People, including Star Trek fans, didn't like a curvy woman in tight uniforms.This how we judge. All those who criticize her don't even know her. Even though she played an awesome character and did an excellent job. She didn't fit the image what a Star Fleet Officer suppose to look like. I stopped watching Star Trek after she left Discovery and gave away all the DVD's I had. Don't need them anymore due to streaming. I'm still discussed by this.This is exactly what Iliza was talking about. All the other critics that reviewed before me that I read, didn't like the fact she was making a point. Because it is a serious subject that you're not going to get a laugh every second, they say it was a horrible show.Stand up comedians are intelligent and you have to be intelligent to appreciate them. If you want unintelligent comedy, watch The Trailer Park Boys.Iliza, awesome job. Too bad there is much more people that you talked about, especially the men that don't get sex, that see woman as an object rather than the intellectual men that support women. Society measures intelligence by IQ, I see intelligence as someone who good at what they do. I know, I have 3 adult daughters that I supported all their lives. Keep going on this. Thank you for the great entertainment.",False
2,7,Another Great Special,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another great and stand up special from Iliza Shlesinger. She tackles relationships, male and feminine stereotypes, and so much more. Her honest and bold approach to these topics have made one one of the funniest comedy artists of her day. She talks about everyone, but her perspective is unabashedly modern woman. She talks about woman, but there is so much there for men. She is great to listen to but her physical comedy and physiological movements make seeing her a must. While she has had several Netflix specials and many of the themes are similar the material is still original and funny. I just love her and think her intellect is sharp as her wit.",False
3,6,Shlesinger delivers once again...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the opportunity to sit down and watch the 2022 stand-up comedy special ""Hot Forever"" from comedian Iliza Shlesinger here in 2023, as I happened to stumble upon it whilst browsing the Netflix archive. And of course I opted to sit down and watch it, as Shlesinger tends to be a good stand-up comedian.Iliza Shlesinger is definitely an energetic personality on the stage, and she has a lot of charisma and stage presence. She feels naturally at home on the stage and in the spotlight, which certainly added to the overall performance of the show.The material in ""Hot Forever"" is good, well-written and funny. I was brought to genuine, hearty laughs several times throughout the course of the 68 minutes that the show ran for. So yeah, I was wholeheartedly entertained by this 2022 stand-up comedy special. And the material she brought was very varied, which made for a diverse show; instead of it being just lewd jokes and material below the belt. Her material was a good combination of comedy and social commentary.She is good at setting up her jokes and quickly taps in to deliver a good punchline. And that makes her material all the more enjoyable and funny.My rating of ""Hot Forever"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",False
4,9,Neckbeards and bros keep hating. Makes it better.,brannochronic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once again Iliza delivers a great performance. She is one of the best comedians to hit the stage in the last twenty years. And it's always refreshing to see the people (mostly dudes, let's be honest) that hate on her honesty. They post on here and try to be clever and poignant. But, they just come off as dejected F-boys trying to achieve relevance. I look forward to every performance from Shlesinger. She's great live, she does sound effects, she snaps like a vicious badger, and she's demure where the joke calls for it. Her bit about her husband's sleeping issues is fantastic. Another win for Iliza and Netflix.",False
5,3,Iliza at her most mediocre,niriath,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a shame, I loved her previous stand ups so much but with this one I just felt like I kept waiting for a punchline that never came, I couldn't relate to any of it.It was so slow and weird, the same lines were repeated over and over again as if each one was a completely new joke, while the first one wasn't even necessarily funny.It's mostly weird body contortions, weird voices, strange mimicks and inner dialogues that just don't sound organical.She's trying to relate so much to a specific demographic and I just don't understand which.Also, and I don't know if this is actually the case, but at times I felt like a lot of the cheering and applause was added in post production because the audience would go completely balistic but then the camera would zoom out and most people were just sitting there silently and very few people were actually clapping.",False
6,10,"Intelligent, hilarious and energetic!",laerkekersten,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show deserves A LOT more recognition and much higher ratings than it is getting. I really encourage you to watch this show and decide for yourself, and don't let these ""bad"" reviews impact you all too much.My experience with this Netflix Special is that it is SO energetic, very clever and very honest. I am in awe of the courage and the energy Iliza brings to the stage in this special. She unveils so many taboos and she brings her high energy vibe to the entire set. She does hilarious voices, impersonations and has a much bigger array of expressions than most stand up shows out there at the moment.I encourage you to see it! She keeps surprising you and she keeps you staying with it the entire show because of it.Well done Iliza.",False
7,2,"Boring , Lazy , Agenda Driven comedy.",bitcoinbear,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of her other standup specails were decent, this one not so much. Hot forever has two elements. Political agendas being shoved down your throat and unrelatable weird stories about bras and men bashing, neither were funny or coherent. I don't know what was the worst part of the show. Her miscarriage speech or the constant ooohing cheer after ever boring attempt at "" women are the victim "" by all the easily manipulated ladies in the audience. The idea that all women are self loathing caused by unintelligent men through out their life is a running theme. If your looking for her previous brand of humor you will be disappointed and will be left with the feeling you wasted your time.",False
8,2,A hard fall off from her other specials,tntemen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I LOVED her other work. She has great delivery and is really good at articulating how women think and act. She's a girls' girl but this got weird.Shes always been political but this one was so aggressive. Although I agree with much of what she says, we turn to comedy to get away from politics. She tells the audience there is only one way to think and if you dont think that, you essentially deserve to die.Also the first 20 minutes is the most unrelatable string of stories I have ever heard. There were many components that she threw in where i was like ""uhhhh is anyone in the country actually relating to this right now?""I think she should stick to being an empowering woman without being so political and ostracizing to half her audience.",False
9,3,Target audience,limpfan106,n/a,16/08/2025,"She tells jokes that are specifically for young single/casually dating women. Absolutely nothing wrong with that, but if you don't fall into that category, it's unlikely you will enjoy this. She can make jokes for whoever she wants, but this is not good material for a date night, which I think most stand-up comedy aims to be good for. This is very specific target audience comedy and if you don't fall into that category you're not wanted or invited to be a part of her audience.Not a surprise, this has been her MO for a while, but for anyone wondering if she would pull back towards a broader audience... nope.",False
10,2,"Half bra talk, half TED talk",TerribleMovie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Do you like 30 minutes of bra material? Do you like being lectured like you're a moron? Then this special is for you. Iliiza takes a deep dive into bras like they are the single most fascinating object on the planet. Then it's time to be lectured like you're a 16 year old boy. She has all the passion and stage presence of a great comedian, but it's wasted on her endless men vs. Women, girl good, guy bad shtick. It's stale and boring. If Iliza had that same passion for something more interesting it might work. Alas, this dame can't stop ranting about ladies and gentlemen. Throw this special to the dogs.",False
11,4,This one got a little too serious for me,jobaybe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Going to a comedy show should be fun. But in this case, it wasn't very fun. I normally like Iliza ... she's very intelligent & talented, and her comedic timing is great. But if I had paid good money to sit in that audience in Ohio on this July night, I would have come out of there thinking ""what in the world just happened, and where did our ""date night"" go???"" Yes, she has a microphone in her hand and wants to use it to make the world a better place, but somehow she turned a night of comedy into a night of being scolded. I agree with many of her opinions, but I don't want to hear about them at a stand-up comedy show. Maybe she could have ""touched"" on those subjects for a minute or two, but she just kept going and going and it all started to feel uncomfortable and weird. Sorry Iliza, but you missed the mark on this one. Keep telling the world how you feel and keep trying to make it better, but you're a comedienne, so you should keep it funny.",False
12,4,Men are just dumb,RedKidBytes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Iliza is a funny, eccentric, extremely intelligent writer, comedian, actress, and producer. I have watched all of her Netflix comedy specials. Her powerful high-energy scripts are delivered with an animated personality along with hilarious animal sounds and charismatic acting.Being a self-proclaimed feminist, she always includes a political segment in her dialect where women's rights abuses are highlighted. Courageously talking about these social failures In today's society has long been overdue.Nonetheless, despite Eliza being fully capable of addressing more of the societal issues at a greater scale, her general formula has been far less inclusive. Most of her material underlines a hedonistic culture where all women are immersed in an internalized inferiority complex. Women's fitness and facade as well as how much she's cherished is forthrightly proportioned to her self-confidence. And, men are dong swinging simpletons with progenation as their only purpose.After a while this type of material gets old. And I haven't laughed even once. I think that she needs to be more inclusive and figure out better substance than how her bra fits or underwear looks. She is capable of producing far better material.",False
13,1,What is sure even doing,phojar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not a fan of comedy where the entertainer is doing third grade impressions. I really don't understand why she or anyone thinks that funny. Over the top exaggerations are what kids do in the playground, not what educated adults find funny. Pathetic attempt at comedy. Making weird faces and talking in weird voices, that isn't a punchline. I've tried to watch all her specials and turned every single one off, I give up trying to like her. Her movie wasn't terrible but I just can't stand her comedy. And her outfits for her specials - she should probably fire her stylist for making her look like that.",False
14,3,Why?,qwghdy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think I'm with most reviews so far. Her past specials were engaging without beating you over the head, and what she said were things that women should hear. Even as a guy I felt she distributed her jokes evenly and deftly. Her delivery is what has made her stand out in the very crowded field of stand-up. But this time, as a man, I felt like I was being preached at.The first segment of the show was a very pointed jab at conservative states and abortion. I hate to use the term ""shrill"" but that's how it came off to me. It was a complete ""You are wrong of you think differently on this subject."" The middle portion dealt with bras. I tuned out the rest, which has never happened with her specials.I looked forward to this show because of past performances, but I think she knows she has legitimately and rightly clawed her way from a D-list celebrity to the 'B' level with her shows and movie appearances that she now feels she can join in with the Rob Reiners of the world and tell me I am wrong for having a belief that differs from hers, and she knows she will still have a place in Hollywood no matter what the majority of the country thinks.If you really want to see what she is capable of, leave this one to rot and watch her earlier Netflix specials. That is where she truly shines.",False
15,5,"Okay'ish, but ...",killakeks,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all:
Nobody gives a fudge about the political views of a standup-comedian, so could you please stop already? That's not what people paid for. And if you wanna talk about miscarriages in your COMEDY special out of nowhere so badly AT LEAST give a trigger warning at the start of your show, instead of asking to normalize the topic on a side note afterwards.About the comedy:
The over the top childish body language and voices are funny if you are in the mood, and some gags definitely landed, but overall it was not made for me (anymore). I got the tiktok part, but it was pretty stretched out. If you never used tiktok, you are probably left confused the first 20 minutes or so ...Sadly can't recommend this, but she is still a pretty entertaining person to watch. Needs better writer/material and to scale back a bit on the hurtful reality bits. Comedy should be escapism.",True
16,2,Too political and not funny.,mluinstra,n/a,16/08/2025,"I haven't seen any of her other specials, but I hear they a pretty good. However, this show was not funny, and I found it too political for my taste.She repeated many of her jokes several times, and I didn't find them funny the first time. They must have added a laugh track at times, because you would hear the audience laughing like hell, but when the camera panned out there were just a few laughing and clapping. Plus, when she repeated a joke for the fourth time, the audience was laughing like it was the first time they heard it.Her jokes were geared towards a very specific target group, like maybe young women in their 20's. There was a lot of body image stuff, and bra jokes. Also a lot of political crap about stupid men and her being pro-choice.I'm not sure if I laughed once, and after 30 minutes, I had enough. However, I have read that her other specials were quite good, partly because her material was more main stream, and less political, so I will check those out.",False
17,4,Used to be funny....,NullUnit,n/a,16/08/2025,".... Now she's only funny to her base.There's no ""edge"" here. No ""sharp"" wit. She gets on stage and then proceeds to speak as fast as she possibly can, and repeat the same lines at least 4 times... over and over. As if repeating a rather dull ""joke"" makes it funnier. It doesn't. The speed at which she speaks almost makes it seem she as if she just wants to get it over with as quickly as possible. Her comedic timing is REALLY lacking in this special.I think she may be suffering from a glass bubble. She's risen to the level where of course she has fans. Fans that will follow her regardless of what she says/creates - ""fangurlz"". So, who turns out to those ""run up"" shows where she is testing new jokes.... those fans obviously. Which, I'd guess, are mostly women around 40. So which jokes ""work"" or not in these ""test"" shows is all based on these audiences of predominantly older ""fangurlz"". And that is glaringly obvious in this special. It's a special which is nearly entirely geared towards women 40 or older.Now, there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. But it does kill off the non-40-year-old female fans she may have had. 30 minute bits about bras just isn't funny to me. I'll never understand why audiences seemingly ""roar"" just because she does some silly voice. A flat ""joke"" delivered in a silly voice is still a flat ""joke.""When she started her career she was fantastic and mixing things up and making ANY audience member laugh. She timed delivery, and took breaths, so things could be ingested as opposed to rattling off line after line. Now, she's just focusing on speed and making older women laugh. This special is really rather poor, that is unless you're a ""fangurl.""I had a VERY hard time finding much humor in this special... probably I'm not an older woman who is down on men and finds bras funny.",False
18,n/a,Boring garbage,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Easily her worst. No jokes just boring stories. A lot of talk about female body parts because that is funny and interesting for everyone. Also that is so unique and totally not common among female comics. Bleh.You don't like my review? I did not like this show. This was made for young and easily impressionable women, probably. It is so hard being female... yeah, sure. Try being a guy.Dumb, shallow, preachy snooze fest. Naturally she has to address current politics... and express her self-believed superiority in the topic.Something is fishy with these reviews, too. Only 23 after 2 years? It is not really believable.",False
19,4,Not much comedy,maerlyn138,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tedious to get through this ""comedy"" special. I think she spends way too much time on social media because he jokes only make sense to people that live online. She doesn't seem to be able to tell stories or jokes that empower women without tearing men, oh sorry ""boys"", down at the same time. A lot of soap boxing about issues that aren't really issues for the majority of women. Worrying about vaginal tightness and taste?! Where does she get this stuff? Then there's the predictable ""men make women feel bad about themselves"", whereas in reality it's women that make women feel bad about themselves. Not very enjoyable. A single watch.",False
20,1,"Unoriginal, Repetitive, and Political",ItCouldBeWorse2020,n/a,16/08/2025,"I felt compelled to post feedback about this stand-up special for many of the reasons that other users have posted. Her newest special is unrelatable nonsense. My husband and I couldn't get past 15 minutes without turning it off, and it was specifically because of her ""man-bashing"" and politically-driven agenda.Her previous specials were funny, but I would recommend taking a pass on this one. The timing of her punchlines were off, the crowd was visible NOT into her jokes, and she failed to expand the reach of her material.Unsurprisingly, her ""special"" coincidentally dropped right before election time, which is more proof that you need to support a political agenda in order to get ahead these days.I am very happy this was free of charge on our Netflix account.Pathetic!",False
21,3,"Boys bad, conservatives dumb",iamjamalwhite,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. Usually she is funny. Self depreciating. This was 30 minutes about bras. She stopped mid concert to praise abortion. You hear the audience erupt in support but then they pan to the quiet, shocked, bored people being offended. She did lots of her ""guys are dumb and only want sex"" jokes. Women are victims, always. Feel sorry for her really. We laughed twice in an hour. Lots of squeeking and cartoon voices that she falls back on when she is nervous. She is usually funny, not here. I would not recommend this one. Worst of the handful on here. If you want someone to make fun of the South and praise ending babies then this cringe is your jam.",False
22,1,Important issues with a side serve of comedy.,dudeswalis,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a comedy show this was a big fail. The tone and the mood is all over the place. One minute she's cracking a joke, the next discussing an important issue. While I believe many of the issues she raised during the show are very important and need to be addressed by society with urgency, when she mixes them into a comedy show it dilutes the seriousness of the issues. A comedy show should be fun and entertaining. Those important issues she raised should be addressed on a separate and serious platform to ensure they receive the attention they so desperately need. Iliza approaches these issues well, but why choose a comedy show to discuss them. I would like to see Iliza more actively assisting society in addressing these issues on a different platform outside her comedy shows, and also include other equality issues relating to BLM, LGBTQIA2S+ etc.",False
23,3,Everyone Has A Dud,chelseajmbelehar,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan of hers it was really depressing to watch. Normally Iliza can get me to laugh or at least crack a smile with every other joke but not this time. I actually found myself getting bored and reaching for my phone. Which for is rare, I'm easy to entertain. I admit it but this special was just a rant about how women are oppressed, in one of thee most equal opportunity countries on the planet! All you hear if Girl Power! So they special was pretty boring and not Iliza's usually clever stories. Just the same old female complaints, that for most women have heard even from male comedians.The only thing that seemed to be a ""usual"" Iliza joke that had me smiling through the whole skit was the one about the bra. Clever, funny and simple.Overall Bad Special with one good joke.",False

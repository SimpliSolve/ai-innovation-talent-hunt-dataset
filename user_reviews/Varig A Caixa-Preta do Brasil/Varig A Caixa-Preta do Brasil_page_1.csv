1,1,Disgusting rightwing propaganda,Marv74br,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLike all 'documentaries' by Brasil Paralelo, it's awful, disgusting rightwing propaganda, This piece in particular tries to imply the fault of the company bankruptcy on the leftwing government of the worker's party (PT), simply because they had not the sense of felling the changes of time and insisted on an unsustainable business model based on top class elitist services. It's not the place for any government to save private companies, but even so it was tried to save hundreds of jobs, but this disgusting film tries to blame the leftwing government for the lack of professionalism of the Varig company.",True

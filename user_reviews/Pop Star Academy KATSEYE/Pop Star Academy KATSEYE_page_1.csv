1,7,Entertaining but oh so problematic,filip_m91,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI want to start out by saying that Son (unlikely but I hope he sees this), is so unnecessarily mean and harsh. He makes me want to egg his house to put it VERY lightly.As for Nikky Paramo - for someone who preaches about attitude, hers is pretty gosh darn garbage. It makes me want to egg her house too. The scene where she criticises Hinari shows her complete lack of pedagogical sense. It's honestly gross to watch. It's one thing not to mince your words, it's another to deliver criticism like a train wreck. It just goes to show that being good at something doesn't automatically make you a good teacher. She can dance, but her teaching is a piece of work.Anyway, it was an entertaining watch overall, but the lack of sincerity and clarity on what was happening was so problematic for so many reasons. My heart broke many times for the girls, and I wish them all a beautiful future, and I hope this experience hasn't left lasting trauma because although I'm only looking from the outside, 14 year old me would not have managed an environment like this.One of the things they did well was implement a therapist to manage the girl's stress and anxiety (Props to you Dr. Wetter!). But that should have been there from the start. Whoever managed this project needs to get schooled on project management before they're EVER allowed to manage a project of this size again, especially if it involves young and impressionable girls.",True
2,7,Wrong people eliminated,theprincessrose,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was an entertaining documentary detailing the long and sometimes cruel process of training to qualify for a hybrid English-speaking k-pop girl group. It's a shame that the final results did not include several of the girls with the most natural talent or hard work and dedication. It was most disappointing to see Adela, Emily and Iliya go home. Hopefully, they band together and form their own group or create successful solo careers.It will be interesting to see if Katseye succeeds as a recording group... they will certainly get a big boost with the global Netflix series. Wishing best of luck to the girls that made the team, and hope their music continues to focus on women's empowerment.",True
3,7,Dystopian but Entertaining,melissamariekrall,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a huge fan of sports documentaries, especially dance-related, so this felt like it was right up my alley. And it was, up until it switched to a survival show. There's a cruelty to this show. Tearing these (very) young women down and pitting them against each other, engineering drama for the plot. We know all reality shows do it, but there was something disturbing about it being so laid out by the so called ""executives"" in such a stark and honest manner. It felt like they fed into the worst parts of the audience and human nature, while these girl's lives and dreams hung in the balance. Overall, it's an entertaining but somewhat dystopian show. It reads less like Making the Band and more like Black Mirror at certain points. None of this should take away from the participants, who are all clearly very talented. I loved watching their progression throughout the series and found their dedication to be inspiring.",True
4,7,Season 1,Martin_Pyramid,n/a,16/08/2025,"I prefer survival/talent reality shows when they focus on the hard work of their participant so this one really hits the spot. There's a refreshing lack of drama but a huge focus on how difficult and full of sacrifice the K-pop Industry is. It does feel unfair sometimes since the participants are really young and were clearly not prepared for how difficult it would be. I would still appreciate more complete performances, it was always like a teaser of them and I have no interest in checking the full performance on the internet.I appreciate how honest the production was there, they told you right on camera that if they did this is because it would work well with the audience even if it seemed unfair.Speaking of production some of the managers always looked like on the edge of a burn-out, they don't really talk about that but you can feel how tiresome it was for the multiple managers there.I won't follow the final band, K-pop is not my thing but they definitely deserve a career for their talent and dedication.",False
5,6,Amazing training opportunity,tomwatts-52260,n/a,16/08/2025,"I marveled at what an amazing training opportunity this was for the tremendously talented girls aspiring to be professional entertainers. 1-2 years of coaching every day by the industry's best. Seeing how the coaches polished the participants who already had natural talent, and in most cases, many years of training already reminded me of the many levels between better and best.Is it good television? It is a documentary of two major entertainment companies investing in a project with potential billion dollar returns. Every decision made is a business decision, with the girls as business inputs. Nevertheless, I appreciated getting to know the trainees.Some of my favorites did not get chosen in the end. Good luck to both those who made it in the group and to the ones who didn't make it, who no doubt will go on to successful careers in the entertainment industry.",False
6,9,Competitive Popstar Competition,myoung-41961,n/a,16/08/2025,"Redundant title, but that's the point. Watch it if you like reality tv, competition shows, cliffhangers, and twists.The show has a very unique perspective. I came into the show after I discovered Katseye. I personally loved building a deeper appreciation for the newly formed group.Some aspects were slow. The competition itself does not start until episode 5, and the first 4 episodes consist of the training before the competition starts. This makes you build a connection with the girls that have been there at the beginning of the bootcamp.I've only watched singing competitions; I like this more. It takes a lot of dedication and hard work to be in a girl group and this shows that hard work. The show also displays how dedication and hard work are the basics. There are 5 categories to consider such as Dancing, Singing, and Star Quality. This becomes more prevalent when the girls start to compete against each other. Unfortunately, the girls don't really understand until the competition really starts.Is it cruel? Maybe, but the audience needs to decide it for themselves. The twists may push some girls over the edge. I was on the edge of my seat due to twists and cliffhangers. Despite knowing who makes the group I did have the occasional trainee that I was secretly rooting for. You'll never see the twists coming.Just like any competition/reality show, there's gonna be drama. It's easy to pick a side but every result has an underlying reason.Overall:
I liked the perspective and execution of the show. In the end, despite already knowing the results, I was crying for one of my favs that didn't get in. It really takes you through all of the emotions and perspectives, so if you feel a certain way then this show did its thing. I wasn't planning on crying but the music and timing really had me crying then happy for all of my favorites. If I could rank on making me feel something alone it would be a 10/10. However, the show is slow. I think it's valid to criticize the show for not telling the trainees it was as a competition show until the 5th episode. Then I go back to loving how intentional every aspect of the show was. I really only removed 1 star because I wish episode 1 started with the competition versus the very beginning of this training bootcamp. The title of the show is accurate, but I wish it was just ""PopStar Competition"". Or, ""Popstar Academy to Competition"", which is wordy but is more accurate to the show. Instead it focused on the origins on Katseye. It's easy to be confused by the rules for each mission but I recommend making sure you understand the rules before watching the elimination rounds or you might find things unfair. Again, everything is intentional.Shoutout to the Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­",False
7,7,Solid reality,JonyVeana,n/a,16/08/2025,"All 20 girls are so talented and Im sur everything's is going to work for them, overall the show is engaging and fun to watch and the performances and the music isa plus.Its a shame everything that's happening with Hybe and i hope everyone can be happy, including the newjeans girls, the 6 winners are definitely amazing with Lexy for me they were the most all rounder girls in the whole survival show.The final girls are going to go big im sure because we the people were the one who choose them and we are kinda experts in kpop after years if listening music and watching the choreography so we choose well.",False
8,7,"Wild finalle, poor sick talent woman great push through",UltraNeptuneCat,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMonae, or however you spell it, wish she didnt stay. Im glad she straightened up and I dont actively hate her outside of the show but. She was arrogant like they said because she had some natural talent that she didnt really sharpen till the end.I think the girl who really pushed toward the end when she was sick, great work that was so challenging especially when you get covid.You get a lot of depth, and rules and what happens in training for these groups, and while its a little bit saturated of a market and this is part of their stradgie get more eyes on their group keep them going, its just really cool to know in general.All these group members were so talented, and im crushed abele was voted out. The voters got limited vision and if they saw everything in this documentry they would of voted the right people out. Fun fact now, this group is still going and did a song or something related to monster high latest media.",True
9,2,LOVE THE CONTESTANTS! HATE THE MAKERS!,jules000,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love seeing al the contestants be so nice to each other and form deep relationships, they all worked soooo hard!!! Huge respect!Hated the fact that all these lovely people did not know what they signed up for and got lied to by the makers of the showThe makers said things like, fans want drama and the show needs itNO WE DON'T WANT DRAMA!!! WE WANT TO SEE GIRLS FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS, HYPING EACH OTHER UP, HELPING EACH OTHER, they did exactly that, But the makers ruined itThis show missed the mark, it wasted it's own potential by choice, could have been a great launce for a new gil band!!!",False
10,1,Social Experiment,tpceebee,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taking young girls, lying to them, manipulating them and overworking them is crazy twisted. This does NOT paint the label or the executives that approved this project in a good light. Towards the end felt like the teachers were trying their best to damage-control the girls' mental healths in the face of the horrible executive decision-making. Feels like I'm watching some kind of twisted social experiment - barely feels legal to treat anyone like this, let alone under 18's. I didn't care at all about who ended up in the group by the end and just felt bad all round for all of the girls that were subjected to 2 YEARS of this. This is a lesson on how NOT to build a lasting global pop group.",False
11,2,2 Years of Deceit,Tron79,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI felt angry (spoilers coming).I agreed with Lexie who quit when she realized this wasn't what she signed up for. It started with recruiting 20 girls to train and compete to become the next KPOP girl band. They would be trained by some of the same people who trained and created the famed BTS KPOP boy band. The girls jumped at the opportunity to be trained by the best dance instructors and vocal coaches. What they didn't realize was that the training would take 2 years and at the end they would have to compete against each other in a survival show where fan votes would count more than their instructors' votes. They didn't realize that their nationalities would count more to the fans than their talent or dedication.One of the values of the KPOP training was to learn how to work together as a team and to support each other. That's why Lexie was devasted as the showrunners began pitting the girls against each other to get more viewers on the survival show. They asked the girls who they thought would be in their top 6 and who they would choose to be with them in the band. Many of the girls had been living together for two years and became family. I felt angry that the showrunners didn't realize or didn't care about the girls' emotional wellbeing, and they cared more about getting viewers for the survival show. In one sense, it seemed like they cared about their mental health since they had a staff psychologist, but on the other hand, they only cared about getting viewers. It was hard to watch the girls' confidence get torn away once the survival show began. Up to that point, I thought it would have been a positive experience for the girls getting feedback from the experts and improving their skills. But once the showrunners decided to have the girls tell them who they would choose to be in their top 6, that was the last straw for Lexie. At least one of the girls didn't get any votes from her friends. What made things worse, and Lexie said this part too, was that the results were read by a faceless black hole on a TV screen. It was heartless.The showrunners were manipulating us to care for Emily and feel horrible when she wasn't picked at the end. That part worked. I felt horrible that Emily wasn't picked. I felt horrible when they started the fan voting and she was judged for her looks and her Texas accent. She was one of the originals who gave up two years of her life for the project. She was always the number one dancer according to the judge's evaluations, and she was the most improved singer. ""Say Emily, say Emily"" could be heard from her dance mentors in the audience right before the final reveal. I feel bad that she couldn't work as a dancer during those two years and she was deceived about the true purpose that she would be a contestant in a survival show.I was left not caring about the six who were picked for the Katseye girl group. I agreed with one of the KPOP execs who had second thoughts about letting the fans choose the band members.",True
12,3,Pop Machine at its worst,morphologipy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I get the feeling that the makers of this show had the intention of creating a buzz around the formation of the next big girl group. Instead, I've watched a social experiment where teenage girls are subjected to harsh regimes, criticisms, and anxiety, all in the name of being famous and making some producers a lot of money. I appreciate that pop stars have to deal with a lot in their careers, but this really shows the shallow and ugly side of the music industry. I would say it's worth a watch just to understand the pop music industry more (read ""don't let your children get involved""), but it won't be as entertaining as you might hope. The only saving grace is how nice it is that the girls support one another.",False
13,1,All that work for a beauty contest,alexandra_stamate,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe series is eye-opening (no pun intended) for the work & efforts done by artists in pop music. Unfortunately the format is focused more on generating social media engagement than actually rewarding talented people. The result: the worst performing and laziest contestant gets in the final group because she's a pretty face, totally spoiling and corrupting the rest of the (actually talented) finalists.It's a frustrating to watch documentary-contest. It tries to send messages of friendship and ""hard work makes your dreams come true"". However, everything is edited, fake and sanitised. Thus, leaves a sour taste of seeing a lot of passionate & hard working instructors and participants exploited to promote a clickbait influencer.",True
14,3,Cruel & Lazy TV,blitheblythe,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series amounts to an 8 episode advertisement for a new global K-Pop band. The documentary makers retain some integrity for not shying away completely from the cruelty of the process the girls were put through, but ultimately they seem to have made several editorial decisions intended to soften those cruel edges.The filmmakers can't be blamed for the awful management of the project at the heart of the show, but you do detect a deliberate decision to refrain from tarnishing the image of HYBE and Geffen Records too much (the music megacorps behind what can only be describe as an extended theatre of cruelty performance), lest Netflix not be invited back for another season.The show follows an international group of very young women (14-21), as they're put through a two year training camp for what they think will be an internal selection process by the record label to create a new 'global' k-pop group, only to discover that they've signed up to a 'survivor show' at the end of it to decide the final members of the band. A 'survivor show' is the K-Pop version of the old TV pop talent shows from the west like 'Popstars' franchise - but conspicously more sinister.Many of the girls come from clearly disenfranchised backgrounds (including one girl who is a refugee), however little is made of this by the producers, who give everyone's backstory a few glossy unsentimental minutes. Only one of the girls gets a huge amount of backstory - and even then it's all very superficial.Nothing is explained in regards to income for the girls, we don't know if they're being paid during this years long process (some of the girls mention having no money as they pack their hopes and dreams into suitcases after being ejected from the program).We also never linger over what these very young girls are giving up to be here, one girl mentions taking her place as a trainee has prevented her from graduating high school - but this is treated as nothing more than a funny anecdote, and no further enquiries are made.Equally, a discussion between the girls about being away from home - in which one girl admits not being able to speak to her family for weeks - simply drifts by onscreen, unexplored.Perhaps the most obvious of these attempts to shield HYBE and Geffen Records from public scrutiny regarding the cruelty of the process, comes at the expense of what would otherwise be a rather critical scene for a show like this.Once the girls have made it to the 'public' survivor show part of the process, they take part in three elimination rounds which are judged partially (and it is only very partially) by members of the public.The elimination scene for the first round is heartbreaking, the second elimination scene is harrowing, and the third elimination scene was presumably so brazenly vicious that it's given the 'off screen death' treatment, where we skip from the girls arriving to hear whether or not they've wasted the last two years of their girlhood from a disembodied voice on a television screen, to a montage of the survivors tearfully calling their loved ones to report their Kpop dreams are still alive - giving strong disaster survivor vibes.Yet there is a slightly less obvious, but none the less very telling detail in the documentary that belies the filmmakers obedience to the HYBE/Geffen machine - the lack of follow up.Unlike other Netflix shows following a bunch of kids as they try to achieve their dreams in time limited settings (Cheer competitions, Basketball finals, Football drafts) - after the final 6 have been picked, and the credits start to roll - we do not get the usual 'where are they now' pre-credit closure snippets of the one's who didn't make it on the show. Indeed, it seems, that like the rest of the whole show, the ending is an exercise in minimisation and distraction - nudging the audience not to think about the brutality of the process, rather to just enjoy the shiny happy teens who've emerged victorious from a process none of them fully understood they were consenting to when they skipped over the small print in their application forms.The access the producers had for the documentary could have been used for that most noble of documentary pursuits - making tangible change in the world. It would have taken barely any effort to turn their footage into an expose that could have led to mass calls for reform in an industry that consistently exploits minors.Instead, hemmed in buy cowardice and perhaps corporate interest too, the filmmakers leave their audience with an uneasy sense of being complicit in an extended episode of emotional and financial abuse - without our concent, much like the girls featured in the show.",False
15,3,Nightmare Academy,Lamborghini_Mercy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI went into this show not having any knowledge of what it was about. I just randomly put it on thinking I wouldn't pay attention. I was wrong.The show started off hopeful and warming. It seemed like everyone really cared for the girls and you could tell that the girls had a great bond. They worked really hard and the teachers tried to give them their best advice. I loved this concept. But then I thought...what's the catch?Then the true nature of the show was revealed with...(Spoilers)...the girls had no idea they were in a survival show. THEN they lied to the girls to get information from them and turn them against each other for ratings. The producer even came on to admit to this. The way they treated those girls once the competition started was ruthless. Luckily one girl had the intelligence to just leave on her own. I wish they would have all left tbh.Manon is a plant or someone is sponsoring her. She had all the best outfits and stages. And she was always the lead. Why? She missed so many practices and gets to stay home but somehow gets a spot in the group that belonged to another girl who worked 10 times harder from day 1.There are many other concerning things about the show that makes me wonder how no one sued them yet or was even able to be released on Netflix. I thought the show came out 15 years ago cause of how crappy the producers are but it seems like we still haven't moved on from horrible shows like Making the Band.I loved all the girls...not so much Manon...cause they were so dedicated, supportive and kind. I would watch a show about these girls helping each other achieve their dreams. No forced drama needed.",True
16,5,Scary stuff,pwinding,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is John Marrs' Family experiment in reality. So freaking scary and upsetting. I know that this is not a new thing in Korea, but that does not make it any less freaked out.A testimony to the extreme capitalism we're in right now.As we're no longer happy with adults doing weird stuff on tv, we now need young girls selling overly sexualised behaviour on screen. Which is astounding but also kind of spooky, as they become a commodity while also something young girls across the globe aspire to copying.On the show, the girls all have language for emotions they have, without the actual knowledge of those emotions, as they're too young and influenced by social media to do other than copy what they hear online. It's not their fault; it's what they've learnt. And they need to know in order to be on this kind of show. So all in all, the reality show taken to an extreme, now with teenagers in the main cast.Is that really the best humanity can do?",False
17,1,BOOMERS BEING MEAN TO TEEN GIRLS,CritiqueEtiquette,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI thought we passed this cruel part of the TV and we are. I was scared of this happening. Money can't buy humanity and these people who created this project are what's wrong with the industry. People do so much to change the toxicity and Netflix is allowing this show to promote this inhuman experience.I loved seeing them happy, passionate, talented, so colorful and cheerful (at first) then the drama, "" did you see the views "" , the lying about being this a survival show! How is this even ethical. Girl's singing and dancing while injured sick and vomiting... And they try to make this sound like WE want this? WE don't. If they didn't make the group they were saved. Yes dances are nice, the girls are pretty but I don't and won't support this show or the group. I am very disappointed.",True
18,1,SADISTIC SADISTIC SADISTIC,mywm-26385,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTrash sadistic show. I don't know if HYBE thinks that thinks this is going to help their reputation but its the complete opposite. This sadistic show makes me NOT want to support Katseye, BTS or ANY groups under HYBE. They lie and manipulate poor innocent young girls and pit them against each other in the guise that they ""love"" and ""care"" about them. They let the girls think that they will be judge based on merit and let them be friends for A FULL YEAR, then surprised them with a survival show that forces them to turn against each other. It's literally giving Hunger Games with Mitra being President Snow. Someone should investigate HYBE & Greffen for mental and psychological abuse ðŸ–•",True
19,3,Be Careful What You Wish For,SusanLervold,n/a,16/08/2025,"A group of talented but naive hopefuls from around the world consent to giving away up to two years of their life to a multinational music conglomeration intent on melding them into an international, cohesive, KPop-style girl group. Though contracts and NDAs were signed by all, apparently not a single participant bothered to have an attorney look over the contracts or have them explained. Apparently, they each took the promise of, ""Baby, I'm gonna make you a STAR!"" at face value and didn't consider the potential price that each would have to pay. Have they never been taught that ""All that glitters is not gold,"" or the clear winner when you make a deal to ""sell your soul""?Besides the giant spiderweb these ingenues become ensnared within, I was immediately struck by the lack of professionalism of (what I call) ""the camp counselors"", particularly the woman in charge, who actually wept with emotion when speaking to the initial group of 14 hopefuls. Her way of speaking, with many of her declarations/statements are made with an upturn at the end, making each sound like questions. Her manner of presents herself in frumpy clothes, slumped posture, and offering little eye contact when communicating, doesn't inspire confidence in her abilities or authority, either. Her sister, the professional dancer (the ""fiery"" one), is far more self-assured and confident, and she deals with the girls with authority and clear(er) expectations.We're given few details about the girls other than some carefully-curated backstories. For example, which girls are homesick? Is school provided for the minors? Which girls are with ""guardians""/parents and which ones are in the house? What does a typical day look like: how many hours spent dancing? Singing? Presenting? Have the girls been instructed on cultivating a unique persona? How disciplined is each girl, really? How reliable? How many dance routines did they have to learn? How do they afford to go out? Who pays for personal grooming? What about conflict amongst the participants? Feelings of jealousy? I can't be the only viewer alarmed by the story told by one of the younger girls' ""guardian"", which goes something like this: While lurking around a random performance event (a pageant or dance recital), she happened across a most charismatic and talented child of about 6 or 7 years old, whom, she was convinced, could become a star, but only under her own tutelage and Hollywood connections. Somehow, this fairy godmother convinced the child's parent/s to sign over guardianship and move her to Hollywood. We're never told what the fairy godmother was getting out of the deal (other than unfettered access to a young child, obviously), nor when her (skeevy) partner came into the picture. If *I* want to know details like this, others do, too.I also take issue with the editing (which, granted, must have been a monumental task): each episode covers such huge gaps in time that it's difficult for the viewer to know where we are in the story. For example: how did a foot fracture heal in the blink of an eye? What did the injured do during the six weeks+ of recovery: practice her voice for the entire six weeks? How on earth did she catch up with the dance routines? Did she receive physical therapy? Who paid the medical bill? I can't imagine you can get out of a boot and be back to new, let alone start back with daily training in heels.While I fully appreciate the immense talent and importance of dancers, singers, athletes, and other performers, making this one's profession is usually folly. What percentage of dancers can support themselves without help? There is simply too much talent and too few opportunities in a field where you're a single injury away from catastrophic failure. Even if you're one of the ""lucky ones"" who escape an acute/devastating injury, the toll dancing/sport takes on a body can't be overstated. We only get one. In professions where the competition is so extreme, corruption is bound to occur; how can it possibly be otherwise? Also, the career lifespan of a dancer is self-limiting: how many professional dancers are there over the age of, say, 35?I couldn't help compare this show with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders (DCC) documentary: as weird and culty the DCC seem to be, I was endlessly impressed by the level of excellence, professionalism, and commitment displayed by every participant of the DCC, from top to bottom. In contrast, ""The Making of a Pop Star"" (MPS) feels like Amateur Hour, like no one really knows what they're doing (save the Chairman and the recording expert). Like the DCC, the MPS participants work around the clock with no days off, and for a pittance, if anything. In both cases, riches are never promised, only fame.In situations like MPS or DCC, the ONLY people who stand to profit are the producers at the top: the performers are truly nothing more than dancing monkeys, performing not even for riches, but merely for the promise of fame. Talk about a deal with the devil! Fame neither fills your belly nor keeps you warm at night; it's both fleeting AND a double-edged sword. Did no one warn these girls?",False
20,4,Genral Spoilers - Behind the Scenes Look on Creating a Girl group,hope-08916,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHello,I loved watching the stories of young ladies pursue their dreams. However, this Netflix series seemed so rigged because it showcased that the company's dream of a diverse group of ladies was not highly based upon talent level and work ethic. To be in the group, what you look like mattered the most (star quality) and the fan base you could bring in (utilized the public via a public voting system) because the company had to think about sales. That was the concluding reality of this series which is a huge blow on the mental health and self-esteem of many young ladies wanting to become a pop star. This series offers the viewpoint on how the music industry can make decisions to hire talent, and it's a bittersweet enjoyment at the end of the day. Would not watch again, but highly recommend to other young girls who THINK they would want to become a star.",True
21,3,Making the Band knockoff,quieria,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was excited thinking it would be like Making the Band or Posters (which formed Eden's Crush) and it was a disappointment from the beginning. The ""experiment"" was off from the outset. The casting is like a year long process, but they don't tell the contestants about the show until months into the process. The judges/trainers were condescending. The eliminating of Naisha for sharing a song with her close friends which consisted only of other contestants was foolishness. I think they thought it would make great TV...wrong! I l skipped episodes 4-7 and just watched episode 8 to see how the train wreck ended.",True
22,5,"Wonderful young people, highly questionable adults",scopesclare,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm up to the episode where it is discovered the wonderful young people have violated the NDA and have gone ahead and, shock horror, posted stuff on Instagram (to a private group consisting of the trainees in the cult - I mean, K-pop group...)This has greatly upset the management, who are absolutely horrified that one of their original songs has leaked out to the public, thereby ruining the hype, which will apparently lead to the bands success. The hype, not the talent, or for the leaked song, but the hype.Which tells you a lot about this outfit. This is the same episode where a number of the lucky trainees are invited to go to the studio and record vocals. Some of them do quite a good job. Not a professional job by any means, but they're pretty good job for young people who have only had a little bit of training. Singing is not an easy thing to do. Professional singers might offended that these young people can go into a studio and be told that they doing a great job by professionals in the industry. Of course they'll come out sounding just fine thanks to auto tune and smoke and mirrors.We all know that these groups are not about the singing. They are about image. Beautiful young people expressing the fantasies of adults who know what sells. Every month a fat overweight man comes in and says who is good who is not. It's revolting. The trainees are told next to nothing about the schedule, about what's gonna happen next, how long they are going to be there, who is going home, how many people are going home? Why, after six months, are there still 20 trainees still remaining? Surely after all this time they could have whittled the field down to six??But little do these poor people realise, they have just wasted a whole lot of time for nothing. They are being left to hang around so that they can participate in an elimination made for TV, a survivor-like competition where apparently the viewers get to choose. Surely this is something each of the trainees should be aware of from the very beginning? And are they being compensated for their time in any way?",True
23,1,Could have been great,mrgnnaz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was in it for the dream chasing, camaraderie, and character development, but this went way too far into cruel social experiment once it turned into an elimination show. Didn't add any entertainment value and totally broke the immersion.I liked the overall concept, because it is a type of behind the scenes and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many people. You can have drama without psychological warfare on underage and barely legal performers if you don't let the board members write the script. The executives are out of touch with reality and at this point I'm only watching for completion.",False
24,1,Demoralizing and depressing,AmberW-00,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe most demoralizing show I've watched in a long long time. The message of this long long story was this: Sure, you CAN show up early with a great attitude to put in 200% effort every day for 2 years, break your body and keep going. We will still pick someone who shows up 70% of the time with a bad attitude over you because some vapid 20-something thought they were prettier. The way that Dream Academy/HYBE/Geffen played with this women, lied to and manipulated them was not only immoral but I felt gross watching it. I really hope that all of the girls/women recruited into this get long-term support and advocacy for their future healing, growth and success in life. The way they used these women for their own pursuit in fame, even using singing performances in later episodes after throwing these women out on the streets... it's not okay, and people NEED to see that!",True
25,1,How is Netflix getting away with this,gingersnaps_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAnyone looking at this as anything other than sadistic is out of their gourd. These girls and young women were lied to and manipulated for two years. They had no idea that the ""pop star bootcamp"" they were attending was actually a competition show. Are we kidding? Who signed off on this? We are so quick to excuse these bouts of psychological torture as an ""experiment"" and forget that these are actual people on our screens. If the producers wanted a pop star competition show then do that! Adding the twist was incredibly cruel, unnecessary, and blatantly proved that they will do anything for money.",True

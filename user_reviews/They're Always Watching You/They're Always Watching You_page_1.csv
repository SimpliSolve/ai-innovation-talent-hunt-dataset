1,3,Interesting and bonkers.,jmartinxx2,n/a,15/08/2025,Not what I was expecting. This is a documentary about supernatural creatures called the Krepid. A mix of Unsolved Mysteries and Book of Secrets. The show states that these Krepids have always been in our history and called Earth home before humans. It's an interesting story but I don't believe a word of it. According to the show that is probably for the best since if you find out about them they eat you.,False
2,8,Forbidden knowledge.,manipulle,n/a,15/08/2025,Conspiracy shows with forbidden knowledge have always interested me and these Krepid creatures are scary as h*ll. If you know about them they can kill you. That would explain why there's not much known about them.,False

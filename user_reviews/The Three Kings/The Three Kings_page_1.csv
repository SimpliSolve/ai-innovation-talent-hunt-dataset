1,8,Golden Age of Football,csm-78119,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ironically I watched this documentary on the night that some of the richest clubs in Europe threatened to break away to form a superleague founded on pure greed and self interest. This film took me back to when the passion for football was at its highest in the British Isles and provided a way for the average person to ""escape"" their troubles for 90 minutes a week and gave the likes of these 3 giants their own means of escape from a life working underground in the local pit. Just listening to any of these 3 in the old tv footage is a delight. There is passion, intelligence and wisdom in abundance here and each of them laid the foundations for the wonderful success that followed for each of their clubs. As a Preston fan I've always had a soft spot for Shankly, his integrity, passion and wit shines brightly. The foundations he laid at Liverpool which were later built upon by Bob Paisley meant that Liverpool were the dominant force in the English game for a long time. Matt Busby's achievements at Man Utd were incredible in crafting a number of exceptional teams over many years and doing all of that despite the most tragic of circumstances. Then add to that mix the legendary Jock Stein who built a European cup winning team made up of players who were all born within a radius of 30 miles! The football achievements of each of them speak for themselves but this film shines a light on the qualities of each as individuals and all three come across as thoroughly decent and impressive characters. Football needs some decency and integrity more than ever now if it's going to survive!",False
2,8,Three Cheers,stewpmca,n/a,16/08/2025,"Owen's film engages you immediately. It highlights the contribution football made to communities struggling in post war Britain, casting back for some to the halcyon days of British football, the unison of support and the teams they passionately followed.Focusing on three iconic individuals who originated from similar working class communities in Scotland only a few miles apart in Lanarkshire and Ayrshire, Owen encapsulates the lasting impact these men had on the clubs they managed and the legacy those clubs enjoy today with following around the world.Busby, Stein and Shankly may have adopted different coaching methods but this film shows they shared values of hard work ethics and togetherness that was common in their humble beginnings. The film successfully uses footage linking the adoration the supporters gave to these icons, shows passionate success and reflects on the personal cost to each manager.
The legacy left is ever present at the clubs they managed.Today the riches on offer to a select few leagues has changed football forever. Owen's film is a testament to the impact three individuals made to the modern game and can ensure soccer's new generation of followers are mindful of the contribution these great men made to the beautiful game.",False

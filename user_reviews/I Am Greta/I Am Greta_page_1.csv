1,8,One of the better documentaries I've watched in recent years.,greg-goremykin,n/a,16/08/2025,"My favourite part of this film is that it reserved judgment one way or another about the subject that they were covering so intimately, which must have been quite a tight-rope to walk, but they succeeding in this perfectly.I don't usually comment on others' reviews, but I have to add that I suspect the vast majority of people giving this a 1/10 (a 1? Those aren't serious votes or Leni Riefenstahl's films would all get 1/10 if the only merit measured is the popularity of the subject matter, come on now) I would bet my left arm never watched this film at all, at most they have read synopses of parts some alt-right website found a hair to split with on Facebook or 8chan or wherever, and are basing their votes purely based on what their particular political cult tells them is bad or good.So don't heed the low rating this gets on IMDb, this really is an emotionally engaging and insight film no matter whether you are someone who even doesn't believe man-made climate change is real. I watched this with one guy, an Engineer, who thinks climate change is actually due to environmental encroachment. the other one a QAnon-believing III%er, and we talked about the film for a good two hours afterward, which I think is a sign of a successful film in my books.",False
2,9,Polaricing Persona...,Xstal,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's disturbing that so much vitriol and hate can be targeted at a young woman whose only wish is for the governments of the world to recognise the overwhelming evidence that supports climate change and for them to do something about it before it's too late (assuming it's not too late already). Conversely, it's refreshing and inspiring to know that a young woman has been able to mobilise such a strong and powerful force to fight against the intransigence and/or misinformation pedalled primarily by biased middle aged and older men; although this is primarily a documentary about a person and not a movement. That person is trying to change the world for the better and, with the help, support and vision of the youth of today (and a few others), let's wish her success in her crusade against greed, corruption and ignorance while joining her in the fight for our survival!",False
3,9,This is not about science,martijnrhijnsburger,n/a,16/08/2025,Your rating on imdb should be about if you liked the documentary and not if you believe in what Greta stands for.'I am Greta' is a beautiful portret how one small girl started a movement. The sequence of her public speeches she has written herself shows what an exceptionally gifted person she is. And how the world leaders have no idea how to react to that. The film also zooms in on her vulnerable sides as a result of the immense pressure on her shoulders.I really enjoyed watching it and had a lump in my throat during a big part of it.,False
4,10,A Great Doc About A Remarkable Person,DavoZed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ignore all of the reviews here by the flat earth, climate deniers. Imagine being an adult and having nothing better to do than come on a movie site and LIE about a movie you haven't even seen.The movie follows Greta from her earliest time in front of the Swedish parliament, through all of her events in Europe to her speech at the UN. You are given a front row seat at the events but also a backstage pass, as she travels to the events, works on her speeches and struggles with the burden put on her as a teenager.And the way I know that the flat earth folks haven't seen the movie ? Greta writes her own speeches with little or no input from anyone. There is NO ONE whispering in her ear or handing her something to read. And when short comments are called for, she delivers them off the cuff, like someone who has done it all her life.A great doc about a remarkable person. A shame that so much hate is shown to someone who is a true leader in our very screwed up world.Update - 9 of 24 people who read my review liked it. I am going to suggest that the other 15 haven't even seen the film. They are just here trolling anything Greta.These people are a sad waste of skin.",False

Amazing movie, the way she discribes the world of rich and powerful people as a weird moviescene. Puppets playing a weird theater.

6,6,Climate change must be taken seriously.,noahgibbobaker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Last night it was so refreshing to be back at the cinema for the first time in a few months. It was a good cinema experience as well, only a few people went to the movie and none of them thought it was a good idea to text or be annoying in general, I have one complaint though, I hate leather seats so after about an hour my bum was really sweaty and uncomfortable no matter what position I was sitting in. Besides that I don't have any major issues with I am Greta.Greta Thunberg is a really interesting person I wanted to learn more about before going into this documentary. By the end I got everything I wanted out of a documentary like this one and more. I knew she had Aspergers but I didn't know about her struggles with anxiety, depression or selective mutism, I can only applaud her for doing so much public speaking and pushing past all of these things knowing that nobody else is going to stand up for what is right. If you think these ""disabilities"" mean that Greta should not be taken seriously then you are an idiot. Often times people with aspergers have very high intelligence, great verbal skills, ability to absorb and retain large amount of information, ability to think in visual images, be very self motivated, ability to think outside the box and generate novel solutions to problems (like climate change) and might show a strong aptitude for a particular topic. The list goes on.The presentation was a bit bland and some of the shot composition made it tough to know what was happening in only a couple of scenes. But I understand that when filming a documentary often you can't get the ideal shots and have to work with what you have. I also thought that the one soundtrack song was really out of place and was very unnecessary, the score was fairly generic but it was effective. I would have liked to see more of her internal struggle before attending the protests and I would have liked to see more of how it was to travel on a boat for 15 straight days as well.My favourite part of the entire experience was exposing many world leaders for being phony and not listening to what Greta and the thousands of protestors from around the world are saying. A lot of the current world leaders simply refuse climate change calling it a hoax and saying that the science is faked, or they just aren't acknowledging that it is a crisis. This is so ridiculously arrogant or just stupid, either way do we want anyone like that in charge of our country?Climate is a colossal issue that absolutely has to be acted on soon or there will be no future. If you refuse climate change or think that because Greta has asperger syndrome, OCD and selective mutism she is uninformed and lying about this issue you don't deserve to be in the position you are in right now, all you are doing is destroying our planet without thinking of anyone but yourself, you are arrogant, uneducated, and selfish.",False

8,10,Genius,williamguilfoyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at Venice film festival. Was absolutely blown away. Wonderfully created, and Greta is the biggest inspiration we've seen on planet earth in such a young and spritely body.The children will save this world",False
9,7,An Inconvenient Truth,Cineanalyst,n/a,16/08/2025,"For many it was former U.S. Vice President Al Gore's slide-show presentation of a documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth"" (2006), Greta Thunberg cites a video she saw at school on polar bears endangered by the loss of sea ice from climate change, and for others it's been Thunberg's activism spotlighted in social media and for still others it very well could be ""I Am Greta"" that awakens them to the perils of global warming. Motion pictures are powerful that way. Such reflexive musings occasionally made by Thunberg--she also compares her travels and rise to fame to as if she were living in a movie-- aside, I didn't have high expectations for this documentary, as I'm not usually very interested in such cinematic lectures or celebrity profiles. That ""I Am Greta"" hasn't received stellar reviews, albeit more positive than not, from the sort of entertainment critics that tend to be predisposed to such material wasn't heartening, either. But, I like the observational approach of the camera here mixed with Thunberg's narration, and director Nathan Grossman got quite the scoop capturing the teenager's initially-solo school strike outside the Swedish parliament and building it up into a saga of the schoolgirl crisscrossing Europe, meeting world leaders and inspiring other children around the world, before ending with a climactic sea voyage across the Atlantic to admonish more politicians to their faces at the United Nations in New York.Thunberg says her activism isn't about her but rather about the issue of anthropogenic climate change, but Grossman is right to keep the focus on the star here, and she's adroit at exploiting--her, not her parents or whomever else, as is made clear in the documentary--her position as a Swedish child, including one with Asperger's, to do what no adult could really get away with--making being curt and passionate in her lecturing come across as inspirational and appealing to the paternal instincts of the supposed adults in the room. I mean, besides the ones who are despots or childish nincompoops, or both--your Bolsonaros, Putins, Trumps and Piers Morgans of the world. It's impressive how she's built a following and movement and has leveraged it to put pressure on leaders and figures who care about governing--the likes of Macron, Merkel, the Pope, even former governator Arnold Schwarzenegger. One of the common laments of ""I Am Greta"" seems to be that it won't convert anyone from the other side. Yet, in an age when science is denied for political reasons and others are demonized even when they're a teenager, that was never really a possibility. Thunberg has the right idea focusing on her peers who haven't yet grown into a feedback loop of confirmation bias, conspiracy theories and misinformation. The science here is established, so her role is to push her movement to galvanize the adults capable of accepting responsibility and scoff at the rest of them.The best exchange in the whole movie, though, is the first one. An old woman approaches Thunberg to reprimand her for not being in school, to which Thunberg retorts that there's no need for an education without a future. Two years later, at 17, she's already been more altruistic and influential in her career as a climate-change activist than whomever that old woman was or most of us ever will be. Even those who don't understand the greenhouse effect or comprehend the dangers of humanity's destruction of nature even while a resulting pandemic rages should be able to see the irony there.",False

11,7,Cringe when you watch the Macron small talk,kevin c,n/a,16/08/2025,"Post-Covid cinema return with Gertie.Slickly assembled, politely intrusive and sometimes affecting; I Am Greta fleshes out the eco-warrior and her supportive family. Greta herself quips ""a very surreal movie because the plot would be so unlikely.""Scenes between Greta and her omnipresent father are the most touching, particularly instances when he pleads her to make time in her gruelling schedule to eat (a banana). And of particular interest was Greta's uncomfortableness with the prospect of heightened media interest.It all concludes with the epic, horrendous sailing to New York. ""I don't want to have to do all this,"" she tearfully confides as waves crash against the hull. ""It's too much for me."" Greta is visible in her truest and most relatable form: a frightened young girl at the mercy of a natural world she hopes to protect, who simply wants to be at home with her dogs.",False

She realized she should not be the main figure and instead started asking people to research and, among all, read the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report.I know that part is boring, it is, but is also very important.I cannot strike enough how I didn't even knew what that was until she mentioned it, over and over again.

16,6,A favorable review ... but not for why you might think,take2docs,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a stereotype to think that all those who aren't with the 'ecochondriacs' are apathetic when it comes to environmental concerns, or in league with Big Oil fat cats. Not so. Look no further than Greenpeace co-founder Patrick Moore (whose latest book I'm presently reading), as a perfect example of this; a man who still cares deeply about ecology but who ended up having to leave the very organization he founded due to its becoming politicized/radicalized.With that said, unfavorable reviews or critical comments of this film ought not to be perceived over-simplistically, as necessarily the rantings of 'climate deniers' or any other knee-jerk, pigeon-holing term, for that matter.I think we can all agree that climate change exists and likely has since the planet was formed. Natural, cyclical fluctuations aside, where it starts getting debatable is when the anthropogenic factor is discussed and I, for one, feel one must always consider what ulterior motives or agenda, if any, someone has for advancing a dogmatic position as to this, one way or the other. There is a God. There is no God. Both views are capable of being held with an almost close-minded religious fervor.Onto the film. As I see it, there's no reason to pan it even if you're not on page with the climate doomsayers. I'm certainly not, but I did find the documentary quite interesting and entertaining, nevertheless.What little I knew and heard of Greta Thunberg prior to watching this is what made me want to see this film, more than anything else. She has been called a mascot for the environmental movement, and an unwitting pawn in a globalist plot to expand world government. (When the United Nations and the World Economic Forum are involved, it's enough to make you wonder.) We're told that her parents are or were in the entertainment business. I've also heard it said that Greta has claimed to possess the ability of being able to see carbon dioxide, if such a thing is even possible. I AM GRETA is quite watchable if viewed as a psychological/sociological study, if nothing else.Two things immediately caught my attention as I watched the film. 1) How extremely curious it is to see Greta being filmed while sitting in front of a parliament building during her very first strike *prior* to her becoming world famous. Think about that for a minute. 2) The very first sound one hears is that of howling wind.As to the first curiosity, there are those who think that Greta's (initial) strikes and her being discovered was not merely by accident or a coincidence, but something orchestrated and staged, and that what she has had to say in front of audiences has been for the most part scripted, possibly by handlers or her coach-like father.Secondly, as one goes about watching this film it isn't entirely clear whether this climate activist/climate alarmist is all in a dither over 'adult-made' global warming or 'adult-made' climate change. For example, there's a scene of Greta huddled alongside protesters outside of a government building, bundled up in bulky coat, scarf, and toque. Later in the film, Greta is shown with her father, standing on the deck of an ocean liner, almost being knocked over from the blustery wind and looking every but chilled to the bone. Then there is her transatlantic trip aboard a boat (a publicity stunt?), where once again she appears uncomfortably cold.There's no denying that Greta Thunberg is likable, however well-meaning albeit misguided one may think her to be in her cause. We learn from her father that she has a photographic memory when it comes to things that interest her, and yet at times she seems speechless whenever spontaneous questions are put to her by those she is seen in conversation with in the film. As for publicity and plaudits, Greta admits to not caring about being popular, despite the almost worshipful attention shown her by countless adoring fans who practically take to placing her atop a pedestal and making an idol out of her.Which brings me to the most unsettling aspect in all this, in my opinion. Namely, how quick this girl ends up becoming a global sensation, especially with myriad (impressionable) youth across the world. Child psychologists refer to something called primary narcissism, which is the idea that children, in general, are born self-centered and think the planet revolves around them. There are selfies and camera-centric footage aplenty, in this. Next you have a whole generation being roused and taking to the streets in protest, in no time at all. Whereas some might look at this as amazing and something to be admired, from a sociological standpoint it can come across as disturbing, as proof as to how easily groupthink and mob mentalities can be created. (Really, I thought I saw this or something similar to this in ""Occupy Unmasked,"" no?)That children can be made to believe almost anything at a young age is a well-known fact, from those who are religiously indoctrinated to believe their faith is the only true one to those who eagerly await Santa Clause or the Tooth Fairy. Knowing how malleable the minds of kids are, that there exists youngsters who can be shown chastising grown-ups, well, there is certainly something surreal and off about this. Who knows. Maybe one day in the future Greta will look back upon these early days and shake her head in disbelief.All in all, I AM GRETA is an intriguing viewing experience, regardless of where it is one stands on the whole climate change issue. I liked it enough that I watched it twice in the span of two days. Personally, the most enjoyable moments for me were watching Greta outside of her role as activist/alarmist, as in the scene that has her freestyle dancing in her pajamas, as if without a care in the world.",True
17,10,"Powerful, passionate, personal documentary",pssmidi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok, Greta is unique. There has never been anyone like her. This film follows her and her father on their journey to wake the leaders of the world from the climate coma. Extremely well photographed. Funny, personal, impressive, a bit sad and very touching.

18,6,Does Greta Thurnberg's Message Unite the Majority?,aspergian,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have always supported Greta Thurnberg's message. the climate crisis is a problem. The positives her is that the film highlights the hypocrisy of the world leaders in saying that they care about climate change, yet it is clear they treat Greta's message as a kind of interesting sideshow or spectacle for them to simply look as though they are listening and action is being taken. the film also sheds light on the narcissistic atmosphere of the political, cultural and religious elite as appearing to care about the issues she presents. However, these elites are simply going through the ""meet and greet"" formalities simply because (most likely) they are happy to associate with her to look as though they are on her side in order to enhance their own image.The film does show Greta's awareness that the media are seeking to portray her as the leader of the environmental leader who began 'schools strike for climate', a point she is seen to reject in the film when a reporter tells her this. It is unfortunate that in some cases among her supporters this is the case of treating her as some sort of environmental figurehead or heroine, particularly online, have the impact of producing the opposite result Greta had intended. The latter who support Greta Thurnberg for her identity are people who have, perhaps unwittingly, created a cult of personality around her, prioritising her identity over what she proposes to do to tackle the climate crisis.I will never forgive Thurnberg for spreading an ageist message that it is the fault of everyone of a certain age that the climate crisis is a problem that they and they alone have caused as opposed to the system as well as capitalism itself. She does in fact criticise the systemic problems but she is overly focused on uniting the youth as opposed to those outside the youth. She lacks the empathy/theory of mind that there are those on the fringes of society who are atomised and outsiders who find it difficult to even belong to any social grouping, let alone organise and join a movement. Her Aspergers or age should not excuse her of this as I have Aspergers myself and have the empathy to notice the difficulties associated with the outsiders that she seems to be unaware of.Greta is also too eager to valorise one segment of the population, the youth, as the ones who will provide the solution. Although she means well, divisive identity politics will NOT create any intergenerational solidarity in tackling the climate crisis in the long-term. The youth segment of the population are not a majority, therefore it is incumbent on people within environmental movements to include everyone instead of demonising older individuals that they don't even know.",False

And all those small-minded people who will criticize her for how she looks or that she has asperger syndrom or that she does that for fame only proof that Greta is right that they have learned nothing yet.

23,7,I Am Greta,jboothmillard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGlobal warming from rising CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes have increased dramatically in the last few centuries, it in an important issue that is slowly but surely becoming a worldwide crisis. One person has been catapulted onto the worldwide stage campaigning this climate emergency, I like many had seen bits and pieces of her on the news giving passionate speeches. I was fascinated to find out more about her, so I watched this documentary film, that follows her journey. In 2018, in Sweden, Greta Thunberg, a 15-year-old student who has Asperger's syndrome (a form of autism), started protesting in front of the Swedish parliament building, vowing to continue and not to attend school until the Swedish government met the carbon emissions target agreed by world leaders in Paris, in 2015. What started as a young girl sitting outside a building holding a sign (saying ""Skolstrejk för klimatet"", translated ""School strike for climate"") slowly built up, with other students joining her in her protest, and social media taking up her cause. Thunberg's activism evolved from solitary protesting to taking part in demonstrations throughout Europe, and then making several high-profile public speeches. Thunberg spoke in many political venues to hundreds and thousands of people. She has also met many famous and important figures of the world, including French President Emmanuel Macron, former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Pope Francis. In the film, it also shows how Thunberg has made changes to her life to make a point, including going vegan, using public transport rather than cars, and not flying, as planes use the most emissions. Thunberg's father Svante is with her throughout all these journeys and appearances, while many news and television broadcasts either criticised her efforts or supported her, agreeing that things need to change. Thunberg's biggest platform came in 2019 when she was invited to attend the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit. As she refused to fly, she sailed to North America, across the Atlantic Ocean from Plymouth, England, to New York, USA; the voyage lasted 15 days. The last scene of the film shows her most famous and passionate speech at the summit, in front of thousands of politicians, dignitaries, world leaders and many watching across the world. In her speech, she said: ""This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!"" The end credits show how Thunberg has had an impact to the climate change movement, including the Extinction Rebellion, and many mass protests across the world, demanding that governments and establishments make changes to save our planet. I personally have mixed opinions of Greta Thunberg, what she is doing does make people listen and she has good points, and considering her disability makes it all the more inspiring, but I can see why there are people that criticise her. With home videos of young Thunberg, insights into how she and her family reduced their carbon footprint, and lots of archive footage of her from television, this film is both politically and emotionally stirring. The story just speaks for itself with no need for people interviewed with their opinions, Greta Thunberg is a remarkable teenager who is sure to accomplish even more remarkable things in the years to come, and this is a must-see documentary. Very good!",True

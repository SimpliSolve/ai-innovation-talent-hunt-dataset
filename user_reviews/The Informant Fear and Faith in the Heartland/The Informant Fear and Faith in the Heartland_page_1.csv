1,10,Nothing What I thought It'd be.....much deeper & much better!,tarawieland-45562,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary puts immigration and the threat of domestic terrorism into a whole new light! This was so much deeper and meaningful than imagined it to be. More than anything, it shows us that we are all responsible for domestic tranquility and we each have the power to turn things around for the better! Let us love thy neighbor, and instill love and acceptance in our children to make our town, our state, our country, and our world a better place! In the end, we are all much more alike than we are different! Ultimately, do the right thing! Thank you for sharing this enlightening documentary!",False

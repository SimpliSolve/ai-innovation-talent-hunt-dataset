1,7,Rollercoaster Ride,normanrockswell,n/a,15/08/2025,"The interviews with Maple, Dr. Daks, and Ichabod are great, and reminiscent of some of the classic graffiti documentaries. They give insightful looks into the culture that remind you why graffiti is cool. Definitely where this doc shines the hardest.Other parts of the doc can feel like an anti-graffiti PSA. Theres a lot of runtime dedicated to explaining that trains are big and dangerous. There are some tragic examples, but it feels tedious.There's also a lot of time showcasing the relationship/life struggles of older-generation writers. Sad and real stuff, but most people aren't putting on a graff doc to hear about someones divorce. Conveying that being obsessed with trains isnt a turn-on doesn't really require 30 minutes of screentime.The beef segment is cringe beyond belief. Guess the doc needed some drama but talking about beating people up in a freight yard in front of your kids isn't a good look.There are several aspects of freight graffiti that are left out, and that would have been great in place of some of the other segments. Most obviously is that younger writers are almost entirely omitted, and in a documentary about a historically youth-driven culture, this feels like a missed opportunity. Interviews with younger writers to supplement the parts with the og's would have made this a more complete picture of freight graffiti, and given some fresh insight that hasn't already been well documented.Overall, its worth a watch, but might not deserve a spot on the shelf with the classics.",False
2,1,Trudging Like A Sloth,LizFifi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nothing ""Rolling"" here. It would have been nice to see some interviews of people that a directly affected by the graffiti/vandalism. It would have been refreshing to see a bit a balance. Sadly this was not the case.On top of that, this was not in the least bit entertaining, engaging, informative, etc....Blame lies squarely on the producer, director, writers, etc...Not recommended.",False
3,10,"Excellent, well made documentary on graffiti.",joshart-35691,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a very well done documentary on an art form that is in the background of peoples lives.Graffiti is something people see and think little of while driving on the road, passing a trainyard, or waiting at a railroad crossing, waiting for a train to pass.This documentary goes deep into the hip hop culture, risk taking, physical danger, and the pure love of the art of graffiti. I am a graffiti artist and enthusiast myself, so I enjoyed every minute of this documentary.However, as this is an illegal activity, many people don't understand graffiti, and and don't get why people do it.This documentary gets into the minds of the graffiti artists, showing you their mentality, attitude, and passion, and explains their drive to get out and paint! Would highly recommend to any graffiti writers or graffiti enthusiasts!",False
4,1,"If you like non-stop quick-cut editing, you'll love this doc",localfoodrocks,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is edited crazier than a Czechoslovakian porn trailer. Seriously though, I wanted to watch this for the graffiti and the artists' stories behind the scenes, but it was edited too fast for my eyes to soak anything in. Totally killed any desire to keep watching.",False
5,8,Interesting Perspective,justin-ismond,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is a peak into the world of Graffiti writers who vandalize freight trains. Its gives some nice details on the history of Graffiti and how it is one of the main elements of Hip Hop Culture. There is some interesting stories behind the motivations of the writers and how long they have done this kind of art. The art is pretty good and there are some ideas that resonate with anyone who has wanted to leave their mark on the world, to prove that we actually existed.Not all of the film is as good as some parts, the flow could have used some work and maybe taken time to just see what its like for them. The variety of writers was kind of slim, TBH I would like to see more big names and highlight some up and coming talent on the radar would have been cool. Overall it was a fun watch for people who like counter culture art and fans of similar films like Style Wars.",False
6,1,Awful,johnalynch-97460,n/a,15/08/2025,"We are living in a society in moral decline. When did it become acceptable and common place to promote crime in our society? This movie glorifies vandals and their ""artwork"". Graffiti is vandalism and vandals belong in jail. Showtime should be ashamed to put something like this on television. Not only does this documentary promote crime, it's not even well made. Showtime should be charged with a crime just for airing this garbage.",False

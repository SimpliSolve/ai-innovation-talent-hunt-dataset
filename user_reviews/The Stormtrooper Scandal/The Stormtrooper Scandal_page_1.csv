1,4,"Slightly interesting story, but hard to find anyone to like",wpymwonktnawi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe underlying story is engaging enough (although it could probably be told in a shorter time) but the challenge for the film is that there is no-one for whom you can muster much sympathy.Whether it's the art 'curators' looking to ride the crypto wave, NFT nerds hoping to make their fortunes by 'investing' in digital art, or the artists/mega-corp who find out that someone else is earning off their creation, without asking permission.None or then are particularly likable.Are we supposed to care about the (mostly virtual) gains and losses of any of these people?It's not the filmmaker's fault that we can't feel much sympathy, but without it, the film's just not very engaging.",True

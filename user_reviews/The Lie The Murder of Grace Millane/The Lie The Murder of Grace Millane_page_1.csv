1,7,Tough to sit through,Kingslaay,n/a,16/08/2025,"I live in New Zealand and am a New Zealander so this was really sad that this happened in our country. I think so many us felt so shocked and angry such a tragedy could occur in a supposedly safe country. We clearly got a lot of work to do as Grace should have been safe here. This is a well made documentary that shows you the harsh reality of what unfolded at the evil hands of a predator. It is beyond shocking how he behaved, lied and tried to cover his tracks after killing Grace. Evil intent was definitely there and we see glimpses into such a disturbed person. Viewers are left asking what sort of upbringing or childhood did someone have to become a monster. Tough to watch but well made.",False
2,7,You feel for this sweet girl,pinkdove,n/a,16/08/2025,"The case even though quickly solved, was quite saddening and also terrifying. These days I don't like watching documentaries as they keep dragging with flashbacks for people childhoods and how happy they were and all. This documentary gets straight to the point. They did make it seem like suspense in the beginning and then things quickly unravel. If this is first time you are hearing about grace than it's an interesting watch. I'm glad the investigators wasted no time. The interviews were so taken very calmly and no wiggle room for the perpetrator to get out jail. I'm glad the lawyers were also very thorough with the evidence. However, documentary Makes you wonder if a peaceful country like New Zealand is not safe than where else would you even go to travel solo.",False
3,8,Her name is Grace Millane,diablowilliam,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a amazing documentary which shines the light on the darkness women encounter around the world. A beautiful soul extinguished by the actions of a cowardly maggot. This documentary is very thoughtful in its approach. It never sets out to tarnish the victim like the courts do, instead it shows how determined the justice system was when the world's spotlight was on them. The law enforcement gave their all with such brilliant investigation, all whilst the coward lied and kept lying, trying to tarnish Grace, but never succeeding due to the evidence that he supplied. Killers like this maggot never fail to suprise me with how inept their egos are and somehow still believe they are superior. Grace was taken from this world but was loved by family, friends and all who followed her journey. Her legacy will never be forgotten, whilst the coward rots in prison, his name will always be synonymous with his crime. Bravo to the director in her approach to this case. No woman should ever be a victim to any man's sick fantasy, and one day we can only hope there will be a future where crimes like this will never ever be a normalised hushed up secret.",False
4,7,She deserved better,jasamas,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA very disturbing, but well produced documentary.Regarding Grace, she seemed to be a marvelous young lady.Unfortunately, her innate kindness permitted her to let down her defenses. Allowing a complete stranger, simply found on Tinder, to caress her, kiss her in public, and worst of all, to agree to go to his hotel suite....well, it certainly was a horrendous decision on her part. She didn't deserve death, or any abuse for that matter, but women need to show more common sense in these situations. Single young women, especially traveling alone in foreign countries need to use extreme caution, and not be so blatantly trusting.This guy was a predator. She made it too easy for him.",True
5,9,Heart-breaking stuff,jtindahouse,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been really fascinated by the Grace Millane case ever since it happened. The thing about it that stuck with me the most is touched on very early in this documentary. We see a Google search of the safest countries to visit. Right there in the number two spot is New Zealand. Grace had just landed here from South America, a notoriously unsafe place where she encountered no problems, and then it was little old ""safe"" New Zealand that got her. It's incredibly sad.Most documentaries have to have someone in the present explaining everything that happened at the time of the case. This documentary doesn't have to do that at all. There is so much CCTV footage, interview footage and court footage that it comfortably fills the run time. And all of it is fascinating.The CCTV footage being matched up with his interview footage to show how he was lying was very well edited. And the courtroom footage showing the defense attorneys hating every minute of their life, having to say the things they were being paid to say was fascinating to watch.It's all pretty upsetting and dark stuff. Be aware that this is not a light watch. It is a well made documentary though. 9/10.",False
6,10,Heartbreaking and evil,londonjo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI could not have contained my rage sat across the table from this guy,
As a parent and a grandparent.Hats off to the detectives. Keeping their calm.There is Pure EVIL amongst us.I hope he suffers in prison til he dies.Poor Grace. So not fair.My condolences to her parents family and friends.He planned this crime
He's cunning and sick
I'm worried has he done this before.Such a story teller he is.Dealing with people like him would be infuriating.This is why life in prison is not Enough.If you wake up to find a young woman deceased surely call the policeCallous self serving piece of work.",True
7,9,Heartbreaking. May Grace rest in peace.,jessicaalexandrapeters,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHeartbroken. This was a really tough watch. I remember when she was murdered and the fascination with reporting on sexual violence and victim shaming narrative in the press and comments disgusted me. This documentary shows some of this, and the courtroom narrative is equally horrifying. My heart broke for her family going through this and having to watch her memory get desecrated in the media and in the comments sections of those websites.For those who want to watch a traditional who-dunnit with a bit of mystery of who the killer is, this isn't for you. This shows a cold, callous murderer and the lengths and lies he went to in covering it up.A heartbreaking watch. Her name was Grace Millane. She was so loved. May she rest in peace.",True
8,9,Well made and sobering watch.,alan_j_grant,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a person who had a girl friend abducted and murdered this was a sober watch. The Grace case was hard to live with as it happened in my home time. While on a drive to the beach we saw her shallow grave site. Chilling. I like how this is done throgih real footage - CCTV, police interviews with the killer, family and the court case. There's only a couple of minor reencatments being his drive to bury her. This is so much a real documentary not an entertainment murder mysteriously . You can see the lead policeman really feels the pain of the situation and family having kids of his own. Which he commented on the time in interviews. I remember when the court case was on at the time that it came down to he killed her but was it with intent. It came down to a legal point that acting in a way that a reasonable person knows could be fatal can be found guilty of murder even if they didn't intend to kill. Hooking up with strangers is risky. Be careful.",True
9,5,Deceptively edited and needlessly drawn out,TheUserIDYouEnteredHasAlready,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI normally don't review TV or streaming documentaries like this, but after paying to rent it on Amazon Prime Video last night, I thought I should warn others.Many people in the US may not be aware of Grace Millane's disappearance in New Zealand in late 2018 or the story of how the crime was identified and solved. It was a big deal in the UK, and multiple previous documentaries and docu-series have already aired there. Hence, ""The Lie"" is likely to be an unnecessary retread for UK, Aussie and NZ viewers.Without spoiling anything for viewers new to this case, the problem with this documentary is in how it was presented. In essence, New Zealand, like the UK and some other countries, is blanketed with CCTV surveillance in both public and private (business) settings. And it isn't that old grainy, pixelated or blurry video many of us are used to when we think security surveillance footage. This is modern, hi-res, extremely clear video available instantly to police when they aren't actively monitoring it to begin with.To that latter point, there is ample footage provided in this documentary where Grace Millane seems to be being tracked in real time. The camera literally follows her and her companion as the events unfold. Hence, the police already knew that the sequence of events as relayed to them in their interview with a person of interest was a lie. This would have been one of the simplest, and shortest Dateline NBC episodes in the history of that program. But the producers of ""The Lie: The Murder of Grace Millane"" artificially craft numerous aspects of the investigation so as to drag it out to feature length. Key pieces of evidence that the police already have at any given point in time are withheld from the viewer in order to create suspense and make the investigation appear to be a drawn out affair, when in reality the case was effectively solved within 1-3 days of the start of the investigation.A good portion of the run time is devoted, in a very shallow fashion, to the problem of man-on-woman violence in New Zealand and there is a lot of filler aerial drone footage of admittedly beautiful parts of the country and the city of Auckland. Of course there is also a ton of CCTV footage, which again, is presented to the viewer in a deceptive fashion. Rather than immediately clueing us in to lies that were immediately exposed, we are led to believe that what the suspect is telling police even matters. It doesn't. All that needed to be done was identify a person of interest, obtain the surveillance footage of the areas where it is known (or he tells them) that he and Grace were active in the city on the last night she was seen, and cross check that with his story. Which is, I'm sure, exactly what the Auckland police did in real life.I'll give the movie makers credit for high production value and a compelling mystery for about the first 25-30 minutes, but after that it becomes an insult to the intelligence of viewers, and especially regular viewers of the ""true crime"" genre.If you're new to the story, it's worth a watch with the above caveats in mind. If you're already familiar with the case and its outcome, I can only recommend this if you're bored and can catch it for free wherever it's streaming.5/10 for taking the audience on a manufactured ride for an otherwise very simple case to solve. I will say the last 10 minutes of expository information on the perpetrator were indeed chilling if the allegations presented in that part of the movie are all true and they add some gravity and context to the investigators' interviews with him from early in the film.",True
10,2,Very dry documentary,public-88999,n/a,16/08/2025,"At the outset, I want to acknowledge the tragedy at the heart of this documentary. It is an incredibly sad case, and my heart goes out to everyone involved. One positive aspect of the documentary is that it brings attention to the event, allowing viewers to learn from it.Now, as for the documentary itself, I found it lacking. The storytelling is extremely dry-there is no real narrative flow. It's essentially a series of ""this happened, then this happened,"" with little attempt to build tension or deeper engagement. The absence of music or any emotional cues further distances the viewer, making most of the experience feel like you're just watching extended CCTV footage. That said, the quality of the surveillance infrastructure in New Zealand is impressive, but it doesn't compensate for the lack of effective storytelling.",False

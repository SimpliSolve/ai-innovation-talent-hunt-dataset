1,2,Don't really know where to start.,pontusporre,n/a,16/08/2025,"The boy obviously has money and a lot of conections but this film shows a really one sided view of this guy. It only gives this guy a opportunity to widen his platform since it for the absolute majority of the film only show the parts of his life he wants show. Atleast they took up the folding phones scams, but in a really small extent.To top it all of he's probably the bigest mytoman i've ever seen. Sure, some of the things have some little truth to it exagerated to the max. Other things are straight up lies. Take the dispute with klarna for example. Klarna never baned him on ethical grounds, it was because he scamed people. The list of lies could be endless.It's a shame that SVT and public service doesn't dig out some of the truth becasue it's out there. In the end this is not really a documentary. A documentary should depict realtiy and this documentary doesn't, it only depict lies.",False
2,1,The most hated and wanted crypto scammer from Sweden,nldjbassie,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is no movie , this man is a thief and a crypto scammer a dreamer that want to be big bud act like he is a big man. Because so called friends with the brother of escobar. I spoke with his father in Sweden, and they had a strip book online shop. And because he was to young his father put it on his name. Bud Olaf steal the many and get in a fight that is still going on till today. Then he run to his mom in the USA, and start scamming there rent houses en small company building. Where he left again without paying. His next move was with this most hated escobar family member, by using his name and put it online. They steal the white paper and never went live with the coin. Bud in mean time stole many investors money. I did hear also a story where he try to sell stolen paintings. Bud it's clear when you google around this man is lower then low. And wanted in some places, i bet he will end up dead on the side of the road one day. He act if he owns the escobar copy rights, bud it's all one big scam to, i spoke personally with the real son of Pablo escobar, and he told me that so called brother of Pablo is hated by everybody in the family because he get away with the money Pablo had left for the Family. That's why they try to kill him in jail with that bom letter. He is a loser and attract losers like Olaf Gustafson. This movie also it's fake not understand why it's still on the website anyway.",False

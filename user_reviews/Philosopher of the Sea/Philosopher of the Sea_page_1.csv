1,8,"""...we are made for eternity...""",jimbarnard-22093,n/a,16/08/2025,"A nice little film about someone who took the path less traveled. At one point in this film I thought about ""The Vasa'"" which if you know that history never made it out of Stockholm's harbor in 1628 . This is an adventure story that inspires and confirms good health is living by pursuing one's passion, not just surviving passively. Staying connected to nature is the other strong element that comes through. One thing I enjoyed is that the filming of Sven's adventures were not shut down during Covid. He found a way to keep the project rolling. I hope there is a sequel but I must be satisfied if there isn't, Sven is 83 years old after all.",False
2,n/a,Subtle and charming.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh Yes,
The Philosopher of the Sea comes together very nicely. It does what few documentaries manage - to find the pacing of what it is trying to tell. In the same way that you would expect a documentary covering F1 to be ""fast"", a glimpse into Sven Yrvinds life; suits being slow paced. The whole message is one of slowing down, taking in and, yes - being there. It is also a homage to; freedom of mind, freedom of spirit and freedom of action - and of enjoying reasonable demands on life itself. It's not a must see but it certainly is a nice to see and just maybe; it provides a tempting glimpse into enjoying life a little less hectic.",False
3,9,Honest and captivating,MrBrooksBooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary provides an honest portrayal of Sven Yrvind's life, revealing his struggles during his upbringing and his decision to separate himself from society. It is clear that Yrvind is not fearless, but instead, he displays bravery and resilience in pursuing his passion for sailing and boat design. As one of Sweden's most legendary sailors, inventors, and charming idealists, Yrvind's story is fascinating and inspiring.Aside from the compelling portrayal of Yrvind's life, the documentary is also worth watching for its stunning depiction of nature and the incredible journey that Yrvind undertakes. Whether you're interested in sailing or simply enjoy a good adventure story, this documentary is a must-see.",False
4,4,"Amateur hour. Better watch any Youtube vlogger instead, it will be as interesting or more interesting...",imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn old man on a boat. Will he drown? That's the basic story. Is it Interesting? NO. He doesnt drown. He doesnt die. He doesnt even get hurt.We just see an old man taking a long sea trip and everybody is worried if this old man is gonna make it alive. Yes he makes it. Nothing happens. BORING.What's the story then? What's there to philosophise about? That you didnt drown and everybody expected you to drown?What's worse is that besides this story being as lame and tedious as can be, the direction, the photography, the editing, everything looks like amateur hour. This isnt worthy of being called a documentary. It's a vlog. Of an old man. And nothing happens.Just as well google on youtube for any OTHER vlog or video about a REALLY disastrous and exciting boat voyage. It will be guaranteed more interesting than this bore of a video vlog...",True

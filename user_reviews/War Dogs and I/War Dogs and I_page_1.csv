1,10,Fantastic and Inspirational Documentary,bendover-23078,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very emotianal and great dynamic film where an adventurous person called Kobus Oliver is with his four dogs that he loves most in the world. He is in Ukraine where the war has started with Russia. It's scary for him and his beloved dogs as they face many death situations but they always come out stronger with more experience even more ambitious to get out of Ukraine safe and alive. This documentary really shows us that there is hope no matter what the situation is and is likely going to inspire people around the world.Overall the scenery was great, there was a lot of suspense/action which was very entertaining and finally the movie comes to a great ending.",False

5,9,Wonderful story and documentary! 9/10,shounaksarkar,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a beautifully shot and excellently executed documentary! Kobus Olivier and his four dogs' story is highly compelling. I was actually one of the privileged few to speak to Kobus personally and write an article on his journey from war torn Ukraine to Croatia for a sports website. Seeing the story represented on TV with Kobus' own spoken words, archived clips and music was therefore very special.Im so glad that he was able to persevere through so much hardship and eventually make it to Croatia intact with his four extremely cute dogs. Highly recommend checking this out! I give it a 9 out of 10 stars.",False
6,10,Our review,pantheaatabeyki,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think that this documentary is great and I learned a lot from it like everybody can. I watched it with my friends and we all loved it. Mr Kobus traveled a long time with his dogs and they are so cute. My favorite is Ollie. But i love all of them. It is impresive how he made it out of the war,and traveled all the way to Croatia from Ukraine. I am really impresed how he found a way to go somewere after a long time having problem with the fact that he could not bring all of his 4 dogs. The movie was sad and happy at the end. I really learnd something and i am happy that he has a happy life now in Zagreb.",False

9,10,it is about a man thet loves his dogs more than anything,mihaelblatnik,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerWarDogs and i is a film based on a true story of ex professional cricket player that lived in Kyiv. I liked the movie because it was inspiring. The dogs and Kobus were scared. The bombs were 15 kn from their house so they went to the shelter but all 5 where not allowed in there because there were too many people in there so they stayed in their apartment when the bombs exploded. He played Hauser to the dogs so they were not so scared. So he searched for some people that can get him out of Kyiv. He found a guy so he paid him a lot of money and after 8 hours of waiting on the border they came to Poland so after 4 weeks he came to Croatia. The trip that took him 4 weeks should have took him about 12 hours.,True
10,10,WATCH IT,hipridsimba,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFantastic! I love how the movie shows the real feeling and the real problems in a war and when you're trying to escape it. The way he never abandonned his dogs, what he loves the most, and managed to get them to a safer place. Croatia was a real miracle, that gave him the opportunity to start a new and normal life.Croatia is a beautiful place situated in the balkans, it has beautiful monuments and beautiful cities.I loved the movie, especially the end! The fact that he managed to escape the war with the power of love. His dogs are so cute, especially Ollie, the only boy in the gang.You should watch it!!! :)",True
11,10,True love story full of hope and miracles,vitapavic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautiful, inspiring story only life can write, and with good director it become such a good movie.Emotional and very interesting movie. The plot unfolds dynamically, and every event is unexpected. The entire film keeps the viewer in anticipation, and each denouement leaves one breathless. It's incredible how only life can design such entanglements and love (in any form) solves them. The strength of this film is in its truthfulness.The scenes are beautifully designed, the viewer is never bored, the music and sound in the background go well with the dynamics of the story. In the end, one wonders what is so great that it protects us in every moment of the struggle, even when it seems that there is no hope.",False

13,10,review,anissda,n/a,16/08/2025,The story talks about a man who had a normal life until it was disturbed by the war. It is heartwarming because the man owns four dogs and because of them he wasn t allowed to enter the shelters. So with his four dogs he spent multiple days living in a small toilet with no electricity and only himself to count on. He then finds a ride to get him out of his home country. In poland he was informed that he needs to leave or he will be deported and his dogs will be taken away. After a week of planning and canceling he gets out of poland and continues his journey of finding a new home for him and his dogs. After an adventure that usually takes 16hours it took the 4 weeks. The man and his dogs finnally settles in in the country of Croatia.,False
14,10,hot flaming documantary🔥🔥🔥,CamilleEsteves6669,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very heart touching/warming/felt documantary, it is about a man ( Kobus Oliver) and his four lovely dogs. He used to live in Kyiv but the war started and there were bombings, he had to hide in his appartement with his dogs for ten days. He had some opportunities to leave but he refused because he could not take his dogs with him. Mr. Oliver only has his dogs, he only lives with them, they are his family, without them he would not be happy, he woulkd be lonely and depressed.I really really really loooved this documantary, it was very interresting for me to watch how this man was thinking totally differently than most people or maybe just very differently than me.This is a must watch.",False
15,10,love of dogs,wrigco,n/a,16/08/2025,"The indomitable spirit of this man and his desperation to ensure his and his dogs' safety is heartwarming and uplifting, especially as the war in Ukraine still wages on today.I know I could never in a million years leave my dogs and cats behind. It's heartbreaking that many people had to do just that in the end. Humans suffer in war, but the silent suffering of our pets and other domestic animals is hardly acknowledged as humans set about destroying and laying waste to civilisation as we know it.The fact that he made it out safely with all four dogs is reason alone to award this little film 10 stars.",False
16,n/a,Pity about the grammar,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"'War Dogs and Me' would have been correct English. I accept that the main subject of the film is not English but surely the producers of the film could have avoided this cringeworthy error. I imagine the film would be both excellent and interesting but I cannot bring myself to watch it.I accept that all languages evolve. 'CRINGEWORTHY' is hardly a word that would have been found in correct English usage but confusing the use of 'I' and 'me' is pure ignorance.As for a man's love for his dogs, I can certainly empathise completely. Were I to find myself in the same situation I would rather die than leave my little Border 'Terrorist' behind!",False

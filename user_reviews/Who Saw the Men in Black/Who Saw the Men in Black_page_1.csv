1,6,Perfectly schlocky UFO fayre,benprichardsdotcom,n/a,16/08/2025,"Apologies to the creators, I fell asleep for sections of this, not because it's boring - far from it! But because I used to fall asleep to the likes of Secure Team in the good old days of YouTube.It's a freaky proposition that the MIB are actually extra-terrestrial, or transhuman. I enjoyed the UFO stuff too, and had a real loathing for that shill bloke!You missed a trick by not utilising The Men in Black by The Stranglers from the album The Men in Black.",False
2,2,Brings nothing to the genre.,sjbolton,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is just like every other ufo show. Scripting it to focus on the men in black component doesn't help. Its still all footage and interviews everyone has seen for decades in ufo shows. It offers nothing new to the field, no new footage or evidence. Its just a money grabbing exercise by the people involved in creating this useless trash. I want my time back for what I wasted to give this a chance. The show doesn't even try to present any conclusion, but as there is nothing new and no proof its just the same garbage rehashed, they present questions as if they were proof. Lots of ""What if..."" ""who are..."" type stuff. And just presented boring as hell. Just avoid it. They've taken longer archival footage and editing it down to try to create new spin narratives by removing the original narrative and context.",False

1,8,A dive into Seventeens music and chemistry,DoctorThor,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before watching the movie, I wasn't very familiar with Seventeen's music, though I had heard of them. After seeing the film, I'm definitely planning to listen to more of their music. I wasn't expecting 13 members, as I initially thought there were only about 5 or 6 people in the group. Despite the large number of members, it was impressive how none of them felt overshadowed; each had their own moments to shine.The close bond between the group members really stands out, making it easy for fans to connect with them. Their individual voices and talents are diverse and captivating, and even though roles like ""main rapper"" or ""main dancer"" exist, each member's contribution is valued. The dancing was particularly enjoyable and showcased their skills well.Overall, the movie was a great introduction to the group and left me excited to explore more of their music.",False
2,10,Gotta Watch!,cindychangdesign,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was blown away by their movie concert in Japan, but this one takes it to a higher level. It's just pure concert and many of their popular and latest songs. My favorite was Lalali and Hot. The stunner was their entrance on stage with them coming down like trapeze artists in boxes the frames their good looks. Great costumes, singing, and dancing. This movie was a stunner. If you're a fan of Seventeen or Kpop, this is a must see. I thought they were just as good as BTS! I'm an army fan and wished I bought their Carat light stick. They made me more of a fan! Don't miss this movie while it's in the theaters!!!!!",False
3,10,Nostalgic Journey,CritiqueCraft,n/a,15/08/2025,"As someone who has followed SEVENTEEN's journey from their early days, the concert film brought back a flood of memories and emotions. Seeing it again in cinemas felt like being reunited with old friends, and it was every bit as electrifying as I remembered.The film captures SEVENTEEN in their element-on stage, pouring their hearts into every performance. From the meticulously synchronized choreography to the powerful vocals, each member's talent and charisma shine brightly. The group's chemistry is palpable, and their energy is infectious, making it impossible not to sing along or tap your feet to the beat.The cinematography is top-notch, with dynamic camera angles and close-ups that allow fans to feel like they're right there in the front row. The sound quality is also excellent, immersing the audience in the concert experience. For those who couldn't attend the tour in person, this film is the next best thing, and for those who did, it's a beautiful way to relive the magic.If there's any downside, it's that the film leaves you wanting more-more songs, more performances, more of the members just being their authentic selves. But perhaps that's intentional, a way of keeping fans eagerly anticipating what's next for SEVENTEEN.Overall, this is a must-watch for Carats and K-pop enthusiasts alike. It's not just a concert film; it's a celebration of everything that makes SEVENTEEN one of the most beloved groups in the industry today.",False

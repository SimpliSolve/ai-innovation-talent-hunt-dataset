1,6,"More about Michael Giacchino than Werewolf by Night, but it's fine.",maxalmonte,n/a,16/08/2025,"I consider Director By Night to be a great documentary about the directorial debut of film composer Michael Giacchino - who in 2019 directed the episode ""Ephraim and Dot"" for the television series Star Trek: Short Treks -. It's less about the making of Werewolf By Night and more about Michael Giacchino's story and background, but still manages to be enjoyable, especially for non-enthusiasts of film scores - and thus not familiar with Michael Giacchino's previous work -.I truly hope to see Michael Giacchino directing again in the future.Michael Giacchino has worked in several MCU titles as a composer in the past, so seeing him jumping to the director's chair is a feel-good story.",False

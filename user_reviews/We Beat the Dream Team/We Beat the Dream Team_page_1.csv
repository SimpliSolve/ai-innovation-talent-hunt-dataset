1,9,Fair and Interesting,tommylib,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoyed We Beat the Dream Team. Grant Hill was perfect as the narrator and the various interviews with both members of the Dream Team, coaches, and the Select Team were all well done and interesting.The twist from Coach K really surprised me and I could definitely see the hurt in the reactions from the Select Team.The interviews of the players from the Dream Team about the veracity of the claim were very enlightening as well.It's a shame Coach Daly isn't around to give us his thoughts on the entire claim but perhaps that makes it more fun to speculate.In any case, a beautifully done documentary well worth watching.",False
2,10,Unexpectedly great...,GivinOutSpankins,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't know this happened until today, grabbed my curiosity when I saw it listed in my feed on Max, couldn't help myself. I had no expectations and I'm glad I didn't, really enjoyed the entire thing from start to finish. The back stories, the side stories, the arguments, and just everything about it was fascinating. Showed the importance of how expectations can get the best of us, even the greats. And how a scrimmage woke up The Dream Team and sent them off to be great in front of the world. Grant Hill did a great job on this...I highly recommend watching if your a sports fan. I'm not even a big basketball fan but this was a nice surprise to my day.",False

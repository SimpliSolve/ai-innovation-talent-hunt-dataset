1,9,Compelling,asilmser,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is perhaps no greater racial stereotype in America than that of a Black person being a strong Democrat. Uncle Tom explores and breaks down this stereotype. Whether you are Republican or Democrat, it should be appalling to see Black Americans who are debating serious ideas in the public forum called such horrible names. We need to enter a stage in our country when we can have a vigorous debate on public policy while respecting one another. This documentary systematically and brilliantly outlines the well-reasoned political ideas of several Black Republicans while also highlighting the very real persecution they face from Democrats who, while claiming to be ""inclusive"" and ""diverse,"" oppose them with insults that would make David Duke feel ashamed.
No narration-just interviews, news clips, archival footage, and ideas.
If you can't stand the idea that a Black person would support the Republican Party, do not watch this documentary. It is too well done. You will be angry and frustrated.
If you are interested in learning about a diversity of perspectives, participating in sincere debate, and removing personal and societal stereotypes, you will thoroughly enjoy this film.",False
2,8,Pretty Good Documentary,jerrycoliver,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of the negative reviews I read were either from the perspective that is was propaganda or not well made. It's certainly less propaganda than anything Michael Moore has done, and it really isn't poorly made.All that aside, I love watching documentaries from every perspective, even when I disagree, because I like to know how people think and how they came to the conclusion they did, and for that, the documentary gives excellent context for where the people interviewed are. (agree or not, you can clearly see why they think the way they do.)The biggest criticism is that it glosses over JFK. I don't think it was done to minimize the efforts by the democrat party's leader, but rather the fact is he just didn't do very much in terms of social justice. I think explaining the complexity of the Democrat party at the time and how Kennedy was an outlier who supported civil rights but didn't actually do anything is a narrative people don't want to believe. The truth is, when people talk about the ""southern strategy"" by Nixon it can easily be debunked by simply looking at the states Kennedy and Nixon carried through their primaries and campaigns and it becomes obvious why the Democratic VP had to be a war mongering Klansman from South. But this is such a misunderstood era, so much so that if you ask people who initiated the Vietnam war and who ended it, they'd say Nixon then Kennedy instead of the other way around. (I tested this theory and I haven't met anyone yet who answered correctly.) So I think, instead of complicating things, they just left it out.Overall, I don't know if it will sway anyone's political beliefs. Feature length's movies are generally only watched by people who want to invest the time, and if you already disagree politically, you won't invest the time. But as a narrative, storytelling (or more like a collection of stories and examination) it's pretty well put together. There's more emotion than you'd think and if you're on the fence or just curious about black people in America, it's a great movie.",False
3,9,Great doc love Larry,bantam-40922,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed the doc and found it very inspiring to hear about the success stories, it also laid out the current state of the regressive left very well.",False
4,10,My Red-Pill Moment.,sahlemariam,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a young black male who was psychologically entrenched in the ""liberal sunken place"" throughout his formative years, this documentary was the finalization of my red pill moment.Uncle Tom provides all Americans a holistic understanding of when, how, and why Democratic policies have damned black America since the 60's bringing a nuanced perspective to the issues plaguing black Americans today.Uncle Tom is a must see documentary!",False
5,10,Great Documentary,rileyper,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cried a few times, so sad on some parts. Uplifting in others.Grab a notepad and do some research while watching. There is so much more information that can branch out of this film.",False
6,10,10 Stars!!,brigittejacobson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you for giving us the opportunity to watch a wonderful film that rejects the victim narrative that the democrats try and push on the black community. This film is so powerful and deserves so much positive recognition. I had high expectations for this film, and it EXCEEDED my expectations!!",False
7,10,Needs to be available to the World!,steve_brenoskie,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is incredible. I just wish it was available for the masses. I completely understand you don't want to give away everyone's hard work for free, but I wish there were a way to raise money so the title can be put on a streaming popular platform ASAP.",False
8,10,This Is A Much Needed Movie,knightdavid-85066,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is like an alarm clock - some people might not like what they are hearing when they watch it but that doesn't change the fact that it is time to wake up. I applaud the courage, the genius, and the love and compassion that went into the making of this important film.",False
9,10,A sucker punch to the narrative.,PalacePickney,n/a,16/08/2025,"A clean, wonderfully informative production. I was aware of some of the notions put forward in this film but by no means whatsoever was I ready to be immersed with just so much factually unequivocal depth! Truly eye-opening and fantastic to see such a diverse array of characters, each with their own insights and anecdotes. A straightforward and rather in-your-face approach to demolishing the left's insistence on minority control. Superb production, cast and motive. Regardless of your political leaning, this no holds barred piece definitely gets the mind racing and questioning all that we are inundated with in the media.",False
10,4,Only as compelling as yelling,andrekmoncivais,n/a,16/08/2025,"Upon my view of this documentary, I had no expectations. As the narration began I felt that I was in much of the same position as those being interviewed. I was for Obama in 2008 so I watched thoroughly all the way through. One thing I couldn't help but notice is this theme in which the narrator did the most to try and remove the wool from over the eyes of black people in America and why they think the way they think. That wool specifically being the democratic party and their ties to racism. Ironically instead of doing so it seems to be more of a desperate attempt to pull the wool over their eyes and accuse the democratic party today as still the democratic party of racism. It rejects the notion that there was anything good done for black people by the democratic party and notes that when there was a great event in the history of black people, e.g. the civil rights act, that it was the Republican senate that pushed that law into being. It leaves no ground left for any credit for the Democrats that were in power and continues the narrative that it is the Republican party that has stepped out of the way of black people and allowed them the initiatives and resources to compete in America as they should be able to today.The problem that I see is that much of what is stated is anecdotal through out the documentary. They speak of events, but they never really give you any substance to track yourself and do your own research. It relies on the interviewees to fulfill the theme that black people are used in politics today, but the problem is all of the interviewees are well known right wing pundits, personalities, and/or voices. There are no independent voices, no democratic voices to help corroborate the ideas of this substance. In fact the entirety of the end of the movie pulls together the net that reveals itself as cast to pull you away from your ideals that the Democrats could ever have your best interests in mind. It does nothing more than speak about President Trump in a way that highlights how he has been the best president for conservatives in history, and tries to further this idea by applying it specifically to the black population. What Uncle Tom succeeds in doing is bulldozing over any possibilities that the rivals of the Republican party are of any use to black people. It uses inflammatory terms to rile up the audience by asserting that legislation by the democrats has been a sort of slavery 2.0, and then paints a picture that black people who are called uncle toms, have seen the light, and would like to welcome these lost, ignorant, and too dumb for their good black people out of their sleep and into the Republican party where they have belonged all along.The problem with this documentary is that it's a bait and switch. Its incomplete in its efforts to contrast because it relies solely on the voices of people who are all adversaries of the party to which they are accusing. It in itself becomes a trial by those in the Republican party to prosecute the Democrats instead of painting a full picture that would, at the minimum include Democrats and Independents, and at maximum have documents or evidence that would clearly show that what they are spreading is sound truth. It's a documentary with little documentation to be reviewed which is a shame because considering the name and the impact to which the original book it was derived from(Uncle Tom's Cabin) I was really hoping there was going to be much more than the emptiness I felt afterwards and have ultimately come to characterize this documentary as being.",False
11,10,This may be the best documentary I've ever seen - I'm a professional filmmaker.,nickalong816,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of, if not the most important film of the 21st century.I do not say that lightly.Everyone has to see this. It's truly life changing.It's a film full of heart, victory, unity, truth, and true patriotism - You'll never be so proud to be an American.Don't pass on it.",False
12,6,Felt like it was catered to people who already agree VS those who don't agree.,howkijan,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Conservatives are really bad at marketing good ideas... They're horrible""Robert L. WoodsonI hate that I am giving a low review for this movie... but I want to be honest.The content of the documentary/film was good, clear, and delivered well. if you were listening and actually agree.I was looking forward to this film and right off the back I wonder if they were lacking budget or just wanted to make it simple.1. Black and White vs Color.
I know there was a reason for the black and white. but I would have preferred color... why? cause it sticks out. when they were going back and forth in history. it would have really highlighted the black and white scenes for us to listen to.2. Graphics.
Like many of the documentaries that are projecting the left agenda I wish there were fun graphics that we could screen shot and show. I know this is preference. But when I see a documentary like ""13"". It's those graphics that really speak louder than words.3. Explanations
Like I shared in the beginning. I think the speakers did a good job explaining. But I cannot remember some of the points they made. I would need to go back and listen carefully. I would have enjoyed it if they had a ""fun enthusiastic person share"" a voice over while showing graphics.4. Who was the audience?
I share my points and reviews because I think this film does bring alot of very important points and questions. However I felt that this documentary was catered to and made for the conservative/black/republican/christian/libertarian group. Which in that case they succeeded. But then I can see the other side being bored and disconnected.5. Resource
Acknowledgments of materials, places, and resources to help others do their own research. Everyone mentioned resources but was not very clear. Wished towards the end there was something saying if you have been questioning and need a safe place to talk, because it is a very divisive convo, it would have been cool if this film shared some of those places.If I was a foreigner and I watched 13 vs Uncle Tom... I think I would have been more compelled to believe int he narrative of 13.At the end. As a libertarian asian American Christian. I enjoyed the film. But I know my left leaning friends would have not. and its because this film under delivered compared to its predecessors.",False
13,2,Biased and reductive,jackflap-137-222952,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this hoping to be given some insight into conservative philosophy, the underlying values that appeal to conservative black Americans, and how those relationships are informed.Instead, it's a two-hour barrage of the same over-simplified message that the American dream demands hard-work and that racism can be over-come just by out-working white people.This is just another example of the lowest form of conservative thinking- people who are impoverished and struggling to survive are just lazy and should work harder.This film doesn't raise any questions, doesn't provide any arguments, doesn't look at any opposing views, it just hammers home a narrative that people who whine about being victims don't deserve any sympathy, much less meaningful change to the system.If this is what Conservative thinking has to offer, social policy might as well be implemented by a bunch of 8-year olds.",False
14,10,Amazing!,bothaandre-51153,n/a,16/08/2025,"A MASSIVE EYE OPENER! I'm a documentary junkie and this is one of the greatest I've seen. Extremely well put together, talking to some truly inspirational, intelligent, and motivated individuals who in my opinion holds the key to elevate Americans to the next level, regardless of race.
Will be watching again.",False

16,10,ACADEMY AWARD WINNER!!!,grussell-02246,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary will likely not win an academy award or even be nominated because of the Liberal propaganda of Hollywood and the media. 'Uncle Tom' should be nominated, and in my opinion, it should win. Great documentary, and one of the best I have ever seen! This is a must watch for EVERYONE around the country. It's the true history and perspectives we are not taught in the classrooms. To know this history, you have either had to live through it and/or educate yourself with books and information not accessible in American classrooms. Those that want the true history of America's political parties, and their agendas in minority communities, this documentary is for you.",False
17,10,Larry Elder is the man!,armaniatto,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great documentary about the black conservative in America today. It's emotional and eye opening. I think people should really watch and understand the truth. Larry elder is a great person and it really shows he cares about the black community, no matter what names are thrown at him.",False
18,10,Exceptional. Elder DeSpells Liberal Voodoo.,danaannduggan,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's pretty powerful and chock full of facts. Larry Elder is brilliant and takes it to the Democratic party. I would be worried if I were them. He just delivered a tour de force against liberalism. As is forevermore my Indy struggle, there are bits with which I disagree, but there's no denying he knocks it out of the park...with one damning fact after another.",False

20,1,Propaganda,johncomo-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is approved mainly by the far right hence all the so-called ""great"" reviews. The documentary is one sided. So much is left out. They focus that black people should not be victimized. They should just accept the assault and get up and move on because that's what they did. First of all Mr & Mrs Black Conservative, there should NEVER have been an assault in the first place. Get that though your thick skull. Yes, I'm an educated black person. I certainly didn't forget where I came from, yet I'm successful in the US. Count your blessings. Everyone in the country will not be rich, some are poor. All they asking is not to be discriminated against and an opportunity. It's up to the individual themselves if they are willing to take the opportunity. Secondly, just stop with the Democratic party was the racist party. That may me factual at one time, but something changed everything. The racism shifted to the Republican party. So, the Black Republicans shifted to the Democratic party. Just because the Republican Congress voted for the Civil rights bill, didn't stop these same people from wearing a hoodie. That what these Black Conservatives not adding to this. I'm not accepting this. They are. They are not Uncle Tom's, they are Sambos. This documentary is eye opening and ignorant and full of shock value. Candace looking for all the smart glory as usual. The neurosurgeon Ben Carson, I get his accomplishments, but he is not a political leader, he's a doctor, he has no business in politics. Has nothing to do with his blackness.",False
21,10,A Must-See Documentary,calebspencer-55573,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary could not be anymore timely. I was hesitant at first glance, but it turned out to be the best watch of the summer so far. If you want to learn about the real history of the country that no one talks about, this is the movie for you. After watching Uncle Tom it truly helped me better understand the black community and gave me a much deeper respect and love for the United States.",False

The same politicos who delivered slavery, the KKK, Jim Crow, and segregation are now the ""good guys'...really? Fortunately, Larry Elder is NOT having it.Uncle Tom knocks it out of the park...again, and again, and again.",False
23,7,Not for church showings,frsauppe,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this with the hope of showing it to my parish and wider community. Unfortunately while I highly hope this movie gets a wide viewing, my parish will not see it because of a very short segment of people chanting F-bombs against President Trump. May I suggest editing that out in future releases. I also thought it a bit long and tendentious. It repeated similar points over and over and over. And over. The closing segment that lasted forever should be entirely dropped. And lastly, and this is too late for the film, a specific personality should have narrated the movie; moving from person to person while offering context and help to identify who is who.",False
24,1,Ill-conceived drivel at best,Tailgunner1944,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm very open-minded and was eager to learn something new from this film. But what I got was something that sounded more and more like a propaganda hit-piece as the minutes rolled on. The film seemed to have been put together by paid individuals twisting themselves into pretzels by using selective information to portray a history that fits nicely into their own false narratives. They use the same old playbook: ranting and showing their disdain and contempt for African-Americans and their 400-year struggle for true justice, then say one or two nice things about MLK. Sadly, that has never worked and does not work here. As a film, the camera work and editing are excellent. As a propaganda film, I give this 10/10 for perfectly playing to its audience of deplorables. But if this was supposed to be an objective film that looks into real issues, then this was an epic fail that belongs to Newsmax or Foxnews reels.",False
25,10,Excellent Documentary,goosecreekfarm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Made me proud, made me cry, made me ashamed that I haven't worked harder in my life. So full of facts and so full of the truth, and they are not the same thing. Only thing that would have made it better would be if it were twice as long. So thankful this film was created.",False

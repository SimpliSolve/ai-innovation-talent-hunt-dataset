1,9,I still get goosebumps whenever I hear Ms. Warwick sing. ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽ¼,Ed-Shullivan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was so looking forward to watching this documentary depicting the classy and award winning singer Dionne Warwick and once again those goosebumps made the hair on my arms stand at attention. I learned a bit more about Dionne Warwick, her upbringing, her relationship with Whitney Houston, and even one of her earliest mentors, the great Hollywood actress Marlene Dietrich.I can't say there is one particular song of Ms. Warwick that stands above the rest (simply because they are all memorable and heartwarming) but listening to how Ms. Warwick first felt about songs like ""Do You Know the Way to San Jose"" and her gathering of the troops to put together the Aids foundation ""That's What Friends Are For"" to raise millions of dollars for the Aids foundation tell us how truly committed she has been to certain causes that may have not been popular for the time.I simply love her music and this documentary makes me love her even more. I will be sure to purchase it when it becomes available.",False
2,8,Goddess,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"Besides the incredible talent, Miss Warwick is the epitome of soul, class and glamour.This docufilm goes back to her roots and early beginnings. It is interesting to hear about all the other talents who got their start at the Apollo Theatre. She also tells a story about touring the south back in the 1950s. She said, ""I had never been treated like that before."" Well, at least she wasn't treated badly in the north, for the most part. Thank goodness for that at least.It touches on her financial problems but doesn't go into her strange oddyssey with the psychic network. It also ignores her turn as the glamorous and regal host of Solid Gold.What impressed me further was her taking on gangsta rap for their misogynistic lyrics. Only SHE could pull that off!I don't get Snoop saying she paved the way for people like him. Apples and Oranges.",False
3,8,"Informative, entertaining overview of the great singer's career.",jimfinger-47793,n/a,16/08/2025,"Somewhat typical/predictable in that the slew of notables interviewed are generally fawning in their praise; but less typical in that there is quite a bit of first-person commentary from Ms. Warwick herself on the various stages of her career, and an added bonus is that her commentary is notably objective. There are a nice number of clips showing her performing many hits from over the years, though not much footage from the recording studio showing the ""making of the sausage."" Some detail is shared about the recording of a few numbers, but that welcome, back-story perspective of specific songs is relatively sparse.",False
4,10,Phenomenal,bvargus,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best docs I've seen. I'd forgotten how many great songs Dionne Warwick had made, but I enjoyed even more the reminders, revelations and details about her life offstage: the refusal to back down when pitted against Southern racism and segregation; the fight for AIDS awareness, including raising tens of millions of dollars for AMFAR through the song ""That's What Friends Are For""; the sit down with gangsta rappers to explain to them that their misogynistic lyrics were harmful and the impact that had on Snoop Dogg; and of course, the most important thing, the incredible loving relationship she has with her sons, despite the fact that she was an international star, in constant demand all over Europe as well as the U. S.
Director Dave Wooley deftly pulls it all together in a beautiful way. I highly recommend this great piece of filmmaking.",False
5,10,"A Legend, On And Off The Stage!",DJM26,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally, Dionne Warwick is getting some of the due she deserves. I know, how can you say that a women who has had the career, accomplishments and accolades that she has received, is underrated, but I do. As Clive Davis says herein, she is at the top pantheon of female singers-an all time great. You have to have seen her in concert, in her prime, to truly appreciate the power of her vocal talents and her ability to move you through song. I've been privileged to see her live a couple of dozens times, beginning in 1969. The first record I ever bought was a Dionne Warwick album.But, of course, as this outstanding documentary shows, she is much more than just her music. She is a leader. A philanthropist. A mover. A shaker. She is a legend!",False
6,10,God Is Proud of its DW-Divine Wonder,akira-hideyo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally caught it on 3rd day of 2023. Couldn't do so via CNN while on flight back home from holidays. No documentary can respectfully contain all the great moments of Dionne's music and her life; its just that full. I had the great blessing of meeting, chatting, hugging and cheek kissing Lady Dionne with precious selfies a long while back, when she was part of an annual tennis charity event in Singapore. This bio documentary is a wonderful homage to not only a living iconic legend, but a known proven humanitarian. Her incredible catalog and gamut of many song gems are mind boggling. I am fortunate to own all her releases and many songs that weren't on charts are nevertheless seemingly timeless hit songs on slow burners for anyone for any era. This presentation gives viewers just a glimpse of just some of the magnificent body of work she graced through so far from her never dull moments of her charmed life with family, friends, colleagues, community, industry, charities and anyone and everyone that mattered. It's uplifting both musically and very inspiring to see her stoic defiant courage in the midst of heavily sanctioned racial situations while on tour and similarly her do or die, F*U, risk it all or nothing on her career future by globally elevating the vital stigmatized movement of the AIDS crusade then by donating 100% of proceeds of her iconic anthem TWFAF, to AIDS research. Humanity above her own commercial legacy. Truly Divine. I salute and will always adore you, Lady Dionne.Segue: To each his/her own, but I must, for once, am compelled to condemn the vile and purid review here by patriamcanany, titled, Fallen Star. Not only did she not watch the documentary, but has the audacity to put on her KKK hat and launch a honey boo boo self inflated role to diss out advice, based on just getting high on trailers? OMG! -you are a true abomination of the word. Now Walk On By- Period!",False
7,5,Straight-forward bio-doc on the music icon,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Dionne Warwick: Don't Make Me Over"" (2021 release; 95 min) is a bio-documentary about the life and times of the legendary singer. Dionne herself does most of the talking, as she reflects on her very humble beginnings working her way up to get the approval of the Apollo Theater audience, and then eventually getting noticed by/pairing up with Burt Bacharach and Hal David...Couple of comments: this documentary is co-directed by Dave Wooley and David Heilbroner (""Say Her Name: The Life and Death of Sandra Bland""). It is in every which way a straight-forward, Dionne Warwick-approved and endorsed look at the music icon. The documentary's first half is by far the more interesting one, when we watch how Warwick, backed by the impeccable songs from Bacharach-David, is able to bridge the otherwise impassable gap between ""black"" and ""white"" audiences. Check out the early video clip of the breakthrough song ""Don't Make Me Over'. Just priceless. Check out as well how Warwick reacts to what it was like touring in the deep South in the mid-60s (the all-out unapologetic racism and worse remains shocking to this day, but hey, that was America!). The film's second half is okay but just okay. There is a seemingly endless parade of talking heads singing the praises of Ms. Warwick (But Bacharach, Alicia Keys, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Barry Gordon Jr., Elton John, Clive Davis, and on and on). There isn't a single negative or critical note or question in the entire documentary.""Dionne Warwick: Don't Make Me Over"" premiered at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival and then was optioned by CNN+, the streaming service which died on the vine in no time. The documentary finally started showing on CNN yesterday (New Year's Day) and that's where I caught it. Whether you are a die-hard fan or just a casual fan of Dionne Warwick, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
8,5,Dionne Warwick: Don't Make me... Human ?,rubenvrielynck,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very straight-forward endless parade of compliments by everybody from Elton John to Bill Clinton. Not that she deserves anything less. Mrs. Warwick is one of the all time greats. What really anoyed me from the start was me thinking there was something wrong with my TV. Everything was so digitally polished that the people looked like computer-animated cartoons or filtered profile pictures on tinder. It was at some point terrible to watch at. Maybe it was just the lightning (wich I doubt) People in their 70's/80's looking younger (weirder) than ever. Wich is very ironic because all and all it's all about soul. Yet everybody looked soulles. I hope this doesn't become a trend in biographical documentary's. I like my humans to look like, I don't know, humans...",False

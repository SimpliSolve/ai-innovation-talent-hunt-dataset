1,6,Not What I Thought It Would Be..,jessicastjames,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love me some Ms. Grande, but I was hype for a documentary, it really is just a concert special with a few backstage moments. It was shot beautifully and of course she sounded amazing, but as somebody who was there at the manchester show, i was really hoping that it was a little more in depth. Love you girl <3",False
2,5,Meh!,kirstenroper,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was underwhelmed by this. The concert footage is good, she's a great performer, but marketing it as a documentary is one heck of a stretch. A few disjointed, shallow backstage clips and very random anecdotes is all you get.",False
3,6,ariana grande's energetic performance is always a pleasure to watch,Sir_AmirSyarif,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's no 'Homecoming,' but it's alright. there's little insight in this uneven mix of backstage and concert footage, but ariana grande's energetic performance is always a pleasure to watch. that random ""Trump is impeached"" moment is... well... pretty random.",False
4,n/a,"Less Documentary,More MusicalðŸ™„",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I thought this movie will be about Lifestyle of Ariana Grande...but the whole movie is showing only the live perfomance where she singed and danced....No lifestyle was shown about her in that movie.....plz don't waste your time friends....Blackpink-Light up the sky is better than this!,False
5,6,Too many backstage footage.,bradesplaysmc,n/a,16/08/2025,"A concert experience is amazing, it's just they add too many behind the stage scenes when this is not even a documentary.",False
6,8,Good concert experience,lisafordeay,n/a,16/08/2025,I went to see Ariana Grande's concert live in Dublin back in 2019 so it was nice to finally see a more in depth look at her Sweetener concert as well as the behind the scenes on the concert.If you are a die hard fan then you will love this documentary.,False
7,7,Sweetener world tour!,exceladeogun,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ariana Grande: Excuse me, I love youThere are two ways to view this, as a concert film and as a documentary.As a documentary, it fails, as the backstage and behind-the-scenes moments aren't enough and offer nothing new to viewers. There are cute moments but not profound or 'grande' to make it a success.As a concert film, it succeeds phenomenally. Ariana's vocals are at their peak. The editing is keen, the camera angles are delightful. Miss Grande can put out a performance, don her six-inch heels, and skip around the stage whilst delivering stellar vocals. Fans of the pop star will definitely love this movie, especially those that weren't opportune to attend any of the shows live.7.5/10.",False
8,2,Sorry but this isn't a documentary,doylezoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Apologies but if your looking for a true heart felt look into the hard work and determination that goes into an Ariana Grande world tour, your in the wrong place. This is nothing more than a concert film with about 6-7 mediocre (and totally unrelated) behind the scenes footage. That have no relation to the tour itself or what it's about. Now if this was just suppose to be a concert film I'd give it 8/10. The visuals, singing and whole performance (from grande to the dancers) was amazing. I can't stand it though when films that try to call themselves a documentary aren't even close to it.Overall, it's definitely worth a watch. Just know that it's not (in anyway) a documentary. It's just a concert movie.",False
9,10,"Ariana Grande: Excuse Me, I Love You",JoBloTheMovieCritic,n/a,16/08/2025,10/10 - fun music film/documentary showcasing the pop star in her best tour yet for those who didn't get a chance to attend or those simply seeking to relive it,False
10,7,Viewers And Music Lovers Will LOVE Ariana Grande More After Watching This Documentary Film,RECB3,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a great documentary film for all viewers and music lovers to watch and enjoy. This documentary film reveals a real and true insight of what really happens when Ariana Grande tours. She did a real fabulous job in creating this documentary film. Ariana Grande is absolutely tremendous in all that she does.Ariana Grande has no limit in anything that she does. There is no stopping her. Ariana Grande is terrific for the creative arts industry. Her music songs really have had a real impact on the world. I enjoyed watching this documentary film. It reveals so much about Ariana Grande. This is a great documentary film for everyone to watch and enjoy.,False
11,4,"Watch if you love her music, not personal documentary",christinecambia,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Ariana but I was expecting more raw footage of her... she has talent no doubt but it just felt like I was watching a concert. With that said, I do love her songs but it was more a music video than anything else.",False
12,9,God is a woman.,Azanspy,n/a,16/08/2025,I love Ariana and her live stage performance is lit.,False
13,1,Disappointed,zpdhani,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was more of a concert movie, where you watch the perform of the show.
Minimal behind the scene and details into what happens backstage/ the lead up to a big shows.
It doesn't touch on big events that we all know happened during this time/ lead up to this era.
The most info anyone gets is when Ariana explains that her dog pooped everywhere when she's was on FaceTime.
Bit of a disappointment.",True
14,10,Queen Ari on the run pop,meimeihuseth,n/a,16/08/2025,Ariana killed this I absolutely love her performances and talent! She never fails to amaze me. This documentary was so special and I hope everyone gets a chance to see it. It was definitely out together very well and I'm glad I got to see it,False
15,4,"Loved the virtual concert experience, but...",pdilly94,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was not a documentary. I figured this would be similar to BeyoncÃ©'s Homecoming concert/doc, which gives more in depth information about her music and performances.
Definitely watch if you're a fan who hasn't had the opportunity to see her live, you'll enjoy the concert aspect.",False
16,10,a beautiful recall,nguyentulinh-09429,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never thought she could do a show after the trauma. However, she made it, 100 shows with her perfect vocals",False
17,1,Another cash grab attempt of netflix,calvinharrisq,n/a,16/08/2025,These popstars couldn't make money off new music so they're releasing these docs for money like okay if you have weird interest in her life then You're sure to be disappointed because It's just concert footage nothing more. Waste of time.,False
18,n/a,over 3/4 of the 9-10 star review are single use accounts (shills),n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly this is not a documentary. If it were it would note that this advocate of 'defund the police"" has armed personal private security 24/7. That this fighter against global warming uses private jets, SUV limos, heated swimming pools and the carbon footprint of 2,500 working persons. This is is nothing more than a narcissistic puff piece.",False
19,10,simply amazing,gracelaister,n/a,16/08/2025,Showcased her amazing vocals. Had a nice balance of behind the scenes and performances. Really enjoyed it and definitely recommend,False
20,4,Fun concert footage but not documentary level,sye_here,n/a,16/08/2025,"I learned nothing about Ariana, the artistic process behind creating this tour, or the albums the tour centers around. It failed to provide the story of the tour or the London concert(s). That's the purpose of a concert documentary. The concert footage itself looked great though. Wish I was there.",False
21,10,watch it rn,fuqugcki,n/a,16/08/2025,This whole movie allows you to experience the sweetener world tour right from the comfort of your own home and the whole movie was stunning. the quality and visuals were insane and i would definitely recommend. swiffers are purposely rating it bad bc of petty fanwars :),False
22,1,Not a documentary,fanny-84452,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's like watching a tour that was recorded. If you want to learn more about Ariana this is not gonna do it, the only few backstage moments you see are pretty short and boring.",False
23,10,beautiful masterpiece,sivanscalvins,n/a,16/08/2025,I enjoyed this so much- imagine being that talented oof love her,False
24,2,I love you is a good title,Vanillaalmond,n/a,16/08/2025,"I guess you must be a fan to enjoy this, I do like her music but this feels too shallow, like there is only product to sell and no person behind the makeup. There is an endless I love youÂ´s.....how can these beautiful words have any meaning when used so constantly towards everything and everyone?",False
25,10,touching,irinetsouroula,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan, i loved the documentary and i fully-experienced the show as i haven't been to any of ariana's shows before. the visuals and quality were amazing and personally i cried bc i felt crowd's emotions.",False

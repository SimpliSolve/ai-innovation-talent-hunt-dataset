1,7,The Process of Procession,roberteaglesaner,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Procession"" presents a radical new concept regarding the reasoning to craft a story: to create something, not about people, but for them. Greene offers cinema as a medium of therapy, a tool of processing, to 6 survivors of sexual assault at the hands of the catholic church with each crafting a short film about how they wanted their stories to be told and seen. In the wrong hands, such a delicate matter could have been a disaster but instead, Greene illustrates a devastating portrait of men who never quite healed. Men who are still fighting from sunrise to sundown to release the anchor that keeps them entrenched in their pasts. Greene achieves this feat through a number of avenues. First, is his intelligent and restrained decision to focus shots on how these events have racked the bodies of the survivors, second, was the score by Keegan Dewitt and Dabney Morris, which provides a lot of heavy lifting to the emotional gravity of the film, third, was how incredibly well-edited the short-films are with the rest of the documentary; side note, this can especially be felt in the final 10 incredibly moving minutes of the documentary. However, where Procession begins to falter is with the short-films presented by the survivors, which although clearly therapeutic, isn't the most effective cinematic tool due to their inexperienced quality. Many times they will take you out of the documentary altogether but on the other hand, the project wouldn't be possible without the shorts so it's a catch-22. All in all, Greene has made a riveting documentary that even with its short-comings is still incredibly effective but more importantly, and perhaps impressively, has made the lives of 6 men all the better for it.",False
2,8,Powerful concept,Movi3DO,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's always been kind-boggling to me how people can be so disgusting. There is no excuse or appeal ever for pedophilia. I am appalled at what these men had to go through. It's so sad and heartbreaking to see grown men break down crying and feeling violated like that.The concept of this movie was brilliant. It was the first time that I heard of cinema being used as a medium for therapy, and I loved it. Seeing the guys helping each other overcoming each of their own demons was sweet and powerful. I do wish the movie talked a bit more about the effect or mechanism of drama therapy, as this technique should be popular.The pacing can be slow at times, but there were many strong and hopeful moments, especially when we started watching the scenes.Overall, an amazing documentary that was both refreshing and powerful. 8-8.5/10.",False
3,10,Powerful,saysjenn,n/a,16/08/2025,"The premise of Procession using drama therapy as a way to heal from sexual trauma was intriguing but I was cautiously optimistic. I can see now that this therapeutic approach was deeply impactful to all its participants and it impacted me as a viewer.Each short story is powerful and disturbing. I was moved by all the stories. The raw emotion of the survivor who lives through the cake incident. His story is titled ""Blatant Lies In The Name of The lord."" I could really feel his rage.All of the stories really highlighted the manipulation that took place. I can now better understand how memories get repressed.I hope all of them can get some justice. To those who were denied justice, know that your participation in this film will help others.",False
4,10,Don't turn away,lauricebray-70332,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every person - especially every practicing Catholic - needs to see this moving and emotional film. Beautiful in its depth, it shows the heartbreaking, painful journey of men abused as boys by predatory priests, and the uphill battle for justice. The scope of the trauma is vast, and it may shock you to see the continuing whitewash given it by the Vatican. Are those who still dutifully attend Mass and continue to put money into the coffers of the Catholic Church complicit in the ongoing coverup? That is a moral and ethical question each of us must ask ourselves.",False
5,10,"Film as Therapy - Abuse, tragedy and recovery through art",indagar,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary tells the stories of a group of men that survived sexual abused when they were children. Although we could have heard about this topic a lot, this movie tries to focus on the power of telling (filming) our own stories as therapy: maybe they aren't actors or screenwriters but you can see their pain in each scene that is represented.While clearly pointing out the crimes of the Catholic Church, I specially liked how respectful (and beautiful) the narration of the film was.",False
6,10,Heartbreaking,guafa_glam,n/a,16/08/2025,"I couldn't stop crying as I feel the pain from each one of the survivors. A great documentary indeed and that young boy plays the role had such a big responsibility to act, understand and absorb the anger, pain feels by the survivors.It's heartbreaking and I hope catholic archbishop will take serious in matter like this.I am catholic myself and this is not right for everyone, all the authority to turn a blind eyes due to statue of limitations.Something must be done so it won't happen to any children ever again.",False
7,2,Not so authentic!!!,li0904426,n/a,16/08/2025,"I finally managed to pass the 1-hour mark of the documentary ""Procession"" after 3 previously failed attempts. The theme is strong and I have sympathy for the six men, all survivors of childhood sexual assault at the hands of Catholic priests. My rating is specifically for the documentary and not for the topic.I had a hard time watching it from the beginning, because many of the scenes seem forced, very choreographed, with lines and dialogues that don't ring true as they don't sound spontaneous. The whole documentary doesn't feel authentic, nor do the therapy sessions, I don't feel that the six participants are looking for healing because they sound more vengeful.Anyway, this is a terrible story that needs to be shown and heard by many so that it never happens again. From the documentary perspective, I found it weak, they seemed more actors performing their own stories.",False
8,10,Deserves A Ten,gbkimberley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Any documentary based on this subject matter deserves a ten. Any production that is presented by the victims themselves deserves a ten. Every minute viewed, every snippet of the traumatic experiences of these victims that is seen, all of it helps to raise awareness of what happened and what continues to happen within the priesthood. For decades, if not millennia, the priesthood has been the go to profession for sexual predators. Documentaries like these serve to remind us of that fact and should be seen by all those who want justice for the victims and who want the church and it's evil predators brought to account. 10/10.",False
9,10,Powerful documentary,Gringoen,n/a,16/08/2025,Very entertaining and highly professional documentary about the evil church. Production quality is high and the importance of this documentary is amazing...,False
10,10,Jesus looks on,edwin-wks,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is incredible to think that many members of the Catholic community still refuse to acknowledge the systemic rape of children in spite of waves of survivors coming forward with their abuse. Procession is one of the most powerful depiction of the lifelong trauma that historic child sexual abuse survivors have endured and their battle against great odds to hold the Catholic Church accountable for their complicity.The cancerous spread of pedophilic priests in Kansas City is mirrored by Ballarat in Australia, where the Diocese of Ballarat admitted in a statement in 2019 that high-ranking clergy protected one of their own against prosecution for child sexual abuse claims. Even the children knew instinctively that what was happening to them was deeply wrong. Yet these men abused their power, paid no heed to morality and contradicted their own teachings.The pain, shame and anger etched into the faces of each of these men are plain to see. As they recount their abuses, they briefly revert to the boys who were violated and there is a grief for the life they could have had instead. Alongside the depravity of their abuse, there is warm humanity in their brotherhood as they support each other towards healing. Michael said it best, ""people do things for other people sometimes they don't do for themselves"".Pedophilic priests may go much further back in history and it is probably the promise of unfettered power that lured these self-important opportunistic parasites into pursuing priesthood. Hence ironically Catholicism becomes a bastion for amorality and synonymous with pedophilia.",False
11,9,Shame on the Catholic Church,lionelperalta-72339,n/a,16/08/2025,"This has to stop. It's ruined so many lives.Wonderful stories of hope and survival. Kudos to all the survivors in this documentary, they are so brave to do this.",False
12,5,Much needed documentary. Mostly well made.,fitforfaith-ministries,n/a,16/08/2025,"PROS+ Much needed documentary. Mostly well made.+ Great courage of the producers and especially protagonists.NEUTRALo Generally a good concept, but it was sometimes a bit too creative and too improvised. Lots of good approaches which seem to have worked for those men, but it is questionable if it works for others to drive back to a crime scene, and if that could not eventually cause more trauma (or even serious police incidents) for the hundreds or thousands of victims amongst the viewers. They should have added a warning to not imitate such approaches.I found it also troubling that the victims changed roles in this documentary, especially when knowing that many real victims become in real life real perpetrators. Not that there would be any risk with those men, but it could be a risk for victims who see this. Yes, the producer's approach is to shift mental perspectives and to help them through that role reversal, but I never heard of role reversal as a therapeutic approach, nor does this come anywhere close to a biblical approach.CONSLots of excessive swearing. Yes, Mike is authentic and it hurts to see men hurting still after 4 decades. But it is also sad that not one character seems to have found salvation in IESOUS CHRISTOS, to have recognized the evil perversion of the true church through the Roman Catholic State Church after 313 AD.What is the obvious reason there is this institutional church masquerading as followers of CHRISTOS? If there are masquerades, then there must be somewhere truth to be revealed. My prayer is that those men will find the truth, because only this can set them free after all those decades of suffering. If they would only realize that the devil is very good at imitating (as the Bible already warns us of 'The Angel of Light') then they would be very close to the truth that sets them free.",False
13,10,Powerful Move Gets me soooo mad,karenbochinski,n/a,16/08/2025,These men should have never had this happen to them when they were innocent and young. The Catholic Church needs to pay for this. It makes me so upset this clergy too advantage of children. It is sooo wrong.,False
14,10,"Gripping, Soul Destroying, Powerful & Brave",brashbuzz,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerWe didn't even hear close to the worst of what these boys endured. Can you imagine? These appalling acts go unpunished and these Priests remain within the Church until they die? How there is a statute of limitations on Child Abuse or any protections over religious groups or anyone at all inflicting these atrocious crimes is an outright disgrace. It is clearly evident the permanent devastation caused by the deplorable actions and the continual pain re-endured by the victims when they are fobbed off by the church & law enforcement.This documentary was an incredibly well crafted piece and it was inspiring to see the power given back to these victims and to witness them use their voices to shed a new light on the injustices caused to them and so many others whilst also having personal breakthroughs and finding lifelong friends throughout their journey. It was truly a privilege to witness.I wish each and every one of you strength and much love throughout the rest of your journey. We all believe you and wish this had never happened to any child. You all deserve justice and peace in your lives. Thank you for sharing your stories with us.,True
15,10,Truth,bostonappleton,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an excellent Documentary and demonstrates the difficulty bringing Catholic Priests to justice for their Pedophilia. While our Conservative Bishops rule our Church we just have to ignore their teachings on morality. These Bishops belong in prison, but it won't happen. We just ignore them and refuse to give any money to our Church.The Documentary itself shows how six men look back on the crimes that changed their lives forever. They take on the roles of the perpetrators and play out some horrific scenes. At the same time they show the essential indifference from the Vatican and the Kansas Judicial Systems.The perpetrators go without punishment and receive only a slap on the hand from Rome.",False
16,10,Absolutely beautiful,lofongocamille,n/a,16/08/2025,"Profound, one of the best, most touching documentaries I've ever seen.These men's personalities shine bright. They each show tremendous courage in sharing their trauma. You can feel the pain, like it's the hardest thing in the world for them to do, but they speak up anyway. All badasses.The abuse stories show glimpses of the unimaginable horror of religious child sexual abuse, but the true focus of this documentary lies on the men's shared fight to overcome through therapy, honesty, sharing with each other and with us, and art. Their abuse is beautifully and authentically translated into dramatic pieces, which are interwoven throughout in the film.Hearing what happened, visiting locations, creating the scenes and then eventually seeing the finished art pieces, feels like catharsis.It is also very, very painful, as we get an extremely intimate look into the worst moments of these men's lives, moments they need to be freed of.And we witness that fight for freedom. It is such a privilege.The horrible, horrible enablers over at the corrupt, lying, life-destroying higher echelons of the Catholic Church can go suck my tit, because nothing can silence to the powerful message of freedom and brotherhood preached in Procession, whether they want to address it or not.The people who made this movie are heroes, all of them.",False
17,2,Disappointing,Steve131,n/a,16/08/2025,"After so many positive reviews and being raised Catholic myself, I decided to watch this film. To be honest, I had a hard time watching this movie, not because of the content, but the slow movie pace. The story behind this documentary is true. However too much of the movie's time was wasted explaining how they searched for places that they remember from their childhood, and some of the dead ends along their search. The scenes were reenactments using the abused men to play the parts of their abusers, as well as one young actor, playing the role of the men as a child. But again, a lot of boring wasted time watching them rehearse for some of the scenes. I felt the men's pain, yet they did not do much to explain what they went through. The use of the word rape was used once or twice, but other than that there was nothing explicit. We are told that some of them were threatened, with separation from the church or their family, and burning in hell. We also know the boys did not want to be alone with some of the priests. What I didn't hear or see, was father so and so cornered me at such and such a place and tried to grope me, or whatever it is that was done. The acts, the when and where were not really explained very well. Not a visual, as this is a painful documentary, but some explanation. The whole movie just seemed like vengeful condemnation of the entire Catholic church, rather than a healing from the torment done by the bad apples within the church that were their abusers, and those that covered it up! If you want a good movie that tells this story in the way I was expecting, it to be told, I recommend that you watch a 2-part TV move. ""The Boys of St. Vincent"" and ""The Boys of St. Vincent: 15 Years Later"" both from 1992.",False
18,4,OKAY AND NOT OKAY,claytonj-45158,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOKAY: Having their stories acted out was perhaps the beginning of healing; I hope they all find peace and are able to open their hearts. Trauma closes hearts when children are abused, with no support.NOT OKAY: I didn't like the way they loaded their trauma onto the young actor who'd agreed to tell their stories; especially, the screaming man, who screamed ""CUT"" in the middle of a scene. No one acknowledged that could have hurt the actor, Terrick. Terrick said or and over: ""I wasn't expecting that."" No one acknowledged his discomfort.Geezed guys - I hope you didn't traumatize the young actor who was behaving far beyond his years.",True

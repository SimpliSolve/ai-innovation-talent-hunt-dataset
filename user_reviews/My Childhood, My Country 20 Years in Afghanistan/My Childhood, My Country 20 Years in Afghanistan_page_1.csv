1,10,Really worth watching,midya-72490,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gives you a whole other image of the Afghan people. Mir is the cutest little boy who's excited about the simplest things in life. It's interesting to watch him grow up into a man who has to provide for his family in poverty. I hope him and his family manage to escape the taliban rule. All in all, I really enjoyed watching this documentary and would recommend it to anyone!",False
2,5,First hand,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTalk about a release that's of the moment. My Childhood, My Country: 20 Years in Afghanistan was made by Phil Grabsky (who produced and directed several of the Exhibition On Screen films and an early version of this story called The Boy Mir in 2011) and Shoaib Sharifi (who has worked on several films in Afghanistan) to tell the story of Mir, who starts the film as a seven-year-old child who lives in a cave alongside the recently destroyed Buddhas of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan.Over the next two decades, the film follows Mir's journey from boy to man in one of the most damaged parts of the world. By the end of the film, Mir is 27, with children of his own, and he's never known a time when his country was not at war. And now, with the Taliban reclaiming his country, that may never change.So often, we watch the news or read opinions about it online, but we never see what it's like to endure life in wartime as a captive of a country forever in the midst of conflict. This may be the closest we ever get and for that we should feel some level of blessed.",True

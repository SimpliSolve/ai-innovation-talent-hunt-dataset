1,9,Improvising Freedom,pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Soundtrack to a Coup d'État"" feels more like a jam session of ideas and emotions than a straightforward history lesson. Directed by Belgian filmmaker Johan Grimonprez, the documentary blends music, politics, and collective memory to transport us to post-independence Congo and dive into the tragedy of Patrice Lumumba's fall. It's a powerful mosaic where every element-from archival footage to the jazz-heavy soundtrack-contributes to a dynamic portrait of a historic moment filled with promises, betrayals, and echoes that still resonate today.Right from the start, the film sets its tone by weaving vibrant footage of newly independent Congo with electrifying performances by jazz legends like Nina Simone and Louis Armstrong. The music isn't just background noise-it's a crucial part of the narrative, capturing both the optimism and the chaos of that era. Grimonprez uses jazz as a living metaphor for the political and social improvisation that defined the struggle for independence amidst Western powers' scheming. Every off-key note and unexpected pause mirrors the turbulence of a Congo striving to shape its own future while external forces worked to keep it chained to the past.The documentary's non-linear structure is utterly fascinating, jumping between decades, events, and cultural contexts. This approach might feel disorienting at first, but it's a deliberate choice that reflects the complex history Grimonprez aims to unravel. There's no attempt to smooth over or simplify the narrative; instead, the film demands your full attention, pushing the audience to deeply engage with the events on screen. This fragmented style is also a reminder that colonialism and its aftermath aren't linear stories-they're scars that continue to branch out, connect, and reverberate.At the heart of the film is Patrice Lumumba, a pulsating symbol of hope and tragedy. Grimonprez emphasizes his revolutionary vision and martyrdom without holding back. Lumumba is portrayed as a messianic figure, a leader whose dream of a sovereign Congo and a unified Pan-Africanism was as inspiring to his people as it was threatening to colonial powers. Here, the film takes on a heavier tone, showing how his vision was systematically dismantled through calculated assassinations, coups, and political manipulation.Grimonprez also masterfully examines the intersections of culture and politics. The tours of musicians like Armstrong and Simone are contextualized as part of Western powers' soft diplomacy strategies, while the music they performed in turn became a form of cultural resistance. This duality-of artists often unknowingly serving imperialist interests while their songs inspired revolutionary movements-is one of the documentary's most tragic and thought-provoking aspects.Perhaps the film's greatest strength lies in its ability to turn historical facts into a visceral experience. Its sharp editing connects archival footage of Lumumba's speeches, contemporary Congo scenes, and modern ads from brands like Tesla and Apple, drawing provocative parallels between colonial exploitation and present-day systems of extraction and inequality. It's a stark reminder that history doesn't just repeat itself-it evolves, often disguising its predatory core.Even with its hefty runtime of 150 minutes, the film rarely loses its momentum. If the pacing occasionally feels slower, it's due to the sheer density of the material rather than any narrative misstep. Grimonprez seems more interested in overwhelming the audience with information than delivering a neatly packaged story. While this can be exhausting, it's immensely rewarding for those willing to dive into its depths.Ultimately, ""Soundtrack to a Coup d'État"" isn't just a tribute to Lumumba or a study of Congo's past. It's a call to reflect on how music, culture, and politics are intertwined in a constant cycle of oppression and resistance. This is a film that challenges us to look beyond the headlines and listen to the stories that linger in the spaces between the notes-stories of struggle, loss, and the relentless pursuit of freedom.",False
2,9,Moves Like Jazz,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"What do jazz and a Coup d'Etat in Central Africa have in common? This documentary by Belgian filmmaker Johan Grimonprez uses a wide selection of historic footage to tell the story, spy thriller style. From American jazz greats such as Louis Armstrong and Nina Simone performing in Africa as good-will ambassadors, to on-the-ground scenes in the Congo as a Coup dÉtat brewed, powerful images fill the screen in rapid sequence. The narrative moves fast for 2 hours and 30 minutes, fusing music, sound, images and graphics to create a new kind of film. Although scenes were shot over half a century ago, the film feels fresh, urgent and contemporary.This is not a ""casual watching"" kind of movie. I am glad I watched at home, because I had to stop and rewind a few times. At the end of the intense 150 minutes, one feels they experienced an immersion into a period of history through contemporary eyes, a rewarding dive. Brilliantly researched and edited, a Sundance Cinematic Innovation award recipient and Oscar nominee for Best Documentary, this film moves like jazz.",False
3,8,Should be shown in schools,golfcruise,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whereas a documentary of this caliber on the direct-to-streaming aisle would incorporate your basic interviews and archival footage with little to no forethought, Soundtrack to a Coup d'État is a rallying cry within a musical odyssey. Hyperfast editing and a symphonic pace make this visual essay so special, resembling jazz's rigid but unforgettable structure. Vastly covering the Congo's struggle for independence (with jazz giants being the preface)- the inherent timeliness to today's genocidal crimes reflects a period not too astray from ours.At times it may seem like the gargantuan presence of information overwhelms the viewer into submission, but rest assured the film continues its tapestry of bedazzlement all the way through. This is how historical documentaries should be made. Lessons will be learned, techniques will be seen. Enthralling from beginning to end, Soundtrack to a Coup d'État must not be missed. A charming, distinctive gateway for those yearning to learn more about deep-seated neocolonialism.",False
4,10,TRULY EXCELLENT LIFE-CHANGING DOCUMENTARY,peter-49291,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two and a half hours an not a moment of boredom. The story (or stories) it tells are amazing, the punches to the gut are well-spaced out, like a boxer wearing down his/her opponent until the final KO. Maybe the best music documentary ever? Certainly one of the most substantial. May only regret is not having time to note down all the books whose titles flashed up on screen in accompaniment of the many quotations, like on-screen footnotes. All in all, a wonderful film which unfortunatley I will never forget.That was the review, but more words are required. This was at the San Sebastian International Festival. Big screen is beswt, I reckon, because it will force you to concentrate.Thanks to all concerned in the making of this film.",False
5,10,A masterpiece,ACoolStory,n/a,16/08/2025,"During my life on the European continent, in a wealthy country that has benefitted enormously through the ages by suppressing other cultures, the stories of peoples enduring this suppression have been supressed enough that a story of this magnitude can suddenly struck you into silence.A breathtaking musical journey depicting the rise and fall of the first Premier of Congo, Mr. Patrice Lumumba, showing the atrocities that the powers that be had to commit to steer history into a different direction.I would like to implore anyone who hasn't seen this, to view this at your own peril, because this powerful documentary can blow your mind.",False
6,9,Art meets politics,labolts,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is a mishmash of beautiful composed edits using American jazz music to carry the content through its highs and lows.There's 2 hours plus of significant content. That can be daunting to those unfamiliar with US foreign policy in Congo or in the western reactions to post colonialism. Still it's beautifully done. And it will hopefully raise more awareness in America's use of soft power especially in foreign country regime change.Congo is the main focus of the documentary but it's a symbol of many other countries including those in Africa, Latin America and Asia. If anything this should start conversations in how entertainers are used by governments to fulfill foreign affairs.",False
7,n/a,Sterling entertaining Doc about a serious subject with great music,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SOUNDTRACK TO A COUP D'ETAT (2024) Nominated for Best Documentary Feature. Johan Grimonprez' dynamic, densely layered Documentary is ostensibly about the Coup in the Republic of Congo in 1960 which dethroned Patrice Lumumba, but it extends further into the cultural and long-term political instability in the region.Grimonprez blends Jazz and Blues with readings from several works on the subject as well as a generous amount newsreel footage to provide the 'Soundtrack'. It is the music which provides the ebb and flow of the film by the likes of Nina Simone, Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Abbey Lincoln, Duke Ellington, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus and Ornette Coleman. Max Roach's impassioned drumming is its blistering heartbeat. The graphics of the title card and on the posters evoke the style of Jazz and Blues records of that era.Grimonprez' work is rigorously sourced with on screen annotations and references. Sometimes, it's all a bit too fast and furious to take it all in, but this is a highly engaging Doc which is riveting for its full 150 minutes. Many of the musicians were in the forefront of exposing the U. S. government's involvement in the overthrow. The Soviet Union's Nikita Khrushchev of all persons comes off as one of independent Congo's greatest defenders (of course, with major ulterior motives of his own). The clips of his colorful U. N. antics are given significantly better context here than usual. In addition to the CIA, the usually thought of as peaceful nation of Belgium stands as the villains of the piece.SOUNDTRACK OF A COUP D'ETAT dares to be 'entertaining', but it's never less than thoughtful, thorough and provocative. A sterling Documentary.",False
8,9,When Jazz and Revolutionary Thinking Collide,AntonyCirocco001,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat"" by Director Johan Grimonprez, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in Jan 2024. It brings the slick world of mid-50s Jazz to the spy genre with a revolutionary feel in a way never seen before. Some of the key subjects in the film are Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Nikita Khrushchev, Walt Disney, and Dwight Eisenhower. It's a big budget archival film mostly comprising of 16mm news footage. In Australia, you can see it on DocPlay.The film follows political events and scientific discoveries in relation to uranium and the atomic bomb. After the British and the Americans moved to lock in to Uranium in the Congo. The link to Jazz begins with Gillespie's musical tours of the ""problem posts,"" to quote Quincy Jones, Gillespie's tour manager, as they toured far-flung places like Iran and the Middle East. Eventually, this tour led him to the Congo. A time of African independence, and the first United Nations peacekeeping force was deployed to Egypt. Nina Simone makes an appearance, sent to Nigeria, sent secretly by the CIA. It's an intriguing and dense documentary with many layers to delve into symbolically and in terms of espionage.Want to read more, google - perspective documentary reviews.",False
9,7,Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a serious testament to the archivist's art as it pieces together an impressive array of imagery of the great and the good of American Jazz and combines that with some intimate actuality of the turbulence ongoing in the Congo as it strived for independence. Why might anyone care about the future of an impoverished African nation that had all but bankrupted it's ""owner"" - King Leopold II of Belgium? Well that's because it holds enormous deposits of the uranium required by both the West and the Soviets - and that's just the start of it's reputedly $23 trillion worth of mineral assets. Emerging from the populace to lead this new country is Patrice Lumumba. He's an articulate man who unlike so many who took their nations out of colonial-hood, is not constantly bedecked in medals and ribbons with armed men at his back. What we see over the next couple of hours uses a superb musical soundtrack from the likes of Nina Simone, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis - you name it, to provide a backdrop to CIA shenanigans, petulant strops from Nikita Khruschev, accusatory comments from just about everyone from Malcolm X to Fidel Castro and some extremely cynical insights into the Eisenhower presidency's approach to this man; to the problems he may bring or solve and to the precedents he was bound to set. As you'll expect, this freedom fight is tied-in closely with the fight for desegregation and equal/human rights for African American people and it uses that platform to illustrate just how ineffective the US-dominated United Nations was at brokering anything akin to a peaceable solution that was in anyway neutral or beneficial to the populace of this vast territory. The secession of Katanga - where the mining was at it's more lucrative and the privatisation of it's principal enterprise ensured that the West still pulled the strings, sets the tone for the final phase of the history and it's tragic conclusion. I knew some of this but I wasn't aware of just how exploitatively the American administration used unwitting people, many globally recognised household hames and who were still treated as second-class citizens (if citizens at all) at home, to peddle a political message of brotherhood and unity in Africa and at just how effective these deceptions were whilst the CIA experimented with new ways of assassinating. There's an arrogance here that's writ large as the local population are treated with a casual disdain that makes your flesh crawl. Fans of jazz will love the accompaniment which mixes some characterful performances of the more famous pieces of music from the genre with some more specifically written and delivered themes that directly address the issues of slavery, exploitation and freedom that led to a protest within the impotent General Assembly chamber itself. It is curious that many of the criticisms levelled at the UN in the mid 1960s are just as valid today, and that little progress as been made changing the format that was established by world powers in the 1940s whose ""permanent"" roles embedded in the political infrastructure remain unaffected sixty years later. This isn't a film about corporate greed, it's one about political influence and domination and has been thoughtfully put together to open a hornet's nest. Did you know that Dizzy Gillespie actually ran for US President?",False
10,7,"Brilliant work, great music, too long",steiner-sam,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a documentary on the birth of the Republic of Congo and the assassination of its first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. The approach incorporates much film footage from about 1950 to the early 1960s, juxtaposing the music and comments of leading jazz musicians of the era with contemporary news footage. Particular emphasis is placed on the various political machinations at the United Nations by Nikita Khrushchev, Dwight Eisenhower, Adlai Stevenson, and other world leaders, including Fidel Castro and Malcolm X.At some levels, ""Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat"" is an intelligent and brilliant work with an incredible musical score. However, it takes too long to make the fundamental connection between the American jazz musicians and Patrice Lumumba. When it finally does, it's highly effective, but a half hour could easily have been edited from the final production.",False
11,7,An innovative and powerful if too long,dngoldman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This smart, sophisticated documentary traces the improbably rise to power and eventual CIA-led assassination of Patrice Lumumba, the first prime minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo, who was elected in May 1960, shortly before his country gained its independence from Belgium. Congo, a country rich with natural resources that were vital, among other things, to Western countries' weapons of war, had been colonized by Belgium since the late 19th century. This sad tale is the sadly predictable part of the story. Grimonprez puts these events in the context of the U. S. own black empowerment movement. Perhaps as sad as the political aspects, the way the US government uses and discards black artists is also sad. The film is patched together with the style and rhythm of bebop jazz artists interspersed throughout the documentary. The film is generally an entertaining and effective direction of colonialism. But it does have flaws. It's too long, apparently paired down from an even longer film. And while the film is right to include Khrushchev and Castro because they attracted both African leaders and African American's inligenciA. But the failure to put these figures without even hinting at their own hypocrisy undercuts the moral weight of the film. Yet the film is still well worth watching for its wide-ranging take on Western colonialism and innovative structure.",False
12,6,"Ambitious, interesting subject, but falls short due to style over substance approach.",hectorcombe-74349,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, in the end this closes as a really powerful story. However the journey we are brought along to get there feels quite unsatisfying and underdeveloped. There is too much focus on flashy presentation amd style, and not enough time given to flesh out the notable persons, their stories, motivations etc. For example the central figure Patrice Lumuba, we finish the film still not really knowing not a lot about him, other than the surface details. The middle part of the films should've settled down into talking heads with the
occasional stylistic flourishes interspersed.Also the jazz connection seems a bit bolted on, doesn't really seem that key to the coup detat and United nations events. Or if it is connected then care is not taken to explain why. Although I did find it cool to have jazz music going on throughout the film.Overall, still a very cool and and ambitious concept. But perhaps labours under it's own concept too much rather than just telling the story. Could easily cut 20 mins off the runtime.",False
13,5,Overlong and Hard To Follow Despite Its Relevance,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Perhaps the most important objective of a documentary is to shed light on a subject and make it comprehensible and insightful for viewers, especially when it involves little-known material. However, when it comes to writer-director Johan Grimonprez's latest offering, that goal is sorely compromised in multiple respects. The film examines (or, more precisely, attempts to examine) the complex history of the Congo's struggle for independence from its Belgian colonial masters and the emergence of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba as a global influencer in the 1950s and early 1960s. The fledgling, resource-rich nation became a flashpoint in international politics on various fronts, including the Cold War between East and West, the rise of the pan-African movement, the ongoing decline of colonial imperialism and the role of the United Nations in global affairs. Its impact also extended into American politics, particularly the birth and growth of the civil rights movement and its impact on leaders like Malcolm X, as well as the Eisenhower Administration's veiled efforts at protecting the status quo, especially through seemingly benign cultural programs like goodwill exchanges involving popular Black jazz musicians. Many threads are thus involved in telling this tale, but, regrettably, they're not coherently managed, particularly in the picture's opening hour (of a surprisingly and arguably somewhat needlessly overlong 2:30:00 runtime). The filmmaker throws a lot of widely diverse material at his audience without coherent, meaningful explanation, and much of that involves reading a series of cryptic screen graphics that fly by hastily with little elaboration, a process that quickly becomes aggravating, frustrating and tiresome, even for the most adept subtitle readers. Then there's the jazz aspect of this release, whose connection to the narrative isn't always made clear or relevant, despite its addition of an element of artistic flair. However, these performance sequences - as entertaining and poignant as they are - ultimately do more to promote the film's style than its substance, To its credit, ""Soundtrack to a Coup d'Etat"" becomes more cogent (albeit somewhat politically oversimplified) as it moves forward, but, by that point, audiences may well have lost patience with it (I was admittedly on the verge of turning it off myself after the opening 60 minutes, something I generally never do). It's also obvious that the material here was exceedingly well researched and incorporates a wealth of revelatory archive footage, both from journalistic and jazz performance sources, qualities definitely worthy of commendation. However, a more fluid, better organized telling of this tale (especially one that doesn't skip around out of temporal sequence) would have helped immeasureably, as would have a better elucidated nexus between its political and musical aspects. There's clearly an important story to be told here, but this isn't the vehicle for doing so.",False
14,5,Incredible story but the documentary is too overstimulating for my liking,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.I understand the main purposes and the importance of what the documentary is trying to explore and tell. While there are some wonderful graphic design presentation, conversations, and visual presentation, the 2 hour 30 minute runtime feels unjustified and the structure of the documentary feels messy.Many of the themes and topics explored are interesting which themes of jazz, decolonization and the conflicts between the country is interesting. I enjoyed some of the musical sound choices and some of the discussions explored. But I found myself unable to fully invest to the story because it felt as if the filmmaker was creating a style over substance situation. Where certain aspects felt uncooked and a bit missing and it was focused too much on the technical aspects.For 2 hours and 30 minutes, the documentary feels too stretched to be fully satisfied. Overall, good intentions but not for me.",False

This documentary shows exactly how MST manipulates poor and humble people into their criminal shceme.The MST movement is a criminal, tiranical, doctorial group with no legal identification that acts out law breaking into private property and claiming it as their own; as the movement doesn't have a legal identical (in Brazil referred to as CNPJ) that makes it easier for they to act out of law.As we have a comunist president, PT allows MST to act so they can get these manipulated people to vote for the party the owns MST.We need this movie in international movie theaters asap!God bless everyone involved in this production.",False
2,10,"MST, The Promised Land",JenifferM-4,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is amazing. If you're into political corruption, civil war, cults, human rights, farming, and Yellowstone, you'l like this.As a Brazilian, I've always had a bad impression of MST, PT, and governmental institutions. Now I know I wasn't crazy.It's very informational and shows how people are still enslaved and tricked into MST with governmental support and protection.In my state, we've had MST try to invade land. When it came up on the news, they didn't show how the owners were affected, nor the aftermath of the invasion. The documentary shows in detail what happens to the real owners and how they lose it all, how the current government, politicians, and institutions play such a big role, and how they benefit from the invasions with votes and money laundering. The things revealed are shocking. It's a total must-watch.",False
3,10,The truth,rventriscordeiro,n/a,15/08/2025,"Precise about one of the Brazilian Cancer which the country has been suffering for years. It is clear and didactic to understand how a complex and delicate problem deals with people's lives leaving them alone in a miserable reality. Besides all the sad stories, this document shows that now Brazil is ready to talk about this issue. Today Brazil has got ""human politicians"" who know how to address the solution and give directions for the possibility of a different future where humble families can have back their dignity as people, as Brazilians and eventually, God's children. This documentary is undoubtedly a must for everyone.",False

5,10,MST the truth,Ana-1781,n/a,15/08/2025,Important documentary to reveal the true and sordid interests of the PT and the MST! May it be enlightening for many laymen who understand nothing about Brazilian politics. Humble people being used by this cancer that is the Workers' Party. Stagnant lives while some get rich off the suffering of the less fortunate! People need to be free in their thinking and understand that the PT and the MST tell you about freedom and prosperity but in reality they make you a slave to their ideology!May this documentary reach the world and especially the Brazilian youth who today follow the Marxist ideology and a large part of them wear MST caps without even understanding what this policy actually entails in the lives of humble people who once believed they were being welcomed! Very well-crafted documentary!,False

8,10,Must watch - the true cancer that's rotting Brazil,CarlosV-581,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lauded by celebrities as some type of mythical social movement fighting a worthwhile fight, MST's true face is exposed in this magnificent documentary. The similarities with terrorist organizations, as well as its parasitic nature and close ties with the deep state and political parties (mainly PT), are portrayed here. If you're not Brazilian, it's worth watching; if you live in Brazil, it's mandatory. From its origins to the current state of things, the most comprehensive overview of this criminal organization, its leadership and its ties to power. Kudos to Brasil Paralelo for another brilliantly produced documentary.",False
9,10,Stunning!,mathgomesalves,n/a,15/08/2025,"You don't need to have a political or religious opinion to know what is right or wrong - these are not synonyms...
In this film, we see the selfish, arbitrary perspective of a few who destroy the lives of many.Exploiting the misery of a group to use them as a political tool is an unprecedented lack of humanity.Lula, PSOL, PT need to be extinguished, not in the name of democracy, but for its survival in the country...
In the film, we can observe how these groups act, how the occupations unfold, and the serious consequences both for the occupiers and the landowners. One of the key pillars of freedom is the right to private property; without that, we are a dictatorship beautifully painted by artists and left-wing politicians as a beautiful 'Democracy'.",False
10,10,The truth revealed,MarcioK-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very important documentary about a brazilian ""social movement"" that shows that the land sharing in Brazil is nothing but a falacy, a way to spread ideology and mantain the political power by the same people ever.Its very sad to see that the institutions are used to spread fear among the small and powerless farm producers, taking their land to put in the hands of a political ideology system.It should be taken to every single school in Brazil, it has o be delivered to all politicians and it would be very interesting if streamed out of the BP plataform, where it is only being distributed.Every single person in this schem should be arrested and forgoten in prison.",False
11,10,Brazil is not for amateurs and innocents,BiancaC-98,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"".The unfortunate reality of Brazilian families with very low incomes who are deceived and used as pawns by unscrupulous people who only want their own gains and to keep the social, political and economic system in their favor.It is a shame that part of society does not understand the suffering of these people. There is no dignity or freedom in living this way.And even if the government granted them land, which in reality does not happen, they would still not be able to make something productive out of the land, because this requires capital to invest and, over time, generate a cash flow to make the activity economically sustainable. In addition to land, they lack credit, which will only be given to them when they have documented land.",False
12,1,Trash,ProfessorR-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis Brasil Paralelo documentary is a disservice: shallow, biased, and clearly made for those who buy simplistic narratives from the Brazilian far-right. Just another cheap product trying to distort the MST's struggle with empty and prejudiced speeches. Another waste of time. It's amazing how BP tries to fool fools.",True
13,10,Invading land is a crime in Brazil!!,LeilsonO,n/a,15/08/2025,"Invading land is a crime in Brazil?This documentary makes it clear how left-wings artists and politician uses de masses to take financial advantage of our chaos.If this is a crime, why does the current left-wing government help?Our current president was called a thief by his vice president.Nothing surprises me anymore!!The last election was the most complex in our history. Criminal factions the press and artists brought the ex convict to the crime scene.Farms have been invaded hundreds of time, the invaders cut the cattle's legs and let them bleed to death, vandalize machinery and crops causing fear to the landowners.May God protect us!!",False
14,10,The truth about MST in Brazil,JidieneD,n/a,15/08/2025,"I recommend! A well-produced, objective documentary that exposes real facts that shed light on the true face of the MST. Every school in Brazil should show this documentary to its students. Congratulations to the producers and everyone who participated in this project! Unfortunately, former MST participants do not have space in the media to speak the truth about such an important subject. Knowledge sets you free! I really recommend this documentary.

People need to understand that what is shown by the media is not always true. This video shares a bit of the truth.We've been living a lie. That's why it's so important that we open our eyes to the truth.",False
16,10,Must see!,RichardG-826,n/a,15/08/2025,"This isn't about political opinion or ideology. It's about being human and preserving great human values. Even if you are not brazilian you must watch this movie that will reveal what's happening behind the scenes of our country. It's a great movie and really necessary specially nowadays.It contains a lot of speeches from people who worked inside of the movement showing how they use miserable people living in extremely poor conditions to achieve their goals and discard them afterwards. Besides that, they show how these people get brainwashed during those movements and get used to elect some kind of politicians. It's definitely a great documentary and you must see!",False
17,1,Documentary created by a manipulative and shameless platform,GabrielaM-43,n/a,15/08/2025,"The MST is one of the most influential social movements in Latin America, and its work goes far beyond land occupations. Rooted in the fight for agrarian reform, the MST organizes the occupation of large rural properties that fail to fulfill their social function, as defined by the Brazilian Constitution. These actions aim to pressure the government to expropriate unproductive land and redistribute it to landless families.Once land is secured, the MST helps establish settlements, dividing plots, encouraging collective or family-based farming, and supporting the creation of cooperatives. But the movement is not only about land - it's also about education, dignity, and sustainability.The MST promotes a powerful model of popular education, running its own schools and partnering with universities. Their educational philosophy is deeply inspired by Paulo Freire, emphasizing critical thinking and liberation.When it comes to food production, the MST is a leader in agroecology - sustainable, pesticide-free agriculture. It is currently the largest producer of organic food in Brazil, offering high-quality products at fair prices through its cooperatives and local markets.Politically active, the movement organizes peaceful protests, marches, and negotiations with the state to demand policies that support rural workers, education, and food sovereignty.Whether you agree or not with their methods, the MST is a powerful example of organized grassroots resistance and a key player in Brazil's social and agricultural history.",False

1,1,Deserves a 0,lilytaylor-57314,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a half done ""documentary"" with a bias that shows that no REAL research was done. It is clear that the person who edited and approved this did not watch the trial.",False
2,1,Another hit piece,amalia297,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a bias hit piece. The only thing we see it's that you're blind to the true. How can you media support such a lier? Please stop twisting the true.. We saw the trial alive, that's why we don't trust the media anymore.",False
3,1,Such a joke.,michal-50595,n/a,16/08/2025,"This whole thing is such a ridiculous joke and NBC, as well of all the people in this ""documentary"" are just making fools of themselves. They clearly think we're the fools who'll believe them, but we actually saw the rial and the evidence, so we won't fall for it. Either they really are that dumb and oblivious that they actually believe what they're saying, or they're just ignorant or in denial or both. What they are doing with this ""documentary"" is an insult to real survivors, it's an insult to Johnny Depp who is a real survivor, and it's an encouragement to women who lie about such serious matters. Not to mention, you're going to make it much harder to believe real victims who come forward in the future. You should all be ashamed of yourself for feeding into her lies and deceptions and for giving her a platform to keep spreading them.",False
4,1,Not a real documentary,kittybissell,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSave your time- this is not a true doc about the case. It can only be described as a hit piece, and it should win an award for its creative use of edits. It shows AH ""crying"" and telling of horrible things, plus some of her ""evidence"" but it does not go into the rebuttals or the context. Nor does it give Depp equal time re his own testimony and evidence of abuse. We are shown Breaking News correspondent Doha Madani's supposedly live ""shocked"" reaction when she sees the verdict- but she is not even watching the courtroom feed, she's just being texted the news that Depp won. Some crack breaking news reporting there! And of course Elaine Bredehoft was eager to come on for even more of her 15 minutes.Overall- the title says ""A Marriage on Trial"", but that's not what it's about. It continues the narrative that this will somehow harm female dv victims. And it also continues the recent msm obsession with going after social media (including youtubers) for supposedly influencing public opinion- but it does not explain how said social media might have influenced the verdict.",True
5,1,A news media ew!!!,sgtjdxmmr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why!? Why are theses media companies giving her more of a voice to lie! It was so evident to everyone who watched the trial that she was not honest. And those people had to go to social media to figure out why news media was spinning A narrative that look good for Amber! It's so crazy, the gaslighting is so obvious and people are so over it!!!",False
6,1,NBC has some gall!,ForgetTheANT,n/a,16/08/2025,"You'd think after their earlier disaster pieces that they would have taken a little more time putting this one together, but maybe they were in crisis mode, and therefor weren't thinking clearly. How do you keep managing to make yourself look worse? If they had stuck with the original Savannah Guthrie interview (before the Dateline edit that changed whole sentences into completely different questions and answers) --then NBC would have at least SOME remaining credibility left.I don't know if it's a case of doubling down on the horse they unwisely backed in this race, or the fact that they smelled money to be had off this case (which is somehow different then the ""greedy"", ""attention-seeking"" social media coverage), but the fact remains that this so-called documentary only tarnishes NBC's image in an age where traditional media should be doing more to prove their trustworthiness.",False
7,1,NBC is totally bias/pro Amber,dinagloriawhite,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't wish this type of person man or woman on anyone. I honestly think Amber Heard is a lesbian deep down but she's too much of a somatic narcissist to deny herself the chance to use wealthy men to her benefit. She wanted Johnny to further her career and she wanted Elon to Father her child so she'd have bragging rights to having a child with one of the wealthiest men in the world (using the child as a pawn).The fact that she hasn't let this go and this whole experience has not humbled her in the slightest, is downright frightening. She has had many years of wealth and access to therapy and not sure if there's help for personality disorders this severe... but I hope she can find the right help for her child's sake and learn from her mistakes.",False
8,1,Total waste of time,upamadeori,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was a badly researched , terribly edited and hastily put together. Regardless of what the world witnessed, this was a juvenile attempt by NBC to re-write history and spin the truth.",True
9,1,Disgusting and flat out lies.,kcorrine,n/a,16/08/2025,"You should be ashamed of yourselves. You do realize 90% of the WORLD watched the actual trial... right?? You realize people got to see lie after lie after lie and doctored photos etc... LIVE as it unfolded.Amber HERSELF contradicted herself many times. And no, there isn't a conspiracy from Johnny's side to make Amber look bad. He doesn't need to! She's doing a splendid job all by herself!! Oh and let's not forget the completely unbelievable acting by Amber on the stand...She needs to take the loss, spend some time finding herself, spend some time with her daughter and move on with her life.Junk like this is only making her look worse, it's ALSO making YOU look bad. Congrats on the probably the lowest rating on imdb. Are you dizzy from all that spinning?",False
10,1,History yet again repeats itself - Gaslighting at its' prime,cpbaby-65799,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is yet one in a million examples as to how We as Americans cannot trust anything the media says or publishes. When you have journalists twist sentences or recordings or reconstruct what someone is saying to benefit your own agenda is complete confirmation bias and gaslighting.Their agenda clearly seemed to be all about believing and stating that JD was the perpetrator and AH is the victim. Anyone that watched the trial and has a rational or logical perspective on reality, will tell you this was not the case at all. In fact, this is the exact opposite of what NBC is proposing. I'm not stating JD is a saint, but history always has a way of repeating itself. JD has had no records to committing violence, but rather has been the victim prior to his relationship with AH - specifically with his mom. On AH's side, she has a history of being violent with her partners and has even been arrested for it.However, NBC takes it to an entirely new level by stating JD's win on the case hurts DA victims and supports the abusers. I could not be more disgusted nor angered by this insinuation. I have been assaulted and never reported it because I was fearful of what people would say or how they would treat me thereafter. However, seeing JD win his defamation case (mind you, when he's already at a disadvantage for being a male victim) felt like not only a win for him, but a win to me and to several other real victims.Her actions and complete neglect to tell the actual truth is what is infringing on real victims to come forward and speak up about his/her abuse. Take responsibility for your actions.",False
11,1,What is this garbage?,christesch-43249,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'll make this short and sweet. Did a single person on the NBC staff watch the trial THEY live streamed? You'd think they didn't after making and airing this disaster of a ""documentary"" that skirts the truth to say the least. Social media didn't have anything to do with my opinion. I WATCHED the trial. Thanks for assuming the public are all stupid and couldn't form our own opinions. Big bad social media made us do it huh? Well you're no better NBC.",False

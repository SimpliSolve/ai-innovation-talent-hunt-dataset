1,7,Each on his own path in life,Cravisx,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBeautiful pictures of Mount Athos, that's about it. Otherwise, everything is too intimate, too forced questions, even stupid, he is either naive in reality or naive for the sake of the movie. I don't get it.The director was the person with the temptation like the devil in the wilderness, a kind of devil's advocate. He tried to awaken in his father a person who is no longer relevant to the life of a monk, again, a little unkind.The father gave him wise and sufficient answers, it is clear that he has the spirit of prayer. To be glad that he has a father who lives with the saints! It's a great thing to have someone in the family as a monk.It is a film edited in a subjective way and It makes you understand that the father is the culprit in this whole movie, at least that's what he wants to achieve in a way.In the end it seems that everything was forced for the sake of the movie. Once again, some scenes from Mount Athos are very beautiful.However, I think that the frame with his semi nude's wife pose and their child at the end was not necessary, again, too forced and too intimate.",True
2,10,"Impactful, heartfelt, authentic",mirceavadan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a movie which expresses very well one of the dramas of our generation (and possibly every generation). It is definitely worth watching as it's a mirror of our souls in an authentic, heartfelt and vulnerable way. On one side we have our parents who don't know how to deal with their feelings and are having a hard time making peace with their past mistakes, while on the other side, we, their children, being in a struggle to connect emotionally with our parents and heal our joint traumas in order to gain the inner peace.",False
3,10,On a journey you need to know where you come from,Val_N_Tin,n/a,16/08/2025,"In some ways we are carbon copies of our parents. My mistakes are my father's mistakes before me. His choices are the example that guide me on his footsteps.A young father tries to understand his father's choice, so he can break the cycle and be there for his child.Heartwarming tale of one's quest to understand his past without a judgement.",False
4,10,A story about journeys,florinaianus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Emotional story of parents to be, parents and grandparents.
We are all somebody's child. And we all live with our own demons and internal struggles. Andrei managed to capture all this in the most authentic way. Many of us will relate to the story on so many levels.
85 minutes of emotions, uneasiness, giggles, laughters, tears.
Thank you Andrei and Paula, for sharing your journey with the world. Ana Sofia is the most beautiful reason to become the best version of yourselves.",False
5,10,"emotional, intimate, personal",mariasimonaarsu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found myself exposed in many ways watching this documentary that feels more like an artistic movie. The most important thing that got my attention after watching it is the fact that i started asking myself uncomfortable questions, regarding my own family. I may be subjective after seeing all of his productions but everything Andrei Dascalescu does, touches my soul in honest and direct ways.I cannot wait to see his evolution as a director and surely, who knows, as a father.",False
6,10,"Every boy wants to grow up to be like his father, but what if your father isn't present?",dienuza,n/a,16/08/2025,An emotional journey into understanding parenthood. Parents are supposed to guide us into adulthood and becoming good parents ourselves when it is time. But in real life this relationship is rarely so simple. This slice-of-life documentary bravely tackles issues in parent-child relationship. Those who are familiar with the beloved Constantin and Elena will get the chance to see them on screen again!,False
7,10,Personal story,danielbarnuti,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very intimate and emotional Family story, going on three generations",False
8,5,Hmm...,philip-00197,n/a,16/08/2025,"As I write this review there are only five other written reviews on Holy Father - all of them rewarding it with ten stars. Most of the reviewers have only ever written one review (and none of them have reviewed more than three). As long as IMDB steers reasonably clear from disinformation and represents ""honest opinions"" it is a useful tool in guiding us through the overwhelming amount of choices we have at our disposal.The story of parents emotionally under delivering to their children may be a universal topic - it is, however one Dascalescu doesn't deliver particularly well. The narrative feels more driven by personal disappointment than trying to convey a message with documentary qualities. In so doing the ability to identify and empathise is greatly diminished.Under all accounts it is hard to take in that anybody, genuinely, feels that 10/10 represents a reasonable assessment of Holy Father.",False
9,10,Brillantly crisp in sight and in depth of Life,kyleroberts,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen I read the headline beneath the title, I immediately said to myself, OMG this movie is about me. I've been searching for my lost father, my whole life (only that mine passed away when I was a teen).Then I saw the movie and I can't hold my admiration to the courage of the author to ""exploit"" so honestly his life, in this interactive, public diary chapter.Well done, Andrei!!!I totally love the image, the editing, the ""script"", the ending, the flow of the relationship with your dad.It seemed like a soothing process for both your soul and your dad's soul. Lots of gratitude to your partner who accepted to shine so naturally in your creation (I mean Paula). Of course, Ana Sofia just entered the stage. :-) God bless all of you! And thank you a million times for inspiring me with your story. You probably just changed my life (and I am in my 40s - right on time for a new path ;-) ).",True

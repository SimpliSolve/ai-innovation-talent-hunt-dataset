1,7,Exploring Genuine Possibilities,JoshuaMercott,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCNN Films has contributed something significant with ""The Hunt for Planet B"". This docu was a pitch-perfect tour through one of the darkest futures we can envision for the human species.Judging by how things currently stand, ""The Hunt for Planet B"" possessed more truths than I'd expected. Plenty of notable personalities, scientists, and professionals lent their voices to this remarkable documentary.Paul Leonard-Morgan did great work on musical scoring for this one. Robert Richman and Vassili Spiropoulos contributed some memorable cinematography work. Sabine Krayenb√ºhl's editing was aces. Michael Wharton's VFX was neat and precise. Good work by all other crew members.The docu focused on a region of space where seven planets are presently orbiting a Red Star named Trappist-1., among which planet 'e' is the most viable candidate. They came across this location when signals transmitted in the '70s were only now arriving at that spot in space, finally granting scientists a look at what's out there in the cosmos that could help provide us a new home.I loved the way they used Dr. Carl Sagan's words to highlight the documentary - that man was a visionary, in the strictest sense of the word. Plenty of scientific elements were included, and I admire the team for doing just that.Plenty of hope rests with the James Webb Space Telescope that recently launched. They covered some interesting people and moments around this event.Nathaniel Kahn directed a splendid documentary. He has genuinely given the world a no-nonsense take on the dire and looming prospect of leaving Earth and going elsewhere. However, he did not merely celebrate the fact that we were seeking new planets to colonize.I liked how he also covered the negative situations getting out of control right here on Earth that in turn prompted us to search for another home. This, more than anything else, made ""The Hunt for Planet B"" on Amazon Prime VOD worth watching.",True
2,10,Great watch,martinmurraymm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great insight into everything James Webb, appreciating the contributions of some of the females involved and what inspired them to be involved, this film however will upset climate change deniers.Some of the philosophical discussions made interesting listening.",False
3,10,Enthralling!,grw-61919,n/a,16/08/2025,"It feels so good to have occasions, such as this, to be proud of my species. Those who wonder beyond the confines of our lives are certain to be the ones who can not only widen our knowledge of our place in the universe, but also the ones who perhaps will save us from extinction. I salute everyone who has a part in the making and launching of this telescope..",False
4,1,CNN produces a real stinker of a documentary,tom-456,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good Grief, let's hope that the James Webb Space Telescope is better at maintaining focus than this stinker of a documentary.I saw this program listed in the on-line TV listing I use, and based on what I read, I thought it was going to be a documentary on the James Webb space telescope. Man, was I ever mislead.A very, very tiny portion of it is in fact about the James Webb space telescope. But the even the portion that is actually about the James Webb gives you about three sentences worth of information about the James Webb. Less than they could have put into the promo for the program, if they had wanted to do that.For the most part, this program is actually snippets of a whole slew of very, very uninteresting people discussing their thoughts about the origin of life and about the prospects for finding extraterrestrial life. This is what this stinker of a documentary is actually about, and it isn't even a half-decent documentary about the origin of earth life or the prospects for finding extraterrestrial life. It is a lousy, lousy documentary about the possible origins of life and the prospects for finding extraterrestrial life.I find this terribly annoying. If CNN wants to produce documentaries, why don't they hire some people who have exhibited a smidgen of talent at producing documentaries? The people who made this piece of space junk didn't even have a clear sense of what sort of documentary they were trying to make. They ended up with something that is horrifically unfocused and horrifically bad, so bad that it should never have been broadcast. They tried to make it seem like something other than what it actually is, by drawing attention to the James Webb Space Telescope.If you want to reduce the James Webb Space Telescope to a single idea, it would be the idea of seeing all the way to the edge of the known universe. It would not be about the search for exoplanets, and even if it were particularly about the search for exoplanets, it still would not be specifically about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. I actually sat through this thing twice, and I do not recall even once hearing anyone talk about the capability to see to the edge of the known universe.The people who produced and directed this piece of space junk should never again be allowed to produce another documentary, by anyone. And by the way, CNN, one way that you could make up for this wasted effort would be to make a broadcast-quality documentary on the James Webb Space Telescope. But I seriously doubt that CNN or anyone affiliated with CNN would have any idea how to go about doing that. Why is it that CNN consistently produces these really, really god-awful documentaries that are so outlandishly awful that hardly anyone can stand to sit through one of them?",False
5,10,Brilliant synsopses,pietclausen,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a buff the doccie is an excellent background to our search for life beyond the Earth. The Hubble Space Telescope opened the heavens for us in 1990, but the James Webb telescope will go back to the edges of the universe. It is mind boggling how far we as a species have progressed, but will we survive as a species to get the results that we are not alone? Right now we are in the middle of yet another mad man who invaded another country for no reason at all and the end result is unknown. Other species on other planets may have reached similar situations, hence we have not found any evidence of life yet up to 40 light years away.Is there other life out there somewhere? Undoubtedly, but space is so large that our own galaxy alone is more than 120 000 light years across. Imagine that there is intelligent life say 2 000 light years away from us, it will then take 2 000 years to say hello and wait another 2 000 years for their reply. Our galaxy is one of billions of other galaxies and space is still expanding at a speed beyond the speed of light.The James Webb Space Telescope will help in making other important discoveries and possibly even find life out there, but we will never be able to visit them in normal space-time. Who knows we may in years to come be able to create worm holes, but currently we are then thinking about science fiction.",False
6,1,Space Documentary Goes Climate Alarmist,info-90847,n/a,16/08/2025,"A space documentary which goes full-on Climate Alarmist and pro-government spending / NASA legitimation. CNN better stick to what they are good in: Fake news, smear pieces, fluff pieces and one-sided political opinion.A waste of time if you expect real new info on space exploration, instead they begin to explore characters of the scientists involved and push climate alarmist propaganda.Alex Jones also gets mentioned and featured as evil climate change denier. What a joke!",False
7,10,Search for Planet B,ssengupta-73745,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Search for Planet B"" is scientific, technological, human, geological and cosmic. I was absolutely overwhelmed by the genius of the director, how he told the story of the scientists -astrophysicist, biologist, astronomer, technologist - combining their knowledge, skills and technical expertise with their utterly human lives, loves, disappointments - and triumphs. I thrilled and cried (fell in love with Sara Seager), and, in the end, was inspired. This was like no other scientific documentary I've seen. I will try. To see it again and again.",False
8,2,I Should have Know .. CNN Film,MennoMan,n/a,16/08/2025,"What is worse than a poorly made documentary is a Woke one.I was excited to get an actual look at the Webb Telescooe and get a real behind the screen look. This was not that Documentary....
What you get is a Pushed emotional look at primarily women that either have dime role in the Telescope or in the use of it. This would not be wrong if in fact it was primarily women who were involved, it is not. Also this is mot about the physical Telescope it's about the women using the Telescope to push the narrative.Not only is the Telescope itself not really the topic, you actually learn little you could not learn in a 5 minute Youtube video about the scope.Also filmed entirely before launch itself.",False
9,2,Leftist propaganda,hankbrns,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sad documentary due to the bias from the film makers.Complaining about:
Not enough women working in the field
Not enough diversity on the project.Not enough Greta Thunderberg clones.Could have been interesting if they'd have stayed with the science--rather than the opinions and speculations of non-professionals and climate protesters.",False
10,3,missed the mark,pkenny1986,n/a,16/08/2025,"In my opinion they zigged when a zag was needed. Life is out there no question. If its not then there could be no us. Statistically intellegent life is out in the galaxy, not to mention may have even visited earth at some point in the last 3 billion yrs of life. Its a good story n msg the movie, but nothing about the telescope and is almost misogynistic acting like its a big deal for girls to be PHDs or engineers. Kinda projects a false image of society as if academics care about ur gender/sex when all they care about is merit and knowledge which is what the telescope is about.",False

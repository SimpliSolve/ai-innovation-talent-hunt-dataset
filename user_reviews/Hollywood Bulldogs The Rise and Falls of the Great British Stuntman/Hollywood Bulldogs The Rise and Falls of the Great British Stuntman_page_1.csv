1,7,Hollywood Bulldogs,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary charting the experiences of some of the great British stuntman who worked on most of the big action movies of the seventies, eighties and nineties. Some of the tales are quite troubling, but there is no getting around what a tough, but likeable bunch of guys these are and what a fabulous life they've lead.A must for real film fans.",False
2,8,Laid back action heroes.,philip-00197,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great laidback insight covering, almost, the entire stunt era - from the tough guy, through the organisation of the guild, to the CGI era.Hollywood Bulldogs pays homage to the stunt trade. It delivers its praise by means of interviews, with a very laid back group of action heroes, and some great footage - it does so very well.",False
3,1,They deserve better.,Hornsmith,n/a,16/08/2025,"The stuntmen have earned a decent tribute- but this isn't it.From the hyperactive visuals of the credit sequence, (soundtracked by a gawd-awful out of tune racket about 'heads getting kicked in')* to the cliched and frankly unnecessary narration by Winstone, it's disappointing, certainly for production values.The interviews in the trail seem genuine, if one gets past the crappy opening.*Apparently the racket is by Motorhead.",False

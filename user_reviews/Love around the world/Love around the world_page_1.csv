1,10,Brilliant take on what love really is,jasna-horvat555,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary not only it talks about many aspects of love and relationship, it takes your prejudaces and kicks them in the face.Love around the world, through many decades and stories, it gives you laughs, anger, tears, wonder, but mostly that rare feeljng that we are all humans. And love connects us.Author doesn't pass judgement, it doesn't explain, it isn't patronising. Really refreshing.I cannot emphisize enough how much I loved the movie.What is love?Watch and find out!",False

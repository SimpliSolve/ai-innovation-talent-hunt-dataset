1,7,walking us through,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Cinema trends often mirror societal trends (Superheroes being the exception), so it's not surprising that so many movies over the past few years have dealt with dementia and Alzheimer's in some manner. In fact, it was just 3 months ago that I watched Maite Alberdi's Oscar nominated documentary, THE ETERNAL MEMORY, and it was only three years ago that Florian Zeller's THE FATHER won two Oscars. As the population ages, physical and mental limitations become more prevalent, and it's the cognitive difficulties that are causing the most challenges for caregivers and medical professionals.Max Lugavere and Chris Newhard co-direct this documentary that focuses on Max's mother, Kathy, who is displaying all the symptoms of dementia. The film opens by showing home movies of Max as a kid, and Kathy as an energetic, fun-loving mom. When it cuts to today, we find Kathy's once lively, twinkling blue eyes are now hollow and lifeless at age 63. She's chronically tired and her phone conversation with son Max shows her memory is slipping. Max co-authored the book, ""Genius Food"" with Paul Grewel, and he meets with his Los Angeles publicist to inform her that he's moving back to New York City to spend time with his mother.What sets this film's approach apart from some others that broach the topic is that Max takes us on the journey with his mom as they explore possible options to improve her situation. It's explained that she's on a blend of Parkinson's drugs and Alzheimer's drugs, as that has been determined to be the best treatment for her Lewy Body Dementia - a cross between the two diseases. We are there as she fights with the doctor over the brain scan, and we sit in on some of the discussions with specialists in the field. Max tries to answer the question, ""Where did this come from?"", as there is apparently no genetic trail or were no early signs (other than a propensity to collect trinkets).It's at this point where knowing Max's background may affect one's perspective on the documentary. Knowing his public support for some trendy diets and the controversy such diets have caused, moves us away from the caring son and towards self-promotion. While it's difficult to disagree with the idea that diet and fitness are likely associated with cognitive health, he seems to quickly believe any study that agrees with his personal beliefs. It is interesting to hear the link between post-operative patients and Alzheimer's, but the 'adopt a dog' segment seemed a bit of a stretch.Many of us have experienced the impact when a loved one begins the slow decline from this silent disease. The idea of fixing the body first so the brain can recover is somewhat logical, but whether it's red meat, vegan, kimchi, or something else ... nothing has yet provided us with the glimmer of hope needed to reduce or slow the effects. Surely, some will benefit from Max taking the camera on the doctor visits and discussions with mom, but the self-promotion is a bit tougher to accept. Re-tracing the NYC locations shown in those home movies makes for a nice final touch.Opening in NYC theaters on April 19, 2024 and expanding at later dates.",False
2,10,Thank You,kmbertreg,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard to imagine anyone coming to this film hoping for all the answers; we know the answers don't yet exist. But I appreciate the amount of questions asked, in raw, honest scenarios. When there is no medical consensus on origins or prevention for dementia, why not ask as many questions as possible. Max's conversations with doctors and other professionals are thought provoking. The intimate look at Kathy and Max's interactions and conversations are heart-breaking but also aspirational; I wish I could have been as forward with my own father. There are a lot of angles packed into a short-ish film, but that also means there may be a different highlight for everyone, but it never loses its sense of being down-to-earth.",False

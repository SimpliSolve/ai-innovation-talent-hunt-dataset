1,5,Too hard of a challenge,dstreiff,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA polio vaccine disabled Jean Maagi at the age of one. He had to grow up facing both the ensuing physical and social challenges. The turning point in his life was a near-death experience as a midaged family father. After that, Jean started facing his shortcomings, both emotionally and physically. Soon he rode his first bike marathon. The pinnacle of his challenges became the crossing of the highest pass in the world in the Himalayas. This experience prompted him to become altruistic and pass on the gift of the altered bike to others and even building a small factory with his family.The story sounds inspiring, but the execution falls short. The dialogues are repetitive and together with the storytelling do not fully explain the motives and transformation of Jean Maggi. The sequence of events in his sports career feel more like an advertisement than a heartfelt journey of growth. Hence, what could be an emotionally touching story ends up as a mildly interesting documentary that could as well be part of a weekly TV show. Aesthetically, some pictures in the Himalayas are beautiful, but the supposed klimax is neither set up in suspension nor satisfies emotionally.After all of his impressive accomplishments, this documentary of Jean Maggi proved one challenge he could not master.",True

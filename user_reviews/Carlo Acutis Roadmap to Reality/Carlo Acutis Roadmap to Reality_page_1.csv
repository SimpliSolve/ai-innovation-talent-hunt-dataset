1,10,A true Saint,ctcookie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was wonderful seeing this through the eyes of today's youth.The way that Carlo Acutis is touching the world with his love for the Eucharist is very powerful. He had such a deep relationship with Jesus and inspired those around him with his deep devotion. He was a ""normal"" boy with an extraordinary undertaking that Jesus is the present in the Eucharist. His website about Eucharistic miracles touched so many hearts.It was also very interesting to see how the internet and social media have affected this generation. Sad to think about how much technology has had such a negative influence upon them and their ability to communicate and interact in the world.I hope more people will see that a relationship with the Lord is the answer.",True
2,4,Disappointing,hellow0rld,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into watching this movie with high hopes which unfortunately were crushed. I had heard about Carlo Acutis, the first millennial saint and was super excited to learn more about him. Ha. This documentary is literally anything but that. You watch 1 hour and 35 minutes of a film that talks about him for maybe 10. The rest is this anti-technology agenda and a pilgrimage these students went on to go see him. I mean sure that's all fine and dandy but I came to learn about Carlo! The very little information they do tell you about him is very fluffy, for instance, ""he loved very much Jesus."" Like yeah no kidding; he's almost a saint. They proceed to restate the fact he loved Jesus in about 20+ different ways through all these priests and experts speaking about him, saying the same exact thing. You'd honestly learn more just doing a Google search on him.",False
3,5,I still don't know anything about what Carlo did,blakebennie,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie will not tell you much about who Carlo is or what he did. I only know that he made a website.This movie seems like a generic letter of recommendation where the author doesn't know anything specific about the subject person. After watching this documentary, I still don't know much specifics about who he was. I definitely still don't know why he became a saint. Because he was nice??The preview for this movie was better than the movie itself. It came across as inspirational, but the only people who were inspired were the other people in the film.Also the editing made me have to look at the wall halfway through. They changed clips every 0.7 seconds for minutes at a time.",False

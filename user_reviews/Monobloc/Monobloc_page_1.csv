1,8,The story of a chair,ZeddaZogenau,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEveryone has sat on it before, but hardly anyone pays much attention to it. The monobloc plastic chair is so widespread that we take it for granted. The documentary film director Hauke WENDLER (born 1967 in Bremen) has set out on the trail and is researching the history of the origins and distribution of this seemingly indispensable everyday object. To do this, he traveled the world and stopped in Brazil, France, India, Italy, Uganda and the USA.Hauke WENDLER has succeeded in making a very informative and at the same time extremely entertaining documentary film. His visit to the VITRA Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, which of course also has various monobloc chairs among its exhibits, is particularly interesting. And the scenes from the North Sea beach also make this unusual documentary an aesthetic pleasure.",True
2,10,Portray of our modern world,asd49789,n/a,15/08/2025,"I liked it, I think it is a very important portray of our modern world. I would like to add two things, that came to my mind about plastic charis, while watching the film:1, I know someone who previously worked in a plastic factory for a few years as a menial worker. He told me, that it was very unfomfortable to work there, even if we are here in Europe and the company obeys working condition rules. The plastic bites you! When the item is dropped from the machine, it is still hot. The metal parts of the moulding tool are cooled from the inside through water ducts, but they are only cooled enough at the end of a cycle, to let the chair snap out of the tool, but the plastic can still hurt you when you touch it. There are gloves, but they are not comfortable to wear and it makes you inefficient to use them. These chairs have effort and pain in them, that you can not see from the outside. This aspect of hardships for workers in the chair factories, was not elaborated or mentioned in the film.2, There are numerous use cases of the monobloc chair in the ""modern, western"" Europe, that the film did not mention I think: their use in factories. And not only in any random low-income type of factory, but normal factories where menial work or machine operation is needed. I have worked in a pharmaceutical factory: I was just next to the pillmaking machines in the clean rooms. There we officially used the white plastic chairs to sit on. Actually, the only type of chair allowed inside the clean rooms and corridors, was the monobloc. It was easy to clean using the 70% alcohol and distilled water, which was the routine method to clean surfaces and walls in there. And as it was white, so any smudge could be seen clearly on the plastic surface, accordingly this kind of chair is just perfect for use in a clean factory. There is no light from outside, which could wear out the plastic material of the chair.",False

1,7,An emotional journey about witches and mothers,Blixta,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI liked this documentary on a topic that has been misunderstood for so long, witches. This one connects a lot of dots too, how the witch trials were used as manipulative tools, in the name of religion and just to hold women down. It was interesting to hear theories like the patriarchy used these accusations to get rid of the healers, the women that healed, for the men, doctors to come in their place. And well done to draw all of this modern experiences of women that get mentally ill, depression, psychosis etc, that still has lots of stigmas around it. Many things done well here. But what gets on my nerves considering anything around witches is that many men were prosecuted also. In some parts in time in Europe, it is thought that up to 70-80% were men that were murdered. I Iceland, out of 22 that were judged, 20 were men and 2 were women. It's hard to know but over all it was maybe 20-30% of those that stood trials, were men. It might be it was left out because it does not fit the purpose of the movie, but not talk about it, leaves a false impression that it were only women were victims, of the men. But other than that, a beautiful, painful and well-made movie about serious topic that needs to be more funded and talked about.",True
2,7,The Power of the Message and the Limits of Symbolism: A Review of Witches,martabaruncic,n/a,16/08/2025,"On one hand, I deeply appreciate the filming, execution, aesthetics, and content of this movie. I believe that the topic of perinatal mental health is crucial and is discussed minimally, primarily within small circles of experts. These women are incredibly brave for sharing their experiences honestly and unflinchingly, as they truly are. The bond among women for a greater purpose is beautiful to witness. Feeling like a witch and using the imagery of witches as a metaphor for these issues is an intriguing artistic choice.On the other hand, not all women see themselves as witches, nor do they wish to be. Medical professionals and doctors (including male doctors) are not the ones metaphorically seeking to ""burn"" today's ""witches."" Psychiatric wards are not prisons where one will be tortured, and the old concept of herbalist witches offering care from home is not inherently better than modern medical practices. Stigma exists, clearly, and the media-highlighted cases mentioned in this film exemplify that. However, postpartum depression, anxiety, and psychosis are not witchcraft for which someone will be burned. Sankey has taken a good metaphor too far, unnecessarily stepping into a new wave of feminism.",False
3,9,Taboo busting and brave,vivi_ohboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this documentary and of course I thought it could never be made in America. Touched on so many powerful and taboo subjects that we as women, and some of us, mothers, are too painfully aware of. It's interesting to realize this has been going on for hundreds of years but sad to think so much has remained the same. I might have liked to see a bit more science behind the chemical causes of postpartum OCD, depression and psychosis to further demystify the subject matter, but regardless, a very well made and powerful feminist perspective. I hope the director continues to delve into these issues as this kind of filmmaking is sorely needed.",False
4,10,A very important documentary,Quet-zal,n/a,16/08/2025,"And incredibly brave.Members of a self-help group share their experiences with perinatal mental health disorders. Their confessions are incredibly intimate and courageous, as the negative aspects of motherhood are among the most taboo in our civilization. The women speak of doctors ignoring symptoms, shame about their own thoughts, and recall historical witch trials and embarrassing contemporary statistics on ethnic discrimination in healthcare.The film is richly illustrated with film clips showing, among other things, the profound infantilization of motherhood in popular culture. This means that women experiencing perinatal mental health disorders are often left completely alone with their problems, which sometimes ends tragically. And although subsequent embarrassing statistics confirm this, this issue is absent from the social and political debate, at least in most countries. Many documentaries address important social issues: economic inequality, discrimination against certain social groups, the planet's ecological degradation, dictatorial regimes and harsh laws targeting political dissidents, and the distortions of late capitalism. Yet, all of these issues are widely known. Perinatal mental health disorders are perhaps the most hermetic topic, one that remains largely unspoken. Or rarely and quietly discussed. This is why this is one of the most important documentaries, as it explores a widely unknown issue.",False

1,7,"""We're not supposed to be happy all the time.""",classicsoncall,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSince the last Tom Papa specials I've seen on Netflix were only from a few years ago, I was surprised to see how much older the comedian looked in this program. I think it may have been the beard stubble. In any event, his humor was till engaging with riffs on his daughters going away to college and leaving him and his wife as empty nesters. He claimed it was hard to be old, but I think he had a pretty good perspective on it. I was surprised when he stated ""I still shoplift"" with no disclaimer coming right after or anywhere else in his routine for that matter. I would hate to think the guy was encouraging petty theft as he heads toward retirement. With just a sprinkling of four-letter words, Papa is a comic who doesn't have to rely on a stream of obscenities a lot of his compatriots in the business resort to. This particular show was similar to 2020's ""You're Doing Great"" and 2022's ""What a Day"", so if you like his routine here, you can catch the others on Netflix as well.",True
2,8,funny guy! love it.,ksf-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Standup tom papa. Live from washington dc. Sending his daughters off to college, and what he's doing with his free time. Van halen. Eating pizza together with his wife, instead of eating pizza alone. Suddenly he has a family! Trying to get through security, dragging the family along. Getting old, and now away around it! Yes, we DO all turn into our parents. Funny stuff! Buying a multipack of silicon, just because it was on sale. And then giving them away. Don't ask silly questions in a marriage, just shut up and carry on! That's the big secret to a successful marriage. Directed by troy miller. I've always dug tom p... he was frequently on sirius xm radio, and the wait wait don't tell me trivia program on npr ! Funny guy. Currently showing on netflix.",False
3,5,"A few laughs, but...",KereSG,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoy Tom Papa on Wait Wait Don't Tell Me and was looking forward to this special. I got a few laughs and appreciate the dry humor, but I turned it off halfway through. Why? A lot of it was kinda mean-spirited, low hanging fruit. As if he's trying to be clever, but just ends up picking on people's looks, weight, etc. It's not ""edgy"", it's mostly just mean. Like the kid in class who is bullying everyone but saying ""Whaaat, can't you take a joke??"" And the joke about questionable driving when going to pick up his kids? Poor taste. I'm not sure why this has so many stars. Not sure what I expected, but this wasn't it.",False

1,8,Eating an onion like it was an apple,owen-watts,n/a,15/08/2025,"This delightful travelogue takes you travelling across Scotland (and randomly, California, in the second series) with two charming companions - the stalwart Margolyes and the effervescent Cummings. They are in turns crude, silly, grumpy, foolish and wildly earnest and I love them to pieces. Both series of this are a real and genuine joy despite the cloying ""constant recaps of what you've just seen and are about to watch"" editorial trappings of the genre. You'll be farting along in no time and dying to watch it all again.",False
2,8,Two Lovely Loonies On The Road,pienpouwels,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had a blast watching these two gallivanter around good ol' Alba. Their chemistry is off the charts. The three episodes are a lovely mix of Scottish culture, nature, activities and personal stories. Together, Miriam and Alan are the pinnacle of iconic, queer energy that anyone would undoubtedly love to see more of in the future.",False
3,7,Chemistry not quite there,ben_macellen,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI love these two performers. I've seen Miriam Margolyes live on stage and she is captivating. I thought I'd be happy to watch her read a phone book. But I was a little disappointed with the lack of chemistry between Alan Cumming and Miriam. No blame, no criticism of the two, I just think that they are separately such big personalities that they grated on each other. Miriam appeared to be a bit grumpy at times. But having said that, she's 80 years old and spending time on the road out of her comfort zone must have been difficult.Some of the segments within each episode were definitely worth watching. Alan sharing the trauma of his childhood as he revisited his former home was truly heartbreaking. And the making of 'Aliam' in a tartan factory was a beautiful joyful moment. His recording of a Gaelic song was probably my favourite moment.",True
4,10,Absolutely marvelous!,petrovicljudmila,n/a,15/08/2025,I will watch this again and again and again. No other words are needed. More shows like this please! Terrific. Please don't make us have to write 150 characters. I didn't want to do that.,False
5,10,I Love These Two!!!,ktkrabbe-19988,n/a,15/08/2025,"We need more of them! I watch almost no TV, but this is so charming and beautiful to watch. Not just scenic, but informative and entertaining to boot. A documentary with Miriam and Alan would be great.",False
6,1,Inane and annoying,drjgardner,n/a,15/08/2025,"I get it. Having a travel show where people go around and explore places is a cheap way to produce a show. The earliest one I recall is the wonderful Huell Howser ""California Gold"" that ran for 20 years. Recently we have a travel show that only looks at high-end hotels.Travel and feed your face started about 20 years ago with Anthony Bourdain. Then came ""Searching for Italy"" which seems to be a never-ending quest, and more recently ""Searching for Mexico.""All these shows have at their core the hope that you will enjoy the people who are giving the tour. Sometimes this works, like in the case of Huell Howser who was so folksy you could cut it with a knife, but it worked.This show is the opposite. The two ""stars"" are so obnoxious and so self-centered that it's painful to watch. Scotland is a wonderful place with so many interesting things to see. But if I have to put up with these two, I'll switch off.",False

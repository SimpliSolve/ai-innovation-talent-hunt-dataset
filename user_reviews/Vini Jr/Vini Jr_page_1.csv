1,5,"Vini Jr. (Baila, Vini)",thomasubieda,n/a,15/08/2025,"A documentary that contains thought-provoking messages about racism, making it the main theme and focus, but which divides critics considerably. Nevertheless, it deserves a chance.""Baila, Vini"" is an experience for fans of the Brazilian and contemporary football, showcasing his beginnings and the rise of his professional career. The documentary features a wide variety of interesting video footage that adds to the experience. The director Andrucha Waddington did a straightforward job very much in the Netflix format of his similar productions, but at times it has some well-crafted details.Visually it meets expectations, but in other cinematic aspects like the narrative plot, it's debatable. From my perspective, we only have a summary that did not exploit all the potential surrounding Vinicius Jr, knowing that he is a player with many issues to digest. However, the key point is about racism and its impact on the footballer. It is there, where the discussion among many consumers arises for wanting to ""victimize"" the events seen on screen, adding another perspective and wanting to give another twist to the story.In addition to that, the essence of being able to enjoy a documentary like this is lost. Productions are based on their content, leaving aside fanaticism and personal interpretations.On the other hand, the positive points of the documentary should be highlighted, such as the appearance of many Real Madrid teammates, the Brazilian national team, friends, and family. Each of them complementing their perspective on Vini Jr.Without a doubt, it could have been better, having a better structure and not giving all the relevance to a controversial topic, but despite everything, it tries to give a constructive critique to the fanbases and European football.",False
2,1,Disappointing and Shallow,saadziko,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had high hopes for a documentary about Vinícius Júnior - one of the most exciting young players in football today - but this film completely missed the mark. Instead of offering a deep dive into his journey, challenges, or growth as a player and person, we get a surface-level highlight reel padded with clichés and emotional music.The storytelling is disjointed, and there's little real insight into who Vini actually is off the pitch. It feels more like PR than a true documentary. Even the serious moments, like tackling racism in football, are handled in a way that feels more like posturing than thoughtful engagement.If you're looking for a raw, honest look at a footballer's life, this isn't it. It's a glossy commercial pretending to be a documentary. Save your time.",False
3,1,too one sided,imdbfan-7128731741,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerVini Jn's new documentary on Netflix arrives with the promise of revelation, insight, and raw honesty. Unfortunately, it delivers very little of any of those things. What could have been a compelling, nuanced look at a subject worthy of deeper attention instead becomes a frustrating exercise in style over substance, self-indulgence over storytelling, and vague musings over meaningful content.From the opening minutes, it's clear this documentary is more interested in aesthetic flair than clarity or coherence. The cinematography tries too hard to be poetic, drowning in slow-motion shots, drone footage, and heavily color-graded scenes that feel more like an Instagram reel than a thoughtful film. While visually polished, the result is a documentary that looks beautiful but feels empty. There's a sense that Vini Jn is trying to emulate the tone of critically acclaimed filmmakers without understanding what makes their work impactful in the first place: a story.Speaking of story-there isn't much of one. The documentary flits between topics without any real structure or narrative arc. One moment we're watching interviews with seemingly random people; the next, we're plunged into vague philosophical voiceovers that offer little insight and even less originality. Themes are hinted at-identity, struggle, creativity-but never explored in depth. Instead of developing any one idea, the film chooses to skim the surface of many, leaving the viewer confused and disengaged.The narration is another weak point. Vini Jn, who also narrates, leans heavily into abstract language that sounds profound but says very little. Phrases like ""the truth is buried in the silence of our collective memory"" might sound deep on paper, but in context, they come off as pretentious and hollow. There's a fine line between poetic and vague, and this documentary crosses it repeatedly, leaving the viewer with more questions than answers-not in a good way.The interviews, which should have been the heart of the film, are disappointingly shallow. There's a lack of context for who these individuals are, why they matter, or how their stories connect. Instead of drawing emotional or intellectual connections, the film lets them drift by like soundbites. We never linger long enough with anyone to form a real connection, and that emotional distance makes it hard to care.There are also pacing issues throughout. The documentary drags in places where it should build momentum and rushes through moments that could have added much-needed depth. By the halfway mark, it feels like the film is repeating itself-not thematically, but literally. Scenes blend together, and it becomes difficult to distinguish one segment from the next. A 90-minute runtime starts to feel twice as long.Vini Jn's ambition is evident, but ambition alone does not make a good documentary. What's missing is editorial discipline, a clear point of view, and a willingness to dig below the surface. The film ultimately feels more like a personal branding exercise than an honest exploration of anything substantive. It wants to impress rather than inform, to inspire without actually saying anything.In the end, this documentary is a missed opportunity. There's potential in the concept, and occasional flashes of sincerity shine through, but they are buried beneath layers of pretension and incoherence. Vini Jn may have had a vision, but the execution falls flat, leaving behind a beautifully shot, frustratingly hollow film that says a lot without really saying anything at all.Chat gpt.",True
4,10,"Vini, you're an inspiration!!!",vinibalmeida,n/a,15/08/2025,"Baila, Vini is more than a documentary, it's a celebration of strength, joy, and identity. It shows who Vinícius Júnior really is not just the amazing player we see on the field, but the human behind the jersey. His story is full of challenges (racism, doubt, pressure), and yet he never stopped believing, never stopped dancing. The interviews are real and touching, and the whole thing just hits deep. If you love football, you'll love this. But even if you don't, this is about dreams, resilience, and being true to yourself. Truly inspiring. Vini's light goes beyond the pitch - it's about representing a voice, a culture, and a new generation that refuses to be silenced. Watching this made me feel proud, hopeful, and emotional in the best way.Proud to have always supported and see him wear the jersey of my beloved team, Flamengo.",False
5,1,overhyped,imdbfan-5861852808,n/a,15/08/2025,"Skip this fluff piece. ""Vini Jr. 2025"" desperately tries to sell Vinicius as some football genius, but the film itself exposes the gap. We see endless clips of him complaining to refs and diving (sorry, ""exaggerating contact"") - more time is spent on his theatrics than his actual football IQ. Where's the analysis of his often poor decision-making, inconsistent finishing, or defensive laziness? The film glosses over his flaws, focusing instead on manufactured drama and victim narratives. It's 90 minutes of PR spin trying to convince us an overhyped diver is a world-beater. Watch real football instead.",False
6,10,Perfect,santosmarimoraes,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary about Vini Jr. Is powerful, emotional, and deeply inspiring. It beautifully captures not only the incredible talent of one of Brazil's brightest football stars, but also the strength, resilience, and dignity with which he faces adversity. Watching Vini's journey is a reminder of how much determination, pride, and courage it takes to succeed-not just as an athlete, but as a human being who refuses to stay silent in the face of injustice.His story fills me with pride. Vini represents the best of Brazil: a fighter who doesn't give up, doesn't lower his head, and carries his roots with honor and joy. It's more than a sports documentary; it's a story of resistance, of never backing down, and of showing the world what it means to rise above hate with class, talent, and heart.Vini Jr. Is not just a footballer-he's a symbol of strength for an entire generation. And this documentary is a must-watch for anyone who believes in the power of sport to transform lives and challenge the World.",False
7,1,Disgusting,bayronbane,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honestly, Baila, Vini is a disappointing documentary. Instead of giving viewers a raw, honest look at Vinícius Júnior's journey, it feels more like a forced tribute made to boost his ego. It's overly polished, full of cliché motivational lines, and lacks any real emotional depth or critical perspective.The storytelling is shallow and repetitive - we get it, he's talented and successful. But there's barely any nuance. It avoids tough questions, skips over meaningful analysis, and just surrounds Vinícius with praise from his friends and teammates. That's not a documentary; that's marketing.The worst part? It treats serious topics like racism as just another dramatic beat, instead of engaging with the complexity of the issue. It ends up feeling exploitative, not enlightening.Overall, the film is boring, predictable, and feels premature - like it was made ten years too early. For someone with such a bright career, Vinícius deserves a better, more honest story.",False

9,n/a,So good,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Haters are just gonna give it one star because they hate Vini, but this is very good for me. I'm Vini's fan and not a Real Madrid fan, I would like to make other people watch it, just forget all of your hate and watch it, it's a great way to see how difficult was Vini's life. Some people say that he victimize himself, but it's very hard see people that you care caring all that hate when you know that he is a good person. If you are able to wish the dead of other human you are able to sit down in a couch for 2 hours and analyze by your self if this is good or not, don't let your hate speak for you, if you forget about the hate just for q while maybe you can enjoy it more.",False
10,7,It is what it is,luissilos,n/a,15/08/2025,"Each review here is either a 1 or a 10.Thats how polarized people feel about Vini.I dont remember people croticizing Ronaldinho for dancing when scoring. Also don't remember any player that was called a cry baby for satnding against racism. The media has placed a Target in his back.For that reason I think people are not watching the film objectively and, also are expecting it to be what they want it to be, like if every documentary has to show the true feelings of a person. Give me a break. Besides he is still 24 so what do you expect.The film is entertaining and it does offer a look into his prívate life and how he reached his star status.I think if you are not bias you will enjoy it.",False
11,1,"A One-Sided, Over-Dramatized PR Piece - Not a Documentary",Imnotindangerskyleriamthedanger,n/a,15/08/2025,"Baila, Vini or whatever this is called tries to pass itself off as an inspiring story of overcoming adversity, but in reality, it's nothing more than a heavily biased PR campaign for Vinícius Jr. Disguised as a documentary. Instead of offering a balanced and honest look at his career and the controversies surrounding him, it paints him as a flawless hero while vilifying everyone else who has ever opposed him - particularly fans, clubs, and even entire cities.The film repeatedly shows Vinícius as a victim, but fails to acknowledge how often he instigates confrontation on the pitch. His taunting celebrations, disrespectful gestures, and unnecessary theatrics are conveniently omitted or framed as ""passion."" There's zero accountability or nuance here - just a carefully curated narrative that rewrites every incident to suit his image.Worst of all, the documentary unfairly defames others, especially Valencia CF and their supporters, with broad accusations that lack proper context. The film simplifies a complex and sensitive issue into a black-and-white story where Vinícius is always right, and everyone else is always wrong. This kind of lazy storytelling only stirs more division, rather than promoting real awareness or progress.If you're looking for an honest exploration of a player's journey, skip this. Baila, Vini is not a documentary - it's damage control.",False
12,1,There are no way for this movie,Evgenii-4,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie should not be exist. There are a lot of players, who was playing in Real, a lot of stars. But Netflix issued series about Vini (24 years old). Not Modric, not Kroos - 24 years old Vini. Shame! I can't understand what's wrong with Netflix? Why is it happened? List a football players who played in Real and deserve personal series: Casilias, Ramos, Figo, Raul, Alonso (new head coach), Zidane, Modric, Kroos, Benzema, Ronaldo, C Ronaldo, Macmanaman, Guti, Robben, Sneider, Roberto Carlos, Hierro, Salgado... they are all legends, Vinicius not. Absolutely shame! This series is example of degradation of Netflix company.",False
13,1,Crybaby,imdbfan-334706,n/a,15/08/2025,"Another Netflix agenda has sparked yet another wave of discussions. At the center is a person many consider a victim, but in my opinion, he is more of a provocateur. His actions and statements are clearly aimed at attracting attention, which provokes various reactions from the public. On one hand, you can understand him - in a world where the noise of information grows every day, it's hard to go unnoticed. On the other hand, this kind of behavior raises many questions about the authenticity of his intentions. Is he truly a victim of circumstances, or is he consciously using his position for manipulation? This makes us reflect on how we perceive people in the media space and the role provocations play in shaping public opinion.And honestly, I'm frustrated with IMDb for not allowing me to write in Cyrillic here! It's ridiculous that a global platform restricts users from expressing themselves in their native script. This kind of limitation only adds unnecessary barriers to genuine communication and cultural diversity online.",False

Worst movie woth worst human being and worst player ever,Let's talk about the movie, it is focusing on his emotions instead of what happened, how it happened and most important why people are having such a negative impact upon his character,The movie should included espain POV about hosting WC and Vini conference, and how the media talked about it,Any way he feels he should have a huge respect in football, he thinks he should be treated like Ronaldinho and R9, boy be respectful like them, then we can talke.",False
15,10,Baila Vini,imdbfan-006279,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Vini Jr. Documentary is an inspiring and powerful look into the life and career of Brazilian footballer Vinícius Júnior. It captures his journey from humble beginnings to global stardom with Real Madrid, highlighting his incredible work ethic, resilience, and unshakable confidence. The film doesn't shy away from addressing the racism he has faced, making it not just a sports story but a social statement. Emotional interviews and behind-the-scenes footage create a deeply human portrait of a young man defying the odds on and off the pitch. A must-watch for football fans. Vinicius junior is the best in the world.",False
16,1,Honest review,swagafg,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary, while watchable, falls short of delivering a fully professional portrayal of its subject, particularly in the context of his on-pitch behavior. Football fans have frequently observed his tendency to provoke opposing players and fanbases during matches, a pattern evident across numerous instances throughout his career. Historically, La Liga, including clubs like Real Madrid, has featured many Black players who, while not immune to discrimination, did not face the same intensity or frequency of racist abuse from fans as often claimed. In my opinion, the documentary feels like an attempt to gloss over his controversies and missteps, presenting a polished narrative that downplays his errors. Instead of critically addressing these issues, it seems to serve as a shield, reframing his career to minimize the impact of his provocative actions and mistakes. This leaves viewers with a sense that the film prioritizes image management over an honest reckoning with his complex legacy.",True

18,1,the worst sports documentary,Cineasta-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's not worth it, it only talks about him, it lacks professionals... it's without a doubt the worst sports documentary.""Vinícius Baila Vini"" is a frustratingly shallow documentary that misses the mark in almost every way. Rather than offering a deep dive into Vinícius Jr.'s rise to fame, it settles for surface-level content that feels like a commercial. The narrative is predictable and lacks originality, failing to reveal anything new or meaningful about his personal struggles or triumphs. The pacing drags, leaving viewers disinterested. With missed opportunities to explore his character, it ultimately feels like a wasted chance to tell a compelling story. Not recommended.",False
19,10,A beautiful portrait,imdbfan-645608,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is a beautiful portrait of a young footballer legend who at a young age has already written his name in the history of two of the most loved and popular football clubs in the world. Vini navigates with class and mental strength all the struggles of the this universe: the raising as a young player among veterans, the hardships of adaptation in Europe, the constant testing under pressure common to the great teams, the public scrutiny and racism. In all, it's his bright spirit that leads the way and conducts the path to this human interest story of resilience, hardship and success. It's s just watch.",False
20,7,"Ignore the rating, it's good",tivdeaux,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's true that it might be early to make something about Vini since he is still in his prime and there's more to he shown, but I found the depiction quite good.Biased opinion, I liked it. Especially his raw take on his behaviour on the pitch. Most bad reviews are from haters or Barcelona fans because they don't have active players to make a documentary out of (nor will they have in the next seasons).I liked the documentary because I felt immersed in Vini s life, however, being a Netflix creation, of course at times drama felt a bit much. Many instances were exaggerated, especially in comparison with previous number 7s of the club, or putting the amprent on Vinicius being the best in Real Madrid (he is good, but most RMA players are). I also didn't like that they showed only successful events in his career timeline (without knockouts from UCL and how these felt for him as a RMA player). I think this would have brought a closer understanding of his motivation to become the best.Overall I think it is worth watching for a train ride or a chill weekend afternoon.",True
21,1,Vinicius - A Misguided Attempt at Victimhood,chowing64,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the very first scenes, it's clear that Vinicius struggles to align his words with his emotions. The moments where he speaks are awkward and forced, lacking authenticity. In one scene, he even breaks into crocodile tears - a transparent attempt to provoke sympathy rather than convey genuine vulnerability.This is not a personal attack. The issue lies in the documentary's poor content and lack of coherence. Rather than offering meaningful insight or balanced context, it becomes a shallow exercise in self-victimization. The production fails to explore the complexities of the situation or offer a nuanced perspective; instead, it reinforces a narrative that seeks compassion from an audience while the protagonist himself has spent time lashing out at anyone who dares to disagree with him.This documentary misses the opportunity to contribute to a thoughtful dialogue about racism or the challenges athletes face. Instead, it weakens the message by centering on someone who, rather than uplifting the sport, often detracts from the spectacle of football itself.",False
22,1,Vinícius Jr. Needs to Reflect: It's Time to Grow Beyond the Drama,SajidulI-9,n/a,15/08/2025,"Vinícius Jr. Is one of the most talented young footballers in the world today. His speed, dribbling, and energy on the pitch make him a nightmare for defenders and a fan favorite for many Real Madrid supporters. However, with great talent comes great responsibility-and unfortunately, Vini seems to be struggling with that part of the game.In recent times, he's been in the spotlight for reasons beyond football. While some of that attention is deserved due to real incidents of racism-which should never be tolerated-there is another side to the story that can't be ignored. There's a growing pattern of behavior from Vinícius that feels immature, emotionally excessive, and sometimes manipulative. In almost every situation, he ends up in tears, pointing fingers, or posting online instead of showing resilience or leadership.In a recent video, yet again, he is seen visibly emotional and frustrated. But at some point, you have to ask: when will he stop? When will Vini accept that not all criticism is rooted in racism? That sometimes, people mock or call him out because of his attitude, not his background or skin color?No one is denying that racism exists in football. It's a deeply rooted issue that needs to be fought with unity and firmness. And when it happens, players like Vini should absolutely speak out and get support. But that doesn't mean every negative reaction or jeer from the crowd is racially motivated. Football fans boo, mock, and criticize players for a thousand reasons-bad sportsmanship, arrogant celebrations, flopping, or even just because they're good and playing against the home team. That's part of the game.Unfortunately, Vini has developed a reputation not just for being easily provoked but for constantly turning every bit of criticism into a racial issue. This makes it harder for real cases of racism to be taken seriously. It also creates a wall between him and even the fans or pundits who might be trying to offer fair critique. His emotional outbursts and constant complaints are making people less sympathetic, not more.What's especially frustrating is that Vini has everything it takes to be a world-class football legend. But instead of focusing on the pitch, he's too often caught up in drama-arguing with referees, clashing with opponents, and now, crying in interviews. There's a fine line between being passionate and being overly sensitive. Right now, he's crossing it too often.It's time for Vinícius to grow up and develop some emotional maturity. He should be using his platform to inspire young players and show how to rise above hate-not drown in it. Instead of reacting to every insult, he should let his football do the talking. He needs to realize that not everyone who criticizes him is racist. Some people just think he acts out too much, complains too often, or brings negative energy to the field.To be clear: this isn't about silencing players or telling them to accept abuse. It's about balance. It's about knowing the difference between standing up for yourself and turning every moment into a controversy. If Vini continues down this path, he risks becoming more known for his behavior than his brilliance. And that would be a real shame-for him, for the fans, and for football as a whole.",False

I was already a Vini fand, but after watching this i am even more a fan of him, he is a humble, smart and focused player that puts his carreer and the sport in the center of his life, that's why he succeeded so much, coming from a hard place like São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro a going straight to the top.

Among this wave of insults and discrimination that he faces is awesome to see a high quality production about him.

Leaving a poor community and playing in one of the biggest clubs in the world, Flamengo, showing his talent and joking Real Madrid. In Spain, even between the insults and backlash he managed to be a crucial part of a champions league title and the face of another one, two years later. He's awesome and this production shows this.",False

1,7,Short but interesting insight of composer Wang Xilin,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerChinese documentary filmmaker Wang Bing has made some of the weirdest and interesting documentaries in his career and while Man in Black is a departure from his usual style, it still remains interesting throughout. I am not familiar with the works of Wang Xilin, this 1-hour documentary is an interesting experimental portrait of Xilin with good camerawork, unique presentation, and strange structure.Throughout, Wang Xilin is portrayed wondering around in the nude through the abandoned theater building, yet, the experimental and strange decision portrayal creates a thought insightful of the traumatic memories that Xilin experienced. Including using interesting sound designs, music and atmosphere to demonstrate the symbolic natures of Xilin's work and his memories.While certain choices about the documentary was pretty strange and makes me question the necessity, Wang Bing creates another interesting documentary.",True

1,2,Disaster,junkdog-69233,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""tribute"" looks like it was put together by a 10-year old. There is no order or direction to anything except a very loose chronological order. A couple of scenes are actually repeated word for word, frame for frame. The music is horrible and often drowns out the dialogue making it difficult to distinguish. I'm a huge Eastwood fan and collect almost whatever I can find about him, There are a couple of brief worthwhile interviews amidst the dross, but the little light they may shine are way outweighed by the rest. Had I known how bad and annoying this is, I would never have watched it.This is only my second or third comment I've made here, but I was so disheartened by this release that I felt I needed to give others a heads-up.",False
2,1,Make To Turn The Channel,galahad58-1,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis is a very poor documentary. The editing is abysmal - the film feels disjointed and jumps all over the place; showing bits of film that have absolutely nothing to do with Clint Eastwood or about his career.It is ridiculous when the narrator is talking about Hollywood's golden era in the 30's and show a clip of a theater moniker with Top Gun as the feature film.There is no talk about his military career; there is nothing substantial about his start in the acting career and a quick blurb about his role in the spaghetti westerns. There is even someone talking about High Noon during the brief spaghetti westerns section. High Noon wasn't a spaghetti western thus showing the lack of quality fact checking.,True
3,2,If rubbish were an art form it would still fail.,josh-05415,n/a,16/08/2025,"As if it were compiled entirely by AI with no additional oversight. Rambling and poorly edited (if at all). Two stars only for the subject (which is worthy of a legitimate documentary).The collaboration with Sergio Leone is fascinating and deserves a lot more attention. Leone was brilliant - entire storylines existed only in his head; paired with Morricone's scores and Eastwood's presence made for some of the most enduring Westerns of all time.Eastwood's career is nothing short of remarkable; why this was made with such little care will be one of the enduring mysteries of the universe.Quite honestly as bad a ""Caligula"" in technical form. Spare yourself and look elsewhere.",False
4,6,"""OK"" documentary.",toonarly,n/a,16/08/2025,"Put together like a mishmash of clips and loose interviews spanning Clint's career. It could have been done way way better. Especially if they didn't use a lot of the louder than the dialog music background in the verbal interview segments, one can barely hear what they say over the music, luckily my version had subtitles. It should have been done in assured chronological order from early stuff to his recent death. Also more of his personal life would have been good, what we wanted to know was the man, the legend, the life and his loves, hobbies, as well as his family and all, other than that, it was an OK watch, except the background music over powered the dialog way too much and ruined it for us for the most part. I hope they do another with more professional direction and choreography. Enjoy.",False

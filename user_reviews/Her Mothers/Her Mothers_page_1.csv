1,8,Cute story,orsivagyok,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really liked this movie. You felt like you are with them, you knew their problems etc. But you were happy to see a loving family. If you are following the Hungarian politics then you know what they felt. Watching this I just felt like it's so sad that you need to leave your country because you are afraid what's going to happen with you. And what's happening there now? If they would want to adopt a child now, it would be impossible for them.For the other reviews I wanted to say, are you really following the politics or you are just reading about Hungary 1 article per month on origo? What a joke.",False
2,9,Adoption under nationalistic homophobia,chong_an,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film does a good balancing act. There is the family part. Choosing adoption over artificial insemination so the child would not be naturally closer to one parent than another, there is still the problem that gays can adopt as singles, but not as a same-sex couple. A two-year-old arrives, and there are differences in child-rearing philosophies and degrees of attachment to each parent. But the nationalistic (and increasingly homophobic) political situation is depicted, adding more complications to the family. From the Hot Docs online festival Q+A, this was part of a project about rainbow families. However, this one-family story stands well on its own.",False
3,9,"Emotional, authentic story",adrienn1991,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAuthentic presentation of the trouble that a homosexual couple need to go through to become a family in the illiberal Hungary. Heartbreaking, moving, still very real. SPOILER: Very sad ending that the solution is to emigrate and as far I could understand to leave behind the three dogs. They exchanged their dogs for a calmer, more harmonic ""family"" life. Truly heartbreaking.",True
4,1,"Conceptional ""documentary"" from liberals",notageemail,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story is true, but there are a lot of staged scenes, and a lot of distortion about hungarian politics. Hungary is a democracy, and the hungarian government isn't nationalistic or homophob as the movie tells you.",False
5,9,Touching story of two mothers hardship,patriktakac,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me say, that this documentary recieved a lot of controversy in Hungary. Mainly because it shows how the system really works there, how ""the party"" wants to control every aspect of your life from what appears in the media to the point who you should or should not be together. In the middle of all this are two women, who just wants to make a family. But making a family like this is not approved by ""the party"".The movie is touching, theres a lot of realness and shows the life of a lesbian couple in Hungary. Sadly theres no happy ending for them in that country.Worth watching.",False

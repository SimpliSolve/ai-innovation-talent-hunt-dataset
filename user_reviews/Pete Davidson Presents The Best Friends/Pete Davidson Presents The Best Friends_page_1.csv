1,4,Meh,bgar-80932,n/a,15/08/2025,So-so at best. It was better than the Amy Schumer presents one on Netflix but that isn't saying much. I'd say skip this one. It's short but even still it isn't worth the time.,False
2,4,"A Very Mixed Bag, But Some Funny Stuff",tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pete Davidson has sharpened his skills as a stand up, or maybe it was the short set, but he was very good. His personal reflections and honesty were very on point and self-effacing. The remaining comedians was a mixed bag. Some were very funny, others not so much. The comedian with the routine about the Barber Shop is one to watch. He was very, very good. I have to confess I am NOT a fan of showcases so I may not be the best person to review one.",False
3,4,A comedy show from 2005,luisacf-96,n/a,15/08/2025,"This special uses Pete Davidson as bait but he's only there for 10 minutes. His friends' humor is stuck in the early 2000's. There's a review here that says they love this show because it's ""sticking up against sensitive people and PC culture"", and that really tells you all you need to know. I'm sure the people from Florida and Texas are the type to like this. That being said, it's nice of Pete to support his friends like that.",False
4,3,A real waste of time,latinfineart,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unless you are the kind of person who will laugh at absolutely anything, this is not worth bothering with. Davidson is funny at times, but not here. Machine Gun Kelly is a real embarrassment. Absolutely no talent, whatsoever. There was some minor talent featured, but nothing particularly funny. A really poor showcase, not worth watching.",False
5,1,This is what it's come to,rmmil,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pete Davidson is not funny. He's a guy describing his life in a somewhat self-depreciating way. That's his entire act. This formula only works for talented comedians. Read that again.Pete's set was only 10 minutes of the 50+ in this show, and didn't really have any jokes to speak of. I shudder to think how much he was paid for those 10 minutes. That's why you're going down the tubes, Netflix!Pete spent his time whining about his ""terrible"" life and all the ""terrible"" things that have happened to him, like falling backwards into fame and being on a nationally televised comedic show for 8 years despite having no comedic talent to speak of.Because Pete knows he isn't funny, and his ""team"" knows this, this Netflix special is mostly an attempt at deflection.The ""deflection"" actually sort of works, as after his 10 minute performance ends, Pete brings in other ""comedians"" who are so bad at their career choice that Pete seems brilliant by comparison.Pop culture, Hollywood: Please stop pretending we should care about Pete. He's really not funny.",False
6,1,Terrible!!,qsspzhpzf,n/a,15/08/2025,"My guess is that all of Pete's friends came here after the show and reviewed themselves. Coz that thing was trash! The ""jokes"" were flat. Everything Pete said was based on Kanye. Twitter has better jokesI didn't laugh not even once!",False
7,7,Best Netflix Showcase Special,dangiven,n/a,15/08/2025,Very solid group of comedians I hadn't heard except for the last one and the country music in the beginning was weird. Pete has def improved as well. MGK killed it as always.,False
8,1,Awful,doomprodigy,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI had high hopes for this after I saw Petes bit about Arianna Grande on Tik Tok, but this was awful, a 48 minute show with only 5 mins of a stoned and unfunny Pete along with some oddballs comedians. With the pumped in laughs and jokes that didnt hit the mark I can say this was a waste of time.",True
9,6,Maybe for discovering new artists but I prefer one-man shows.,deloudelouvain,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stand-up comedy, one of the things I can really enjoy, but mostly one-man-shows. Pete Davidson Presents, is like you guessed, different stand-up comedians bringing each a very short act. It's nice to discover new artists but most of the time it's just too short. Just when you get into a certain show they stop and introduce another artist. Not all of them were good but decent. Some others were interesting and made me want to see a complete show from them, maybe in the future. The couple singing acts didn't fit and were not that great. This show is okay to kill an hour but don't expect the tears rolling.",False
10,1,Terrible!,qgwydj,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unfunny....the b team.Didn't laugh once. I did win $100 at an open mic night so I am an expertðŸ˜‰
I guess I am spoilt by Ismo ... now there's a funny guy!Pete isn't bad but this show just didn't do much for me!",False
11,8,"Best ""Someone presents"" so far on Netflix",backup-50362,n/a,15/08/2025,"The ""Bill Burr presents"" was a major disappointment, and the rest were okay at best and unwatchable at most.But this was great. I know it's illegal to like Pete Davidson for some reason, but I don't follow US pop culture so I don't know what he did to deserve this, other than dating some random dead-inside pop stars and useless public figures.But as a comedian, he's always been funny on stand ups, and he's funny here too. I also like MGK a lot and it's always great to see him too, the man that clapped at Eminem.The comics on this one, unlike the previous Netflix ""presents"" stuff were actually really good, and I'm guessing those really are friends of Pete, not like the last few times - cherry-picked Netflix people.So yeah smoke a tree like they did before this and enjoy. It's better than everything else from ""Netflix is a Joke"" so far. Those random friends of Pete are way funnier than the comedians Netflix is pushing all the time!",False
12,7,"Not great, but a LOL Compared to Bill Burr's NFIAJ Special",tontogringo,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a legit 5/10 comedy. Worth watching, BUT still Not great. It is a refreshing LOL Compared to Bill Burr's ""Netflix is a Joke"" Special. Hopefully he (Bill) learns that he's straight up wrong, and not funny, when he runs with ""jokes"" he knows are not funny (I went to his life show with the same jokes ad his Netflix is a joke special: the crowd did not laugh at the jokes he put into his special, but he would bring the crowd back with other jokes, then still continue with the ""jokes"" no one was laughing at).",False
13,1,Unbearable,dcassis,n/a,15/08/2025,"How bad is the comedy scene when Pete Davidson is big enough to be presenting anything. Let alone a who's who of people you will never hear from again, and a guy famous because he's girlfriend was in that movie one time..
0/10.",False
14,10,Amusing at the least,austin-46918,n/a,15/08/2025,I thought this was the best comedic stand up in a while...far better than Snl. I guess the masses have very poor taste in humor these days...no wonder 90% of the stuff coming out is garbage.,False
15,10,Return to comedy and a middle finger to cancel culture.,swmbtwgyd,n/a,15/08/2025,"These guys calling it out in a hilarious way. People being stupid hypersensitive and being ridiculous get owned here as they should. Jordan Rock was on point big time calling out Gen Z and the other guests were hilarious as well. Super dope of Pete to give his friends a platform like this. Also really happy with Netflix moving away from the PC culture that is rotting this country. Finally feeling like there are normal people out there. MGK bringing pop punk back as well. As a 31 year old who is tired of the ridiculousness, this was so refreshing. Way to go Pete, Netflix and friends. About damn time we start sticking it to the crazies.",False

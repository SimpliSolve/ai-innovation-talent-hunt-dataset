1,6,Light and fun show,cwcyrj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really like watching fancy house tours, so overall I enjoyed the show. It was light and fun, and cool to see a glimpse into the luxury market in Toronto. There wasn't much in terms of storyline. No real character development. The ""drama"" was pretty dull. If you're looking for the Canadian version of Selling Sunset, this definitely isn't it. Don't go into it expecting much. It's a good show though for just shutting your brain off and unwinding in the evenings. I'm sure some of the listings were probably fake, but it was still neat to see the different houses/ architectural styles/ decor choices. All in all a decent show, but nothing to write home about.",False
2,8,Wow. Wow. Wow.,marsha_roc,n/a,16/08/2025,"The production value, direction and music for this show is phenomenal. I always knew that Toronto has a lot of affluent people but to get to have a peek at some of the houses and condos of this caliber in the GTA is a real treat. We can definitely rival Selling Sunset in L. A. and The Parisian Agency in France. It really made me want to venture to change profession and become a Real Estate Agent. The drone shots and arial panoramic views are breathtaking. It really shows off the beauty of our city. Makes me so proud to be a Torontonian. Keep up the fantastic work and continue to showcase the heart of Canada in order for us to elevate the 6ix.",False
3,10,Refreshing!,curtismitchellplatt,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this was a really refreshing take on a reality theme that has been a bit stale for a bit. Love the Canadian touch, the head guy at Team Torkan has a wild backstory, and seems very genuine. You can see that passed down to his team too, curious to hear more about Veronica Harris' story, great natural charisma and seems so kind. Also refreshing to see that in that industry! Nice to see a great Canadian city featured too, such beautiful areas to show off, and amazing variety too. Hope they get a season 2 to show off the people and places this country has to show, they've only scratched the surface!",False
4,10,Insightful and Entertaining,tiffanithiemann,n/a,16/08/2025,"What sets Luxe Listings Toronto apart from other real estate shows is the depth it gives to the agent-client relationships. It's not just about flashy homes, but about the trust and finesse required to close these multi-million-dollar deals. The agents, particularly Brett and the Torkans, have a dynamic energy that is both entertaining and insightful. For anyone interested in luxury real estate, or simply in need of some light-hearted TV drama, this show is a fantastic pick. Interesting to see how the agents navigate the complexities of their clients' demands. The rivalry among the agents adds a competitive spirit that keeps you engaged.",False
5,10,"Beautiful Homes, Fun Rivalry",meldaknepp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed the luxury home tours, and the rivalry between the agents adds a layer of excitement. The homes are breathtaking, and it's nice to see a real estate show set in Toronto. Definitely worth checking out! Luxe Listings Toronto is pure entertainment! The homes are incredible, and the agents' personalities really shine through. It's glamorous, captivating, and just a lot of fun to watch. Can't wait to see what else the season brings. If you're a fan of real estate, this show is a must-watch. The homes are stunning, and it's interesting to see the Toronto market up close. There's some drama between the agents, but it doesn't take away from the incredible properties.",False
6,1,Makes me embarrassed to be from Toronto,CallaDB,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let's start by putting aside how blatantly tone deaf it is to release a show like this amidst the worst housing crisis in Toronto's history with a record number of unhoused people and even working professionals struggling to fulfill a basic human need. It's an obvious and damning lapse in judgement to all involved that I hope comes with business related consequences after this dumpster fire gets cancelled. Instead, I'll just focus on how utterly CRINGE this show is as a whole. From the camera quality to the painfully bad acting and dialogue, if you didn't know better you might think it was a parody of Selling Sunset that was purposefully and hilariously bad. But no, this is how these people genuinely chose to present themselves to the world. The fake drama, the fake lifestyle, it's like a fantasy of what every Bay St. D-Bag would think was ""luxury"" in the mid 2000s. I usually love seeing my hometown represented on screen, but this is just cheesy and embarrassing.",False
7,9,"Stunning Homes, Engaging Agents",andradunford,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show delivers a fascinating look into Toronto's high-end real estate market, offering a mix of drama and luxury. The agents have a natural charisma that keeps the show interesting, and the homes are simply out of this world. I particularly love how the series balances showcasing properties with the personal stories and challenges of the agents. It's not just about selling homes, but about the relationships, the hustle, and the city's competitive market. Luxe Listings Toronto is a compelling watch that'll leave you dreaming of owning one of these incredible homes. Each episode leaves you wanting more-great cliffhangers and character developments.",False
8,1,Out of touch,cassyballs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who's idea was this to even produce this show ?? When the average Canadian can't even afford a home across Canada you have all these yuppie real estate agents acting like they're the damn wolf of Wallstreet , it's a gross slap in the face . Shows like this do nothing to help cool our housing market. First episode I watch the guys looking for a 21-25 million dollar home???? The fact that this was released in 2023 goes to show that these rich folks are out of touch areseholes who keep over inflating the housing market to make a quick buck. Let me guess CBC play a part in this ? Wouldn't doubt it for a second.",False
9,10,Entertaining but Overly Competitive,auberongunnerson,n/a,16/08/2025,"The properties featured in this series are nothing short of amazing, but the constant competition between the agents can feel a bit contrived. I would have liked more focus on the real estate deals rather than the rivalries. Still, it's a fun show if you're into real estate. I loved seeing some of Toronto's most luxurious homes, and the agents were fun to watch, especially with their friendly rivalries. The show is a great mix of jaw-dropping properties and behind-the-scenes real estate drama. Can't wait for more! Love the insights into the luxury market-makes me wish I could tour those homes!",False
10,1,you will lower your IQ if you watch this show,salavich,n/a,16/08/2025,This is what happens when networks or streaming services have to present Canadian content. We get content like this.This isn't even close to reality - this is just uggggg.Like if anyone who had that much money to buy houses like this would EVER consider buying from over botoxed pretensious wanna bes like this.We need make it hard to get a real estate license in this country. This is an embarrassement for anyone who is actually a real real estate agent in the City.Influencers are not real estate agents - never should be. Anyone who is seriously looking to purchase real estate in Toronto would stay clear of these actors.,False
11,10,Great Balance of Homes and Personality,reathajandl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love how Luxe Listings Toronto balances beautiful real estate with the personalities of the agents. Brett Starke and the Torkans are fun to watch, and their friendly competition makes the show even more entertaining. A must-watch for real estate enthusiasts! I never realized how incredible Toronto's luxury real estate market is until I watched this show. The multi-million-dollar homes are unreal! The agents keep things lively, though sometimes the personal drama overshadows the properties. Still, I'm hooked! Visually stunning! The properties are breathtaking, and the agents' dynamics keep it interesting.",False
12,10,Toronto Shines,vergiefanny,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally, a luxury real estate show set in Toronto! I love seeing my city represented in such a glamorous way. The properties are to die for, and the agents are entertaining. The drama between Brett and the Torkans is a little overplayed, but it doesn't take away from the incredible homes. This show gives you an incredible tour of Toronto's top-tier real estate! The homes are gorgeous, and the production quality is top-notch. The cast is likable, but sometimes the rivalry feels a bit forced. Overall, it's an enjoyable series if you love luxury real estate. Fascinating to see the challenges these agents face while dealing with high-end clients and properties.",False
13,10,Toronto Real Estate at Its Finest,quianakegler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seeing Toronto's real estate market from the inside was fascinating! The show offers a unique look into how competitive and high-priced the market is. The drama between the agents feels a little forced, but it's still very entertaining. I wanted to love this show, but it feels a bit too scripted at times. The homes are spectacular, but the personal drama takes away from the real estate. If you're looking for more focus on properties and less on the agents, this might not be for you. The competition among agents adds an exciting edge. I can't wait for the next episode! A refreshing take on real estate reality shows, with a unique Toronto flair.",False
14,1,The worst trash on television,alan_lovatt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really?This is true television garbage, horrid, nasty, name dropping, botoxed clowns. How did this show EVER get approval to start filming.It is so terribly out of touch.How do you base a show on 15 second snippets of mindless drivel interspersed with all the trashiest music in today's society.I feel like this would work better as a comedy, on the lines of basing a whole show on the Catalina Wine Mixer, you've already got the perfect cast in place. This is not funny, not interesting, poorly scripted bottom feeding television. The reinforcement of the foul language and unprofessional attitudes should tell everyone to stay away not only from this show but the ""performers"" as well.Just my humble opinion.",False
15,10,Escapism at Its Finest,iselaplansinis,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're in the market for some real estate eye candy, Luxe Listings Toronto delivers in every episode. The homes are breathtaking, and the stakes for the agents feel real. What sets this show apart is the balance between showcasing the glamorous properties and focusing on the personal dynamics between the agents. It's fun to see how competitive yet collaborative they are. Even if luxury real estate isn't your passion, the entertainment value in this show is undeniable, and the Toronto backdrop adds a fresh vibe to the luxury reality TV genre. While it showcases incredible homes, the interpersonal drama is what really draws you in.",False
16,1,Abhorrent,chrisfernbeck,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I don't necessarily agree with the previous posts with regard to going after the show due to it being out of touch, I will say that it's pretty horrible on all levels. From the camera work being elementary compared to Luxe Listings Sydney, Selling Sunset, Selling the OC, and, EVEN, Buying Beverly Hills, the acting is atrocious. It seems that all the characters, including the guest appearances from buyers and builders, seems to be just a way to boost the businesses of people who really haven't ""Made it"". Close ups of fake Rolex Day Dates(Jubilee Bracelets, really? That's not an option, and, even if it was, why would someone choose that over the ""Presidential bracelet?"", houses that never sold and the listing were terminated. Wow. Embarrassing for Toronto. I have no doubt that this show will be cancelled, and if not, what has this world come to?",False
17,10,A Bit Too Dramatic,roshoffelmeyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"The houses are absolutely stunning, but the show focuses too much on the rivalry between the agents. I wanted more about the listings and less drama. It's worth watching if you're a fan of real estate, but the personal conflicts feel a bit over the top. As a fan of real estate shows, Luxe Listings Toronto is a fresh take with some of the best properties I've ever seen on TV. The show gives you an inside look at Toronto's luxury market, and I was especially impressed with the beautiful cinematography. Highly recommend! An entertaining look at the real estate hustle, though sometimes the drama feels a bit staged.",False
18,3,Bit too fake for me,kkingdesigns,n/a,16/08/2025,"A bit too fake and forced. Acting is terrible. For example one of them is driving to a function and out of the blue he said I need to stop by and check a property of mine cause I am just so professional (eye roll) then when he gets there and walks through the doors, the house is already lighted up like a Christmas tree. AS IF!It is what it is with this show, I get things are staged but the acting is so bad it actually makes me cringe.Anyways I need to fulfill the required characters so I will sing Hero to inspire others to go on after watching this show.... There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away....",False
19,10,Lavish Homes and Intense Deals,micacudworth,n/a,16/08/2025,"Luxe Listings Toronto brings you into the high-stakes world of real estate, where the homes are as grand as the personalities. Brett Starke and the Torkan duo add layers of intrigue, making the show more than just about selling properties. I was hooked by the stunning homes at first, but it's the negotiation scenes and the tension between agents that made me stay. This series is a great watch for anyone who loves a peek into the ultra-wealthy side of real estate. I love real estate shows, and Luxe Listings Toronto is the best I've seen in a while. The houses are beyond gorgeous, the deals are intense, and the competition between the agents is addictive. The series offers a perfect blend of luxury home tours and reality TV drama, with plenty of laughs and tense moments. Toronto's skyline makes for a beautiful backdrop, and the homes featured are nothing short of dream-worthy. Highly recommend this series if you enjoy a good mix of luxury and drama.",False
20,10,Stunning Toronto Homes,cotyissac,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is the perfect combination of luxury real estate and interpersonal drama. Watching Brett Starke and the Torkan duo go head-to-head in Toronto's competitive market was incredibly entertaining. The homes are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, and the rivalry adds a fun twist. A great show for anyone who loves aspirational content and a peek into high-stakes real estate!""Luxe Listings Toronto showcases the best of what this city has to offer. From sprawling mansions to chic downtown condos, every episode features properties that make you dream. The agents have great chemistry, though at times it feels a bit scripted. Still, the stunning visuals make it well worth the watch!",False
21,10,Luxury Meets Competition,lulamarine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Luxe Listings Toronto has quickly become my go-to real estate show. The properties alone are worth watching for-each one feels like a dream home. But what really makes the show stand out is the competitiveness between the agents. The mix of rivalry and respect between Brett and the Torkans adds an extra level of excitement to the series. I highly recommend this show for anyone who enjoys reality TV with a glamorous twist. While some conflicts feel exaggerated, it's all part of the fun. A guilty pleasure! I love the focus on high-end listings; it inspires anyone interested in real estate. Meets Competition.",False
22,1,The Audacity,ryan-f-kolman,n/a,16/08/2025,"At a time where more and more Canadians are ending up homeless because of the skyrocketing cost of housing, these geniuses think that it's a great time to launch a show detailing the homes of the country's fabulously wealthy. This is exactly why we need to tax the sun out of them. No one deserves or is entitled to live like this when there are families living in vans and RVs - people with full-time jobs! I hope this show ruins the careers of the hosts as well as the brain-dead producers who green-lit this project. I guess the silver lining of this trashy show is that they're showing the rest of us exactly where to find them.",False
23,10,Not Enough Focus on the Properties,tawandakaestner,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the show has some amazing properties, it spends too much time on the agents' personal conflicts. I wish there was more focus on the real estate deals and less on the drama. The homes are worth watching, though! This is one of the more exciting real estate shows I've watched. The competition between the agents is fun, and the properties are beyond beautiful. If you're into luxury real estate, you'll love Luxe Listings Toronto! Luxe Listings Toronto shows luxury real estate at its finest. The properties featured are absolutely stunning, and the competitive nature of the agents adds some spice to the show. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys luxury real estate.",False
24,1,Just Plain Embarrassing Only Thing Missing is JT and Freeland,eugenio-steele,n/a,16/08/2025,I also cannot believe that this show has been released as this time when the whole of Canada is under a inflated property bubble and we can see who is just responsible. This is what happens when a large amount of money is trapped in this bubble and boy its going to be refreshing to see when it bursts.I question who would want to be involved in this show but its ok the posers and actors rise to the occasion.I especially loved the story about how the Mans Man dodged the draft in Iran. We need to stop confusing wealth and success with good people.I also would not trust any of the real estate agents in this show and it sadly points out how bad the market is in Toronto.Also this show is immediately dated as the ONE as gone bankrupt. And is heading down litigation street.But if you want to blame anyone about the housing crisis in Canada you need not look any further than the government's past policies and guess what when it blows up.Its going to be us again the Tax Payer who will be on the hook.After all the money that has been wasted we could have given a free house or parcel of land to everyone in Canada.,False
25,10,Drama Overload,keshaboehm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping for more of a focus on the real estate market, but the show leans heavily into agent drama. While the homes are gorgeous, the personal conflicts between the agents take up too much screen time for my taste. I had a blast watching this show. The real estate is jaw-dropping, and the interactions between the agents keep things interesting. It's a fun, lighthearted show that's easy to binge! This show offers a fresh take on the real estate genre by focusing on Toronto's luxury market. The agents are charismatic, and the properties are incredible. It's definitely a step up from other real estate shows out there.",False

1,6,New nuances,svozil-706-642770,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary might be interesting from a French point of view, as it contains long passages with French functionaries.What was new to me was that many of the ""disclosures"" of the past years might actually prepare us for, and be the precursor to a ""big final disclosure"" in the not too distant future.Small glitches were made wrt confusions of the ""pentagon videos"" in the beginning, but they are of no importance to the content. Nice interviews with former Senator Reid, as well as with Harvard University Professor Abraham Loeb (although I doubt that the object called Oumuamua represents alien technology---it simply might be ""too dumb"" for that), as well as many Frech experts who say very reasonable things.Btw, I always wondered why UFO/UAP/AAPs allegedly crash so often on Earth, leaving debris behind, but who am I to judge?",True
2,8,Great up to date summary,AlienLover3000,n/a,16/08/2025,"Covers the most up to date, most credible ufo incidents in recent memory including the Pentagon UFO videos. While nothing new for ufo enthusiasts, for anyone not in deep in the ufo field, its a short, succint, straight to the point ufo documentary on the latest happenings. Great analasys and insight by a bunch of French dudes in it too.",False
3,1,Stupid movie,ivoivo-31020,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie documentary is made for simple-minded people that can't question anything from what have some ""government officials"" told them too. If you don't have the capacity to think, then this is your new religion.",False
4,9,Very interesting,hansy-39254,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really don't understand why this documentary have such bad ratings. It's a very interesting documentary which brings up very credible and up to date incidents, as TuanHo mentioned.
It's not one of those ""nut job"" UFO documentaries.",False
5,1,Limited Disclosure BS - for the sheeple,asarandes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh please aatip, mufon nonsense, limited disclosure pile of crap. The world governments know who they are, what they want, have treaties and beefs with them. This is just a pile of propaganda for the brainwashed masses. If you're bored and want a laugh, maybe make a drinking game out of this joke of a documentary.",False

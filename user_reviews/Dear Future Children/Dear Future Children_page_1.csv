1,10,Incredible!,sarahkoch-49263,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very sophisticated, authentic and emotional documentary with strong, courageous and inspiring protagonists.

2,10,Compelling and eye opener. A must watch,marialaika,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEach story was shocking for me in many ways. But I'd highlight the fact that this is shot in XXI century and the political situation shown is mind-blowing and unfair.The Chilean situation reminds me in a way of what happened in Spain back in 2011. With more violence though. I really hope the resolution is different though, because in Spain I don't see a significant change.The protests in Hong Kong are so recent that I still get goosebumps... And there are so many details I didn't even imagine that were happening!Seeing the impact of the climate crisis in Uganda is very revealing.Totally recommend this documentary.",True

7,10,Most important film of 2021,d-danzer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let's get back from the corona paralysis to the topics that are really imprtant. The question: What kind of world do we want for our children, if not for ourselves? And: are we willing to fight or a world wtrth ro live in?

9,n/a,Impactful,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Definitely worth watching. It saddens me that the Hong Kong and Chile protests feel already forgotten in 2021 (in the US). I hope that this helps people remember. There were so many sacrifices that have already faded into obscurity.,False

Finally this is a brilliant and well-made documentary which gives a voice to young activists from Uganda, Hong Kong and Chile.I long searched for a richly detailed documentary about climate activists and the way how the audience can connect with the protagonist Nakabuye Hilda Flavia here is wonderful, entertaining and informative at the same time.",False

13,10,Brilliant film!,erinthomascorrespondence,n/a,16/08/2025,I saw this in January 2021 and it was definitely the most thrilling documentary at the Max-Ophüls festival - very well-made and character-driven.

14,10,One of the most important films this year.,natalylunghu,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm from Hong Kong myself and met the filmmakers Franz Böhm and Friedemann Leis whilst they were filming at the protests. I also supported their crowdfunding campaign and was impressed by how much the filmmakers informed their community.The finished film is very well-made, well-informed and emotional at the same time.For me, the protagonist ""Pepper"" (from HK) represents the characteristics of so many Hong Kongers:
Thirsty for democracy, home-loving but powerless when they have to fight against such a big opponent.
I think it's so important that many people see this film.As someone who experienced the situation in Hong Kong, I feel very understood and represented by this film.I also want to send out a big THANK YOU to everyone who was involved in creating this film.",True

17,10,Goosebumps guaranteed!,MarcelRenner,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw the film at the premiere and I'm positively surprised how good it turned out.You feel very much with the young protagonists, who are rightly angry at the government.

The team exposed themselves to real dangers!I absolutely recommend this documentary to everyone, young or old.Watch it!",False
18,10,Gives me a big ton of hope!,mirahill,n/a,16/08/2025,"Voices that keep being unheard are finally listened to! Being an activist myself I know how much this means and that projects like this coming alive is exactly what holds our world together.It's all emotions in one movie. Not only the narrative it transports, but as well the mix of power and vulnerability which shows so delightfully what makes us human - why it's so important we protect each other and keep all of us save in a world that is extremely cruel. It's the teamwork and faith in front and behind the camera that makes it so vibrant.Literally a grand masterpiece with no other of its kind!",False

22,10,Captivating and impressive - definitely well worth seeing!,john_albright,n/a,16/08/2025,"DEAR FUTURE CHILDREN is a documentary film in which three strong women are fighting for individual causes and against crises. Pepper is a young woman from Hong Kong who is protesting against the impending dictatorship. Hilda is a young climate activist who represents ""Fridays for Future Uganda"". Rayen from Chile is a young activist who demonstrates against the injustice in her country and for the rights of the working class. They all have one thing in common: They want to make the world a better place for the next generation. So they fight against oppression, climate change and police violence. The documentary shows unfiltered what extreme and dire situations prevail in some countries. Impressive images and impressions directly from the demos and events bring the crucial points across in an incredibly captivating way. It is also good that the topics are not told as objectively as in the news, but with emotions from the demonstrators' point of view.",False

A powerful insight into the world of resistance.",False
25,10,Outstanding Documentary!,ginacrivellin,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary by young filmmakers, with young protagonists and a strong message to protect the future of our children.This film captures the viewers with its brave protagonists, bold statements and overall stunning atmosphere.While learning about the history of current problems in society and climate, the three protagonists talk about their lives and those of many other civilians which suffer under their current conditions of life.I was shocked by the scenes about the protestors on the frontline but also grateful that the filmmakers are giving a voice to these young women and their movements.",False

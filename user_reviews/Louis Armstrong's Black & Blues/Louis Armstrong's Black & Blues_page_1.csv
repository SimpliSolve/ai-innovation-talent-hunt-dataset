1,8,What a voice. What a musician. What a legend. What a man.,imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do get instant goose bumps whenever I hear these magnificent Louis Armstrong classics! Such a magnificent voice.Everybody around the world, still recognizes that voice instantly, from the old to the very young. The man just isnt able to sing a false note and has such power and warmth in his voice, that is simply to die for!Jazz musician Wayne Shorter narrates this documentary, which consists of a lot of short interview clips and sound recordings from Louis Armstrong himself, throughout his long and glorious carreer. I liked that way of telling his story about his life. What better way than let the artist himself speak.I wish we got to hear more about his youth though and why and how he got into music, besides being surrounded by musicians on every street corner in New Orleans and being given a hornet at a young age, which he cherished and which he studied intensely. The rest is history...Already at a very young age he was known for reaching powerful high notes, which nobody else could play. Even Wayne Shorter, not the least of the jazz musicians, even he simply cant reach many notes Louis Armstrong could reach easily!This documentary focusses mostly on Louis Armstron as a person and his rise to fame and the focus is not so much on his records, which I guess was a choice that didnt turn out badly.The documentary ends with a portrait of the civil rights movement during the late sixties in which Armstrong publicly didnt choose sides. He was attacked for that back then by some members of the black community, but in hindsight Louis Armstrong probably did more for building bridges between races than he was given credit for.Recommended for all the fans! And now I am gonna shut up and listen to one (of many) of his terrific songs!!!",False
2,7,"You Know His Voice, But Do You know the Man Himself?",KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"'Louis Armstrong's Black & Blues' (2022) is a stunning documentary looking past the gravelly singer and trumpeter that was only ever shown with a smile. You will see the man behind the trumpet and what his thoughts were throughout his well-documented life.Pops is the sole focus of this documentary as almost all interviews and recordings of Louis' friends and contemporaries are never shown on screen. Louis is King like he was in real life. Through interviews and personal recordings, the life of Louis is more thoroughly revealed and explored than ever before.This documentary is fantastic as it gives the audience an in-depth look into someone they all know and sing along with but not really know too well. Satchmo is known for his great smile and gravelly voice throughout the world, but his thoughts provide so much more to the legendary figure in this film.Watch it. You may have known that Louis is a legendary figure, but now you will know why he is such a legend.",False
3,n/a,Really beautiful portrait of an artist,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Didn't know what to expect going into the film. I thought I knew who Louis Armstrong was but this film shows me I knew nothing but the records.There are so many ways to make a biographical documentary but this was such a unique way. To make this Louis account of his own life and those who truly knew and played with him elevates the film so deeply. You get a real essence of Louis the person not just the performer, which this film goes to great pains to tell you was just one side and at the same time everything of who he was. The animated segments are the most enjoyable outside of learning musically what made him so special.I would definitely recommend anyone to see this wonderful documentary about the late great Louis Armstrong, in his own words.",False
4,10,Thrilling,hfernandeshsf,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember loving Louis Armstrong's voice from a very young age when I lived in the outskirts of my hometown in Brazil.We were very poor, but there were two things that used to be mandatory in our house: a TV set and a sound system (3x1 we used to call it, as there were a record and tape player, and the radio in it).I used to love to listen to a certain radio station that only played nice music, both Brazilian and international. Louis Amstrong's included.I had no idea by the age of 9, 10 years old what Louis was singing about, but the melodies were so beautiful (I also didn't know then that he was famous for playing the trumpet) and the songs sounded so thrilling.Today, I watched on Apple TV this great documentary about his life and legacy. It made me cry, both for his life story and for reminding me that it is not about where we are born at or who we are surrounded by, it's about the choices we make.One of the choices I had made when I was 12 years old was that was going to learn English. I didn't know when, I didn't know how (my mom couldn't afford it). Eventually, I managed to do it and that changed my life forever.By the way, I recommend this fabulous documentary!",False

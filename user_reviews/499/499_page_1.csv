1,9,History repeats itself through the eyes of a Conquistador.,TrueWouve,n/a,16/08/2025,"499 is a remarkably compelling look at violence in modern day Mexico. The film, which deals with very graphic and disturbing subject matter, is made accessible because it is narrated, in a way, through the eyes of a supernaturally returned Conquistador. This odd approach gives the film makers a culpable soul to bounce the grievances of the films' victims off. The segments of the film where our Conquistador retraces his original journey from the gulf coast inland are beautifully filmed. Each new region's changing topography is matched by a different aspect of modern violence.
It's been 500 years since the arrival of Cortez but somethings we see haven't changed.",False

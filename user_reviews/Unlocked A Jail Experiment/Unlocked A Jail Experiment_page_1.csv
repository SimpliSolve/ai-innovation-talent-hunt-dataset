1,8,"Big Brother meets Oz, great series.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Sheriff at an Arkansas Prison sets an experiment in motion at The Facility, he plans to open the doors and increase privileges, but both come with problems, that threaten to end the program.I binge watched the whole lot over a single weekend, it's a fascinating documentary series, so interesting.It's like a real life Oz, with Big Brother cameras watching, it's definitely a look at Prison life, but more so it's a study on human nature, the laws of the jungle as it were, a fascinating social experiment.It's interesting the whole way through, you really do get to see how the program influences and changes people. Easy to write them all off as bad eggs, but there are signs of change, Randy and Crooks seem like really cool guys.I chuckled to myself, who's the worst person to be locked down with, definitely Miller, wow that guy was so irritating.Biggest nuisance - Miller
Best tattoos - Crooks
Most likely to cause a riot - Eastside
Most level headed - Randy
Worst person to play dominos - Weekley.I urge you to watch it.8/10.",False
2,6,Missing Information/Lack-of,ariellis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Would have appreciated more background on the characters we are following through 8 full episodes. Multiple characters are shown in all 8 but never named, never explained. We follow them throughout the entire series with no information on their crimes, their time spent incarcerated already, their time left to serve.Interesting idea but lacking the details. The personal details. The information needed to keep you invested in the people, the point of the series. Much left to be desired at the end as well as far as outcome. Seems a bit scripted in many scenes, definitely dramatized.Better jail documentaries out there.",False
3,6,Good truthful ending,tarohang,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe beginning of the show was intriguing when they posed the idea. It seemed forced because what the chief would always say it's dangerous and take no consideration into what everyone else was saying. They introduced the people as dangerous but they never got into really bad fights. The fights are never portrayed because there are no cameras in the room. It got interesting when they introduced new people into the jail and the old head cheated on cards and got his head sacked by a few of them. It's interesting to learn about commissary and hooch and lingo. The people there have interesting motivations, the old heads have more wisdom and the young ones done care at all. At the end when they all came together to encourage the chief to keep the doors open was heart warming and you could see how they really benefited from social interaction and peer support. It's too bad that their distrust and deregulation makes it difficult. The ending and showing the stories of redemption reminds us that these are real people and should be treated as such.",True
4,6,"Somehow, It's somewhat hilarious",FinleyKolapo,n/a,16/08/2025,"LOL All the reality TV tropes are here, even in prison:Classic ""you disrespect me!"" drama. Also, ""How dare you talk to me like that?!"" dramaInmates are introduced with close-up footage, multiple angle cuts, posing, lens flare, and dramatic music. Like, hello, these people committed CRIME lolVarious things were smashed. Many angry hands movementInmates having confessional-style reality TV talk to the camera as if they're Kardashians.The overall experiment itself was somewhat interesting, and there are serious moments in the show. However, I don't think I have absorbed any serious message. It's the prison drama that kept me watching.",False
5,7,"Storyline positive, music is annoying",angelabcampbell,n/a,16/08/2025,"If I hear 'you know what I'm sayin' one more time.. jee.sus! They need to add speech therapy to the curriculum. Such a bad habit.It was nice to watch them grow throughout the program just as it was frustrating to watch them fail.Kudos to the sheriff and his backers. This should be started at juvie tho. Nip it in the bud early.The series showed just enough plot, good feels, says and a bit of eye-rolling periods but that's what fast firward/skip 10s is for ;)I was hesitant to watch 'another jail reality show' but this one's promise for a good outcome for the inmates keeps you watching. ;) ..",False
6,7,Experimenting With Human Beings Is Not Good,jsi-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this series interesting, but if I was a Pulaski County taxpayer, I'd be concerned about what the sheriff might be putting me and the rest of taxpayers on the hook for. When the government takes a man's freedom from him, the government then becomes responsible for his wellbeing. That prisoner has to be fed, housed and cared for in a humane manner, and he has a civil right to not be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, and the sheriff has a duty to keep the prisoners from harm. If one prisoner had attacked another prisoner during their little experiment and severely injured, maimed, or even worse, killed a prisoner before officers could get in there and stop it? Well, the county would writing the prisoner and/or his family a big, fat check. I can't believe the county legal department would've signed off on this experiment. Locking people up; taking their freedom away, is a very expensive business if done right, and even more expensive if done wrong.",False
7,10,Unlike anything I've seen,guaposenorbutler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unlocked: A Jail Experiment is a mini series that follows the inmates of a cell block in Little Rock Arkansas as they navigate and negotiate life in jail environment, but without guards and without locks on their cell doors. At face value, this sounds like an impossible concept to film given the immense risks involved with allotting such freedom to some of societies most unruly men, but here it is for your curiosity to consume. I was at first turned off by the overly dramatized style of the documentary, but the high stakes of the experiment and the personalities of the inmates drew me in. I found the episodes to be raw and emotional, making the human spirit the main character. I've never seen any show quite like this one simply for the natural unfolding of almost Shakespearean drama. The pain and shame of the individuals involved sets a silent overtone despite their overly masculine facades. The American prison system can truly be cruel and dehumanizing and it is only in its context that these men could possibly have taken this experiment as seriously as they did, desperate to maintain their suddenly acquired freedom. The line that will stick with me, in response to the added privilege of free phone calls for all inmates, was ""this is paradise"". This series can be truly heart wrenching, and it will show a side of humanity that we all can relate to, in the least likely of places.",False
8,7,What did you expect?,celticsfan-72909,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's jail! All these guys there are bad people, and they belong there, period!Now before anyone throws a tantrum, I believe we have a character problem in this country, and jails and prisons are unfortunately needed. Look at the way these guys act and talk, and look what they're in for. They're scumbags, first and foremost.Now, the interesting part is the lengths the sheriff is willing to go to in order to give these guys more freedom to see how they respond. At the end of the day, if you tempt a wild animal with food, they're gonna bite you.These guys don't have the common sense, or the temperament to deal with responsibility on a daily basis, that's exactly why they're locked up!I watched it because it's different and interesting, but it's exactly what I expected.",False
9,10,Overlooked empathy when...,thisappuser,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching this show, and it's incredibly interesting on many levels.It's amusing to see the transformation from initial skepticism- inmates believing ""this isn't going to work""-to eventually taking responsibility, teaching others how to act, behave, and shape their identities.Additionally, I have immense respect for everyone involved in making this documentary. The camera crew members were physically surrounded by inmates, risking their lives, yet the inmates showed respect and let them do their job.The sheriff is a very good person. Often, people overlook the importance of empathy when dealing with inmates. Although inmates are incarcerated due to their actions, many are there because they lacked role models or were never taught the basic rules of society, leading them to commit crimes without considering the consequences.",False
10,7,It was worth the binge,philewill,n/a,16/08/2025,"Series score, if I was asked to watch it again within a month:10, would watch it again.7, not anytime soon.4, once was enough.1, regret my time.Tv series: Everything that starts well must end well, and I don't care how good a series starts, if the ending ruins it, whether that's because it was canceled or badly written.So whether it was canceled or ended badly, if it's an otherwise great series, it gets a 4, and if it sucked regardless of how it stopped, it's a 1.However even if the show has ended rushed or as intended, it will be judged based on the entirety of all seasons combined, with any of the 4 scores I mark content by.Review: I really enjoyed this, but I wouldn't watch it again anytime soon, it's easily a 4/10 in regards to the fact I wouldn't watch it alone again, although I'd love a future season where they take it to another pod/wing of the prison.That said, if someone asked me to watch it with them, I'd watch it again for them, it wasn't so bad that I felt like once was enough regardless of who wanted to watch it with me but preferably I'd want more than a month between watching it again.It's a good series, nothing amazing, but it kept me reasonably engaged, and the film crew did a good job for the limited space and capacity they had to work with.",False
11,9,People can change! Even the bad ones!,AndreasHoivold,n/a,16/08/2025,"The prisons in the US are bad! Finally some of the people running them has started to understand that how you treat people inside the walls will mirror how they will act when they get out.To let the prisoners get responsibility and some freedom is the only way to educate them for the life after prison, and that is what the sherif in Arkansas that is head of the prison will make an experiment about.Seeing how the inmates get into groups that wants to and don't wan to follow the rules is very interesting. Seeing how the prisoners change already from the first hours and all the way to the end of the show gave me tears in my eyes.This is a documentary that I would recommend for everyone, and especially those who like prison movies or that has served time or even those that are going to serve time.There is almost always hope if you just have the right mindset!",False
12,5,You know what I'm sayin?,benlancaster09,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I first started watching this show, I didn't know what the inmates were saying. They kept asking me, but I just wasn't getting it. I must be a slower learner. But having now watched all 8 episodes, carefully listening to all the inmates, and mulling it over, I can now confidently say that I still don't know what they were saying. They kept asking me ""you know what I'm sayin?"" And each time I said ""no"", but they continued talking as if I knew what they were saying. Eventually I just started nodding in acknowledgement, knowing full well I had absolutely zero idea what the hell they were saying.",False
13,10,I Too Just Binge Watched this Series Overnight,RiaViewre,n/a,16/08/2025,"The sheriff of this prison wanted to make a change and he and all related staff spent months preparing to create a situation where inmates could actually benefit and improve themselves vs staying in a cell for 23/24 hours/day. This hopefully improved quality of life for both staff and inmates, they needed ""a better way"" to run the prison and that included hopefully making more productive future citizens once the incarcerated folks leave the prison. I highly commend the sheriff and staff's efforts. They discuss the ""Older"" vs ""Juvenile"" inmates. Randy, an Older one, had the foresight to try to encourage others to step up and play a role in making their open door and extended freedoms program work. The inmates saw consequences of not conforming and participating positively within their experimental cell block Community. This program allowed the inmates to practice being responsible which is a step toward being responsible in the real world and not resorting to old criminal ways but instead being open to new ways of handling things. I LOVED IT! Honesty if this type of program was available where I live I would volunteer to help it be successful.I looked it up, at Pulaski prison they spend $18,250 per year to house a felon. That's about $50/day. That probably barely covers meals. In New York, it can cost as much as $162,000 per year. At Pulaski, they have 1-2 staff in the cell block, necessitating 23 of 24 hours/day of lockdown due to lack of staff. I had no idea that prisons had entire cell blocks on lockdown 23/24 hours/day (and I wonder if the 15 minutes per meal counts toward the 1 hour per day of getting to be outside of their cell. ) That would drive anyone insane, not being able to socialize, feel any freedoms or do any activities, or have any hope. This was not only a humane 'experiment', it should be a model for prisons going forward to help these folks who didn't have proper mentors or learning environments, or peers to get it right the first time before going into prison. Some people have a disabilities, if they find themselves in stressful prison settings without any attempt by their peers to better themselves, all will be stagnant or worse when they get out and then explode with the freedom. Freedom in prisons is a good concept when used to encourage proper behavior and adaptive skills that an be used positively in the community (or wherever they end up) going forward. Just sticking people in jails to rot isn't the answer; productive rehabilitative settings where people can learn from their life experience and improve themselves seems to be the way to go.",False
14,10,Absolutely brilliant I loved this..,cosnic-50173,n/a,16/08/2025,What a series.. The changes in some of the inmates was palatable in some cases.. Really a great series if you can see the benifit of people taking their own responsibility for not only themselves but for the community! The sheriff is a strong kind man with great foresight in the ability of people taking the right steps to change! By giving privaliges & recognising their actual strengths...I loved it from beginning to end I watched it in one night because I couldn't bare to leave it...I hope that many more prisons will recognise the benefits of such a program..I also hope that some of those inmates have learnt a load from the experience & change for the good...More of this please! My first review on this website because this was so excellent... What an ending!,False
15,10,Punishment or rehabilitation? That is the question,sgb71,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this series brought out some glaring truths to me: both punishment and rehabilitation are what prison needs to be.The hardest part of watching was seeing some of the men trying their best to become better men but not having the mental health support that they so desperately need. I'm sure the prison provides what it can, but without real change in the real world where mental health support should be available to everyone, then this will be an endless cycle. And the people holding the purse strings in Arkansas aren't willing to make changes at the prison for the better. This facility is only a county jail- yet it is being used to house inmates who are serving life sentences and have zero f's to give. Mixing a first time prisoner in with repeat offenders and those who will love their entire lives in jail is less than ideal.As an Arkansan, I see firsthand how wide the disparities are between those who have and those who do not. Generational poverty, violence, drug abuse and more are running rampant everywhere. And do not fool yourself that everyone is getting an equal education.If this look into a prison brought out any empathy, then please urge your lawmakers to support this sheriff and his staff as they try to balance punishment and rehabilitation in a novel way.",False
16,3,Trash reality TV in Jail?,ben_cat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Calling Unlocked a 'social experiment' is an embarrassment, it's nothing more than a soap opera in jail. This jailhouse reality TV debacle feels more like a recycled, watered-down version of past attempts. Programs like 60 days locked in even do a better job.Instead of shedding light on the harsh realities of incarceration, it seems the producers are more interested in turning inmates into reality show caricatures. The superficial glimpses into their backgrounds do little to humanise or contextualise their actions, leaving us feeling disconnected from the true impact of their crimes.While there may be occasional comedic moments, any semblance of authenticity or seriousness is lost amidst the contrived drama. It's clear that Unlocked prioritises entertainment over anything that could be impactful or learnt from an 'experiment' like this..That being said if you enjoy mindless entertainment like the Kardashians this is just a jail trip away!!",False
17,10,Compassion,rpepion,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEach person in this show was a piece of yarn ibterwoven into a tapestry. Watching the pod start off in a more institutiinalized reliant way then transforming through experiences as a collective, many mistakes made , but a learning process. From the outside looking in we could see what was workung and what wasnt. I personally was so annoyed when the leadership, Randy, stepped down. But he had to let the pod learn the hard way. After the 24 hours it waz a reality check n ears were opened. Eastside took responsibility which was good. We got to see the answer to a person who was having thoughts of harming themselves and jails still have a ways to go in the mental health of individuals on meds.My fave was Tiny. Seeing him reconnect with his boy was some raw emotion.A great study in human behavior and the way we humans survive (and some dont survive) and our need for compassion.",True
18,10,What a surprise this film was !!!!!,cyndyspan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, hope this system can b used and implemented in all the prisons. What a fantastic change that was made by these men in real time/life. To see them get to change their ways by their own decisions was an epic change for prisons. Men coming away from prison with many new abilities that will help them survive on the ""outside"" and ability to handle conflicts and life. They come out with skills and some pride in themselves. What a fantastic idea, this comes from a mom of an offender who would have loved to see him come home with a skill and a decent personality, and the ability to make good decisions and get along with people.Congratulations to Arkansas facility and hope they can get started to implement this system.",False
19,10,Perfect Reform!!,dowdenelisabeth,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is amazing!!! The change that it could create if this idea takes off!!!! Many different facilities could try this and create a wide spread change in the prison and jail systems. This is a blessing, they are doing great work. I'm very happy that Netflix joined with this as well, it was really well shot and edit. Can't lie either, I was crying at the end!!!! If you haven't seen it I really think you should, and comment the positives you seen in what they are trying to do. What other things does anyone else think they can do with this ""seed""? I cannot wait to find out and hope Netflix makes a sequel for us to see the amazing changes in prisoners lives more too!",False
20,4,Background noise. Boring show,scff-22820,n/a,16/08/2025,This is fine to have playing in the background while you're working or something but it's not very gripping or entertaining. I'm not much for reality TV but the premise had me intrigued. If this somehow lays the ground work for prisons to become better; I guess I'm for it.As a source of entertainment it just wasn't for me and a 4/10 was me being generous.I finished it just because I wanted to see where it was going but it truly wasn't an easy watch. I found myself bored with most of it (again I had it on while I was working so to be fair I wasn't paying super close attention to it).My advice is if you find yourself still bored 2-3 episodes in just give up. It doesn't get any better.,False
21,10,Gives me hope for humanity,mpride-87236,n/a,16/08/2025,Just finished the first season with H unit and I feel inspired. The Sherif is a true leader and a man who cares about humanity. I am very impressed with him and how his leadership changed so many lives. We need more cops like him in this world. The guys in the unit touched my heart as well. It is very hard to change and be reprogrammed from life's traumas but they worked hard to keep their privileges and keep those doors open. We should treat prisoners better and allow them to grow because most will rejoin society and prison is suppose to be correctional facility not one that turns people into animals!!!!!,False
22,9,Unexpectedly Liked It,PalmBeachG,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I first saw Unlocked: A Jail Experiment as a new release, I cautiously put it on my watchlist and wasn't sure if I really was going to watch it or not. Decided to give it a chance and to my surprise I unexpectedly really liked it. I like the experiment whether it was going to work or not because let's face it - something is failing our society and at least one man (the Arkansas Sheriff) was willing to put his career on the line and to at least try something to help not just individuals but a whole unit as a group. I think the experiment treated it more like a mental institution where those that are locked in are allowed to roam freely in common a common area, eat together, play cards, games, watch tv, etc together and they seem to manage despite their different problems, violent tendencies, etc. So why not try here? I just hope that it all sticks with the ones that got transferred out to new prisons and that they don't go back to their old ways. It looks like the documentary may have been left open for another season with maybe another try in another unit.#UnlockedJailExperiment

23,10,Excellent future,rdc-396-133236,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Unlocked: A Jail Experiment"" paints a vivid and hopeful picture of the transformative potential within the prison system, showcasing the remarkable change in prisoners' attitudes and behaviors as they begin to treat each other as fellow human beings. Drawing parallels with Australia's innovative approach of no-cell prisons, where inmates are granted more freedoms while still being held accountable, the documentary underscores the power of humane treatment and rehabilitation.Throughout the series, viewers witness a profound shift in the prisoners' interactions, from hostility to empathy and mutual respect. This evolution serves as a beacon of hope, demonstrating that even within the confines of incarceration, individuals can undergo meaningful transformation when provided with support and opportunities for personal growth.By highlighting success stories like those seen in Australia's no-cell prisons, ""Unlocked"" offers a glimpse into a future where the American justice system prioritizes rehabilitation over punishment. With each episode, the show not only challenges societal perceptions of prisoners but also ignites a sense of optimism for the potential to change minds and lives on a broader scale.""Unlocked: A Jail Experiment"" is a compelling and thought-provoking series that underscores the importance of compassion and understanding within the criminal justice system, offering a glimmer of hope for a brighter, more humane future for all.",False
24,2,A dangerous play with people's lives for entertainment,dominiqueacamara,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have a lot of questions about this so called social experiment and how it possibly could have been approved. Was there a team of psychologists or any type of scientists who helped to design it? Did the inmates give their consent and have the option to opt out of it? What research is there to support the hypothesis that taking nearly every reasonable safety support away from people with obvious severe social and mental impediments would be beneficial? There likely are ways to beneficially restructure the relationship between inmates and guards, but this experiment screams neglect and makes a mockery of the people. Also why aren't these inmates doing anything useful with their time? They just hang out all day while taxpayers fund their Hollywood drama??!! I'm not along for this ridiculous ride.",False

Makes you realise that everyone has the capacity to learn, evaluate and make steps on a different path instead of going around in circles. All of these men have stories, hardships, trauma & bad decisions.I agree with holding people accountable. There's a reason why they are there. But, this shows a different way to approach damaged people, teach them how to communicate.It brought up quite the debate in my household ranging from grace needs to be shown to throw away the key.

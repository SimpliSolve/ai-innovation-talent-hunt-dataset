1,7,Contrary to popular opinion ...,jologo-12649,n/a,16/08/2025,"While it's not a barrel of laughs, I enjoyed the quirky originality of Catherine Cohen's song-and- standup performance. Not sure I would watch another of her shows, but as a one-off, it was a good hour's worth of entertainment.",False
2,2,Depressing,Jblum5,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a former standup comic myself I believe stand up comedy is extremely personal to me. I believe it is one of our last honest forms of honest entertainment. I have heard many times the stereotype that ""women aren't funny"" and I personally know that isn't true. So I always keep a look out for comics I haven't heard before.This comedy special is abysmal. Laughs are few and far between. The comedy is fake woke. Schumer style forced sexual jokes, to the lowest common denominator. It is also peppered with songs that bring everything to a screeching halt. Disappointing that this is what Netflix gets behind. Skip this one .",False
3,9,Unapologetically Feminine,livkelly-17062,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very fun and refreshing to watch stand up about being a woman (but not in the form of solely sex jokes) She's real, her jokes are relatable and she's unapologetically feminine. The songs are a lot of fun and she has a beautiful voice. She really reminded me of a self-deprecating alexis rose. Would love to see more of her!Ps. A lot of the reviews on here so far are from men, so I felt the need to add my first ever review- Please don't expect to watch an amy schumer esqueshow- this is not that type of female-comedy.",False
4,1,The singing is terrible,phojar,n/a,16/08/2025,"What in the actual heck is this crap show? I started watching this and after 5 minutes of terrible singing, I decided this was a do not finish. She overdid the entrance and I began to wonder if she was desperately trying to show off her singing instead of perform comedy, which if she thinks she's an amazing singer, she clearly got too many participation trophies.The first 10 minutes was so gut wrenching bad that I couldn't stomach the rest.",False
5,8,Fun!,radarou79,n/a,16/08/2025,"I honestly don't get the cynical nature of the previous review. Obviously written by a straight man. I thought this comedian showed a fun, eccentric, off beat personality that's all her own. I laughed throughout. I'm actually watching it again.",False
6,2,More forced woke comedy rubbish,info-85684,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the jokes to be crude, and verging on disgusting, nothing funny about them.She was clearly trying to shock the audience into laughing which failed abysmally.The woke agenda was in some way inserted into every punchline, or what she obviously wanted to be a punchline.She has an ok voice but nothing special. I also prefer to keep comedy and singing separate.Whoever decided this should be a netflix special needs their head examined.",False
7,9,Brilliant musical standup,cinema11954,n/a,16/08/2025,"This one-hour special, filmed at Joe's Pub in NYC, is a raunchy musical romp through the world of Millennial self-absorption, sex, and privilege. Cohen flies highest when she is singing, with songs that stand on their own musically. The songs especially delight through the wry lyrics delivered in Cohen's beautiful voice with a ridiculously varied range. The shock sexuality loses its impact as the show goes on, but all in all, the breadth of Cohen's skills make this show a highly worthy view.",False
8,4,"Songs' good, jokes are not",yvettelxn,n/a,16/08/2025,Her voice is beautiful but I didn't laugh the whole time. She briefly talks about one thing and when you expect more then she changes to another topic. Somehow I feel sad for her experience.,False
9,n/a,Knock-Off Amy Schumer Tries to be Knock-Off Bo Burnham,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Twist...? She's Cringeworthily MediocreI wanted to like this special. I'm always excited to see new stand-up, and I love when a good-comic can defy the untrue stereotype that ""women aren't funny"".. this was not one of those times. This comic presents as an overly narcissistic, desperate for your attention, cabaret act that feels like a knock-off Amy Schumer during the sub-par joke sections and a wanna-be Bo Burnham during the uncatchy/unfunny songs. There's even a poetry reading bit that failed to land even half as hard as Burnham's nearly 10 years ago.The comic's lack of self-awareness is really what pushes this special to become ""cringe"". She'll tell you she's a fabulous singer after she sings a greeting to the audience and they don't clap (as they shouldn't). This comic is not a strong enough singer or comedian to blend the two professional performances together while remaining arrogant. A little self-deprecation toward her singing voice would have made an enormous impact on how she's perceived.I believe if she sets the music aside until she's polished the comedy, we could see a really funny second special from her. Unfortunately her potential was squandered this time by trying to juggle too many pieces.If you like Amy Schumer and don't know who Bo Burnham is, you might like this special, everyone else can pass.",False
10,1,Very lacking in self awareness,smkett,n/a,16/08/2025,"The worst thing a comedian could do is overestimate how funny they are. Unfortunately, we live in a world where people like to pretend things are better than they are. Millennials are very eager to agree with something that fits what they think is evolved and cool. Sadly, many just don't have the nuance or integrity to reject what's bad because of their perceived identity - which is not sophisticated at all.",False
11,10,Brilliant,vnpkssv,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the funniest cabaret show I've seen in my life. She describes her show as ""for girls of all genders,"" so if you've never been a girl it might not be for you. Also it's true that it's sad, but in the best way. If you like bittersweet, weird musical comedy then you will probably enjoy this show.",False
12,1,Humorless,charlesjdunkl,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only criticism I disagree with relates to her singing voice, which is an acceptable singing voice. Too bad she can't write, doesn't know how to tell a story, and doesn't have anything resembling comedic timing. I was in a mood to laugh, but this show crushed that mood.I didn't come away disliking her, and I'm sympathetic to her health challenges, but comedy isn't one of her abilities. The people praising her here seem proud of hating straight men. If you do too, go ahead and watch this show. There's a joke in there, unlike in this comedy show. I never came close to laughing and only cracked a smile once, probably because I misunderstood what she was saying at that moment.",False
13,10,Arch funhouse mirror cabaret comedy!,wilkay,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this show in 2018 in cabaret venue and it was spectacular then, and it was the same now on screen. The comedy is a hilarious reflection on the pains of the current culture of narcissism and everyone having 'main character syndrome' or wanting to have it. Her voice is gorgeous, flexible and clear. The opening song is almost a thesis statement for the entire show. She is a victim of herself, and presents her unhinged spiralling with espirit and does self-deprecation in a new way that I have not encountered before.It is odd to read some of the other reviews here, saying the she has a bad voice, because that is blatantly false (and makes the reviews seem entirely disingenuous). Also I wonder if these reviewer have ever been to a cabaret, if they understand the tradition she is working within is not stand-up. It is cabaret! Cabaret is bawdy, that is one of the main features, a shock for the puritanical undercurrents that persist in American society. Cabaret is gleaming, liminal, glittery, grubby and funny; and Catherine Cohen imparts these tones gorgeously.",False
14,1,Glaring nepotism,seanb-45703,n/a,16/08/2025,"Utterly devoid of comedic timing or original material, Catherine Cohen's comedy special 'The Twist...? She's Gorgeous' is an insult to the artform and a colossal waste of an hour.Leaning heavily on tired tropes and flimsy observational humor, Cohen demonstrates a complete lack of skill or stage presence. Her delivery is flat and affectless, her material recycled drivel. The only possible explanation for how someone so bereft of comedic chops managed to land a Netflix special is blatant nepotism and box-checking, as Cohen brings nothing compelling or unique to the table. Do yourself a favor - skip this vapid, derivative drivel and find a real comedian to spend your time on. The only twist here is how Cohen managed to fail upwards into undeserved success despite her glaring lack of talent.",False
15,10,cat cohen is a star,nancyhowekimball,n/a,16/08/2025,People are just scared of women that are loud and funny and opinionated and upfront about their experiences in the worldas a woman in my early twenties I feel really lucky to have a person like her to look up to and can't wait to see what she does next.,False

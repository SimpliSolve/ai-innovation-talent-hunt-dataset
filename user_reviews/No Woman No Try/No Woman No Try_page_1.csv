9,10,Solid reminder of why I love the game,kelsibutler,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched No Woman No Try with my boyfriend this evening and we were totally engrossed. Firstly, shaunaugh brown is an icon. Secondly, not to undermine SB but all the women featured in this film are icons.So much honesty from everyone being interviewed about their experiences, and I'm sure so so relatable to so many in rugby and in other womens sports. If you are a human, you will relate.Thank you to all involved in making this film for giving our sport room to have its voice heard. I only hope we can use this as a platform to grow the game more.Respectfully, this is me begging for a follow on series following players experiences at grass roots and premiership levels.",False
10,10,Great documentary,smiley-72735,n/a,15/08/2025,I loved this documentary. Really talks about the inequalities in sports and how easy it is to have all sports on same playing field. Not sure why so many ratings of 1 but of course no reviews explaining why. Started playing myself 34 years ago and played D2 on at my university as a club sport in its second year. Women's started the next year and we supported each other in every aspect of the game on and off the pitch. This is definitely a way to move forward showing how all should play and it should equal access to all players and same opportunities to play professionally and be equal in every way.,False

1,6,Fans will love this,dakjets,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lena Nyman was a Swedish actress who was once described by Ingmar Bergman as a genius. Her career took off in 1968 when she shot the film I am curious, which became a worldwide sensation.Unlike many other documentaries, this one is based on Lena Nyman's diaries. A narrator's voice reads out, while we see various film clips and other archive footage. For me, this gets a bit messy. I prefer a clear chronological narrative when I watch such documentaries. Here it becomes somewhat uncertain whether what we hear is Lena in private, or Lena as an actress. I am interested in film, but had only seen one film with Lena Nyman before I saw this; Autumn Sonata. The fact that I lost interest while watching this is perhaps due to the fact that I did not have such a close relationship with her as an artist and actress beforehand? Maybe.This one is sure to hit the spot for her followers, and for an audience that is well acquainted with her long career in Sverge. And not so interesting for the rest of us.",False
2,9,Beautiful portrait of a wonderful woman,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLena Nyman is indeed one of the pioneers of Swedish cinema, and entertainment industry - and this film so beautifully chronicles her remarkable career in an utterly satisfying way, all put together by a stellar director.It is very expertly paced, conveying all sides of Lena Nyman's life and career in splendid fashion, and the cutting and editing is incredible - some that would make master directors such as Vilgot Sj√∂man proud to have his achievements reinvoked in yet another masterpiece.Overall, truly a joy for any fans of Lena Nyman, and an all around beautiful and incredibly well made film. Highly recommended!",True

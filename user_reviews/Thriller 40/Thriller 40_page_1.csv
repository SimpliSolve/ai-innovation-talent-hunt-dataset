1,8,A thrill to watch!,imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I expected a mediocre retelling of the success of ""Thriller"", a sort of a cash cow, but what I got to see was (pun intended) actually really thrilling. Goosebumps from start till finish.The good: this album still is such BLISS to listen to some 40 years later! What is especially great about this documentary is that we get to hear snippets of the demos of ""Thriller"", which sounded awesome already, with merely hearing Michael Jackson's voice solo. What power.Back in time. Back to the eighties. Back to one of the greatest classics. Back to music heaven!Recommended watch for any fans of the ""Thriller"" album!",False
2,7,"Still worth watching it, but it's not really good documentary",camiliafjihani,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not satisfied with this documentary, honestly. Actually, I was very passionate about hearing this documentary. Because I'm a huge fan of Michael. But, I'm sorry, I just gave 7 out of 10. It's a good documentary, but I think the estate can give more rare videos of BTS in this album. They just gave a little rare footage of Michael's interviews during Thriller era. I wanna hear his opinion and see his process for producing this album in recording studio cause it's not enough for me to see little spots for Michael on it. And as far as I remember, they didn't give and put the explanation for making ""The Lady in My Life"" on this documentary. Disappointing. I felt like this documentary would've given a lot of rare footage for his jobs. Maybe I put high expectations for this documentary. It will be great for the estate if they can produce documentary film for the other albums of Michael. Not only for ""Thriller"". Yeah, once again, it's not bad docu but not really good. It was a mid documentary movie. But, it's still worth watching it.",True
3,7,Dissecting the best-selling album of all time,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Thriller 40"" (2023 release; 88 min) opens, talking heads are gushing over the album, and we are reminded along that Thriller was, still is, and always will be the best selling album of all time. We then go back in time to the Jackson 5. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is directed by writer-musician-director Nelson George (who in fact played on the Thriller album). Here he celebrates one of the best and most iconic albums of all time, with Michael Jackson, then 24-25, at the peak of his creative forces. The talking heads include people like Usher, Mary J. Blige, Maxwell, etc. The documentary really pays off when we get to the actual dissecting of the album tracks and the videos. Watch how current acts like K-Pop's BTS liberally ""borrow"" many moves introduced by MJ. And last, but not certainly least, there is ""Thriller, the short film"". Bottom line: I rarely play ""thriller"" anymore (because all of it has been played to death), but watching this documentary gave me a new appreciation for this, one of the greatest achievements in the history of pop music, and frankly all music, period. Please note that of course ""Thriller"" the album was released in late 1982, but ""Thriller"" the short movie was released in late 2983.""Thriller 40"" was released in limited theaters as a one-off on December 2, 2023. It started streaming on Showtime (now part of Paramount+) in late December. I just caught up with it the other night. If you are a fan of Michael Jackson or, say, of the just released ""The Greatest Bight In Pop"" documentary, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,10,"Best MJ Documentary of all time, Hope to see more! :D",MW_,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the best MJ Documentaries of all time, gives us a taste of how Michael Jackson's mindset was set towards success even after several challenges, as he always will be considered the World's King of Pop for all time. I hope there is another part or documentary continuation as that would be great to see more rare archival footage of mastered qualities and people that have worked with Michael to explain how MJ was as a musician. I would love to see more old live performance footage, more rare Behind-the-scenes clips, actions, dancing and close-up conversations. Michael has recorded in more depth and length in future Michael Jackson Documentaries.",False
5,10,The rare footage is breathtaking,mijacfan,n/a,16/08/2025,Looove this documentary so much.. firstly the amazing and beautiful never before seen interviews and footage of Michael as he creates the biggest selling album of all time is worth watching this documentary...from stunning footage of the victory tour to Michael recording the girl is mine with Paul McCartney we final get a glimpsed into the making of the greatest selling album .. a must watch for everyone The only negative is they Should of just had more footage of Michael instead of people talking about him.. beautifully showed the magic of Michael and why he is so loved !!!.. We love u more Michael...,False
6,n/a,A celebration of Jackson's talent,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Always worth remembering that Jackson was acquitted in life from 14 charges in a gruesome trial where 'previous bad acts' where allowed and that the FBI never found anything incriminatory in an investigation that spanned 13 years and that included three thorough surprise raids of Neverland.These are facts and you can look them up.The documentary is a bit all over the place in terms of structure but is emotionally resonant.It takes us to a time when Jackson was transitioning from teen to man, or from Michael Jackson to MJ, as he put it down in paper.It excels at documenting this passage and at bringing us back when we watched in awe his inmense talent.It takes.",False
7,10,The documentary Thriller 40 is an incredible celebration of the legacy of Michael Jackson,danielramosdossantossilva-54968,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHis iconic album Thriller. Delving behind the scenes of his creation, we are taken on a fascinating journey into the genius of the King of Pop. The documentary's unique approach offers an in-depth look at the magic behind each track, revealing Michael's musical mastery. Thriller remains a timeless masterpiece that transcends generations, and this documentary is an immersive tribute to one of history's greatest artistsIn this fascinating behind-the-scenes dive, we are introduced not only to the magic of creating Thriller, but also to the personal moments and challenges that shaped Michael Jackson as an artist. The documentary highlights Jackson's revolutionary innovation, not just in music, but also in the way he approached visual art in music videos. Through exclusive interviews and rare footage, we witness Michael's emotional journey, revealing not just the musician, but the man behind the icon. Thriller 40 not only celebrates the past, but highlights Michael Jackson's influence on contemporary music and popular culture.",True
8,10,10 points to Michael Jackson!,mascardilake,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI gave this documentary 10 points because MJ deserves even more. The documentary itself has nothing new, I've seen all the stuff before separately or in the Making of Thriller vhs! There is no way to honour him because we've seen it all and what we need is not only Usher but al the millennial artist paying tribute to him, thanking him and asking him to forgive them. MJ was a genius, humble, extremely shy man that became fearless on stage. He gave us excellence and inspiration for centuries and just like Elvis, he is no longer here. MJ has to be released of the course of the allegations, Leaving Neverland tried to silent him and the same people that once pretended to love him, made a fortune with that thing which is not a documentary. If you watch leaving neverland in silence, with no sound, the body language of all the accusers does show anger, they look so cheerful and it makes you think that they are saying beautiful things. Michael Jackson gave the world a lot, the one documentary that will honour him is yet to be written and it will have to show the FBI investigation, Child Services, Whiteness, all the evidence in his favour and not one proof to condemn him. He was stigmatised in the 90s because of his androgynous look, today that would be considered discrimination with the ""inclusion movement"" .MJ was a sweet gifted soul, whose smile was outshined after the allegations. His luminous gaze and smile, turned to a man whose face said: I'm soul broken.So this documentary it's ok, nothing new but it doesn't make justice as he deserves. Love from Argentina!",True
9,10,Capturing the magic of that time,michelmaas09,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was 11 when I first got stepped into the magic world that was Michaelmania. It's hard to describe how that felt. Michael was all around and he was indisputably the pinnacle of pop around the globe. Like mentioned before by many, it was like or must have been like Sinatra, the Beatles and Elvis. This documentary did a very good job in getting very close to that energy and excitement, for people that were born after the album came out and are witnessing it today for the first time.The format is something we've seen before in official documentaries like 'the legend continuous' and many more, starting with the very beginning, seeing Michael as a kid being the lead singer of the J5 and the Jacksons. Instead of it being a showcase or marketing his back catalogue, it really built up to why and what he wanted to prove; making Thriller the best selling album of all time.Would've loved to see more of Quincy and his team behind the succes, since it was promoted as more about the art, than the artist, but to me it was more about the impact it had on a cultural level.A lot of never seen before footage, private audio fragments and a very good insight into his thinking, his strategy and his philosophy makes it a must see for everyone who wants to understand the creative, the business and the cultural impact it had and still has today on contemporary artists and even beyond.",False
10,8,overall very good!,gcuriazza,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed this documentary very much, but I do wish that they payed more of his demos and unreleased songs. I loved seeing the new footage and HD Victory Tour footage. I wish they talked less and just showed him more. It was very good though, and I feel like it was just as good as Spike Lee's: Michael Jackson's Journey From Motown to Off The Wall.I also wish that they discussed PYT and Lady In My Life. I also want to point out that I didn't learn anything new from this documentary, but it was still nice to see the footage of him talking. At least the MJ estate put some effort in! Solid documentary and I enjoyed it!!",True
11,5,Mostly Disappointing,gmmmuscles,n/a,16/08/2025,I have been looking forward to this for years after the excellent Bad 25.Unfortunately it didn't deliver.Way too much focus on the opinions of newer folks who weren't there. Instead of Misty Copeland why not interview Jeffrey Daniel or the NY Undercover guy who was in Beat It? First hand opinions by people who were there.No historical interview footage of Rod Temperton or Bruce Swedien yet tons of Usher and Will I Am giving the exact same interviews they have all over youtube a thousand times. These parts pull down the good elements of this film as they look and feel like filler material. Yes these are great artists who were influenced by Thriller but not directly relevant to the subject at hand as they were probably children back then so all they can contribute are opinions.I was really hoping for the definitive story of this incredible album by the people who created it but it feels like an homage created for YouTube.Bad25 in contrast did a fantastic job of keeping the story very focused on the actual creation of the record by the people who were there.Good to see Greg Phillinganes and a few others but this feels very incomplete with some glaring omissions. Yes some of the main players are sadly deceased but there is a ton of historical interview footage by people who were there that could have made a much more cohesive and definitive telling of the story.Unfortunately I felt like this didn't really tell the full story which an album as genre defining as this still deserves.,False
12,9,Fantastic Documentary,fisayofalusi,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very good documentary that I wished was even longer. Michael Jackson was a genius and still this day, the Thriller album still remains the greatest and most iconic album ever.One of the things I loved about the documentary were the rare clips that included the making of the videos and the ones from the Victory Tour in great quality. I hope his estate releases them for Michael Jackson fans and the rest of the public to see in general.The current generation of artists and fans also need to watch this documentary to see how iconic the Thriller era was and how legendary Michael Jackson was and is still is as an artist. It was well done.",False
13,10,Documentary Worth Watching,mandelaalum,n/a,16/08/2025,"The album Thriller has a special place in my heart and this has probably to do with the fact that like everyone who happened to live in the last few decades of the 20th century, the album would hold a deeper meaning. For those that grew and lived during this time period, little did we anticipate that this album would continue to remain popular well into 21st century and we would still be enjoying this album as we become older and greyer. What's more interesting is that the current generation are enjoying this masterpiece and this will hopefully be the trend in the decades to follow. Big up to the mastermind.",False
14,10,Exciting!,ashleigh-88,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally something positive and focusing on the man he really was. Very honoured to watch this even more so with no hating false media narratives. Thank you !!!Focusing on his raw talent and the mind behind the man is incredible. I know there's so much more footage that hasnt been given to us.. i hope it does come out in my lifetime (I'm 35).One thing negative I will say is, There should have been more promotion for this, I was only aware of it because I follow Michael Jacksons Instagram page.. Netflix should show this for a start. Followed by airing it on normal TV with adverts promoting it.What an incredible man and artist.. thank you again.",False
15,9,It's a good documentary with some new footage,mitchmenghi,n/a,16/08/2025,It is a good documentary with some footage I have never seen taken from the archives which was nice especially some thriller footage. I also enjoyed John Landis giving deeper insight into the making of thriller which I loved.There was some reused footage and also some of the same celebrities giving their interviews I have seen before eg usher.I think the documentary was lacking a little bit in regards of showing some candid video footage of Michael Jackson himself. I would of loved to see some unreleased footage of himself maybe giving deeper insight into the music but it was pretty top level info we have all seen before.Overall I did enjoy it as any Michael fan will. But in terms of directing of this documentary it could of been better I have watched other recent music documentaries that are far better than this as an example the story telling of Mili Vanilli documentary was fantastic.,False
16,10,Michael is the King of Pop,gbinet,n/a,16/08/2025,"What I love most about this documentary is seeing all of the unreleased footage and interviews of how the greatest selling album of all time was created. Thriller 40 is a reminder of how Michael Jackson paved the way for future artists and how this is considered the blueprint of pop culture success. Thriller has sold more than 100 million copies worldwide and is continuing to break records even after his passing. Not to mention the groundbreaking Motown, 25th Anniversary TV special where he performed Billie Jean live for the first time and wowed audiences when he moonwalked on the stage. There are two things in the music industry, before thriller and after thriller.",False
17,10,Loved it!!,jelandracorcor,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved it, it gave a us a tiny insight as to how Michael made his music. He put so much in to it.. The estate said he can sometimes have up to 100 songs for 1 album. He was a true perfectionist! I especially love what he said about music videos, sorry, Short films. He changed the way we see them. The ones before beat it and thriller were terrible! Thank you Michael for giving us wonderful music and melodies and for being the soundtrack of our lives. This just proves that no one can come near his megastardom, the way he puts 10000% in everything he did. HE IS THE ONE AND ONLY KING OF POP!",False
18,10,"Thriller 40, What A Thriller!",dntlew,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great documentary especially for those of us who wasn't alive to witness the earth shattering album ""Thriller"". Awesome breakdown of the songs on the album, the ""short films"", and going into the genius musical mind of Michael Jackson. He had a vision and was unrelenting in making sure the world heard and saw his vision. His affirmation was on 1000 during this time in his life. He was determined to breakdown all the walls within the music industry. Not only did he do it, he did it PLUS more. Never give up on your aspirations and dreams because if you believe it, you certainly can achieve it! A must watch documentary!",False
19,10,Amazing!,Niv-1,n/a,16/08/2025,If you are a Michael Jackson fan lots of this stuff will be familiar but there are certain things in here that are described in such depth as to be revelatory!!One of these things is the description of how the music to Thriller was developed which is absolutely eye opening. As described by Anthony Marinelli it's really educational and a just a fascinating glimpse into how the sound was developed. This just might be the one of the most exciting sequences ever in a music documentary! I got chills at the end!! I can't stress enough much this is worth seeing!Also great was Steven Ivory describing Michael Jackson's performance then Motown show which of course contains the iconic debut of the Moonwalk. His insights are always welcome and so well described!I also really enjoyed the comments of Mark Ronson and wish there was more.A truly great trip into the creation of music.,False
20,9,even though...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIm a grumpy old man, i cant stop that urging feeling, from blustering out of my limbs and and my joints,hitting my predemented frontal cortex, everytime i hear the classic 1980-albums that michael jackson did, i just beat it , and stomp the ground like a hunchback on steroids, so if you want to delw back to the decade when disco-pop where at its hottest, have a view at this documentary.Its a hailarious showout on all of that artists qualities, a pure insane checklist of ''what i wanna do'' when riding the surf of success, interviews, mediaclips, also a great way to honour all the crews of people who helped mr bad to reach his goalsthank god this music wont die , nor even with me. Have a good tine.",True
21,10,I Give It A 10 Because It's MJ's Thriller 40 Documentary,smithdean-22092,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being the documentary is so so late to the Michael Jackson Documentary Game.Fortunately Spike Lee did 1979's ""OFF THE WALL"" Documentary & 1987's ""BAD"" Documentary. They both were released either with the CD or separately on MJ's website.Anyway, I constantly wonder what goes through MJ's Estate Minds at times?I am upset to see that Spike Lee didn't direct this ""THRILLER 40"" documentary?!?! He did such an incredible and amazing job with the others. Spike seemed to get better celebrities for interviews and way more behind the scenes footage.Don't get me wrong, there is some high quality rare footage in this new documentary but not as much as I was expecting.This Thriller Documentary went by way too fast and glossed over pivotal moments in my opinion.Michael Jackson's Thriller is the best selling album of all time, I felt it deserved a more grandiose film with way more footage and coverage of the controversial 1984 Jackson's Tour and MJ's true final feeling about the album himself.Also, none of his brothers appeared in the documentary! It was very odd.But as a MJ FAN... I truly loved and appreciated it.",False
22,10,"Cute, so sweet, beautiful, talented , perfection, Billie Jean, Liberian Girl, Human Nature,Pure Genius is Michael Jackson.",Lexi9518,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great job, Michael. You died too young at Middle age went to RIP in heaven, however, left us such great vids, songs, til we all 1 day leave earth. Michael Jackson is a legend. Literally and figuratively
& I'm Thriller 49 again , never sick of it."" Chills everytime
I watch it on mi cable tv SHOWTIME.""GENIUS. I am in awe (still) of his sleek moves #mesmerizing . Michael's cute, good looking, sexy beautiful man he was, his nice sounding voice, the way he can just stand there or break out a move had me hooked everytime. His laugh, smile, to dancing wit'his bros., to wit' Janèt, everything about #MichaelJackson is still as beautiful to remember, as no artist today, while we are alive shall EVER compare, NOBODY. Truly 1 of a kind."" Adiòs!""",False

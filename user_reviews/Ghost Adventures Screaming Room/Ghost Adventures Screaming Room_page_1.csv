1,1,Don't cancel Destination Fear,mollybsurrett,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ghost Adventures is the same show every week, Zak gets possessed and then treats all the guys like crap. He's really scared to do any real investigation thats why he always makes Aaron or Billy do the scary stuff. He's really a big chicken. But for some reason Travel channel keeps this show on and cancels the good ones. Like Destination Fear which is the best show on TV. Canceled Ghost Brothers, Holzer files and other good ones. I simply don't understand why they cancel good shows and keep the repeat GA's. So maybe travel channel will really take a look at their line up and reconsider their line up and stop canceling their good shows. GA's is not near as good as they used to be years ago. I used to like this show but stopped watching it when Zak started getting possessed every week.",False
2,10,Good Show,xbarracx,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can tell the people giving this show a bad rating for ""not liking Zak Bagans"", never even watched the show. Do I sense some jealousy maybe haha? I admit there are some paranormal shows like Destination Fear which are as fake as they come, but Ghost Adventures actually shows you what they find. They don't have crew members hiding around corners making noise like Destination Fear does haha. If someone gives Ghost Adventures a bad review it's from someone who hasn't watched the show and is jealous of what they have accomplished.",False
3,3,Zak Bagans,gabushby,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show is great with one exception.Zak Bagans narcissistic behavior is super annoying. You can't help but notice that during the entire taping of the ""Screaming Room"" he is extremely unpleasant towards Billy. His constant remarks towards him are ""Please, don't say that again"", ""Why did you say that?"", ""Don't do it again!"", etc. He seems to be breathing down his neck time and again for unknown reasons. Billy is a great investigator and doesn't have ego issues like Zak. He gets along with everyone and is very likeable. I feel sorry for him and he is just too nice to tell Bagans to take a hike.It's worth noting that even though Mr. Bagans seems to run the show, he is the last one to muster enough courage to be involved in the most scary scenes.He is weak inside and in love with himself only. I get the shivers when I watch him.",False
4,10,The Woman's Name - 7th episode Enchanted Forest,gabbymarquez-28850,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo to me it sounded like she said ""Mercedes"" in a spanish accent not ""come tell me secrets"". Again not trying to step on any toes just giving another option or possibility.AARON, I LOVE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR!!!",True

1,8,F@ck This Job / F@ck Putin / F@ck This War,unpaid_movie_critic,n/a,17/08/2025,"Dear Natalya Sindeyeva, Hope you are doing well.First of all, thank you very much for creating such a unique and great channel of independent news. Never thought that TV Rain (Dozhd) was such an enthusiastic idea that eventually led to an independent source of real news. Real news about everything that is happening in Russia or related to Russia. You and your team have been doing a fantastic, tremendous, and extremely valuable job. Hopefully, you will come back and your announcement on March 3, 2022 means that you are just taking a small break in broadcasting.TV Rain (Dozhd) has a whole story of ups and downs, and a story of very controversial situations as well. However, the last three - four years were very good quality of broadcasting. Primarily, once you opened up your channel for mass on YouTube. It was the point when you started sharing valuable news no matter of subscription status and posting short videos as valuable data summary. Even though some of the broadcasts were mundane and boring, they are valuable and essential like freedom of speech because they cover what other channels (government and propaganda one) never do.""F@ck This Job"" is surprisingly well made, interesting, and such a sentimental documentary about TV Rain (Dozhd). It is a depiction of your life and life of the channel. It is a depiction of something that has to come back once Russia becomes free from the corrupted government and system that Vladimir Putin established. Hopefully, this day will come soon and people in Russia will open their eyes.Thank you very much for the truth, integrity, and independence.Best Wishes and See You Soon.",False
2,10,Suprisingly Amazing,ArisSil,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary was in the International Documentary Festival of Thessaloniki. Initially I found it interesting, so I added on my list to watch it. I had a huge fear that it will be western propaganda and especially with the current situation. Everybody understand that when there is war or conflicts all sides try to make propaganda where sometimes there are so many lies and is hard to find the root of the problem. So, I guess my fears were legit.However, I gave it a try and I did not expect to watch something so good! The documentary is moving around the life of Natalya Sindeyeva and her dream to make an independent media channel that will support shows for everyone. Something, that is missing generally from the majority of countries these days. It actually presents the challenges, the up and downs and the threats that the employees and Natalya came to face.I don't want to say more! I think this is a must watch for everyone. There are people fighting for a better world giving everything in their life and this is a story about such people!",False
3,10,Raining on Putin's gerontocratic pity party.,squelcho,n/a,17/08/2025,"Who'd imagine that in the 21st century, a desperate old man with a narcissistic personality disorder could find himself in charge of a vast nation state, it's military apparatus, all of its communications and media channels, and a nuclear arsenal to boot.It almost happened with his useful idiot, Trump, but even he couldn't destroy the free press in the US , despite his best efforts. Putin, and his cronies, tolerate no dissent, or even a hint of freedom of expression, even from minor media players who wish to report anything but the party line.More fool the true believers in the cult of Putin, because they've been drinking the Cool Aid for twenty years.Just follow the money, if you want to find the Black Sea palaces and their actual beneficial owners.",False

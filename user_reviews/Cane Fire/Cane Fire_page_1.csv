1,8,Required viewing prior to travel to Hawaii,gbill-74877,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a review of film history related to the treatment of native Hawaiians this documentary is a bit lacking, though the clip from Big Jim McLain(1952) with John Wayne and its description of all plantation union organizers as communists was incredibly damning. Seriously, f* that guy. And, as a review of the overall history of Kauai, from colonial times to modern-day tourism and wealthy people snapping up real estate to the detriment of the locals, this is a solid, very good film. The interviews with past union leaders, young and old workers, and activists are fantastic. The bits of footage across news feeds, interviews, and Hollywood productions may seem slightly scattered, but they effectively paint an uncomfortable portrait of a historical wrong, one that continues to perpetuate. Most importantly, the perspective is shifted to that of native Hawaiians, past and present. It's depressing to think about how 50% of real-estate on Kauai is owned by non-residents (as vacation homes), or how the ultra-wealthy descendants of the ""big 5"" corporations in the 19th century and people like Mark Zuckerberg own so much of it now. Anyway, it should be required viewing prior to vacationing in Hawaii, not to shame or discourage, but to help understand the sensitivity.",False

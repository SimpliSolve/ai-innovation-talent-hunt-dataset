1,4,Considering the wealth of info re this case....,jethro-17881,n/a,16/08/2025,"...this documentary seems very thin. Interesting but no where near the depth that the case and victims deserve.The horrors of this well documented and well recorded series of crimes by this couple deserves better than a documentary that seems to be mostly interviews with experts, still shots of the family and victims and a bit of footage of Police press briefings and news footage.My main criticism has to be related to its length; being so short it has little depth or insight, nothing that a reasonably active reader or studeious true crime consumer could figure out for themselves.For those interested the book 'Happy Like Murderers' is a far more thorough, insightful and dare i say graphic account of Fred and Rose West's life and crimes.",False

1,7,Should have been 30 minute episodes,smahmood-11755,n/a,17/08/2025,"Way too many unnecessary cut scenes and aerial shots to make these episodes longer. I'm guessing they spent most of their budget filming that trying to fit it all in rather than just give us the information. Interesting cases though so I watched all 5, just could have done without the over production.",False
2,7,Not equal but some very good episodes,steveoneil-58383,n/a,17/08/2025,"The serie is not about the most « notorious » criminals but the most wanted and this is the good point of the documentary. Not all episodes are equal (Number 1- Ismael Zambada- is not the more interesting and Number 4- Semion Mogilevich- look like a never-ending coarse trailer), but all of them use a lot of great (and bloody) archival shots and documents how these criminals managed to escape the authorities.
The last episode- Matteo Messina Denaro- takes place in the same location (Sicily) all 45 minutes long but keep you on the edge of your seat.",False
3,7,Good show,Calicodreamin,n/a,17/08/2025,"An interesting look into some of the worlds most wanted criminals. The interviews were relevant, the timelines well established, and good use of archival footage.",False
4,7,Not among Netflix's best but still great.,matrixdukenukem,n/a,17/08/2025,"Netflix has raised the bar for its docuseries so high, that other decent releases go under the radar. Fortunately for me, I saw the trailer and had immediately saved it in my list because I had seen Don't F*ck with Cats and likes it. It's the same team.So this isn't as crisp as other series' and I think this is one of those documentary that could've used a little recreation for dramatic effects because the characters they chose to interview .. some of them are little dramatic. Another thing they could've done better is to show us more about the criminal's past life because they choose to pursue all these most wanteds after their hieneous crimes. We are taken through the journey of what they did,how they fled and little bit of how the authorities have been chasing them. This isn't a deep dive into the criminal's mind that we have have a perversion of.My favourite episode was the last one. You watch it and immediately want to re-watch The Godfather. Unfortunately even that episode was not as fleshed out as it could've been.These are the complains but for what they've shown and researched it's still a good quarantine watch.A solid 7.5 out of 10",False
5,7,That's why i like Netflix!,said_kurollo,n/a,17/08/2025,I always ask my self who are the world's most wanted criminals. And here is Netflix answering my childhood question!Very interesting show and well directed episodes.,False
6,7,Interesting.,Lukasmj,n/a,17/08/2025,"Netflix's true crime documentary series World's Most Wanted follows the world's five most wanted criminals who have so far eluded the arm of the law despite hefty rewards and international manhunts.""The World's Most Wanted Criminals"" makes the best of himself.The fact that some episodes are a bit boring is probably more the reality that there are not many interesting criminals who are still on the run (which is of course a good thing :D)
I think the documentary series has presented the stories in the individual episodes quite well.In any case, you can take a look, if you seek a thrilling documentary.",False
7,8,An informative docu-series of the World's most sought after criminals,gaurishkohli,n/a,17/08/2025,"A binge worthy series which you can finish in one go, although it uses the same techniques of storytelling which a crime documentary would use. But it still makes it interesting to watch when you consider the scope of the crimes they have committed.",False
8,6,It was overall good,buttabiscuit,n/a,17/08/2025,"A better version of this documentary would provide details of how the government is actually assisting these criminals from being captured, That is more than likely the key factor of how they're able to remain at large for decades.",False
9,10,Another Netflix Crime Winner!,cicerolounge,n/a,17/08/2025,"Netflix have provided another winning crime documentary by Novo Productions. All the most wanted people have their crime biographies on show here. It's a rogues gallery of the drug cartels chiefs; money launderers, terrorists, arms dealers and mafia on show.",False
10,n/a,Mehh,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,It's alright. Funny how American agents confess to torture and they don't even realize it because it seems so normal to them.,False
11,7,Pretty Good,g_alex-87691,n/a,17/08/2025,Pretty good. Whoever likes documentaries will dig this. We want more!,False
12,8,Why to close the show with the best ?,synoxbeverly,n/a,17/08/2025,"Fortunately I watched all the episodes, but the order of their broadcast is curious.
If I were Netflix, I would have begin with the Sicicilan godfather (the most exciting and tense) and close with the Rwanda genocide (good episode with happy denouement).
Other episodes are OK but could be broadcast in any order.
My order of preference :
5,2,3,1,4",False
13,5,Average at best,Xavier_Stone,n/a,17/08/2025,"A few key interviews but most of the series is all stock video, internet drone shots and suppositions all without any real evidence to support the headlines.",False
14,8,A Super True Crime Docu-Series.,IdiotBox_Recommendations,n/a,17/08/2025,"World's Most Wanted is a mini docuseries exploring five of the most wanted criminals in the world- a terrorist, a mafia godfather, a cartel boss to name a few. These are the most dangerous people, coming from different countries and are known to have committed the most horrendous, inconceivable crimes at international levels.
They are responsible for thousands of murders and even lakhs in one instance! Highest levels of corruptions, conspiracies, moles being planted in law enforcement agencies, killings of informants- everything appears to have landed straight from a Martin Scorsese movie, albeit this being a reality.
Real life pictures and footages of violence and death are shocking, absolutely blood curdling.
The FBI, Interpol and many such international law enforcement agencies are after these criminals since decades. What is most disgusting is that aside from Felicien Kabuga- the criminal responsible for Rwandan genocide, all the others are roaming free and we can only hope that justice will be provided to the innocent victims one day.",False
15,8,Death and justice(!),REXNE,n/a,17/08/2025,People as bad as states are no different on either side. There is no brutality they will not do for money and power. A quality and instructive documentary.,False
16,4,Boring,postvoorgianni,n/a,17/08/2025,The stories could have been told in15 minutes. It just drags on and they repeat every single bit of info they have. Which is little.,False
17,2,Childish cuts,abarfacebook,n/a,17/08/2025,Horrible editing job. Whole thing feels like a trailer. 50% of the time you'll see stock footage. 90% of the time you'll hear over the top background music. I've seen YouTube videos that were better cut! Annoying as heck.,False
18,2,Just not a good and accurate,omandreassen,n/a,17/08/2025,"They focus on heroine and cartels on the first episode, not mentioning that all those addicts that They show in their worst shape Come from american pharma companies that fueld the oxy and fentanyl eruptions and none of those big bosses are being jailed...
Netflix has become way to ""voke""",False
19,3,Badly Directed,mozzmanau,n/a,17/08/2025,"This show is all over the place, no clear direction. Needs to be structured a lot better. Very hard to watch.",False
20,5,"Starts well, then fades away",gamerz-18042,n/a,17/08/2025,The first few episodes are insightful and well told. The Rwanda genocide is something rarely mentioned and interesting to learn about.The characters in the latter episodes are less captivating.,False

1,4,The Making of a Missed Opportunity for Meaningful Insight,lonelyowl,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary seems to have prioritized style over substance, failing to deliver the thoughtful, insightful storytelling the subject demands.From the tiresome editing choices to the build-up that leads nowhere, the film struggles to engage its audience meaningfully. The use of bleak music during inappropriate moments felt jarring, undermining the gravity of the issues being discussed. Instead of shedding light on Sean Combs' actions with clarity and respect for the victims, the documentary veers into unnecessary sensationalism and dramatization.While it was compelling to hear directly from some of the victims, their voices were often overshadowed by the production's flashy attempts to stylize rather than humanize. This could have been an opportunity to provide a dignified platform for those impacted and focus on presenting facts and evidence that could contribute to justice. Instead, it felt like the filmmakers were more interested in amplifying shock value.A more restrained and authentic approach, with longer, uninterrupted focus on the victims' stories, would have lent the documentary the gravity and impact it sorely lacks. This could have been an important piece of work-unfortunately, it missed the mark entirely.",False
2,4,Missed opportunity,davidwalshldn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately this documentary seems to have fallen down a sensationalist hole. There is a fair amount of what appears to be damning testimony and interesting context to Diddy, his background, rise and fall, but it's seemingly constantly embellished by hot takes about childhood trauma, conspiracy theories and at times some of the personalities don't exactly come across as genuine or authentic. The result is a tabloid-like doc that doesn't feel serious.Hopefully things will be clearer when Diddy has his day in court. It's clear that he has done some extremely awful things (the assault of Cassie is both undeniable and inexcusable), but the documentary doesn't really do much to truly help us understand the extent of his deeds one way or the other.",False
3,6,Truths ?,jeffhale-89133,n/a,16/08/2025,"If 1/2 of this is true, give him day in court. Release ALL tapes, videos etc and taking him to the gallows
Either way he is a P. O. S. The way the rappers, gangsta's, hip hoppers and all the other so called ""music"" has created a culture that has not been beneficial to this or any society.As far as this documentary goes, it seemed that a few of the interviewed appeared to be embellishing a little. What is true? Who knows, but we never did find any truths with Epstein.... Will we with Diddy Dipspit ? Doubt it.Either way, there is the video outside the hotel room that shows the true color of this thug. ANY man that lays hands on a woman, let alone kicks her, should be beat themselves.",False
4,3,A polished promotional piece setting the stage to gaslight survivors but excusing predators deviancy.,lepadinis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just listen to some of the interviews of some of these people (dont even have to mention names, you'll recognise them by their own thought processes in their own words) setting the outdated mindset that predators are ""Victims"" of their environments.Untold numbers of people, from all walks of life have gone through much worse adversity growing up, the difference is how the person is wired, people who are not predatory in their character become hyper-vigilant towards others safety-especially reflecting on how they felt/would feel in similar circumstances, if you're a deviant mindset with lack of empathy you'll become a predator yourself.",False
5,7,I was at City College,royaltypub,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked this documentary. I liked Tim because he confirmed for me exactly what I thought was the beginning of Puffs crazy world- His mother Janice Combs along with those in the industry who may have made Puff do things for that power.Me , my sister and a few friends was at City College that night. We were stuck in the crowd. It was so crowded on that staircase that my feet wasn't touching the stairs anymore. I got into the gym. My friend April was one of the last people I saw get through the doors before I saw dead bodies being pulled into the gym. I did a show about this on my YouTube page years ago ""Straight Talk With Ms. Tee.Also my uncle is one of the guys who got Puff's father into the Nicky Barnes crew. Please know it's only alleged that Melvin snitched. IT'S NOT A FACT.",False
6,4,Bombastic to say the least,johansk8god,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting for me here in Sweden. I follow the downfall of Diddy from a distance.It starts all right with a look into his childhood and some good scenes with a guy called Tim Patterson. He tells about how Puff was raised and I as a viewer I get some valuable insights.But then, it gets pretty unfocused. There are a lot of accusations - rape, drugging, violence, all you can think of. The score is like a mix of something from a horror movie and a block buster trailer. A lot of slams, eerie sounds and bombastic stuff.Far from a minimal approach. I think it gets kind of shallow. It's more like a Wikipedia of accusations than a real movie with a solid storytelling.",False
7,1,Typical,PopcornPlease,n/a,16/08/2025,"What kind of people actually care about anything pertaining to this no-talented ""alleged"" serial rapist and sleazy lowlife? (And anyone who is a fan of such a person is no better than they are.) But of course there will be those who make Combs sound like a victim and loudly claim he's being targeted because of his color, the same people who cheered when double murderer O. J. Simpson was found not guilty during his criminal trial. (He was found guilty in his civil trial.) There's a big difference between being a ""bad boy"" and a serial criminal. Combs is just another one who thought his undeserved celebrity status put him above the law and would shield him from the consequences of his crimes. If there's any justice, he'll spend the rest of his life behind bars. Too bad Bill Cosby can't join him.",False
8,1,This is just bad on so many levels,rasmus_juel,n/a,16/08/2025,"The actual story of Diddy's life and allegations is intriguing and interesting - but this documentary only tells a a disjointed superficial tale with no depth, tabloid-like conspiracy theories and the very few actual facts and witnesses do not come across as believable or authentic. It seems the focus is on trying to create dramatic moments with audio/visual effects - but with a total lack of focus on substance.To make matters worse - it is clearly cut for US television with constant ""dramatic"" cliff hangers to be placed just before commercials, followed by repetitive content to follow after the commercial break. I could live with it if the substance was there and the cliff hangers were actually exciting - but they are not. They just thought ""let's put a commercial break here - and whatever we talk about just before, let's invent something dramatic"". Yuk!You also has to endure a constant dramatic soundtrack. At no time is there no dramatic music in the background.There is so much subject matter in this case to make a good documentary - so how they have managed to screw this up so badly is quite a mystery.",False
9,1,BOOOOOO!!,japierce3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Diddy may be guilty but this documentary ain't nothing but here say. And quite frankly, he could sue the documentarians and everyone in this doc for slander, libel and defamation of character because there is no proof that he did anything wrong. A lot of speculation, hearsay and gossip. Again, I'm not saying he's innocent but this documentary does nothing to prove his guilt. For the future documentarians, they're not reading this but if they are, LAWYER up and/or make sure that you have proof of your statements. Even if you cloud your voice like the ""former bad boy employees"", you can be SUED!",False
10,5,Meh,Bmore-Hero,n/a,16/08/2025,"Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy sets out to explore the rise of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, one of hip-hop's most influential figures. The documentary covers his early struggles, business savvy, and rise to fame, offering some behind-the-scenes glimpses into his career and the music industry.While the film does a good job of celebrating Diddy's achievements, it feels more like a polished promotional piece than an in-depth documentary. It highlights his successes but avoids diving too deep into the controversies, setbacks, or complexities of his career. For fans who already admire him, the documentary provides an entertaining, if surface-level, look at his journey. However, for those hoping for a more balanced or revealing exploration of his impact, it may feel too safe and controlled.Visually, the film is well-produced, with sleek editing and nostalgic footage that longtime hip-hop fans will appreciate. But the storytelling lacks depth, often glossing over key moments that could have made the documentary more compelling.Overall, Diddy: The Making of a Bad Boy is an average watch. It's engaging enough for casual viewers but ultimately feels more like an extended PR reel than a truly insightful documentary. 5/10.",False
11,4,The band wagon or truth reveal?,kiowhatta,n/a,16/08/2025,"As anyone with an IQ over 50 will realise, we live in an era of trial by mediia.Add to that the socio-cultural misandrist agenda the media perpetuates, plenty of 'he said, she said' and you have a viable product in itself.My main problem with this whole phenomenon is the man has not been found guilty of anything in court.In this 'documentary' there are plenty of relative nobodies claiming to have knowledge of all manner of behaviour, which is damning in and of itself.However I draw the line when: I don't have all the facts; it's Hollywood so whose agenda is on display here? And furthermore, until he is charged, I have no respect for this low quality type of 'investigative journalism'.Whatever happened to ethics in the media?Why do we allow one of the most powerful institutions on this planet to serve up sensationalist rumour and here-say?A low, low point in the history of the media again.I'm disgusted by not only the level of this, but the eagerness of the public to consume it and believe it.'By giving us the opinions of the uneducated journalism keeps us in constant contact with the community.' Oscar Wilde.",False

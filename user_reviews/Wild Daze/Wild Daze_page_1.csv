3,10,Urgency Attention Call,crimeagainstcreation,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wild Daze is not just a documentary about African wildlife and nature, or poaching, trophy hunting and wildlife trafficking - it is about what the most evil and insensitive of humans do due to ignorance and greed. But most of all it's about humanity's lack of care and understanding of what is happening not only in Africa, but to our Planet as a whole, and how it will affect us all if the heartless, greedy and corrupt crooks win, that we're on our way into utter darkness if we lose the nature that we all come from and depend on. Wild Daze is an Urgency Attention Call, and it should be mandatory in all common eductaion.",False

1,1,Important but it should be more subjective,sean-70162,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe movie was shocking when it first started. We can see the video of the crime scene (regardless of whether the video has legal problems or not). But in the middle part, it started to leave the case itself and discuss the difficulties faced by the entire immigrant worker group in Taiwan. I think the whole film is a bit off topic. It's not that the content he discussed is unimportant, but that this film should be discussed separately from the opposite side of the case itself. Although the director can have his own position, he is very biased. He tried to have the position of wanting to put the police position in, but the length was very different. When I saw the discussion of other migrant worker cases in the middle, I thought the director would raise the whole film to a higher level, but I didn't expect the ending to return to the case itself, which makes people feel very disappointed.",True

1,8,On the Sand Tracks of Pier Paolo PASOLINI,ZeddaZogenau,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn 1959, Pier Paolo PASOLINI (1922-1975) undertook a very special journey through his native Italy. Driving from beach to beach, he completely circumnavigated the Italian boot. What he saw and heard he published in a series of journal articles that later appeared as a book (La lunga strada di sabbia / Die lange Stra√üe aus Sand).Italy was going through massive changes in those days. Economic growth, social upheaval and the emergence of mass tourism turned the country upside down. Incidentally, the Italian film industry (CINECITTA) also began to soar at that time, which was to last into the 1980s.Almost 60 years later (in 2018), the German ACADEMY AWARD winner Pepe DANQUART (he received the trophy in 1994 for his short film SCHWARZFAHRER (Black Rider)) has made this journey again. Italy has of course changed during this period, not always for the better. Beautiful pictures, enlightening insights and a critical look at a country that can represent the European continent! This wonderful documentary by Pepe DANQUART offers all of this.In the original German version, the actor Ulrich TUKUR speaks the narrator. The Italian actress Adriana ASTI, who filmed with Pier Paolo PASOLINI, is one of the interlocutors.A documentary film worth seeing, not only for Italy lovers!",True

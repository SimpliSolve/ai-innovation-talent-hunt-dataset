1,7,Very watchable but flawed.,megatoothster,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a great idea but the flawed practicalities of the execution soon become clear. Ant is hardly making any money at all on the cars, in some cases none at all. Yet the house project continues apace.Any reasonable person would therefore assume very quickly that this is purely for the entertainment value of blending house restoration with the same for cars, for TV.It's nice to see an old house being respectfully preserved and they do a great job on the cars too (even if labour is ""free""). But the premise of the funding of the house hinging on the cars making profit is ludicrous and it therefore becomes clear that the house is being paid for either by Ant or the production company. So the repeated ""I need to make some money on this car.... Whoops it just sold without reserve for the same amount we spent on it"" soon becomes a bit irritating and fatuous.Nice idea, poor logic and connectivity between the activities. But still watchable.",True
2,9,What about the auction fees,ray-kehoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off I liked the show.It was entertaining and worth watching.The one thing that stood out about his profits and/or losses was that when he made a small profit he didn't mention the fees that the auction houses charge for a sale.His profits were small and some of his losses were large, and the auction fees would have had a bigger impact than he mentioned.I think he also understated the amount of money that he spent on restoring the house.There is no doubting his mechanical knowledge and ability and in general he is very gifted.I didn't particularly like the paint finish on the Land Rover in the last episode.",False
3,8,Enjoyable but with a strange twist,ianbrooker-87709,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoy watch Ant Anstead and I think this programme hits the right level between entertainment and being technically interesting.The premise is that Ant will restore a series of cars to fund restoration of a home for his parents. However, as far as I can see he loses money on most of the restorations. This build up of losses isn't mentioned during the programmes, so it's pretty obvious that the auctions were held after filming most of the series! This isn't surprising as it's never going to be an easy ask to make money on a quick restoration, and Ant is too easily tempted to lavish money to do a good job!Having said that it's a nice watch and good to meet some of Ant's family and friends.",True
4,6,Just about watchable,chrischapman-47545,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I have respect for Ant as an engineer, and author/writer, this series almost falls into the same traps as many motoring programmes. Obviously staged in parts, it can be simplistic in that only certain car faults are shown and a lot of refurbishment work simply isn't shown. Then vehicles are sold at an upmarket auction which may not always be the best solution. The link to renovating a house for his parents (not ideally suited for them given their age?) is novel but again it is simplified. Ant comes across as a bit of a drama queen and impulsive. At least he treats his audience with some respect in terms of their assumed technical knowledge and doesn't constantly repeat the same issues. Nevertheless it could be significantly better, especially if they ditched the inevitable background music..",False
5,4,Remember Wheeler Dealers?,mike-499-205871,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere's a great line from Count Arthur Strong: Have you seen Wheeler Dealers? It's where they buy a car, do it up and sell it on for a slight loss.. Well here we go again. Ant buys various classic cars and semi restores them, with the idea being that the profit will pay for the renovations on a house he's purchased for his parents. Except the cars rarely make a profit. And given they are mostly sold at Classic Car Auctions, where there is £100 entry fee per car and 6% commission. So when the land rover supposedly made £2000 profit, that failed to take into account the £820 auction costs. The Thunderbird lost £1500, but that should be north of £2000 with costs. Most people watching this will be well aware that it's not free to sell at auction and treating viewers like idiots (although becoming common) isn't the way to go.",True

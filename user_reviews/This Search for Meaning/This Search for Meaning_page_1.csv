1,10,I LOVED it!,madorra27,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the opportunity to attend the premiere of this documentary in London. It was fabulous, far exceeding my expectations! It was not just because it was about Placebo (which is, obviously, one of my top favourite bands ever) but because everything else: the visuals, the songs choices, the sound, the interviews, the discussion topics, the raw, beautiful honesty and the powerful vulnerability. And because of this surprise: my favourite actor, Benedict Cumberbatch is a Placebo fan. How awesome is this?The documentary and the whole experience made me love Placebo even more, on a deeper level.Also, a big shout-out to Oscar Sansom - you rock!!!I would highly recommend this documentary to any Placebo fan, but given the themes it explores, I'd suggest it to anyone. It will make you reflect on some truly important matters.It was definitely worth coming from Bucharest for this event!",False
2,3,A Slap in the Face,chrisdec-137-32695,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSince a moment in the 90's, when I woke up at around midnight in a hotel room and 36 Degrees was playing on the TV, Placebo have been my favourite band. I was at a National Meeting of Youth Councils in somewhere like Scarborough or Skegness and all the other youth councillors were at the disco, but I'd ducked out early (of course). Brian Molko wouldn't be in the least bit interested in such an anecdote though because what this film amplifies for me is his complete disinterest in, or resentment towards, his fan base. That's one problem I have; the other is that they obviously didn't think just a biography would get greenlit, so had to call it ""This Search for Meaning"" and jarringly splice in relentless amounts of pseudo philosophy from Brian and someone called Joe Talbot, to the extent that one would want to get up and leave. A third but lesser concern is that the story of the band is completely airbrushed. The narration and commentary are provided by what remains of Placebo and a motley crew of celebrities (names provided on screen in case you didn't realise). Again, I assume the celebs were needed to get the film greenlit, and hopefully not because Brian is so shallow that he wants us to know that he's friends with Robbie Williams. The celebs are pretending to be talking on phones. Yet, whilst the video of them has a CCTV filter on it, the camera angles mean they can't be pretending that they are being recorded. Benedict Cumberbatch, probably aware of the stupidity of this direction, basically vlogs his contribution from the back of a taxi, but the director puts the CCTV filter over his phone video anyway. The thought of him weighing up what to do with Cumberbatch's perfunctory effort was one of the unintended highlights. The CCTV motif is there to remind us how outrageous it is that we have CCTV without consent, as per one of Brian's opening lines, but the theme is developed no further than that. I suspect Brian is actually trying to justify getting security to harass fans at gigs who are recording the show by feigning paranoia about cameras. I have no idea what point is being made by the dates on the CCTV filter being years wrong. Robbie Williams, who I would never have associated with Placebo, is sat there in his dressing gown, legs open, straining to remember his old claim about maybe being bicurious so as to fit in with the anti-cis heteronormative white man narrative predictably coming from the other celebrities. The irony there is that this was the only group in society that actually got mentioned in this film. I was sat there thinking that you have dragged me and the other three fans in the audience out on a Sunday afternoon and put this person of questionable songwriting integrity in front of us in place of something meaningfully including us like a modern act would have done. And so on to the airbrushing. Placebo have given many interviews over the years, and so if they want to exclude former members from contributing, controversies like with the Italian PM, etc. Then fine. However, the 10 minutes or so spent arguing that taking drugs is inevitable when you start doing arenas was plainly absurd when Taylor Swift and Coldplay manage to get by. Footage of Brian whilst high was interesting, but didn't show things out of control. I also would have liked to have seen an honest appraisal of the leg up he got in life. He's from a privileged background which would have given him the freedom to take risks, but the canon is always that he was alternative, and he had to struggle with meeting his parents' expectations. Getting that introduction to David Bowie before even releasing an album was quite something. At the start Brian tells us the same thing he always tells us: He's doing it all for himself. But really after being in the business for 30 years, if he has no curiosity about his fans, seeing them all as this irritating blob that he has to go and perform songs to, songs that he's grown out of, then I find that sad, and actually shallow when you consider that he knows that the lyrics appeal to people who aren't mainstream. The impression I get is that This Search for Meaning is his, and he's not looking to adoration from the fans. It's probably, as was the case with Elton John, recognition during his childhood for what he was then, for which the pursuit of success has ever since been the surrogate for. The session recordings in the film are good.",True
3,1,The miserable state of Placebo,MiguelA-209,n/a,16/08/2025,"Placebo grew from making music to whoever felt weird and without sense of belonging to a mainstream tedious blob that echoes what the industry demands.People are completely done with getting lessons from anyone with a mic.Placebo died years ago. Now they represent nothing.I'll keep the memories until battle for the sun, Loud Like Love still had a spark but from then on it's Taylor Swift sound and domesticated pet behaviour vomiting the polítics that is obliged so they can há é a plate of soup.A disgraceful final image of a band that once represented something.Now old, boring, safe for the fanily and really really with nothing to give.Respect your past and end the band.You are now what you loathed.",False

1,8,Trevor Noah doing what he does best!,putneychick,n/a,15/08/2025,"He is so good at doing accents, impersonation etc and the last joke was the best with a twist bringing the show to a fantastic closing. Always love seeing him laugh at his own jokes too by giving us the cheeky grin and purported innocence. Overall, I enjoyed his show cos he really made me laugh so much and did not realise his hour was up. It went so quickly. Good entertainment..Thank you Trevor Noah very much.Looking forward to seeing more of his stand-ups as he is such an intelligent comedian offering a unique perspective and always making sound reflections and sincere opinions through his brand of humour.",False
2,8,Truth hurts,estathena2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Trevor Noah returns and rocks Toronto with a much-needed dose of self-actualization and sardonic observation that stirs laughter as well as thought. Sharp and wicked smart is Noah's raportage on Covid events, politicians, & society's gullibility to Trumpian conspiracy nonsense.Noah's impressions are spot-on, hysterical, and hit home with a swift right hook: Trudeau's trip to India is priceless - and I should know because I'm Canadian.Trevor has blossomed into a fully self-aware individual, one who unafraid to turn that perceptive eye inward as well as out.This show displays growth and an intellectual maturity that George Carlin himself would give a tip-of-the-hat to.Truly enjoyable.",False
3,7,An underwhelming return,keemanxp,n/a,15/08/2025,"After a while not on stage, Trevor returns for his latest Netflix special, more like an inspirational speaker than a comedian. Despite some repetitive lines from his previous specials or even episodes of The Daily Show, Trevor couldn't really find ""fresh"" connections to all his jokes. It's not hard to detect some ""exhausted"" lines being recycled in this special. Even the audience's response wasn't that good. It's either we wished too hard, or we were putting a greater expectation after not seeing him on stage for 2 years.A good warm up for him I guess, but hoping to see better ones soon. Keep it up Trevor!",False
4,6,Trevor Noah is Bright and Funny,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"I tried watching The Daily Show after Jon Stewart left but I just no longer found it funny. I have nothing against Trevor Noah. I think he is very smart and knowledgeable and I agree with him on many, many issues. I just don't find him that funny. This special is no exception. He is bright and funny. He also is a great impressionist and his mastery of languages is very impressive. However, I think this is an average stand up special with some very funny moments. I understand he is leaving the long running news show to go back to full time stand up. I am not sure that is a great move if this is an example of his best material.",False
5,10,Intelligent and Global Perspective!,ashrinanand,n/a,15/08/2025,"Trevor continues to impress by just being himself - a smart, intelligent, perceptive, and thoughtful comedian and human being.He touches upon a broad range of topics, making light of his part-Swiss heritage, in his unique way and an audience with even a somewhat global perspective will appreciate his insights and jokes.Trevor leans heavily on experiences from his upbringing, diverse cultural connections, and being based in the States in recent years.Didn't realize where the hour went by and I was surprised when I saw the timeline toolbar and realized the show's almost over.His Indian bit was done very tastefully and I believe his audience from the subcontinent would enjoy how the scene and jokes were setup.",False
6,8,People are rating this low because of politics,patricksreviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you know and love Trevor Noah, this special is no exception. If you're an interesting (or interested) person that appreciates worldwide references and jokes, he once again will not let you down. If you're a right-wing conspiracy theorist that can't take a joke, you're going to tighten up your butthole and rate this one star.Comedy has never been about laughing 100% of the time. There has often been deeper themes between comedians and this special is another example of how you can reflect on humanity with humour.Saying ""he used to be funny"" is an easy way to say your political beliefs don't line up with his.",False
7,5,"Disappointing, I maybe chuckled 5-6 times.",Top_Dawg_Critic,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a fan of T N, this was a snoozefest and not even close to good as his previous worst stand-up. At best, this would've been an ok 15-20 min stand-up open-mic night gig. Him speaking German with barely any explanation to what was being said was boring. Then the rest of the fist half was just dragged out nonsense with zero laughs thus far. The last half was the only time I broke a few chuckles, and even those jokes dragged on endlessly. His monologue on The Daily Show is hilarious, so now it's clear the TDS writers come up with all the funny content. He needs to make sure they go with him if he still plans on doing stand-up as a career, because had I paid to see him live for that one hour, I would've walked out half way through and demanded a refund. It's a generous 5/10, only because I'm still a fan.",False
8,10,Funny funny man,kiran-97107,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not afraid to be who he is, and speaks his mind!Clever, funny, intelligent and brilliant man. Trevor at his best. Not afraid to be political and honest which was so refreshing!!Not for the close minded!!! Or for the supporters of you know who.Covered some great relevant topics that have impacted us in the last few years, which is no easy fate. This is part of what makes the show so great.Overall there was great flow to the show, seemed shameless and then it finished - we were all left wanting more; the best way to exit a show if you ask me.Lucky Canadians who got to watch the live show!",False
9,2,Boring and repetitive,dloaders,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIn the first 10 minutes or so you notice right away that he looks like he kinda does not want to be there making that show. I can't really explain it, but it seems there is no effort in making good jokes because he has nothing to prove. Right of the bat he recicles that black hitler joke, but with no funny twist or anything, basically just the same joke. I like the guy very much and his other shows are superb. I really liked his genuine way of telling us about his life, doing funny voices, and really having a great sense of humor. It seems he is too famous now to put in any real effort in entertaining.",True
10,10,Hilarious üòÇ,kasimahmed-49471,n/a,15/08/2025,Trevor is the best comedian for me today. I really enjoyed this special and was very eye opening for me to see how funny and hilarious trevor can be outside of his comfort zone üòÑ. His indian accent was fantastic and his German learning was also hilarious and his charisma on stage is just really powerful .he made the whole arena look like a theater. It was so refreshing to see that and if I may add trevor is genius just genius .u may not like his politics but u can't deny that he is hilarious üòÜ ü§£ dude and very knowledgeable comedian and very sincere with his comedy .I have enjoyed so much so I gave 10 out 10 ratings this special .love u..,False
11,10,Takes you on a Journey,literalreasoning,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of the best stand ups I've seen. Trevor takes you on a journey similar to how he did with the Daily show where he leaves the series at such a high that you are left wanting more. He starts it off with some jokes you've heard before if you've been watching the daily show and connects it all together with a BANG of an ending joke that connects it all together with original material and unexpected outcomes. If someone didn't like it, it's a lack of exposure to different cultures and a ethnocentric view that is well engrained in the receivers psyche. Felt like I got sucked in to the TV and was sitting in the live audience. One not to miss!",False
12,1,He used to be funny,dibo2deep,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had marked the show to be added to my Netflix list once it dropped because, as a fan of the daily show, I was excited to hear Trevor Noah's new material. I also enjoyed his book and previous comedy specials. To my disappointment, there isn't much new material in this special, mostly old jokes repackaged, and the few new bits aren't funny at all. You could feel the forced laughter from the audience. It almost seems that he just wanted to get something new out there regardless of quality. Compared to his older specials, this is garbage. Not even once did I laugh. I guess I can say it was disillusioning.",False
13,10,Trevor is incredible.,laerkekersten,n/a,15/08/2025,"Trevor is so intelligent, so compassionate and so so authentic. He has an incredible talent seeing and playing around with the different cultures and languages of the world, and he had me laughing and growing wiser throughout the entire show. This is amazing comedy as it is not entirely political but HUMAN and centers around his experience of being in the world, traveling, growing up in South Africa, and seeing the whole world with such a sharp eye and warm heart. He is optimistic and critical at the same time, which is amazing. He zooms in and out constantly, juggles micro and macro perspectives. His bit on the presidents of the US had me laughing so much. I really recommend you spend an evening with Trevor's observations üôèüèΩ",False
14,2,Fell asleep,dimitrij-l,n/a,15/08/2025,"Truly dissapointing performance. I actually fell asleep during what was supposed to be a comedy show?Maybe I misundstood something..He also seemed quite tense which was a bit of a surprise to me considering his TV experience.It also made me wonder whether his Daily Show was scripted that much? I mean this was a completely different Trevor Noa compared to his earlier stuff as well as the snappiness and character shown in Daily Show and his amazing performances before that.Sure, there were couple of good jokes in there but the rest of it was just unexciting, to put it mildly.I certainly hope to see more of Trevor, how he used to be.",False
15,10,Unfortunately it takes mature people to appreciate mature material,florianc-96974,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was excited to hear about a new special from Trevor. I haven't watched the Daily Show at all because politics don't interest me at all.I loved the show, I think he grew up magnificently and he shows it elegantly in his stage presence, self-deprecation and skill.There are now overarching arcs in the story of his stand-up. And seemingly unrelated stories have a common theme, namely schadenfreude. He has raised the bar of comedy very high and I'm enjoying the hell out of it. It is very difficult to deliver this kind of show and he does a great job.I saw some people say some jokes were rehashes, I haven't consumed enough of his content to see that but I understand that can feel a bit disappointing. However, for me, the pleasure isn't in the jokes, it's in how he plays and delivers them. The last part, especially, was extremely funny and tasteful, and it closes the arc of the whole show. Beautiful.Unfortunately, it's hard for many people who have strong political views, and don't agree with him, to put that aside and just enjoy a masterpiece in comedy and writing.",False
16,1,Just gives me a headache,Nomad007,n/a,15/08/2025,"He screams phrases over and over and over.These phrases are shouted out in a annoying weird squeaky voice.Or perhaps he's just speeding through a bit super fast just to get it out asap.Perhaps this is why his show is an hour instead of the more common 90 minutes.I've seen him with other specials and shows. This one just makes my headache in the worst way.I guess his show might be considered family friendly give the content; but then I don't think younger viewers would be interested even understand the content.All I can say is the show is just annoying. No laughs.Look elsewhere, please, I beg you.",False
17,3,"I Wish You Wouldn't, Trevor",forpeen,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's the 2020s. The foreign accent impressions is getting really tired by now. So are the ""west is trash and everything else are awesome"" jokes. I'm East Asian and am taking no offence, it's just no longer funny when it's recycled 10000 times.Then there are jokes based on alternative facts. His facts. Falsehoods like 'Africa handled Covid better than the West' (they didn't, cases and deaths are found to be highly underreported). It's as cringe-worthy as some right wing comedians basing their jokes on falsehoods and their redneck audiences cheering it.Even his Donald Trump and Boris Johnson jokes are funnier during the Daily Show episodes. Overall, this special felt preachy, old and tired. No where close to the better comedians of his generation like Mark Normand, Joe List and Sam Morrill.",True
18,5,Quite repetitive,qiuolouip,n/a,15/08/2025,"So, I'm a fan of Trevor Noah, or at least used to be until I stopped watching the Daily show because it just dropped off.And I really, really loved his old stand-up. New, fresh perspective on things. New stories, new takes. Exciting stuff.I didn't have big expectations going into this, but most of this is regurgitated older material of his loosely strung together and it feels lazy. Maybe it's that he's too much in his bubble and has writers for his jokes on the show. Maybe he had a three show deal with Netflix and just had to get it over with.My guess is, the guy's burnt out.And I'm sure he'll come back strong, once he's stopped doing the Daily Show.",False
19,4,Dated and uninteresting,gergelyjandrasits,n/a,15/08/2025,"I used to laugh myself to tears listening to Trevor a couple of years ago so I had great anticipation when I noticed his new title on Netflix. I put it in and to my surprise he opened with two jokes that he used like 10 years ago, and I think everyone who remotely knows him heard at least a dozen times. After that it started to be promising, only to turn into the 1000th comedian to start talking about Covid. I listened to the flat jokes for a while, which we ourselves talked about multiple times during the pandemic...and then I decided that I can use my time better than this and turned it off.",False
20,3,Not great,vatsalyabohra,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll give this to him. He does have stage presence. He does command attention from audience. He does really well with facial expressions and comedic pauses. He is actually one of the best in impressions. The impressions of the American presidents especially Trump and Biden was hilarious. German impression and creativity around the joke was also quite funny.But......
That's it.... There is nothing more to it. He does have too much of political opinions and I don't think he is smart enough to understand politics. Extremely biased and petty in some of the jokes. Promotes victim mentality and the material is quite polarising. Making fun is ok, but when you start backing it up with sentences like - ""I don't know why someone would vote for him"" - This shows the emotional weakness and personal agendas.I won't recommend watching the whole thing, but rather wait for the best of Trevor Noah reel or something on Youtube and get the best parts. Again, president impressions are some of the best I've seen.",True
21,1,Lacking wit. Must try harder.,vvwvjpczp,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSo first up, I concede that TN has some charisma and great stage presence, but his content was just so shallow. He tried and failed to land several broad, factually incorrect, and over-simplified generalisations e.g Covid in Africa. You would think that as a S. African being truthful about this would be more important to TN than being funny. He was actually neither of these things.Quick-win chuckle statements for liberals were cast regularly to maintain some momentum and distract from the lack of any real wit. Can i ask who enjoys the self-congratulatory tone of TN, and how terrifically cultured he is? The best comedians do not try to win the cultural exchange during a stand-up routine, and when someone like Ricky Gervais does, he rightly gets called out for it. Even the ever-polite Canadians were running on fumes at times. A great deal of time was spent delivering self-absorbed 'ten minute set-up' jokes, which ultimately lead to a 'funny accent' - choose from the Black German one, the Indian friend, the Indian Scottish waiter. All unfunny and mildly annoying jokes. Humour for the feeble-minded.His T*ump stuff is a bit funny, but it's honestly because T*ump is doing the heavy-lifting, oh, and I just realised, it's just a 'funny accent' again. You want funny on T*ump? - See John Mulaney's 'horse in a hospital' skit, no accent needed. And by the way, who on earth is TN to tell anyone who they should vote for? Really, that is 101 stuff.So, it was a load of nonsense. I would enjoy watching someone spiky and acidic pick this apart - Frankie Boyle perhaps.",True
22,3,I had to chime in from the last review LOL,Moviedude90,n/a,15/08/2025,"Your contention is if I didn't think he's unfunny, it's because I'm 'ethnocentric' or racist? The best comedians on earth are black, that's not racist it's reality. And guess what, it's BECAUSE they're clever use of racial themes (not racist, racial) to connect to any human regardless of race.I thought it sucked because he's not funny, not because I'm ethnocentric or racist (let's be honest, that's what you were implying).It was one of the worst 'headliner' specials I've seen since Amy Schumer. 1/10, but I'm giving it a 3/10 so you know I'm not racist. Quit race-baiting no one cares about skin color, they care about content and character, and he has neither. Couldn't even get through half of it.",False
23,1,Huge fan - hugely disappointed,sait-95948,n/a,15/08/2025,"Relative to some reviews I've seen here (not mature enough, not politically alined enough to understand this new special):I'm not white, not western, not a man, far from 14 years old, I subscribe to intersectional / decolonial / etc.. anti-capitalism. I'm a gigantic fan of Trevor Noah as in I've hopped on a plane / train / bus to a different country JUST to catch him live. I was a regular viewer of the daily show and I've seen all of his previous specials and loved them.However, I was hugely disappointed by this special : old material with no new twist, very obvious truths uttered with a sense of mystery as if just uncovered, no nuance, no wit, long boring set-ups. I thought ""no way ? You don't say"" throughout the whole thing, barely smiled, even cringed.I've never thought Trevor Noah to be the prophet of nuance that everyone makes him out to be, he's never been very edgy, but nonetheless all of his previous specials were smart, witty, often surprising and always amazingly executed. As a mixed-race person, I'm certain some of his jokes managed to relieve a bit of tension in me. I've always thought he had a knack for joking about very specific, unthought of details of everyday life, for building surprising, smart and long metaphors. Lately, he's even started to punch up instead of down more and more, and I though this was the direction he was going to take.What's worse is the live shows I caught before this special were great !! Much better in every way. Very different from his previous material, and masterful performances. I think a lot of the negative reviews come not from white reps but from historic fans who had higher expectations.In one of the live shows I caught, he does a whole joke that starts with a UTI, and reflects on his male priviledge. I thought it was very much ""sexism 101"", ""patriarchy - beginner slevel"" and it was genius still genius !! Because it was funny and smart in and out of itself : 1 - it was delivered by a cis het man who's apparently just now discovered that society does a bit of symbolic violence to women and co that he doesn't suffer from, 2 - said cis het man clearly knew how ridicule he'd been and played with it. So there were my expectations.But this special felt disconnected from real life, disconnected from him, flat, lost in its purpose, pandering, easy, uninhabited, lazy.And this is not a hot take, I watched it months ago.",False
24,n/a,Glad he's back,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've adored his past specials, have read his book and listened to his podcast. I love how he makes me think and laugh in equal measures, fueled by his imagination and worldy, compassionate perspective. Happy to hear he'll be doing more comedy now.Overall, this special had some funny moments for me but fell flat compared to his others. One of my favorite bits was ordering Indian food in a Scottish restaurant, and I think some of his best material comes from retelling stories of his own personal experiences.Enough of the material I'd already heard him speak to before (his German accent for example), so it didn't feel as fresh or engaging. I'm sure now that he's doing his own thing he'll have much more material to work with, and I'll be hear for it and rooting for him.",False
25,2,Not Funny,lourensdylan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not relatable or funny. I've seen Trevor live over the years and this was a let down by comparison. This review is not political, it's just not worked for me. These underwhelming performances seem to happen to comedians when they get big. They get laughs for being a big name rather being actually funny. There were moments where you feel like he has something important to say about social issues and politics but the humour just wasn't there. Maybe he needs to spend some more time in South Africa with the people who gave him the unique perspective that made him such a rare talent. I don't recall a single laugh out loud moment throughout this special.",False

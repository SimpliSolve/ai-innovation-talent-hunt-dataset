1,9,For the Fans,The_Jew_Revue,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Goofy Movie was always one of my favorite Disney animated films, but it never seemed to get the recognition it deserved. This documentary puts that into perspective for all fans of the film. It goes to show there is way more love for A Goofy Movie than anyone ever knew.The writer and director of the documentary did some great interviews with cast members Bill Farmer and Jason Marsden, the producers and mostly, director Kevin Lima. A Goofy Movie was a work of love by those who made the film, and it's great to see how much they cared. It's hard to believe the studio didn't have as much faith in the film even though it was based on a core Disney character.I was extremely surprised that Jeffrey Katzenberg was wanting Goofy not to have his iconic voice, but rather have him voiced by Steve Martin. How weird that would have been. I'm so glad they didn't go in that direction. And even though Katzenberg seems insane for that idea, he was still behind the film until the day he was fired.It's been 30 years since released and it's awesome to see what an impact A Goofy Movie has had on audiences of multiple generations and across all ethnic groups. It is one of the more memorable films of my childhood and I'm so glad it's still so popular.",False
2,8,A Solid Tribute To A Film That Defined A Generation,zkonedog,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sometimes, there exists little corners of pop culture that are transformational for a generation. 1995's A Goofy Movie is one of those ""pockets"". Despite being a critical flop, the heartwarming messages and sheer entertainment value of the film helped born-in-the-80s-and-growing-up-in-the-90s kids navigate adolescence. Not Just A Goof Is a tribute to that legacy.For the most part, Not Just A Goof is a pretty straightforward ""behind the scenes"" doc. A lot of archival footage/interviews were recently discovered and put to solid use here. Granted, these are also the most ""boring"" parts of the doc, so to speak. The material is fine--there's just too much time spent on the technical ""making of"" film specs and less about legacy.Fortunately, there are enough highlights here to largely ameliorate those concerns. One is the segment on the music of the film. Truly remarkable how The Goofy Movie team somewhat stumbled into a group of musicians that made the songs of the film stand the test of time.Then, the last 20 minutes of the doc are absolutely riveting--as that is when the film's legacy is discussed. It remains somewhat unreal (to the fans and the creators alike!) that The Goofy Movie has not only achieved cult status, but even vaulted far above that to headline Disney expositions and becoming an out-and-out 90s classic.Truth be told, a bit more time could have been spent on ""legacy"" and a bit less on ""nuts and bolts of filmmaking"" and Not Just A Goof would have been even better. But as a card-carrying ""Goofy Movie kid"" through and through, it was still fun to recall that magical mid-90s period and recall how a classic Disney character transcended those roots and inspired a generation.",False
3,10,Not Just A 'Making Of',moviebuffpayne,n/a,15/08/2025,"I expected to hear some cool stories about the production of 'A Goofy Movie'. I wasn't ready for what I got; a vivid picture of a group of people given a project that was questioned by so many.'A Goofy Movie' is a certified Disney classic due to the amazing people behind it and the fanbase that came with time. And 'Not Just A Goof' is a love letter to all of them!If you grew up with that perfect slice of the 90s, then this wonderful documentary is worth the watch. And if you're at all a Disney fan, like myself, pair it with a viewing of 'A Goofy Movie' afterword. It was a whole new viewing experience!",False
4,10,"Rewatch A Goofy Movie, then watch this!",ReviewTheCritics,n/a,15/08/2025,"Check out my review of this documentary and the video where I roast the critics who hate A Goofy Movie on my YouTube channel: Roast The Critics. Review: Of of the movies to make a documentary about, they picked my absolute favorite Disney movie, A Goofy Movie. I thought I was the only one who considers it modern Disney's greatest achievement. I thought I was the only one who was moved so deeply by the story since I was a little boy. I thought my dad was the only dad who sat down to watch it with me (he hated cartoons, but he watched this one). Apparently, there's a gigantic following that are as moved by this under-appreciated masterpiece. This documentary brought such happy tears, and confirmed that I wasn't the only one who is obsessed with this movie. I hope Disney is paying attention, because if they hope to survive another 30 years, they better recapture the magic of A Goofy Movie. I've always said they need to make a feature film about Mickey Mouse and the whole gang - in 2d animation. There's not a demographic on the planet that, if done right, it wouldn't appeal to. We don't want more expensive films. Keep the budgets modest and the stories simple. That's what we want. That needs to be the new era of movies going forward.",False
5,10,Amazing!,Movieloverkristen,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Goofy movie has always been one of my favorite movies!! I was excited for this documentary, and trust me, I'm not a huge documentary person. But this.... This was so cool! Going deeper in how the movie was made and just getting the over all backstory!I was actually shocked, I had no idea the movie wasn't a huge success when it first came out. The absolute disrespect of those critics. LolI'm glad it's getting the proper recognition!The respect it deserves!I really enjoyed this. Great job to every single person involved in making the original movie! And to the people involved in making this documentarySide note:
I-2-I will always be the best Disney song ever, in my opinion!",False
6,n/a,The more you know...,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Would watch A Goofy Movie (1995) and Goof Troop (the series that it spun off from) many times in my childhood. Both have aged quite nicely in my opinion and seeing that Disney+ was releasing a documentary about the making of the film to coincide with its' 30th anniversary I was quite intrigued to see what happened behind the scenes.The documentary shines a light into a lot of things that transpired during the making of the film. This was Kevin Lima's first directorial effort, the crew didn't have as much money to work with compared to other features Walt Disney Animation Studios was developing like The Lion King (1994) and Pocahontas, and Jeffrey Katzenberg was both the project's biggest challenge and cheerleader - for instance, the rumor that Steve Martin was suggested to voice Goofy instead of Bill Farmer? It turns out it is true, and Katzenberg even wanted him to use his regular speaking voice - thank goodness director Kevin Lima believed in Farmer and had him redo some of his lines with his normal voice which proved to Katzenberg his idea to recast was the wrong one to have.Katzenberg's exit from the studio did not do the movie any favors though, as their marketing budget got slashed, and they were unable to make a strong impact at the box office, but luckily it found success in syndication and on home video release and it is regarded as a classic.Definitely a delightful and insightful documentary. The 2D animated flashbacks were also a nice and humorous touch.",False
7,10,Absolutely touching,myemail-38116,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not going to lie, cried my way through it.It was awesome to see behind the scenes to the greatest 90's Disney film and top 10 movies of that generation. We love you all who helped make this possible. You are loved in cherished through every30 to 40 year old smile.This documentary reminded of why I watched the movie fove times in theateres. My Dad was working three jobs, I really didnt know at 8 years old. We thought my mom was going to die from bacterial minengitis, so I spent all my birthday money to get my Dad to go with me to theateres to try and make a connection with him. So if I had lost my mom, we had something to connect over. Luckily we didnt lose her, but it was a long road to recovery, that so much so we watched the movies on VHS while she was bed ridden.This movie gave me comfort when I needed it the most.",False
8,6,"""Not Just a Goof"" is Good",JCeran,n/a,15/08/2025,"The ""Not Just a Goof"" documentary takes a deep dive into the making of *A Goofy Movie*, offering insights into the movie's dialogue, animation, music, and production.It explores the behind-the-scenes process, shedding light on the creative challenges and triumphs that shaped this beloved film. I found the documentary to be well-crafted and enjoyable, especially the added animation elements, which were both creative and engaging. However, as someone from Gen Z who didn't grow up with Goofy and only watched the movie years after its release, I struggled to fully grasp the documentary's overall purpose. While I didn't personally find the need for a documentary on the film, I can see how it would be a treasure for long-time fans of *A Goofy Movie* or those interested in movie-making behind the scenes. For them, this documentary is definitely a must-watch.",False
9,10,Independent Film Making at it's Best,masontrueblood,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a film for anyone that dreams of being a creator. For anyone that LOVES a peek behind the curtain. For filmmakers, animators, Disney fans, Goofy fans and everyone in between.Not Just a Goof is an inspiring and heartwarming story of true underdogs with a chance to do something great.And the doc is independently made! This is a major accomplishment. It's not every day a true indie film is created and brought into the fold at Disney Studios.I love the celebration of what I believe is a true Disney Classic.There is so much heart in this film and so much love poured into every frame - the score is also beautiful!ENJOY!!!!!!!!",False
10,10,I love A Goofy Movie.,jared-25331,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Goofy Movie (1995) is my third favorite Disney animated movie of all time and this documentary movie is one of the best movie documentaries I've watched in a long time.Positives for Not Just a Goof (2025):
It was fascinating to watch this documentary on a movie that I am surprised failed at first and manage to grow legs over time. It was nice to see these interviews with people who genuinely cared about making this movie. It was also nice to see clips of fans and critics saying awesome things about the movie. I loved seeing the concept arts for this movie. And finally, it was just nice see Disney finally acknowledge this movie for its greatness.Overall, Not Just a Goof (2025) is a wonderful documentary movie on a phenomenal Disney animated movie.",False
11,10,Not just A Goofy Movie,TravisCStewart,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not Just a Goof is a treasure trove of never before seen footage of behind the scenes and interviews, a celebration of a film that went under the radar for years and eventually became a Disney cult classic, and a look into the talent and voices who recognized the potential in telling a contemporary story about a father and son. I saw this movie in a largely empty theater when I was 12, and for years since I've been advocating to all my friends and family that A Goofy Movie is one of Disney's best. My friends brushed me off to watch The Mighty Ducks instead (love that one too, don't get me wrong). But now I get the last laugh, and so does the entire team behind A Goofy Movie. A terrific documentary which includes beautifully animated recreations of behind the scenes moments, and it's a must watch not only for the fans of the movie but also for anyone interested in animation.",False

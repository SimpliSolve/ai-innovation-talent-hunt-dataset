3,10,A MUST WATCH.,MandalBros-5,n/a,15/08/2025,"Discovery Plus never disappoint with its documentaries. This time they've have come up with the Indian Epic, Ramayana. This documentary features acclaimed author Amish Tripathi, who traverses 5,000 kilometers on the footsteps of Rama. He travels to key locations, mapping myth with geology, customs and belief to bring the legends of Rama's travels alive.While watching or I can say while you're traveling with Amish virtually, you'll be introduced to many real life stories that will surely amaze you. You'll get to know so many unknown facts of Ramayana. For example you'll get to know about Shanta's story, the connection between Buddha, Mahavira & Ram, birth connection between Ram & Hanuman, the story of Shabari & Nala. The animations with the background voice over were amazing.So, overall I can say it's a MUST WATCH.Available on Discovery+.Â© MandalBros.",False

12,8,Brilliant,Movieholics9,n/a,15/08/2025,"Brilliantly crafted show, much more informative for researchers.It's an investigative show so worth to watch but what I think is that the information provided here may not be all correct as it is not proven whether this event happened or not and almost impossible to prove it as there is no proper evidence found yet.However, the work of Amish is so awesome. He travelled 5000 kilometers to extract the information, tried to meet every expert so that real facts can be presented in the show. Each expert presented here was genius. They tried their level best to give their own perspective.I like the show. Thank you for making this show.",False

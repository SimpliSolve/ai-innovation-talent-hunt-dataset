1,6,A Cautionary Tale - But Not the One You Think,paul-devalier,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched Trainwreck: Poop Cruise as someone who lives on a boat and has also spent plenty of time off-grid, camping, living simply. So my reaction to the events on the Carnival Triumph was not what the filmmakers may have intended. Yes, the fire was serious. Yes, the loss of power was frightening. But what truly shocked me was not the mechanical failure - it was the passengers.The documentary reveals something deeply unsettling about modern entitlement: a total inability to adapt when modern comforts disappear. When toilets failed, the crew handed out sanitary disposal bags - a practical, biosecure solution. Most passengers refused. The result? Unsanitary conditions, plumbing backups, and worsening chaos. This wasn't just a systems failure; it was a human failure.What astonishes me is the genuine horror expressed at the idea of peeing in a shower or using a bag - things our species has done, in one form or another, for tens of thousands of years. Watching people recoil from such basic realities while drifting in the middle of the ocean was, frankly, more apocalyptic than the fire itself.The film is well-paced and tightly edited, and Carnival deserves scrutiny for its disaster preparedness. But if there's a deeper message here, it's this: modern humans may not be ready to survive without flush toilets and air conditioning - and that should worry us far more than an engine room fire.Stuff happens. Systems break. But survival requires mindset, not just amenities. If these people are representing the species, then we are doomed.",False
2,7,annoying cruise people great crew,UltraNeptuneCat,n/a,15/08/2025,"Omgosh a lot of the people who attended the cruise for fun are people I would hate to hangout with. The people who couldnt handle the begining of the problems like poo in the bag and number one in the shower when it wasnt stinky. Are so lame.Yall never went camping. You guys are not lasting if goverment went down and structures started failing.I had such a annoyance at those who couldnt handle and complained at the minor indecency.And to the dude who wanted to hold in and not poo in a bag, could of actually created a health emergency not from bad hygenic outer conditions but because that can come out his mouth.The documentry itself is kind of funny, love the news coming out, the aftermath, and the crew were the greatest.",False
3,6,Bad title but not a bad NF documentary,Katz5,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Trainwreck series of Netflix documentaries has one underlying theme: Americans, if given free reign, can be as crass and depraved as anything featured in the notorious Penthouse-produced movie Caligula. As an American, I watch these documentaries with a mix of fascination and shock. If we still had a mental health care program in the United States, most of the people featured in these documentaries would probably wind up in wards.This documentary's title is off putting, juvenile and like something from a National Enquirer tabloid headline. But I watched it anyway for the hell of it. At only an hour, it's not a long time investment. And it has its merits. The recreation of the bad conditions on the ship are engrossing. The most revealing interviews come from the staff of the Carnival ship - mainly Jen the ""Julie McCoy"" of the cruise, and the chef originally from India (I can't recall his name). An executive from Carnival is interviewed too, which is a surprise. Of course in typical executive form, he is mostly unapologetic, claims the ""media"" blew the disaster out of proportion (the horrible ""fake news"" media strikes again...), and all Carnival liners are subjected to rigorous inspections before they launch.On the other side of the executive perspective, there are interviews with a maritime attorney who specializes in cases against luxury cruise ships. He reveals that at the time, all ticket purchasers of Carnival cruise lines had to agree to a clause, likely in very small print buried on page 5 of the text-heavy application, that passengers are basically on their own in the case of a disaster at sea...anything apparently from hitting an iceberg to a fire that causes the power to go and all of the toilets to stop working.Thus, the ""poop"" angle of the documentary. Most passengers interviewed freaked out at the thought of (OMG) doing ""number 2"" in a red biohazard bag. It's not as if the ship had a shortage of biohazard canisters or toilet paper. So thus begins the American entitlement reveal. Three young women are interviewed prominently. Their only objective on the bachelorette party/cruise is to drink, day and night. They need to take an expensive cruise just to do THAT? They could have saved a ton of money by just spending a long weekend at a hotel next door to an Applebee's.Other passengers include a young guy who traveled with his fianc√© and her father, who seems to be auditioning for a movie most of the time. Besides the two Carnival staff interviewed, perhaps the most sympathetic subjects are a father and daughter duo from Lubbock, TX. But at the time the daughter was 13, and why the hell dad that it was a good idea to ""relax"" with her daughter (who was 13 at the time) on such a decadent cruise is anyone's guess.Maybe this is being too critical of the subjects being interviewed. They experienced a horrible ordeal with at one time no end in sight. But whoever at Carnival made the decision to offer free alcohol on the third day of being stranded to these most likely sleep- and nutrition-deprived, hungry, frustrated, and delirious passengers should have his or her head examined. If they wanted total Roman Empire violence, sex, and debauchery, they sure got it, before a wiser employee shut the bar down.The takeaway from all of this, for me at least, is that if I ever have an itch to take a cruise, it will be on a paddleboat on the Mississippi River. At least then, if anything goes haywire, we can swim to shore.",False
4,n/a,WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU TAKE THE LIGHTS OF YOUR LIFE JACKET?!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary validates my fear of being in a crisis with a bunch of (stupid) people. Besides the face that I dont understand why you would rather clog the toilet than use a disposable bag, why on earth when you're stuck on a ship at sea, would you rip of the lights on your life jacket?! Just so you can see a little when you pee?! My biggest fear in this world is stupid humans! Amazed at the ignorance, arrogance and just plain stupid behaviour of the interviewed passengers. I have never felt such a lack of empathy for people before. Credits to the crew for putting up with them (but also why would you think it was a good idea to have an open bar amidst a crisis).",False
5,6,Typically American,mail-79096,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary perfectly illustrates how shallow and over-the-top (most) Americans can be.The people interviewed are your typical cruise-goers. They skip the safety instructions and head straight to the bar-because of course, they know best.The moment they're told they might have to poop in bags, it's the end of the world. ""This is literally the worst thing that could ever happen to me...""
Maybe these folks should tune in to global news once in a while.And then the staff's response? Opening the bar for free. Seriously? That's just plain stupid.Most of the issues could've been solved with a bit of common sense and a capable captain. Instead, they literally ended up knee-deep in their own mess.The world didn't exactly hold Americans in the highest regard to begin with, and this documentary certainly doesn't help.BUT! Entertaining af.",True
6,6,An expose of First World entitlement,eakogan,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is a fairly short documentary that is fun to watch. Well, fun if you like laughing at other people's misfortune.What struck me is the incredible sense of entitlement of the passengers (at least those being interviewed). Oh, the HORROR of having to poop in a biohazard bag! Really, is it that bad, under the circumstances? They were reacting to the red bag suggestion as if they were told to perform surgery on each other without anesthesia.Hannah, the crew member, could not have possibly grown up in the Soviet Union, just based on her age. Her knowledge about the country comes from the same sources as fairy tales about bears on the streets playing balalaikas. I did grow up in the SU, and I have never heard nor experienced disasters similar to that cruise ship, where people hoard food, fight each other for sleeping places, and generally everyone is out for themselves. On the contrary, this kind of experience would have been handled differently, the crew would have been rationing food (one sandwich per person), and the passengers would have been much more disciplined and would have banded together.",False
7,6,"It's an hour, worth the watch",dan-can-do,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNo, it's not a documentary masterpiece but a somewhat light hearted look at what could have been a very serious Eco/Bio Hazard. Fortunately it didn't but other than Carnival's poor maintenance history the passengers and crew carry some of the blame for what it became.It starts out with the typical look at a cruise ship while introducing the main characters which is a combination of crew and passengers. On the morning of day 3 the power went out due to a fire in the engine room. When it became obvious to the crew that power would not be restored any time soon they came up with a solution to the electrical dependent sanitation system. Do your ""number 1"" in the shower and ""number 2"" in a red bio bag. Seems simple enough but I was shocked at just how many objected to using the bag. It wasn't that long ago when Outhouses were the norm in North America so doing your business in a bag didn't seem that bad to me. If those who ended up dropping their ""number 2"" elsewhere and instead used the bag, it might not have become what it did. I think they contributed to the rank conditions on the boat.One of the funniest stories came from one crew member who described what he saw in one of the bathrooms. Obviously it had been used by those who refused to use the bag and instead created a ""Lasagna"" in the shower. Poop, Toilet Paper. Poop, Toilet Paper. Poop, Toilet Paper. Even though he never said I suspected he added his layer of ""Lasagna"" to the excrement creation. I wonder how anyone could handle the smell. Urine alone is bad enough but when you add ""poop"" it had to be nose burning disgust. Yuck...I didn't roll on the floor laughing but it definitely had some funny parts. Considering the title most of it revolved around the sanitation system and poop in the bag. It's worth about a 6/10.",True
8,6,It's interesting enough.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"4,000 passengers set off on board a luxury carnival cruise ship, but on the return journey, the power fails after a fire in an engine room, and chaos ensues.I can understand why they decided to focus on the 'poop' angle; it's pure clickbait. I get that it's a grim part of the story, but come on, it's a little juvenile. I can imagine twelve-year-olds giggling about it.The interesting side of it isn't the whole poop angle, but the human nature aspect-seeing people splinter off into factions, with primal instincts coming through. Why on Earth did the people in charge think that opening the free bar would be a good idea? Who could possibly have thought that giving stressed-out, bunged-up people free booze was the right thing to do?Credit to the staff on board that ship; they seemed to come away from this with a bit of dignity. Carnival's disclaimer was something special; can you imagine? Human nature is always interesting to witness, so from that point of view, it's watchable.6/10.",False
9,2,The Real Disaster Was the Passengers,kmwehri,n/a,15/08/2025,"The real disaster here wasn't the engine fire or the overflowing toilets. It was watching full-grown adults unravel like toddlers denied a juice box. You would've thought the ship hit an iceberg, sank, and then personally insulted their families. No-what actually happened is they had to poop in a bag. Tragic.One woman looked into the camera with dead-serious eyes and said, ""It was like being in prison.""
Another guest described walking down the hallway with ""sewage sloshing around my feet,"" as if she were storming the beaches of Normandy. Sis, you were on the Lido Deck in a Carnival T-shirt. Relax.And the tent cities? People were out here building towel forts and acting like they were pioneering the Oregon Trail. Someone said, ""We had to sleep outside like animals.""The real MVPs? The crew. They smiled, served food, and took abuse from people who were personally offended by the idea of a nonfunctioning margarita machine. Meanwhile, Chad from cabin 8423 was ready to sue Carnival because his flip-flops got wet.If you've ever wanted to witness civilization collapse in under 48 hours-just add mild heat, no toilets, and take away Wi-Fi. Boom. Chaos. The egos, the entitlement, the group therapy sessions about missed karaoke... it's all here in Trainwreck, and it's glorious.",False
10,7,"A brisk, entertaining doc about a biological disaster zone on a cruise ship...",mdw0526,n/a,15/08/2025,"The new Netflix documentary ""Trainwreck: Poop Cruise"" confirms that I've been right to avoid cruises. This brisk, entertaining doc recounts the infamous 2013 Carnival cruise in the Caribbean where a fire knocked out power and turned the ship into a floating biological disaster. I hadn't followed the news when it happened, so much of this was jaw-droppingly new to me, especially the footage of panicked passengers descending into chaos with no working toilets and free-flowing booze. It's a psychological and biological meltdown that proves why ""Lord of the Flies"" is required reading in high school. If you've ever questioned how people might behave in a disaster scenario, look no further than the three white women trying to salvage a bachelorette party in a hallway of human waste. Equal parts gross, gripping, and grimly funny, it's well worth the hour, especially if you've been considering a cruise.",False
11,1,CLEARLY 100% of the interviewees have NEVER BEEN CAMPING,Malauraashley,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am at a loss to understand why some individuals chose to focus on relatively minor issues when faced with the profound challenges of being stranded in the ocean. Defecating in a bag, for example, is far from ideal, but it could be worse, such as intentionally causing constipation. Urinating in the shower really isn't as dramatic as they make it and while the absence of air conditioning may be uncomfortable, it is essential to acknowledge the magnitude of their circumstances. The documentary is not accountable for these people's inability to cope; nonetheless, it would have been advantageous to select more resilient interviewees.",False
12,8,It's fascinating...HEAR ME OUT üòÅ,loganps,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't follow the story when it first happened, so this documentary was a wild, bizarre, and completely captivating surprise for me. I was hooked from start to finish.But there's a great guilty pleasure in watching this when hearing the American women on a bachelorette cruise share their dramatic version of events, complaining about missing out on margaritas and beach time, while a crew member calmly explains that this kind of thing happens all the time in her country and doesn't shock anyone. It's both brilliant and embarrassing! üòÇI think this is the reason for the 1-star reviews, but it's a fascinating commentary on culture pulled from a story about poop flooding a ship. I say, well done!Also, credit to the producers for keeping it under an hour. That was the perfect length.",False
13,7,Interesting quick documentary,Edge49,n/a,15/08/2025,This was pretty interesting. I remember hearing about this years ago and thought never would I ever go on a cruise. I did go on a carnival cruise a few years later and had a good time.I thought this would be more scandalous than it was. All it was was just a bunch of people laying around bored. I'm sure that's how it really was though. When I heard about it on the news I was picturing hell in my mind. This doc made it seem bad but not like hell.One common thing I heard was how great the crew was. It would've been hard to keep that lively composure up the whole time. Kudos to the crew.The payouts carnival gave the passengers was pathetic.,False
14,4,A below-average documentary with horrible guests,nextstone,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was alright and I enjoyed watching it with my parents for entertainment purposes. However, I was really bothered by the guests they decided to interview/keep in the documentary and how surface-level the documentary was. To be clear, I think the cruise ship crew did a good job, both in the interview and in trying to remedy the actual situation. Although some things could have been done better (giving everyone alcohol? Seriously?), I believe they tried their best.The guests they decided to interview - with exception of the father and daughter, whose story I found very sweet and heartwarming, and was more what I would want from this documentary - were extremely entitled and seemed like they completely denied the reality of their situation. The stealing and hoarding of food, and the complaining about the food being provided, was very selfish and irritating.But what bothered me more - because it was more largely covered in this documentary - was the guests thinking they were ""above"" pooping in bags and peeing in the shower. Particularly annoying was the woman taking Imodium, and ESPECIALLY annoying because of the screentime he got in the documentary was the idiotic guy in glasses who treated not having to poop in a bag as some ""achievement."" They were dramatic about all the wrong things and I was annoyed that the situation was handled so poorly.I understand many humans are selfish, and that can be seen in the included cruise footage, but out of the ~4,000+ guests they could have interviewed, I can't believe these privileged morons are the best ones they got. I really would have preferred less dramatic guests who were less in denial and who handled the situation rationally, and who could turn this documentary into more of a perseverance story. But I guess that would have made for a less comedic documentary. As someone born and raised in the U. S. I hate seeing such generalized comments about how entitled and selfish Americans are, but this documentary does nothing to help that case.Also very disappointing were the interviews with the CNN reporter and the CEO of Carnival. CNN treated the situation as a business decision and decided to ham it up for ratings, and the CEO only seemed concerned with saving face and the opinions of shareholders. While these things aren't the documentary's fault, the documentary could have done a better job going into it and criticizing CNN and the CEO for doing those things. I'm not saying the filmmakers HAVE to have that opinion, but it would have been SOMETHING more than ""poop funny haha.""There are a few other things I'm probably forgetting but that about sums up my review. I learned nothing except some more info and footage of the situation and that humans today are extremely entitled and selfish, but I knew that already.",False
15,n/a,That sunk fast,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Trainwreck: Poop Cruise (2025) starts off with a weirdly intriguing premise; enough to make you press play out of morbid curiosity. But it doesn't take long to realize there's not much beneath the surface. The documentary feels like typical Netflix filler: shallow, rushed, and you could say, somewhat intellectually insulting.The incident itself is so anticlimactic, many might've been better off never hearing about it.The documentary is just short enough to keep you watching, only to leave you wondering why you bothered.Hopefully this is just throwaway content, and Netflix has something better cooking.",False
16,6,Humans r the ick,jmcsea-08148,n/a,15/08/2025,"Truly a horrible situation. Those interviewed made it far worse by not using the red bio bags. Follow the rules humans. High horses, anyone? Step down, y'all are not better than the next. You are not even better than your best self! Also why not share the stories of those that did follow the rules? This is a sad display of human behavior!",False
17,6,Red Bag Reviewed,kilorome,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a documentary and the good part is that this is in a single episode to be presize. You need to fast forward many details as they have only 5 guys who came forward out of 4000 to give the interview. Something it feels local channels that cover the news were much needed in this.The role of a democratic government is also not covered at all. Where are the coast guards, where is the tru blue navy. Sometime watching this looks like you are so alone and helpless when problem occurs.Call this a made in hurry and less covered and no lesson learned part 1 documentory then is more of a waste of time. Mood off poop out.",False
18,6,Enough with the profanity in these documentaries,ThrillerLover214,n/a,15/08/2025,"A short, relatively entertaining, but also irritating documentary.Most of the interviewees were annoying, including the insufferable CNN reporter, Brooke whatever, the sleazy lawyer, and the bachelorette party crew. Ugh. No sympathetic characters aside from maybe the father and daughter.The behavior of the passengers after only one day without power is sadly about what I would expect from the Carnival clientele.The utter horror expressed by spoiled American passengers at being asked to do their business in biohazard bags was ridiculous.Lastly, is Netflix not capable of producing a single documentary without profanity? If I hear one more ""what the f-"" or ""holy s-"" in the interviews.... It's vulgar, adds nothing of value, and Netflix needs to put a stop this.All in all though, an ok way to kill an hour.",False
19,7,"Amusing, worthwhile short documentary",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,15/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulA group of passengers board a luxury cruise liner, celebrating weddings, engagements and various other events, only for the ship to lose all power, and the revellers found themselves stranded in the middle of the ocean. Among the many problems the situation posed, was the toilets stopping working, leading to people having to poop into special bags, before the corridors get flooded with mess when the toilets blocked up.This Netflix documentary, taken from the 'Trainwreck' series, certainly has a catchy title that appealed to someone who has ventured into adulthood with a facile sense of humour, maintained from youth, although it documents an event I don't have any memory of, an oddity given it attracted so much attention American news behemoth CNN got involved with reporting the story. It's an interesting story, in all ways.It could never be accused of indulgence, running in at just under an hour, and so focusing on the nuts and bolts of the story, rather than delving too heavily into any deep human drama. Ultimately, nothing tragic or especially traumatic happened, and so the light hearted tone is in-fitting with the material. With people getting used to peeing and messing in front of each other, we even learn of a married couple getting randy with each other in front of other passengers, which could surely be excused as another bodily function that needed to be expelled??!This is a short, succinct exploration of the worst nightmare of everyone involved, that somehow changed into an eventful, colourful experience that they were at least happy to appear in a documentary about (and presumably get paid for.) ***",False
20,1,This is an explicit expose of everything wrong with Western culture,briansetubal,n/a,15/08/2025,"For God's sake, I would be peeing, pooping and vomiting (if necessary) right off the deck and into the ocean.. Talk about spoiled children. The ship had to have enough bottled water to keep people clean. When that one woman said all she got was a lettuce and tomato sandwich on soggy bred .... I just lost it. This has to be the most disgusting Netflix video of all time. My God. I pity these poor souls and pray that not just they made something better of their lives, but they came to the realization what true suffering in this world actually entails. Will never recommend this video to anyone. This is a piece of .... you know.... video.",False
21,2,Too dramatic,rainawang,n/a,15/08/2025,"The trailer in my Netflix homepage attracted me to watch it without seeing the reviews, and I thought it would depict a real crisis. But the worst situations the interviewees complained about were needing to poop in red bags for at most 4 days and sewage water leaking on the last day. Excuse me?The staff lady from Soviet Union was so right, that the Americans were being too surprised.I'm not saying that these passengers' stories are worth no sympathy, but they are definitely not worth a 24/7 media coverage at that time and a documentary film, when you think about how many people suffer in the third world with zero access to clean water, education, or birth control.",False
22,8,A Perfect Storm of Poop and Schadenfreude,drhemp,n/a,15/08/2025,"They say it's not nice to laugh at other people's misfortunes, but sorry, I couldn't help but laugh.In February 2013, everything was going fine on the Carnival Triumph luxury cruise ship until day four, when a fire knocked out the ship's electricity. This, in turn, disabled the toilets, leaving passengers with the option to do number ones in the shower and number twos in a red poop bag.Most of the food had to be thrown away, thanks to no refrigeration, leaving passengers with crappy, unappealing sandwiches and not much else. A plan to give passengers free drinks didn't go well, as it seems drunk passengers on a broken cruise ship stuck in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico was a recipe for yet more disaster.This is just day one; it gets worse, much worse. I felt bad for laughing, but I couldn't help it.Eventually, the media got a whiff of the story, which is much better for them than the whiff of pee and poop being endured by the poor passengers and crew of the Carnival Triumph.It turns out there were plenty of warning signs that this could happen. There had been several fires on Carnival's ships, and this fire was caused by a leak in a diesel engine's flexible fuel oil return line that spilt onto a hot surface and ignited. This was not the fault of the crew, who came across as guardian angels, thus saving Carnival Cruise Line a little bit of face, but not much.This is the third of the Netflix Trainwreck series I've seen, and probably the best so far. Thankfully, nobody died in this disaster, but anyone watching will surely be glad they were not on that boat.",False
23,1,Hyped up dull story,wkrwvgs,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI love the other trainwreck stories so had high hopes. The people interviewed that were 'on the ship' seem so fake, like low budget bad actors. If they were on the ship they are so annoying you really struggle to have any sympathy for them. What I learned from the story is that some people are so spoiled that they see something like this as the worst thing that ever happened to them or any human ever. A floating hotel breaks there's no electricity meaning no toilet but clearly a large amount of those on board didn't stop using the toilets.There is very little footage from on the ship itself just annoying people telling us their account. It was very dull.",True

The worst being the three girls who are basic american people with american reaction. ""They want us to do what?""I hope those people never go camping or anything related to nature. They won't survive a day clearly.Also, beside focusing on pooping in red bag, like it's not such a big deal, the documentary could have focused on people mental health due to the fact of being stuck on a boat. Or how people were starting to organise themselves, I don't know anything would have been better than just ""omg, we have red bags now for pooping inside"".The doc was good to show how some companies can be greedy regardless of people safety.

I'm glad these people suffered a slight inconvenience on their all inclusive holiday. What happened sounds much more fun than a normal cruise anyway. Every one of these interviewees has dined out on their dreary little experience, and I imagine their friends are bored of hearing about it.

1,9,Excellent,kfokour,n/a,17/08/2025,"Such a privilege to go through this journey with Taeyong. Lots of smiles, laughs and tears as you progress through the movie. Very visually pleasing and I was shocked that he looks even better when on a large screen. His reflections before the songs made me appreciate the sincere and beautiful music more. I felt it was too short and could have stayed there for another two hours easily. Lost one star because the subtitles were missing for the last half an hour and I don't speak Hangul. Annoying, but I don't know who to blame for this and I hope it can be fixed for other fans who will be watching.",False
2,10,"Taeyong's ongoing journey, TY TRACK",areum-jeong,n/a,17/08/2025,"I attended both days of the concert and viewed numerous fan videos countless times. By now, I knew each stage performance by heart. What I had not seen were the behind-the-scene videos and interviews that documented the journey in creating not only the concert but also Taeyong himself-his reflections on his journey from his rookie days to the 10th year marking the beginning of TY TRACK.These reflections were probably not completely new to many Tyongfs because Taeyong had previously revealed such thoughts via live streamings, interviews, and even in conversations during fan video calls. But the ways in which the film interweaved the behind-the-scene videos and interviews throughout the concert made it incredibly moving to once again witness TY TRACK and everything it represented. It created a space to confirm, to be reminded of everything I had already known about him, and to reaffirm my belief in him.K-pop idols hold a very unique position in the global entertainment industry-the ways in which K-pop idols are created, produced, and viewed in Korean culture and society cannot be fully explained or understood through EuroAmerican-centric discourses and theories. One thing that makes them distinct from other celebrity cultures is the idea of authenticity. While we all perform in one way or another in our daily lives, how much you reveal yourself authentically can make you stand apart from all the glitter and glam that packages this industry. It can be incredibly scary and terrifying to reveal who you are, to show yourself. And Taeyong is so brave, so courageous to reveal who he is in such an earnest and honest way. He writes and sings about his hopes and struggles, the dark and the light. And Taeyong has always consistently revealed his true feelings and personalities, being strong yet vulnerable, playful yet serious.But there is also a sense of confidence amidst this process of revealing who he is so authentically. A kind of confidence that shows how much he is aware of himself and his ambitions and surroundings, and how he knows he can take care of himself. A kind of confidence that shows he is not afraid of what others might think because this is Taeyong 100% and he is not afraid to own it.I see TY TRACK as a kind of ""crossing"" rather than a destination-a crossing from baby-faced rookie Taeyong to the artist that he is today, a crossing from a multi-member group leader into a solo singer-songwriter who can easily fill a two-hour setlist purely with the songs he composed (which is no small feat), and a crossing from an ambitious young boy into someone who constantly and fearlessly challenges himself. TY TRACK is a part of his ongoing journey in becoming someone whom I cannot wait to meet after his enlistment, and the best part is he will always take Tyongfs with him on this journey because his music will always be for us and with us.",False
3,10,"Vocal, dance, visual talent on full display",kayeskichee,n/a,17/08/2025,"What a ride! Taeyong's TY Track concert movie captured his visuals, vocals and performance in a spectacular way. This movie makes you feel in awe of his talent and artistry. The way the camera captures his performance, his expressions and amazing live vocals, you would think it's not humanly possible to pull all that off at the same time.The interviews and backstory is touching and really humanizes this talented, almost unreal artist. The monumental efforts these past 10 years to make it here, to finally have his own solo concert. The message that you the audience too, can make it. Can make your dreams come true.It is a shame it was so short, not showing the whole 3 hour concert. Which in fact is a genius way to leave the audience hanging and to look forward to his actual world tour in 2026 when he returns from his mandatory military duties.",False
4,10,"Not a closing chapter, but a beginning",reginabecrazy,n/a,17/08/2025,"Although this movie losely spans across the month of intense preparation for the concerts, TY TRACK is a result of 10 year of hard work and growth by Taeyong. From a rookie idol who was kind of unsure about himself to an artist who was able to fill a full-length concert with entirely self-written songs, it conveys a heartfelt message that you can achieve your dreams.The setlist of the concert sadly had to be cut and rearranged for the movie format, but it still shows the great variety of genres and different stages in Taeyong's work. From rap to singing, the sound editing is top tier and the additional camerawork elevates the experience for the viewers who couldn't attend the concert.Intertwined are scenes from the practice, interviews with the artist himself and also self-filmed little clips which give more insight into his thoughts directly before and after the concerts. Self-doubt and reflection, but also newfound confidence from successfully finishing Day 1 and finally 2 give this concert movie new depth. Fans and casual listeners can gain an insight into Taeyong's thought process. At all points you can feel his sincerity and feel a connection to him despite his sometimes larger-than-life stage persona as a performer.TY TRACK in Cinemas is a great watch not only for fans of the genre, but for any concert enthusiasts who enjoy seeing great stage production and live concert cinematography with insights from the artist himself. Overall the movie version makes you want to attend the concert in person. So hopefully instead of a two night only event, the next Taeyong concert in 2026 will be planned as a full tour.",False
5,10,Best experience in my whole life!!,yilinglwozu,n/a,17/08/2025,"Taeyong is definitely one of the best artists I have ever seen.

Thank you Taeyong for being an artist that we can love and always give us happiness and good things. Taeyong is good enough to be worthy of having a solo concert.

8,10,TY Track: one of my best experiences,zaynsweetmild,n/a,17/08/2025,"As an Idol, Taeyong shows us amazing performance s with incredible vocal, dance, and acting skills.

This amazing feature film captures many of the best moments from his phenomenal 2 night first ever live solo concert, and also treats the audience to special, intimate behind the scenes insights & communications.As a Gen-X fan, I highly recommend others from my generation & beyond who loved and admired artists like David Byrne, Peter Gabriel, Prince, and David Bowie - who share with Taeyong a creative core spirit utilized not only to bring forth fabulous musical works, but curate themselves as a work of art & truly bring it all to the stage.Additionally, the production behind this movie & Taeyong's concerts & honestly all his support staff is amazing! Huge kudos to all involved!!",False

18,10,felt like I was there,xXx_TINKYWINKY_xXx,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's unfortunate that Taeyong did not hold a concert in my country, but with this movie it felt like I was there. My favourite performances were Ghost, Moonlight, Ape, Shalala and Tap. I enjoyed the unreleased songs that were specifically made for the concert as well. And there were many songs that sounded better live. I really enjoyed the behind the scenes as well. You can see that Taeyong put a lot of effort in the concert and movie.

1,10,Very enlightening & powerful documentary,cseneca-85919,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bravo to this dynamic team & all their hard work in bringing these crucial issues on behalf of the voiceless! It is a must see to everyone who loves animals and wants to bring change to this world!Clint Eastwood was amazing & I loved all the Countries traveled to support eco-tourism and the animals filmed were magnificent to see, as though you were on the ground with them... The Cinematography was dynamic. You can tell there was a lot of compassion & love put into making this film. We need more documentaries like this that exposed the truth & highlight the good people fighting the good fight on behalf of all animals. I can't wait to see the next documentary.",False
2,10,Amazing visually stunning documentary,Lynx58,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a must-watch, powerful, eye-opening documentary Directed and Produced by Katie Cleary. Katie and her team traveled the world visiting the heroes on the ground fighting to protect our earth's most endangered species. This film was so well done, poignant and visually stunning. The story line made you engaged and wanting to learn more about how we can all do our part to help save the last of our earth's amazing species. I am inspired by this film to do more to help animals around the world. We can all do our part to make this world a better place. I highly recommend Why on Earth. Well done!!!",False
3,5,Hot model discovers that we torture and kill animals,drjacobgrayson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I fully support the message, but there's something grating about watching rich white people jet around the world ""discovering"" something that's been known for decades. In this case, super-hot model Katie Clearie is surprised to learn that we are killing and abusing animals in every corner of the planet, and she needs to personally go to oceans and jungles to validate this. Yep, shooting elephants for ivory does in fact impact the species. Who could have known? Farm animals are abused and tortured!? Who knew? Again, I support the message but seriously this documentary is like 10-20 years behind.",False

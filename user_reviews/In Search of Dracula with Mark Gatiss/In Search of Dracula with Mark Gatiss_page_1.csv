2,10,Brilliant,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another absolutely brilliant documentary from Mart Gatiss. This guy really knows his horror. He always goes back to the beginnings and explains things really well and effortlessly. I really enjoy hearing his takes on films which in turn, makes me see some films in a different light. Can't wait to see what he does next.",False

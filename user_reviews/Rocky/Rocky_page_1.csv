1,9,"What it is to be and ""underdog""",crumpler,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of Stallone's first and finest feature film performances is as Rocky Balboa, a lonely, small-time boxer who gets by doing muscle work for a neighborhood loan shark. Everything about his life spells ""underdog""-- he's even left-handed. He lives alone in a shabby apartment, and when he's not slowly being swept aside at the local gym, where even the trainer calls him a bum, he fauns over an introverted pet store clerk named Adrian.He gets his first break when he's chosen at random by heavyweight champion, Apollo Creed, to take a shot at his title. No one thinks he can beat Creed-- not even Rocky. All Rocky wants is to be able to go all ten rounds with the champ, because no one else has. And in the final ten minutes of the film, Rocky finds out just how far he can go.What's terrific about this movie is that it's about Rocky. It's not about winning; it's not even about fighting. It's about Rocky and his desire to get by in the world without being a bum. The sequels to this widely popular film have focused more heavily on the upcoming fight, whereas this story focuses on Rocky's life. He doesn't want to win; he just wants to survive and feel good about himself. That's what most of us want, and that's why this film is a classic.",False
2,9,Rocky through the ages,colm-hearne365,n/a,15/08/2025,"For this review, I'd like to go through all the Rocky movies (including the most recent Creed) and talk about their good points and their bad points.Rocky - The first one is obviously a classic and the best out of the series and made people like Sylvester Stallone a superstar. It takes a simple but touching story of the underdog boxer and rise to have a chance to be a champion.Rocky II - I felt was kind of the same story and was a little cheesy but it still carried the spirit of the original.Rocky III - Like the second one, was cheesy but it was entertaining. But I like how Rocky was doing more boxing and had more drama and Mr. T was a good villain even though he talked too much. Also it featured a great song, ""Eye of the Tiger"".Rocky IV - Again like the two other sequels, cheesy but still entertaining and it had another great song ""No Easy Way Out"".Rocky V - I know this one disappointed a lot of fans but I thought it was okay but I can understand why people didn't like it but I don't think it deserves to be hated.Rocky Balboa - Was redeeming and I like how it has a lot of references to the first Rocky.Creed - Finally, this one was another great comeback for Stallone as Rocky and gave Michael B. Jordan his big break as well.But you can't beat the original because it's the first and a classic, like I said before. But I'm still looking forward to the sequel to Creed next year.",False
3,9,A great Sylvester Stallone film,rbverhoef,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you think Sylvester Stallone has made nothing but stinkers you just have to see 'Rocky'. This is a brilliant film, based on Stallone's own screenplay, where he plays a complex character in such a terrific way it is not strange people thought this was going to be a great actor. Compare it to another great film about a boxer, 'Raging Bull', and 'Rocky' will be better at some points. It goes without saying that it's quite an achievement.The story is about Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a boxer who once had a glorious future, but now fights for little money in gyms. Then, out of the blue, he gets the chance to fight the heavyweight champ Apollo (Carl Weathers), a stunt from his side. Although Rocky seems to have no chance he starts his training to make the best of it, although at first he is too proud to accept any help. The scene where he finally accepts the help from his old trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) is one of the best scenes in the film. Rocky also starts dating the very shy girl Adrian (Talia Shire), sister of his friend Paulie (Burt Young).'Rocky' is a terrific film in every aspect. The acting is what amazed me the most. Stallone gives such an impressive performance it is very hard to believe he is also the star of films like 'Over the Top', 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' and 'Judge Dredd', and from the other 'Rocky'-films for that matter. Not only Stallone is impressive, Shire, Young and Meredith find perfect notes for their characters as well. Every little thing that happens seems natural through their acting and of course Stallone's screenplay does a great job here. Director John G. Avildsen serves this material the way he should. Of course he is no Martin Scorsese, 'Raging Bull' stays the better directed film, but he knows how to tell this story.I do not like boxing very much, so a boxing-film is not something I would enjoy. But this is not a boxing-film, it is a film about a boxer. It tells about a character who happens to be a boxer running for a title. This is probably one of the points where the other four 'Rocky'-films fail and where films like this one and 'Raging Bull' and Clint Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' succeed.",False
4,10,"""But it's Thanksgiving.  Yeah to you, but to me it's Thursday.""",JFHunt,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's hard to explain what this movie means to me. Words could never. I remember when I was a kid, I never liked the first Rocky, was too obsessed with III and IV. It happened when I was 11 and I went to see V in the theater. I never been to a movie like that before. People were screaming and cheering. Shook the whole damn place. They were dancing in the isle's and celebrating. It was then I realized the true power of Stallone's vision. The realization that only the original would ever really matter.Rocky to me is so many things. I had to beg my girlfriend to see it. She said she doesn't like boxing. I almost dumped her right there. If she wasn't so hot, I probably would have. I was crushed that someone could think that this movie is about boxing. To me it was never that. It's about a guy, much like you or me, who's down on his luck and everyday feels like Sunday. He's pushing 30, single and broke. I'm sad to say that at this moment it almost reminds me of myself. Every minute more another reason.It's hard to pick my favorite scenes from the movie. I love the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian (Shire). When he's talking to door and she finally comes out and then stops to look in the mirror. It's a thing of beauty. Or when Mickey (Meredith) goes over to Stallones apartment. Rocky gets upset and punches his shitty wall, then goes to hide in the bathroom. The look on Stallone's face when he comes out to find Mickey still there is priceless. I heard it wasn't in the script or directed, just happened. But the one that does it for me is when he comes home in the opening scene after the chapel fight. He turns on his record player and goes for a beer, but it's empty, like everything else in his life. Talks to the turtles and his fish, why because the Rock is lonely. Goes to the mirror and practices a joke for his love. Looks at a picture of himself and realizes he's wasting his life. It's more than beautiful or real.It's safe to say that I have seen the original more than 100 times. I still feel all the emotion. I love this movie more than any other film. I hope one day, with God's help, to show it to my kids and have them feel the same way. I think if I ever got the chance to meet Stallone, I'd want to thank him. Tell him how he changed my life. But in reality, he probably wouldn't care. Because, ""I'm at least half a bum.""",False
5,10,"""He doesn't know it's a show. He thinks it's a damn fight!""",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOne gains a certain degree of perspective with the passage of time, and one of the things I like to do is watch a movie that I saw upon it's original release and compare my feelings for it now to those I experienced back in the day. I thought ""Rocky"" was a great and inspiring movie back in 1976, and with only the slightest bit of hesitation, I think it delivers the same feelings today. I throw in that slight hesitation part because over the years, the sports underdog theme has been worked to death in cinema. But the thing about ""Rocky"" is that it's not so much a film about boxing as it is a film about life in general. A direction-less man with no goals suddenly finds the gold ring handed to him on a platter. Not that there isn't a whole lot of work involved to make that dream come true, but one has to recognize opportunity in the first place. I read with some amusement the negative reviews of the picture on this board and have to wonder how many of the nay-sayers consider themselves so intellectually superior that they trash the film for that simple lack of recognition. Because criticizing Rocky Balboa for talking like he had a mouth full of marbles is missing the point. He talked like that because he was a street punk working as an enforcer for a local mob boss, and the people he dealt with on a daily basis weren't exactly magna cum laude types. Nor was he going up against members of mensa whenever he climbed through the ring ropes at a local boxing joint.To prove he's not just another bum from the neighborhood, all Rocky wants to do, as he confesses to Adrian (Talia Shire) in that touching apartment scene, is go the distance with the champ. He doesn't have to knock him out, doesn't even have to win, just go the distance. You know, I still have to remind myself at times as I reflect on the picture that Rocky really didn't win the match. But he comes out a winner in the truest sense of the word, and that message blurs out the ring announcer's call of a split decision in favor of Apollo Creed. If there was no ""Rocky II"", (or III or IV or V), I wonder how many of the movie's fans would have been settled with the idea that Rocky Balboa actually became the world champion that day.",True
6,10,NOT A BOXING MOVIE!,forsaken999,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first common misconception about Rocky, and something that's almost inevitable when you put a half-naked Stallone with boxing gloves on the cover is that it's a fighting movie.  In that time it would fall into a category including Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jackie Chan.  Now don't get me wrong, I like both of these actors a lot, they're among my favorites, but Rocky is not just another cheap movie about a man who like to win a fight or tournament because he deserves it (Bloodsport, Quest).  Instead of a fighting movie we should say that it is a movie about a fighter.  That changes the context altogether, it means that sure he has fighting on his mind but has other personal issues that are demonstrated throughout the movie.  In fact in the whole movie there are two fight scenes (at the beginning and at the end) which together add up to about 15 minutes.The rest is the portrayal of a man who has never had it easy in his life but nonetheless keeps his heart.  That is to say that he keeps his moral and ethics, just keeps on trying no matter the hardships.  A MAN WITH A DREAM... an un-realizable dream to be frank.  But in the end, a lot, even most, of our dreams are un-realizable... but we try anyway.  The difference here is that this man is given a shot at his dream, a ""one-in-a-million shot"". It's something that we all would like so we can relate and CAN'T HELP but cheer for him at the end of the movie.The largest portion, in minutes, of the movie is actually devoted to the love theme between Rocky and Adrien.  So that should maybe make this a ""love story"" movie instead of fighting movie.  Adrien is another of his dreams, slightly more attainable which is why he devotes more of his time everyday to trying to attain it (her).  She won't open up to anybody but in the end, with a certain amount of tenacity on the part of Stallone, she can't help but fall for the heart deep inside the rough exterior.Another theme here is that of fraternity between Rocky and Mickey, his trainer/manager.  In fact THE MOST TOUCHING SCENE in the whole movie in my opinion is one of about 15 to 20 seconds long and without any words.  It's when Mickey goes to see Rocky at his home the first time to see if he can manage him.  Rocky gets angry with him but keeps it to himself until Mickey leaves, at which point Rocky takes it out on the door jam and yells at Mickey who can still hear him outside.  Rocky's life is being turned upside down by this whole ""fighting Creed"" business and although it is his dream, he doesn't know how to deal with it and is scared to get mangled in the ring, knowing he's not of the same caliber as the champ.  The touching scene is when he realizes that he has yelled at an old man.  His heart takes him out into the street after Mickey, he joins him and shakes his hand.  The beginning of an enduring friendship which will ultimately lead to tears in a later film (Rocky 3 and 5).This movie simply seeps with ""classic"", and by the end you know you have just seen a movie of courage, of the portrayal of ""the indominable spirit of man"" (Rocky 3).  No matter the difficulties, Rocky's heart takes him through it all.  It doesn't fit the mold of today's classics (like Private Ryan) with melodrama and grandiose scenery, just a simple movie, with simple qualities but very large meaning intricately woven into the fabric of the film itself by Stallone and the director John G. Avildson, with the musical overtones of Bill Conti.  A classic from a different age, and the mold of a lot of movies to follow.",False
7,10,His whole life was a million-to-one shot...,TheSixthChild,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I was a kid there were only three major things in my life: food, wrestling and `Rocky'. My brother and I followed the numerous Rocky Balboa struggles religiously, and even today, there is no exception. Although the latest efforts of Stallone have been pitiful, the movie that made his career is the 1977 Academy Award Winner for Best Picture, `Rocky'. On top of that, `Rocky' also earned two more Academy Awards for Best Film-Editing and Best Director (John G. Avildsen).This movie is unlike any other ever put on film. It's films like this that remind us of the beauty that is going to the cinema, and if only I was around during that year when such films as `Close Encounters of the Third Kind', `Jaws', `Saturday Night Fever' and `Network' were all playing in cinemas. The storyline takes place in Philadelphia, where Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) struggles to make a living as both a small-time boxer, and the brawn of a loan shark. Until one day, a sudden opportunity is handed to Rocky to compete for the World Heavy-Weight Title against the champion, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), a charismatic and flamboyant fighter labelled as `The King of Sting' and `The Master Of Disaster'. Attracted to Rocky's reputation as ""The Italian Stallion"", a match between Creed and the unknown boxer is set, which is subsequently advertised as a fight where a ""nobody"" can become a ""somebody"". Mickey (Burgess Meredith), is the owner of the gym where Rocky trains and later becomes Rocky's manager. Mickey is passionate about the world of boxing, and believes that Rocky has the potential to go the distance, instead of being `a cheap second rate loan-shark'. However, the central character in Rocky's life is Adrian (Talia Shire), a shy pet-store clerk, who acts awkwardly when Rocky even breathes in her direction. However, these almost completely distant outcasts are strangely drawn to each other. While one `didn't have much of a brain', the other `didn't have much of a body', so they worked on their opposites, only to end up together. The legend of this film when it was first released in the mid-70's was: `His whole life was a-million-to-one shot', but what Stallone did was prove to the world that `Rocky' is one-in-a-million.Seeing `Rocky' is both a cinematic experience and a religious experience. When first released, the film appealed to the widest audience, and all felt the emotion and intense passion which passed from the film, to them. The film's possession of realistic acting, superb dialogue and the most phenomenal music score by Bill Conti to date, indeed transformed the face of cinema. Stallone's wholesome performance of his own screenplay is electrifying as the film celebrates of the underdog battling to beat the odds. Fans of cinema aren't manipulated into thinking that the inevitable will happen as it does in every other tedious hero drama.Over 25 years on, `Rocky' still manages to let the audience's emotions explode; Rocky's blossoming relationship with Adrian, the seedy worlds of Mickey and Adrian's alcoholic brother, Paulie (Burt Young), and the affirmation of Rocky's inability to overcome Creed. And who could forget the excruciatingly compelling Balboa / Creed confrontation? Rocky's determination overturns the boxing fraternity, and supplies cinemaphiles with one of the greatest moments in cinematic history, as a body of spectators both on-screen and off applaud and chant for Rocky in unison. The following four Rocky sequels attempted to deliver the same magic as the original, however failed to convey it's message. `Rocky' illustrates how life itself is stifling and perplexing, but sometimes when you lose your way as well as your original intentions, you may just find something better.Simply put, if anyone has a free Friday / Saturday night, this is the film to go out and borrow from the local video store. It's unbelievable that this film was only voted in at #78 on the AFI Top 100 films of all time, and worse yet, was voted in at the SECOND best sports film of all time (the first went to `Hoosiers', starring Gene Hackman). C'mon people, be you black or white or brown or any other skin colour we have yet to discover, get out there and be inspired by Stallone's masterpiece, `Rocky'.",False
8,7,More than a boxing movie,josephellis,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is very different than the sequels. It's more of a Drama that explains Balboa's early life. It's cool to revisit, seeing him before his success. For those who just want boxing, you won't get too much of it. It focuses on the drama and character buildups more than action. You still have to watch this before you watch the others.",False
9,10,One of the greatest movies of all time.,Obi-Wan Wilson,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't remember exactly when I first saw this film, but for a long time I thought that the second of the series was my favorite.  Well, I recently bought the DVD box-set and after I watched the first movie again I knew that it was definitely the best in the series, and also one of the best movies ever made.  Rocky is very much more than just a boxing movie.  It's a movie about the unbreakable human spirit, determination, and the will to ""go the distance.""  Rocky(Sylvester Stallone) is a second rate club-fighter and a debt collector for a loan shark(Joe Spinnell).  He becomes involved with a shy girl working in a petshop named Adrian(Talia Shire), and also becomes friends with her brother Paulie(Burt Young).  Rocky's life really isn't anything of interest - until the World Heavyweight Champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) gives him an unexpected shot at the title.  An old boxer-turned-trainer named Mick(Burgess Meredith) offers to be Rocky's manager.  Although the whole film is outstanding, what follows are some of the greatest and most memorable movie moments of all time.  Rocky striving to go the distance in the training scene, the final fight, and the closing moments of the film are so emotional and inspiring that they perfectly demonstrate the human spirit and can bring out the will to win in anybody. Add to this an excellent music score and you have  a classic and unforgettable movie.  Without a doubt deserved the Best Picture award in 1976.   Exceptional performances by all the cast members, notably Burgess Meredith and Sylvester Stallone.  **** out of ****",False
10,n/a,Rocky is one of the most inspirational films out there.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rocky shot a then struggling actor and writer Sylvester Stallone into the A list. This is a great underdog story enhanced by some gritty direction and great performances by Stallone, Talia Shire and others. What many do not realize is how little Rocky is about boxing. In fact the boxing doesn't even take center stage until well into the second half. This is a character study first and foremost and Stallone should be commended for penning such a heartfelt screenplay. Rocky has entered pop culture lexicon but its important to remember that it started off as an independent feature with a minuscule budget. This is a great start to the career of a fantastic actor.",False
11,7,Time has taken something from it,runamokprods,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSeeing this again for the first time since it was in theaters 35 years ago, I realized this is a very odd film. A strange blend of low budget 1970s street grittiness and realism, and low-brow Hollywood fantasy and cliché.I appreciate the bittersweet ending, much of the writing, and some of the acting (Burgess Meredith), as well as the very well done fight choreography.But other moments come off as amateurish improvisation, over the top performances, and old- fashioned hokum (e.g. Talia Shire's absurd physical transformation from over-the-top uber- nerdette, to sexy young love interest).Still, enjoyable and fun, if not quite the great film I remember it as.",True
12,10,"Great movie, great soundtrack a classic",marcrice,n/a,15/08/2025,"What can you say about a this movie that has not been said already? It is my all time favorite movie series ever and I could watch every movies back to back time and time again. I have owned this movie series on Video, DVD, Blu-ray and owned just about every version going.The main story is about one mans struggles to overcome the odds life has stacked against him but it is also a love story. There are real touches of greatness such as Burgess Meredith as Mickey as veteran boxer who does not want to train Rocky as he sees him as a washed out bum until he is offered a shot at the big time. Then seeing his relationship with Rocky grow. The acting is superb and the music still pumps my blood to this day. This may have been the movie to invent the training montage which is now a must in any movie about sports or fighting. Stallone's performance is phenomenal as the film celebrates the underdog battling to beat the odds and it is still amazing almost 40 years after release.",False
13,7,The underdog,bat-5,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the 1976 Oscars, Rocky went up against such films as Taxi Driver, Network, All the Presidents Men and Bound For Glory.  Rocky won because it was not in the least bit cynical.  Sylvester Stallone gives the best performance of his career.  It's not weighed down with overwrought cliches, or explosions.  He's a nice guy from Philly who has a big heart.  All he's ever wanted to do is fight, and go the distance.  Apollo Creed gives Rocky the chance, and you're not given many chances like this.  In Rocky's eyes, we see the fear and excitement mixing.  He knows he won't win, he just wants to prove to the world, and to himself, that he's not a bum.",False
14,5,Vastly overrated,grantss,n/a,15/08/2025,"Vastly overrated.Not sure how this got to be regarded so highly, and won the Best Picture Oscar in 1977. Story isn't too plausible and is quite dull in spells.The opening setup was interesting, as it painted a picture of a man in a dead-end situation. But then, just when you think the movie is going to be how he gradually works himself out of that situation, it turns out that it is all about winning a lottery, rather than hard work, essentially.The only thing that made it watchable after that was the fight scene, right at the end. The Rocky-Adrian relationship is implausible, contrived and clumsy.To add insult to injury, Sylvester Stallone got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his series of monosyllabic grunts that pass for dialogue. In total Rocky received three Academy awards plus seven other nominations. Of these, only the nomination for Best Original Song was deserved.One of the most over-rated and over-awarded films in history.",False

The story is flawless and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 9/10Music- The best thing about the movie itself. The music in this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps every time you watch it. Bill Conti gives you an excellent score throughout the movie, including the famous ""gonna fly now"". 10/10Acting- 4 nominated performances in this movie.

Burgess Merideth plays the boxing trainer Mickey.

16,10,A classic! the best and the original movie of all time - Rocky !,ivo-cobra8,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerRocky (1976) It is still today one of the best action, sport, drama and a cult classic low budget films ever made in history. It is an underdog story telling about a men and his struggle in his life. Sure, I know that without it, there'd be no sequels for a ranking, but compared to III, although this Best Picture of 1976 was great, it just dragged a bit for me. I'm no brainless action-goer, mind you. I love real human drama portrayed on screen. I've got to say though, at times, you feel like you're watching a documentary on a real man's life. It's that much realistic. This to me is a no brainier. You get introduced to an insecure Rocky who works for the mob as a collector, but has too big of a heart to go around hurting people in an awesome heartfelt movie. Adrian and Rock meet, You get introduced to the lovable A-hole Pauly. Introduced to Creed. Introduced to Mick. And BUTKUS! And Rock goes the distance with Creed! This movie has a Heart . As a kid Rocky III was my favorite best movie ,but this one is my second best movie. YO ADRIAN I DID IT!!!It is my first best favorite film in the series and I just love this film to death. It has a message and it is portraying a real human drama. Rocky is a movie that everyone can relate to. One of my favorite Stallone roles, there is nobody else who could play Rocky better than him, it's too bad that he didn't win Oscar because i honestly think that he deserved it. But at least movie won the best picture of the year award. Maybe Rocky didn't win the fight in the movie, but Stallone did win his ""fight"" in real life. Rocky, a poor guy that just barley manages to get by, just wants to fight. However, everyone including his trainer has given up on him. Rocky also wants to go on a date with Adrian, a very shy girl who works at the local pet store, Adrian, however, is too shy to even say anything to anyone. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (the heavy-weight champion of boxing) learns that his boxing partner has been injured and can't fight. Apollo tries all the other potential boxing partners, but every one of them refuse. Apollo decides to give an unknown boxer a chance to fight him for the title, with the intentions of just giving him five minutes of fame then knocking him out. Apollo picks Rocky. This is the Rocky's only shot at the big time and chance he will never get it back.Rocky Balboa is a struggling boxer trying to make the big time, working as a debt collector for a pittance. When heavyweight champion Apollo Creed visits Philadelphia, his managers want to set up an exhibition match between Creed and a struggling boxer, touting the fight as a chance for a ""nobody"" to become a ""somebody"". The match is supposed to be easily won by Creed, but someone forgot to tell Rocky, who sees this as his only shot at the big time. Sylvester Stallone, himself a virtual unknown, managed to sell his Rocky script (one of 35 that he'd written over the years) on the proviso that he be given the starring role. Since the film was to be made on a shoestring and marketed on a low-level basis, the risk factor to United Artists was small. For Stallone, this was a make-or-break opportunity - just like Rocky's million-to-one shot with Apollo Creed. Costing under a million dollars, Rocky managed to register with audiences everywhere, earning back 60 times its cost. The film won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture.The original Rocky film is one of the greatest epic action sport drama film in the history! It contains action, humor, romance, and an uplifting message. The screenplay is great, and features some truly touching moments. There is also some great camera work, thanks to the new Steadicam. It's a shame Stallone's later career and all the Rocky sequels have lessened this film in the eyes of many.

17,10,The Raging Bull Named Rocky...,MovieAddict2016,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Rocky"" is about a man. It is the story of a man who exceeds past all normal expectations and makes the most out of what he is doing. What is he doing? Boxing. Why? As Rocky says in the film, ""You have to be a moron to want to box.""Rocky is played by Sylvester Stallone, whose only other film before ""Rocky"" was ""Weekend at Kitty and Stud's,"" and, as you can probably guess by the title, it was an X-rated movie. But Stallone gives just about the best performance of his career here. Before he started getting into recycled action movies and unfunny comedies, the man had talent, as seen shining through in ""Rocky."" Somewhere along the way he lost that talent, but it's pretty evident that he had it at one time.Stallone wrote the script, which is about a down-on-his-luck Philadelphia man named Rocky Balboa. Rocky is your average tough-guy you see walking down the street, but this film takes a closer look INTO the guy walking past you, and not AT the guy walking past you.He lives in a beat-up, old apartment, infested with roaches, and he barely makes enough money to support himself. His job? Rocky retrieves money for loan sharks. His real job, however, is to break the loaners' thumbs if they don't pay up. He's a muscle man.After he returns from his ""job"" every day, he takes time to do what he has been doing for the past six years, which is boxing. Then, after that, he takes a trip to the local pet store to see the love of his life, Adrian, who works there. He constantly tries to impress her and talk to her, but she is shy and literally does not talk much throughout the entire film.But things change for Rocky after heavyweight champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) decides that he wants to make a big performance on the 4th of July. He wants to appear nice by letting a regular Joe Schmoe fight him in the ring. All for show, of course. As he is looking through a book of local boxers, he points his finger at the letters THE Italian STALLION, a.k.a. Rocky. He says that fighting an Italian is perfect. ""An Italian found America,"" Creed says. If he fights an Italian-American on the 4th of July, it will be symbolic and will also make Creed look good.But Rocky doesn't realize this is all for show. When he receives word that Apollo Creed wishes to fight him in the ring, Rocky begins to train long and hard with Burgess Meredith, which results in the famous scene where Rocky runs up an entry of stairs in Philly with the music ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing in the background. This scene is spoofed by films world-wide, and it's one of the cornerstones in film history. You will see it all the time. It's just one of those film moments that are marked down in history.The most entertaining thing about ""Rocky"" is how innocent Sylvester Stallone comes across in his role as Rocky. You feel for him when he is trying to impress Adrian and she shrugs him off. The scene where her brother invites Rocky over, and Rocky keeps saying, ""Are you sure she knows I'm coming?"" is a sign of how the guy has been put down. And then when she comes over to his apartment, he acts nice and talks to her. He's not trying any moves on her. He just enjoys being with her. Rocky is a bit of an idiot, as he himself admits, but he's a sweet idiot.And the end, when Rocky fights Apollo Creed, is amazing. A nobody who actually stands a chance against the heavyweight champion of the world. Creed and Rocky are being battered by each other. Creed goes into the opposite corner as Rocky, and one of Creed's managers says, ""This guy thinks this thing is for real -- knock him out!"" You feel sorry for Rocky there, because he is giving the fight all he's got, when it was just a publicity stunt from the beginning, but he didn't even realize it.Things like that are what make ""Rocky"" what it has become over the years. It is a great film, and it has many classic moments that you will see spoofed in films all the time. You should probably see it just for that fact.But the truth is, if you take away all the underlying intricacies, ""Rocky"" is just the story of a simple guy who gets a chance to do something amazing, and he gives it all he's got. I think we've all gone through something like that before, and if so, you will be able to identify with ""Rocky"" all the more.",False
18,10,The fact that Rocky isn't on the top 250 is kinda sad.,b_u_n_44,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rocky is one of two great boxing movies. Only Raging Bull challenges Rocky as the greatest boxing movie of all time. Not only is there great action inside the ring, the story and drama outside the ring makes for a movie worth watching over and over again. There is no doubt in my mind it should be at least in the top 25.",False
19,n/a,This is where it all began,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rocky has become a part of popular culture for so many years its hard to look at the first film as a standalone low budget entry in the boxing genre. This is a great film and put the writer and main lead Sylvester Stallone into the stratosphere of Hollywood. Considering what the Rocky series became - popcorn action films with little heart, less intelligence, and a lot of testosterone - it's a somewhat refreshing experience to go back and re-connect with the original, which offers a lot more substance than the sequels. Rocky is not a flawless motion picture, but it is a feel-good classic, and well worth another look. The basic storyline has been done to death over the years; this is still one of the most effective and successful applications of the formula.",False
20,6,Not that big of a deal,silverketchup,n/a,15/08/2025,"I hate to be one of those this-film-is-overrated people, but that is really the case for this film. Seeing this film for the first time (2014) I expected a lot more from it. I've heard so much about how amazing this film is and I just don't see it. It is a good film, but not great.This is a fairly generic underdog story. The film is kinda boring until the last third and the chemistry between Rocky and Adrian doesn't really work. The way Rocky goes after her seems more like harassment than love. She doesn't show any interest in him. She feels really uncomfortable in Rocky's apartment and tries to escape but Rocky blocks her in. There's no way that two minutes later they're kissing. A big disappointment was Mickey, I thought he was going to be some awesome trainer like Mr. Miyagi but he's hardly in this film, and kind of a jerk. I'd heard of that one famous line of his ""You're gonna eat lightning and crap thunder,"" but I didn't realize that's basically the extent of the training he gives. The most iconic part of the film is probably the training montage (in which Mickey just watches him do push-ups and pull- ups) which is the best part of the film. I felt the words ""Trying hard now"" was actually referring to the filmmakers trying harder compared to the rest of the movie. Although without that song you have to admit all Rocky's really doing is running around and punching things. The final fight is alright, but fairly underwhelming. It doesn't feel like many of the punches are connecting, heck they don't even punch each other for a couple minutes. Fighting scenes can be a lot more intense than this, just look at the fighting in Warrior as an example.It's not a bad film though. I think it was even quite good for its time, but it hasn't aged well. Maybe the film looks better in context with the other sequels, but standing alone this film just doesn't go the distance.",False
21,10,Yo!,BA_Harrison,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a struggling Italian/American boxer who also earns cash collecting debts for shady Philadelphian 'businessman' Gazzo (Joe Spinell). When heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) finds himself without an opponent for his upcoming match, he offers the unknown fighter a chance at the title as a gimmick, but doesn't count on Rocky's determination to go the distance.I watched Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull not that long ago, an excellent film, but something of a downer—a gritty study of a not very nice character whose horrible personality and poor choices see him winding up losing everything. Rocky, on the other hand, is a real feel-good film about a guy on the skids who is given a once-in-a lifetime opportunity to make something of himself. It's an uplifting Cinderella story, a classic underdog tale that leaves the viewer with a big smile on their face, which is why I prefer it slightly over Scorsese's film.Rocky also has a great story behind the making of the film which mirrors that of its main character: star Stallone went from an almost broke struggling actor to Hollywood mega-star by not only writing the script for Rocky, but also insisting that he play the title role. The rest, as they say, is history.Those only familiar with Stallone's later action hero work will be surprised at how good an actor he is in his breakthrough role, tackling the drama just as well as the boxing: Rocky's burgeoning romance with shy pet store clerk Adrian (Talia Shire), his friendship with her brother Paulie (Burt Young), and his strained relationship with trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) are all handled superbly.Director John G. Avildsen also manages all aspects of his film with aplomb, with the final fight between Rocky and Apollo being the absolute showstopper, a gruelling battle of wills, both combatants pushed to their limits. Add a rousing score from Bill Conti and what you have is an unmissable, uplifting classic of the '70s.9.5 out of 10, rounded up to 10 for IMDb.",False
22,6,It's mediocre at its core,ACollegeStudent,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerRating: 6.9It's not bad but not good either. Yeah, the training montage is iconic, yeah thematically it was great that he didn't win and just proved to everyone that he isn't truly a bum like he said he would. Yeah anyone can rise from something is an inspirational central message but nothing really stood out about this story-wise. The romance subplot took a decent amount of screentime and didn't really add anything to the main storyline, the ending love confession was cheesy in my opinion and I get that rocky and Paulie were friends but why would you help the guy who admitted to only using his sister to get a piece of the fame pie, and constantly hounded you for a job despite firmly turning him down? Overall passable but not anything truly great.",True
23,10,American Masterpiece,khodan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOver the Fourth of July, I was channel surfing and caught Rocky on AMC....and as usual, after watching about 20 seconds, it sucked me in again to watch it for the 124th time or so. Since it's been about 35 years since Rocky premiered, I was waxing nostalgic about the film.It's so impressive now to remember that Stallone wrote the film, then went up against the Hollywood movie industry and got it made even though he had only been in a few previous movies prior to this. AND, he wouldn't sell it unless he was cast to play the title character, turning down offers even though he was broke and hungry at the time. He believed...and wouldn't compromise.So basically, as a kid, a novice in Hollywood, Sylvester Stallone created one of the true all- time classic American movies....a masterpiece that has grown even stronger over time....with an Academy Award, necessary or not, to add its official stamp of approval.Over the years of his career since them he has had many ups and downs. He's been the butt of jokes, always type-cast, let his celebrity status overshadow his movie roles. He's been grouped in with Schwarzenegger, Seagal, Van-Damme...just another cookie-cutter action- hero...and hey, he's chosen the roles that put him there. Nobody's ever compared him to Pacino, Spielberg, or any of the upper echelon of the Hollywood elite.But then there's Rocky. It'll probably never place higher than The Godfather on the all-time lists....never compare to Citizen Kane or Casablanca in film school discussions...or mentioned in conversations discussing Pulp Fiction or Schindler's List.But Rocky is the cinema equivalent of Tom Sawyer, The Grapes of Wrath, The Old Man and the Sea....a true American classic.His portrayal of the title character (which was probably more just being himself than acting) embodied what all us guys want to be. He was a guy who knew where he came from, he didn't have much, but what he had was yours if you needed it, he tried to guide those in his neighborhood down the right path, he remembered to always feed and care for his pet turtles, Cuff and Link...he was a street-tough that was sweet, kind and gentle. He was a friend to a guy, Paulie, who didn't deserve his friendship, and he fell in love with a woman and treated her as if she were a Queen. He knew he couldn't offer her much in the way of the material trappings of life, so he gave her what he could...himself, his heart and his unconditional love....He was humble in attitude, and gave respect to everyone, regardless of their position in life. Stallone wrote and portrayed the character that all us American guys hope and try to be. And when offered the chance to make a dream come true, Rocky Balboa accepted the challenge. The South Philly lunk put his American work ethic into achieving his goal...something all of us are...or want to believe we are...doing in our own lives.The hero doesn't win in the end, at least not on the scorecard...but his victory comes from knowing that he gave it his all...he didn't give up.So this is a movie that grabs your heart and shows you that if you believe that good things can happen...and if you just be true to yourself...that the journey is itself the victory, and the people we love and who love us are the real treasures in our lives. If you're not cheering at this movie, than you may not have a pulse...and you're definitely lacking a soul.When you're in one of those ruts where nothing seems to be going your way, when bad luck is your constant companion, and you're asking yourself, what's the use? Rocky will give you an encouraging pat on the shoulder, a firm kick in the butt, and let you know that you're not alone in your struggles.That a kid outta Hells Kitchen wrote the script, and nailed the lead role, is an underdog story in itself. No matter what Stallone has done since...or will do in the future....he created Rocky, one of the greatest American movies..and characters... .ever made. No one can ever take that from him.So thank you Sylvester Stallone. I'm grateful for the gift of your movie.",True
24,7,I don't like sports movies,ndeschweinitz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the few sports movies I actually like. One reason would be because of the likable characters; Rocky, as the main hero has both funny, unique lines and an endearing personality. His girlfriend Adriane, although very quiet, has a certain charm to her.There is also not a lot of actual sports in this film; there is the fight at the beginning and at the end. The fights themselves I found more engaging than others in the same genre. The story and dialogue are easy to follow which makes up for the sometimes slow pacing. I feel the story could have been told in an hour and a half, and it is predictable, but at the end of the day I finished the movie feeling satisfied.",False
25,4,This? This won Best Picture?,say_andy,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNow that I've seen it again, I gotta wonder how in the world did this movie beat Taxi Driver, All the President's Men, Network, and Bound for Glory, or most other films released that year. True, I haven't seen any of those movies, but I'm sure they're better than this cheeseball flick.To begin, the movie is dull for the most part. It follows around Balboa through his plainly ordinary life with plainly ordinary shots, and painfully bad dialogue. The acting ain't much better either. Every character in the movie is a caricature, and none of the actors do anything to raise them above that status. Sylvester Stallone's Rocky is the mindless thug with a heart of gold. Despite the fact that he part times as hired muscle for a loan shark, he practically walks around with a halo and choir throughout the rough streets of Philly. Adrian (Talia Shire) is a mousey shut-in, pure and chaste, who does nothing to show why Rocky would be so into her. Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is a cocky, disinterested imitation of Muhammed Ali, Burgess Meredith's Mickey is practically a cartoon character, and there is no scene that Burt Young can't ruin with his ham-handed, oafish, stereotypical portrayal of Adrian's brother Paulie.The movie tries hard, reeeeeally hard to get us to care about the underdog Rocky and his lady-love Adrian. Their made for each other, you know? Nevermind that they're first kiss gives off creepy date rape vibes, they're sweet, especially since she seems mildly retarded. That this film has achieved full-on Spike TV guy movie status is kinda baffling, giving how slow and sentimental it is. You figure that it must be the boxing scenes that redeem it and stand out in the collective guy mind, but then the climactic boxing match between the Italian Stallion and Apollo Creed begins, and you realise that it kinda blows.First off, there are waaaaaaaay too many punches thrown for the early rounds of a heavyweight fight. These things are dances, not slugfests. But, hey, that's okay since this is the action sequence, bring on the violence! Except... that after the brief flurry at the beginning, the movie just skips through most of the fight, a few seconds of round eight, a spit-take from round 11, then the obligatory cut scene to begin round 14 (where the cutman cuts Rocky, not a scene that didn't make the movie). It's ridiculous really, since all of Apollo's pre-fight hype involved him knocking out Rocky in three rounds, and then they skip past the third round. WHO IN THE HECK SETS UP A MOVIE LIKE THAT? And, better yet, who in the heck awards such a movie Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Film Editing? But, the entire movie wasn't a loss for me. Eventually, the big thug won me over (or wore me down), and I looked past how one dimensional he was. I've always been a big fan of his monologue scene before the big fight, where he admits to Adrian that he's nothing more than a bum, but if he could just go the distance with Creed, not beat him, but go the distance, than maybe he'd be something more than a bum. It's still a great scene (albeit cheapened by the sequels where the unpolished fighter beats a better prepared Creed and goes on to be unstoppable). And, when Rocky was training, pounding the beef, drinking the raw eggs, and running the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, I got chills. He's Gonna Fly Now, darnit! But, all in all, not a good movie. I'll give some of the weaker visual sequences a bit of a pass, since it was made for only about $1.1 million dollars, which also explains why some of the performances aren't up to snuff, since they didn't have that many takes (my favourite scene, the aforementioned monologue, was done in one take). But the budget doesn't account for the overall cheesiness of the flick, or the film's treatment of the final climactic battle as an afterthought.",True

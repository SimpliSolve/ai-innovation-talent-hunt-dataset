1,10,Joe Puleo documents a poignant story without a narrator.,rip-694-591911,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of us are used to the Ken Burns style of documentary film. It's great to see a young filmmaker who's aware of other styles but chooses to go his own way to make the truth of this film understood exclusively from the comments of those he interviewed. It's also poignant to note that some of those voices were captured in their last days on this earth as several of those in the film are already gone just months after the work was done. In this manner, the story tells itself rather than having a coat of cosmetic interpretation that instructs the viewer what to think or how to interpret the voices heard. St. Louis, from afar can sometimes be judged only by the news outsiders see, like the fires in Ferguson or the conflicts between protesters and homeowners in the Central West End. The Hill provides an in-depth lens on a love story for a community, culture and credo that affirms its history and explains why it will endure when even more of its founders are long gone.",False
2,10,Fascinating and well-done documentary.,loric-80032,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this beautiful movie! The pride and love of an entire neighborhood was well-captured and presented so well that it is not even necessary to live there to be able to appreciate and long for a place that feels like that. (We do live there part-time).
The history was so interesting...the interviews with residents about the current times, and the stories of their ancestors and the long-established places of business were so well-done. The music score that complemented whatever era was rolling was also spot-on. It was entertaining and all-in-all, just a beautiful piece of film making. Thank you for making it!",False
3,10,Brilliantly done,tannerboyle-08797,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this film, it was very well done and informative, can't wait to watch it again.",False
4,10,Educational and entertaining,ghg321_,n/a,16/08/2025,"I tend to find documentaries to be boring, but America's Last Little Italy: The Hill had my attention from start to finish. I knew very little about the history of The Hill even though I'm from STL. Even if you aren't from St. Louis, The Hill is definitely a neighborhood you want to learn about. It's an awesome area. 10/10 would recommend",False
5,10,Definition of a documentary right here.,bengiessman,n/a,16/08/2025,I feel like this one brings it all. So much information and it tells a great story of an authentic American neighborhood!,False
6,10,Wonderful Film about a Special Neighborhood,lmjegle-76850,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film is an obvious labor of love and the story is one of great perseverance and pride. The history of the neighborhood is brought alive through interviews with residents that relay the vibrant Italian heritage and pride that prevails in the neighborhood. Wonderful production! It seems likely there is a lot more these interviewees could add to the story, maybe a sequel?! Congratulations on a fine film that conveys The Hill as being a truly special neighborhood.",True
7,10,An excellent in-depth look at one of St. Louis's most historic neighborhoods.,parnlev,n/a,16/08/2025,The passion for the community and its residents really shines through in this documentary. Very well done.,False
8,1,"Poorly written, poorly researched with heavy bias",JoePerricone,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a New York Italian, I am saddened to see such a biased report on Italian immigration to St Louis. Moreover, I am saddened by the title which suggests that there are no longer any other ""Little Italy's"" anywhere else in America. For the record, America consists of North and South. America has many many Little Italy's that are thriving. I have been to St Louis a few times and to the neighborhood, The Hill. This is not a critique of The Hill which is certainly a quaint neighborhood. This critique is aimed at this propaganda laden documentary which seems to have another agenda behind it. It seems to be fixated on an ideal past which indeed never existed.",False
9,10,Excellent directing and use of actual residents to narrate the story!,gregbierbaum,n/a,16/08/2025,I have been anticipating the release of this since I found out about it. I expect it to win best film at the St. Louis Filmmaker's Showcase. Very real account of a very unique area. The interview with the director after the movie is almost as good as the movie itself. Kudos to the entire staff for a gem of a preservation of history.Its a true from the heart first person portrayal of the Italian immigrants plight to come to America. Which built the sense of together and community that makes it still stand today. The Director found the oldest people on the Hill and interviewed them before they were gone. Half of them have passed since. Very inspiring.Its the together we stand divided we fall mantra played out in a tiny cocoon in South STL. Even between the North Italians and the Southerners - they have their deep rooted divisions and differences - but they stand as a whole to the world.Saluti!,False
10,10,Wonderful film and amazing history lesson.,jenniferlee-88582,n/a,16/08/2025,I recieved the trailer this morning from my mom. She tells me to watch and you will see your grandparents. Sure enough they are there at the dinner table. The history is so rich on The Hill. I learned quite a bit from this film and watched it with my daughters who are blessed to have been named by their great grandfather. Highly recommend!,False
11,10,"A definitive look at the impact of Italian immigration on the US, the neighborhood it spawned and the cultural touchstone it has become.",bedney-92850,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even if you're not of Italian descent, this important and impactful documentary of one of the last major Italian communities left in the United States will give you a keen insight into how immigrants came to this country, established a community and then flourished through hard work and the importance of family. You will see the push-pull effect of wanting to become 'American' while also retaining their Italian heritage. Coming from an Italian family myself, this movie truly captures the importance of love, family, religion and (yes) food in the Italian experience. Like an Italian grandmother cooking Sunday dinner for her family, this film was made with love - and it shows. Highly recommended!",False
12,10,Heartfelt Tribute,zimtrain,n/a,16/08/2025,"A deeply emotional tribute to the Italian immigrants who came to America to start a new life. They didn't find ""streets of gold"" but worked hard to assimilate to America while still holding on to their unique heritage. The Hill is very special to all of St. Louis, especially to those of us whose ancestors founded it. The executive producer, director, and all involved with this heartfelt project did an absolutely wonderful job of conveying this. You can feel the passion and love in this film. The Hill has a lot of ""characters"" and this film brought them all to life. Bravo!",False
13,3,Tries too hard,JonathanRosenbaum,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is this film a cover-up for an extreme sense of vulnerability? This is the sense I felt while watching it. While important to understand the neighborhood's past, it portrays the residents as high on ""agentic"" motives of achievement.",False
14,10,True Labor Of Love,mavitale-64704,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is totally AMAZING! So much history about an Italian neighborhood; the traditions, culture, faith and lifestyle shared directly from interviews with life-long residents of The Hill neighborhood! The passion and love shown by the director, editor and producers is so evident! Great documentary! Congratulations to everyone involved! You'll want to see this film more than once! It's a Real Treasure!",False
15,10,Well done documentary,rvitale10,n/a,16/08/2025,This looks like a film that required dedication and love for the neighborhood. Great job by all.,False
16,10,Wonderful!,johna-39855,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documtary was very informative, smooth in transitions and held a story narrative very well. I would totally recommend it to anyone wanting to feed their thrist for knowledge with a very well done film",False
17,10,Joseph Puleo's America's Last Little Italy - A Walk Down Memory Lane,lkgleeson,n/a,16/08/2025,"America's Last Little Italy: The Hill, directed by Joseph Puleo and based on Rio Vitale's book, St. Louis's The Hill, was a walk down memory lane for me as a history buff with family ties to the area around The Hill, an Italian enclave and the last remaining Litlle Italy in the United States.With America's Last Little Italy: The Hill Puleo provides an eloquent treatment of the Italian immigrant coming to America and settling into the area and becoming a part of the social fabric. Puleo utilized a plethora of black and white photographs, newspaper articles as well as a multitude of interviews with a wide-ranging assortment of Hill residents and extended family members sharing their experiences, strength, and hope. One of the story's prime drivers, Fr. Polizzi, arrived at St. Ambrose Parish in the late 1960s immediately immersing himself in the community. The early 1970s was a time of great social and cultural upheaval and brought changes to the area - think of Travis Bickle's opening voice-over monologue in Scorsese's Taxi Driver. Fr. Polizzi and the men of The Hill neighborhood took matters into their own hands to ensure the neighborhood was kept intact and the darker elements were kept out. The women did the same (and more), to keep their Italian heritage alive and thriving. The nearby Shaw neighborhood by comparison (a war zone) didn't fare so well.Within a runtime of seventy minutes, Puleo covers all this and much more including how and why The Hill, named for its proximity to the highest point in St. Louis, is America's last Little Italy today. Highly recommended!",False

2,10,A fantastic insight to Jimin's creativity,gigipjm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is an exceptional intimate recording showing the struggles & creativity into making music. It is wonderful to watch how this group of musicians built a song and how they bounce ideas off each other until the bits here & there merge together into a song.Not only do we see Jimin participate in the writing and production of his own albums, but we get to see how he creates melodies and the vision he has for his albums, the message he wanted to tell. He showed us humor, frustration, shyness, joy and determination.Most importantly, he took charge of his music and crafted a beautiful musical storyline and made history with his debut album FACE. The title tract, Like Crazy, charted at number one on BB100, the first Korean Artist with a Korean solo song to do so!",False
3,10,"Organic Artist of this Century, Jimin",youjiminpark,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having Jimin's first solo album Face is the proof of how great potentials Jimin has as a sing-a-song writer as well as a breathtaking stage performer. The honest expression of the anger and frustration is well described in this talented singer's self-made song Face-off as the first track. The subsequent songs then narrate the feelings of excitement, loneliness, and firm determination to help himself to be free from all the troubles and restraints. The entire album is like an epic briefly summarizing his 10-year boyband years and thoroughly foreshadowing his rebirth as a magnificent solo artist. This documentary clearly features the whole process of Jimin's making-album with him as the very core of creating. We see how humble Jimim is even when his talents produce such a beautiful album just like his own essay. Those who already love him cherish this documentary, and those who haven't known Jimin much should watch this to realize the very definition of an organic artist and a good human. We are truly blessed to witness the process of Jimin's standup as a solo artist even without his agency's help.",False
4,10,if you want to witness art in the making,regimnlule,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is defintetly the go-to piece you want to take as a referrence.<Jimin's Production Diary> shows how to build up from scratch, how to navigate through the infamous frustration and blocks artists inevitably face, how to gather oneself, how a little bit of encouragement can be the life-saving light and thread. Last but not least, it demonstrates how collective effort results in art, in the most modern sense.You don't see a glimpse of a genius or any superstar, in the beginning. You even wonder if Jimin is THAT popstar I used to know from the global boyband BTS? But it doesn't take more than an hour to realize what Jimin is made of and what his potential could be. And you cannot help but want and wish for more, you just want to know him, to see more of him. Thankfully, Jimin's main producer hints in the film, 'Jimin has alot stored up'.Since Jimin's second album, 'Muse,' was released three months ago, I'm looking forward to his second Jimin's Production Diary. Can't wait!Congratulations, Jimin, on your journey as a solo artist.",False

We always knew him as a hardworking artist but to be able to watch him in the process of creating songs, composing, collaborating, writing lyrics, singing and recording was just amazing.Not many artists are as gutsy as Jimin to allow us a sneak peak into his process.

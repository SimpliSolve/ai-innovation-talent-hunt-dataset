1,6,"Ambitious and complex, tho I did wish I like it a little more",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.The Battle for Laikapia is a brutal look on the effects of colonialism, climate change and the historical injustices and conflicts that Kenya has experienced. Colonialism and the historical injustices in Africa have been well-documented in the past and the filmmakers are brave to create an powerful and frustrating story about the issues of colonialism and how it effected the country.Throughout, the camerawork is gorgeous with beauty landscapes and the natures of wild life Africa. Many of the conversations between the participants felt genuine and emotional to observe and some of the information that were explored was pretty frustrating. However, as much I did enjoy the documentary, I did wish I liked it more because I personally felt some of the concepts and conversations weren't as strong enough and some of the pacing did kind of dragged along. As there were certain components that felt could have been improved and be focused a little more.Nevertheless, I applaud the filmmakers for being brave to tell the stories of the harsh realities of European colonialism and the effects it had on Africa.",False
2,7,Quiet Battle,eurekachucheng,n/a,16/08/2025,"True to its title, 'The Battle for Laikipia' immerses the viewer from beginning to end in the depiction of conflict-new wars, old wars, and the mingling of both. Importantly, the film maintains a level-headed perspective, eschewing any sensationalist depiction of these volatile confrontations. I prefer to call it a quiet battle because the film subtly renders warfare with the hues of everyday life, with people confronting conflict as if it were part of their daily routine. (Premiered at the Copenhagen International Documentary Festival 2024.3.22 And it is my first time watching movie in Copenhagen)",False
3,8,"Not a simple story about black versus white people, nor about colonists versus natives. Both sides equally trapped in the effect of climate change. No solution in sight",JvH48,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the IDFA 2024 documentary film festival in Amsterdam. Nice landscapes of local nature and cattle herds. At first sight, the English-speaking white farmers look like a residual of the colonial past. But they see it differently: they are native Kenyans, born there (as are their ancestors), and don't consider themselves settlers on stolen land. Their ownership is granted many many years ago and is difficult to challenge.The battle around grass and water is a new phenomenon, coming about since a long-standing draught (2 years) is making it difficult for local herds to find grass and water. In the past, there was an agreement that boundaries between farms and areas for the pastoralists were less strict when water became scarce, deeming it something temporary. That was usually the case at the time, allowing a lenient compromise that worked well in the past.Nowadays, however, with a long-term draught, it gets under duress. Water and hence grass becomes more difficult to find for everyone. The landowners have their own water supplies and want to keep it for their own cattle. So, electrical fences are built and crossing those borders is responded with violence.By following families from different sides, we see two-sided opinions along with their positions in the issues. Less clear is the role of the politicians, who is who, and what do they stand for. I think I missed a lot on that aspect. There was more focus on the struggles between landowners and pastoralists, the latter forced to move elsewhere, to leave their homes and face an uncertain future. Their other option is to force their way into the land of the farmers, knowing that the latter are better equipped to withstand that sort of direct pressure, having modern weapons, vehicles and communication equipment. A long-lasting siege, on the other hand, is difficult to maintain when your possessions (house and cattle) are in open field and easy to harm.All in all, there is more to it than a too-easy story about colonists versus natives, white versus black people, and more such superficial observations. By showing both sides, we get acquainted with positions of both sides, none of them right or wrong. A third ""party"" in the struggle is climate change, causing all the troubles we see emerging, without an easy solution in sight anywhere. I dearly missed a clear picture of the politicians and what they think to do about it (can they do anything useful??).",False
4,9,Battle for Laikipia.,nyashakadandara,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Battle for Laikipia displays the complex nuances around land, belonging, and the legacy the colonisation. With each protagonist drawing us deeper into untold perspectives of the lives of people living in an environment strained by climate change. This documentary feels foreboding as globally we continue to suffer from increased extreme weather changes. And it begs the question what does one do in such a situation. It also delicately examines the complex racial dynamics at play on the African continent particularly in former white settle colonies. A must-watch important film told beautifully.",False
5,10,A must watch,xdyejp,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Kenyan, this was a highly poignant film to experience. I truly love how nuanced and deftly the subject matter was handled by the filmmakers. There is no clear villain in this story and you leave seeing all the very understandable perspectives. It goes well beyond exploring the land conflict and into wider themes like how colonialism has affected us. I also loved the visual structure, with gorgeous lingering shots letting the film breathe organically. Cannot wait to watch it again, I feel like there's a lot to pick up with repeated viewings. Truly enjoyed, great job to all who were involved!",False
6,9,Raw and Gripping,rosefina,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Battle for Laikipia is a gripping, unflinching documentary that holds your eyes hostage from the very first frame. Showcasing the raw, high stakes conflict over land in Kenya's Laikipia region where history, survival, and politics collide with devastating intensity.Through breathtaking cinematography and deeply personal storytelling, the film thrusts you into the lives of indigenous Samburu pastoralists and white landowners, both caught in a relentless struggle over resources depleting from climate change. The tension is palpable, every confrontation feels like a ticking time bomb, and the emotional weight never lets up.You don't just watch The Battle for Laikipia, you live it. Every scene pulses with urgency, making it impossible to look away.@thebattleforlaikipia.",False
7,10,A true battle for resources and coexistence,rensonkioge,n/a,16/08/2025,"The ""Battle for Laikipia"" truly captures the delicate balance between indigenous pastoralists and descendants of early settlers, all vying for dwindling resources amidst mounting pressures like climate change and population growth. It highlights how historical grievances, land ownership struggles, and environmental challenges intersect to create a microcosm of global land-use conflicts.This story offers valuable lessons about coexistence, resource management, and the complexities of addressing historical inequities. For anyone interested in understanding the socio-economic dynamics of Laikipia, this is a must watch for those who want to appreciate the true state of laikipia.",False
8,10,Such a thought provoking watch!!!,jennifergatero,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone should see this documentary. It's simply amazing. It speaks of historical land injustices in a way that's candid and fair. This is a masterpiece, talking about such a deep and disturbing topic in such a digestible way. But if we don't begin to be honest with ourselves and start having open discussions as a people then this injustices will never be corrected. It's one of those films that grips you from beginning to end, never letting go!!! I wish land everywhere would find its way back to its original people. Kudos üëè üíê kenyan cinema just keeps getting better and better. I am here to see it.",False

1,10,Amazing!!,imdbfan-331756,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary had me feeling every emotion possible. It's such a beautiful look at not just BTS, but the connection they share with ARMY all over the world. It really shows how much love, comfort, and strength they've given to so many people. Whether you've been a fan for years or you're just getting into them, this documentary hits different. It's honest, emotional, and a reminder of why BTS means so much to us.

2,10,"Fun, refreshing, and insightful!",linda840325,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was very informative, lighthearted and funny! As a person who hasn't really delved much into Kpop and who haven't heard about BTS until they released Dynamite, it was so fascinating learning more about the history of the band and its fandom. I went to a screening of the film with the director and other members of the film team present for the Q&A, and what made it even more special was getting to watch this documentary with others, hearing them laugh and clap and certain points throughout the documentary.",False
3,10,Amazing and beautiful,RileyM-152,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this movie so much! As a long time ARMY watching it felt like someone was saying all the things I wanted to say about why I love BTS and why being an army is so important to me. Super heartfelt and emotional in a way you can tell was made by people who really love BTS and being fans. I was able to get my parents to watch this with me and I finally felt like they understood where I've been coming from for the past few years. So glad that HYBE finally made something to really showcase the fans and the group. Also, amazing editing, and graphics in this movie! Highly recommend for anyone who's a fan and anyone who wants to just understand community and love.",False
4,10,One of the greatest docs on BTS Ive seen,MichelleV-879,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ive been an Army for 3 years and have seen many docs about them, but this was one of the best, because it talked about whats so great about BTS: the people. BTS themselves, and how they inspired people to dance, create, question social norms and be themselves. And fans, meeting around a common interest and cr√©ating amazing friendship. I also like how they placed the phenomenon in relation to sociology, history, psychology. I had chills the whole time.",False
5,10,Absolutely spectacular,TraciW-02,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seeing this film as an ARMY was so incredible. Watching people from all over the globe who...get it. It's so wonderful feeling like you're a part of something so big and pure and wonderful is so special. I'm so grateful to the makers of this movie and the fact that I was able to even see it all the way in Seoul, South Korea. Magnificent. Beautiful.",False
6,10,Super interesting doc for fans and non-fans,LamiaK-8,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting deep dive into the global fandom that is BTS ARMY. Learned so much about how ARMY has and continues to prop up the group. For anyone that wants a concise and thoughtful introduction into the global phenomenon that is BTS, this is a great start. Also great for fans who want to celebrate their diverse community.",False
7,10,"An affirming, honest, and joyous story!",chutch-97600,n/a,16/08/2025,"Forever We Are Young is more than just a glimpse into a fandom, it's a story about people first and foremost. Patty Ahn and Grace Lee (et al) made a beautiful film in every way. The stories that were told were honest and true, deeply personal and wildly brave- I especially loved the scenes of folks having gender euphoria and feeling seen for who they are at their core. Being a BTS fan, ARMY, has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my adult life. The community that had been built and curated by the individuals in this film and so many others welcomed me in with open arms. I could not be more grateful! Everyone who is ARMY, tried and true, MUST SEE THIS FILM! Throw out your expectations and take the ride, understand the phenomenon that you are a part of, and see how you are helping to write the story globally. This film was a triumph, an emotional journey that made me both laugh and cry. APOBANGPO!",False
8,10,JUNGKOOK IS MY BIAS,perfectlynormie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEven though I helped make this film, here are a few reasons why I genuinely love it:1. The sound design is incredible-especially during the concert scenes. You really need to experience it in a theater setting to feel the full impact.2. I was blown away by the stories we uncovered, like BTSx50States. Hearing the behind-the-scenes of how that campaign helped BTS break into Billboard gave me chills.3. The dance section is one of my absolute favorites. I still can't believe we got to film inside their actual practice studio!4. There's so much raw emotion. We got to hear from adults who opened up about how BTS helped them grow, reflect, and heal.5. And then there's the friendships. The real connections that formed because of BTS. Watching those moments unfold onscreen is something special.To everyone who's already seen the film: thank you so much for your support! I hope you had as much fun watching it as I did working on it, and sitting in the theater beside you made it even more meaningful!P. S. That Jungkook blanket? Yeah, it's with me for life. Probably even afterlife.",True
9,10,Energizing and heartfelt,hyejinxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a moving tribute to both BTS and its mighty fandom, ARMY! So glad I got to see this in theatres because experiencing the music and storytelling on the big screen was magical. It weaves together the rise of BTS itself with the sweet, funny, and quirky voices of some of their most ardent fans, giving faces and stories to the occasionally somewhat scary concept of ""fandom"" itself. The concept might sound uninteresting to outsiders, but in this day and age, capturing the essence of that spark that catalyzed BTS' global impact is quite the accomplishment itself. I was moved by the glimpses of vulnerability both in BTS and ARMY, which showcased so well the ways in which so many people across the world are searching for meaning, belonging, connection, and understanding, as well as what makes this particular phenomenon so unique. Highly recommend even if you aren't a BTS fan because there is lots to love and learn from! I went with two non-ARMY friends who also loved the film as well.",False
10,10,Amazing and heartfelt!,imdbfan-299736,n/a,16/08/2025,A great take on the fandom! Paints army's in a beautiful light and speaks about BTS so eloquently! Loved watching it with my family! Will definitely steer anyone in this documentary's direction when the wanna know about the phenomenon that is kpop fandoms and army as a hole!!! Portrays army as much bigger than people expect!,False
11,10,Amazing Documentary about BTS and ARMY,LindaK-20,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredibly thoughtful documentary that focuses on the ""ARMY,"" highlighting their dedication, activism, and the ways BTS has touched their lives. This is a must-see film that accurately captures the diverse nature of the fandom, showcasing how the ARMY is a global movement spanning generations, cultures, and identities. The film is a powerful message of connection and unity which
showcases stories of individuals who found comfort and strength through BTS and their music. The film uncovers the strong bonds formed and the positive impact of this connection. For those unfamiliar with BTS, the documentary gives insight on their music and popularity and the power of connection and fandom. The powerful storytelling, interwoven with performance clips makes for an extraordinary documentary.",False
12,10,"Moving, joyful film",JL-0310,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was an uplifting and joyful experience, much needed during such dark times. It illustrates the impact army has had on the culture, for the people in the community, and for bts themselves. As someone who is unfamiliar with fandom culture, they painted a moving picture of how powerful it can be when people come together. I can see how army themselves would feel that this movie is truly for them. They don't pretend to conduct some ""objective"", anthropological analysis of the community. Rather, it's an emotional story that offers a platform for its participants to speak for themselves. The directors also did a great job of painting the story of BTS' rise, and how army helped make it happen. It made me feel invested in both BTS and the folks featured in the film. And most of all, it was such a fun experience. I saw it twice and the second time was just as exhilarating as the first.",False
13,10,"A must watch, for army and passers-by!",HW-81,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this movie knowing nothing, and i found myself consistently entertained, fascinated, and impressed (by both the subject and the film itself). This movie was well paced, cleanly edited, captivating even to someone with little prerequisite knowledge of neither the band nor army, and introduced so many different perspectives without leaving any of my questions unanswered. The diversity of subjects interviewed and the emphasis on different parts of the fandom throughout the world beautifully illustrated the points about how unique a cultural phenomenon BTS is, and i also loved how much the dynamic between army and BTS, as well as Army and itself were shown. There are some really well animated portions, really aesthetically pleasing shots, and the way social media is depicted through film was really well done. If you love bts, like many army in the audience around me, this movie is a beautiful loveletter to bts, and if you have no idea or even interest, this movie is still guaranteed to fascinate you through and through.",False
14,10,"Fascinating, ground breaking film for music fans even if you aren't a BTS fan",lirani,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like a few BTS songs, but I am not a fan and I am not army. But music and music culture is so important to me, and this film has a groundbreaking approach to music documentary. Instead of focusing on the artists, it starts with the fans -- ARMY -- as social movement of political, aesthetic, emotional, and communal creativity, and the relationship between ARMY and BTS, and how it is out of that relationship that BTS becomes what it is. The filmmakers take us around the world, showing us how around the world, forever, we are young, even if we are young in different ways.",False
15,10,"Fresh, fun and insightful",ddauchan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This fresh, fun and insightful! Doc is charged with the energy of BTS and their devoted fans. Visually dynamic and well- paced ....It's always in motion while expanding our understanding of the diverse and inspired community that is the BTS fandom.. while simultaneously tugging on our heart strings.",False
16,10,A BTS documentary that could only have been made by true BTS fans,imdbfan-037251,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a long time ARMY dating back to their second mini album release, I've walked this path with BTS for a decade now and I can say without a doubt that this documentary explored BTS in a way that could only be done by fans of them. It is a film very aware of both the miraculous aspects of BTS' rise to fame as well as being honest about the less glamorous sides of ARMY as well. It's a very grounded documentary and I cried pretty much the entire film. It was moving and somehow familiar, especially as a fan that is aware of online communities of BTS. It was heartwarming seeing reactors I recognized and even putting a face to the organization that had done so much for English speaking fans (bangtan subs). It was diverse and shared various perspectives of ARMY all around the world and explored topics that pertained to them. I felt my own love for BTS reflected in the ARMYs I saw in this documentary and it made me appreciate BTS and this fandom even more. It's a truly well made film that is accessible both to long time fans and those who know nothing about BTS. I hope more ARMY can see this and know they are not alone. I purple you! Thank you to the creators and to the fans that contributed üíú",False
17,10,A wonderful love letter to BTS and Army.,Josephina-7,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's no denying the reach that Kpop has had in western media in more recent years. For a non-Kpop fan, a quick glance at a group like BTS and their fans might easily be simplified to just a boyband and their teenager followers, but for those open to a deeper perspective, this film is for you. I would recommend this documentary to anyone interested in a multilayered understanding of the positive impact that BTS has had on their fans(and vice versa). The film covers stories about fans of different ages and backgrounds from Seoul, South Korea to Mexico City to Houston, TX -many who have followed BTS' journey since their debut in 2013. It highlights how strong messages of self-love and perseverance through music can transcend different countries and cultures.",False
18,10,Great doc!,kangisman-19942,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even if you're just a casual listener of K-pop, this doc on BTS fans pulls you in. It does a great job showing just how deep and wide the ARMY really goes across countries, languages, generations. It's not just a fan club, it's a movement. The film gives real insight into what makes BTS more than just a pop group, and why so many people feel seen, empowered, and connected through them. It's smart, heartfelt, and a great intro for anyone trying to understand why this phenomenon is so much bigger than music.",False
19,10,A Must-Watch For Fans and Non-Fans!,RM-228,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic documentary from an incredible, hard-working team. It's such an amazing backstory to what the fans did to support BTS throughout their entire journey. It also explores difficult topics that are not so glamorous in an eloquent way. Such a great watch and I would love for fans and non-fans to experience it together. BTS would be extremely proud.",False
20,10,Beautifully done!,ScottA-62,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone not terribly familiar with BTS, and even less so ARMY, the film is a wonderful and loving tribute to the attraction of BTS and its powerfully intimate relationship with its fans. I highly recommend BTS: Forever We Are Young, regardless of how familiar you are with BTS and K-pop in general.",False
21,10,BTS Army: Forever We Are Young - A Joyful and Moving Tribute to a Global Phenomenon,Laura-4485,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEven if you've never heard a single BTS song or thought twice about K-pop or fandom culture, BTS Army: Forever We Are Young is still an engaging and heartwarming watch. This beautifully crafted documentary doesn't just tell the story of a world-famous music group, it tells the story of the people who love them and why that love matters.What makes this film so compelling is the clear care and affection poured into it by everyone involved. The team behind the project does a remarkable job tracing BTS' rise to global stardom while centering the beating heart of that success: their fandom, known as Army. It's a delightful love story, not only between fans and artists, but between people from all corners of the world who have found community, comfort, and joy in the music and message BTS brings. One of the film's standout qualities is its thoughtful attention to diversity. Through intimate interviews and rich, emotional storytelling, we meet fans from a wide range of races, ethnicities, nationalities, sexualities, and genders. It's powerful to see how BTS, with their infectious passion and charisma, have brought together people who might never have crossed paths otherwise. The documentary doesn't flatten these experiences into a monolith; it lets the uniqueness of each story shine, while also showing how shared love can transcend borders.Beyond fan testimonials, the film dives into the symbiotic relationship between BTS and their Army, how the fandom's unwavering support helped catapult the group to historic milestones, including becoming the first Korean pop act to truly break into Western mainstream media. It also doesn't shy away from more serious topics, the racism BTS and their fans faced early on, the skepticism of Western gatekeepers, and even the political dimensions of being a global artist from South Korea.Visually, Forever We Are Young is stunning. The cinematography is vibrant and elegant, balancing intimate moments with sweeping visuals. The editing is clever, emotional, and seamless, it keeps the narrative moving while giving space for reflection. Every frame feels intentional and full of care.As someone who walked into this film with minimal knowledge of BTS and their fandom, I walked away not just informed but moved. BTS Army: Forever We Are Young is not just a documentary-it's a celebration of love, resilience, and the power of music to bring people together. I'll definitely be seeing it again, and I'll be bringing friends and family along for the ride.",True
22,10,Beautiful film capturing what it is to be ARMY,LakshmiI-8,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am still thinking about the film the morning after. Over an hour and half we get to see the growth of a nascent fandom into the global powerhouse it is now. For a fledgling ARMY like myself, this was a peek into something I hold dear in my heart. Next to me, my non card carrying ARMY daughter ugly cried when fans spoke of BTS finding them at their lowest. She sobbed when another fan spoke of how the groups non toxic masculinity was something they could relate to.We get to watch BTS perform at Troubadour for a 200 strong audience and when the movie ends, we get this montage of a packed SoFi stadium bathed in a sea of purple lights. I had goosebumps watching it. Throughout the movie, montages of BTS concerts were interwoven with everyday people sharing stories of how BTS found them. We had women in America's heartland showing how they were the only person to know who BTS was in their entire county. We had fans in Mexico bonding and making friends. We had women in Indonesia finding BTS when they needed them the most.In the midst of this, we also get to see how community organizing works. We watch as fans worldwide get together to strategize, chart and propel their idols to superstardom. There is a lesson in here for all those involved in grass roots organizing. Through it all, what was common was the thread of humanity that bound us all. The reason we became ARMY. The boys at the center of the fandom who, by showing they were vulnerable, made us want to be the best versions of ourselves every single day.So, yes, if you are curious about the BTS fandom, if you are a baby ARMY, if you are a veteran OT7 from pre-debut days, you should go and support this film. Your showing up is for the subjects of the documentary who have shared incredibly vulnerable footage of themselves for the greater good.Be the ARMY BTS will be proud of.",True
23,10,Real Army facts,DR-466,n/a,16/08/2025,"Despite all the hatred invented for political purposes against the documentary, it was able to reach many countries carrying the true message from Army to the world, a fandom that was born and exists thanks to BTS, the true stories of those who allowed Bangtan to be heard and loved without borders. Tks to Patty an Grace, Those who stood firm despite everything.",False
24,10,Very touching!,PatriciaK-687,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's truly touching to see how BTS has brought together so many people from around the world, uniting fans across different cultures, languages, and backgrounds. During some of the most challenging and uncertain times globally, their music, message, and presence provided comfort, strength, and hope to millions. What makes their impact even more remarkable is the overwhelming sense of support-not just for BTS themselves, but also among the fans who've formed a global community rooted in empathy, acceptance, and shared love for the group.BTS has created a space that is both diverse and inclusive, where people feel seen, heard, and valued. From mental health awareness to messages of self-love and resilience, their influence goes far beyond entertainment. It's admirable how a boy band was able to transcend language barriers and cultural differences to inspire such a powerful, widespread movement of positivity and solidarity. Chart rankings or records don't just measure their success, but by the genuine connections they've fostered and the lives they've touched.",False
25,10,Beautiful film,gomanhae,n/a,16/08/2025,"A group of us girlfriends went to see it together last weekend, and among us was a BTS Army, someone I'd call a super fan. The rest of us were either BTS newbies or mildly familiar with the music. All of us LOVED it!! What a beautiful film, so well done. We laughed, we cried. Our hearts were touched. I was blown away by the moving testimonials from various Army from all over this country and all over the world. I grew such a deep appreciation for the Army and the beautiful community that the fans have created, not to mention for the incredibly hardworking and dedicated BTS members themselves. The filmmakers did an amazing job of balancing BTS music highlights/performance footage with the personal stories from the Army. The film was clearly made with love.I personally am grateful to have watched such an uplifting film during these difficult times. Afterwards, I raved about the film to family and friends, and they asked where they could stream it. Fingers and toes crossed that it will be available for streaming soon!!",False

1,7,"Taxonomy, that is, classification--and what resists it",KFL,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taxonomy, that is, classification, has been and still is an important component of modern science. Through classification we may be able to identify important relationships and natural laws; consider for example the periodic table, subatomic particle classifications, and of course zoology.And yet, those ""monsters"" persist--the instances that do not seem to conform to our attempts at classification. Can we learn from them? I have studied the history of science, and have not come across much emphasis on ""monsters"", but this short film makes me think they may be real, and important, and, perhaps, revealing.IAC a beguiling short film that asks more questions than it answers.",False

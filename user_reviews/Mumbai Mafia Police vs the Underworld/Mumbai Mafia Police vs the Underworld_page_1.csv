1,6,"What do you feel when you hear the word ""encounter""? [+60%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a quick and cerebral look at the rise of D-company, police encounters, and how the city of Bombay (now Mumbai) evolved over the years. There was a time when encounter specialists deemed themselves judge, jury, and executioner - they'd ruthlessly remove gangsters from the dangerous streets of Mumbai by shooting them dead. The media also hailed them as saviours of the city, because it was easy to do so. Encounters would always make for front page news or shocking headlines, so it was natural for the officers to get a high out of it. When the world became more inquisitive about at least some of these questionable encounters, the saviours turned villains. The morality behind this is what the documentary leaves you to think about. At 87 minutes, it's an engaging affair.",False
2,7,Encounter specialists in the 90s - did they go too far? ?,gandhiaakash-68378,n/a,16/08/2025,"Engaging narrative of how the underworld activities in the 90s were successfully curbed using ""encounter specialists"", but at the same time the documentary grapples with the question whether these encounter specialists went too far and took the law in their own hands by staging so called ""fake encounters"".These specialists argue that irrespective of whether the encounters were staged or genuine, the end result was a dead criminal who in a normal scenarios would get bail if jailed and will be out on the streets terrorising people.On the flip side, human rights activists argue that the dead criminals missed an opportunity to reform and lead a positive life.At the end of the day, politicians were happy for encounters to take place while the crime rate was being brought under control but once it was controlled they had to sacrifice some of these so called encounter specialists to pacify the western governments and human rights organisations.Would Mumbai have ended up as a terror state had it not been for the encounter specialists? No doubt there was collateral damage, but was it worth it ? Only a person living in fear in Mumbai in the 90s would know, and probably agree.",False
3,7,Mafia,vibhus-17780,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary gives us the brief insight into the world of 90s Mumbai Mafia and police encounters to neutralize the organized crime syndicate . Unbiased view towards the issue was the major positive of the documentary , at first it explores the rise of D Company and how cruel they were , which caused chaos in streets of Mumbai , to neutralize them cops chose the violence in which they ended up exploiting their authority , same time it shows how annoying and opportunistic the media are . Docu mostly shows the cops side of the story and how they became heroes of the country by encountering the criminals and at end how they became villians for there fake encounters .Overall , documentary discusses the known incidents and facts that took place in two decades in 1hr 30mins . If you have less idea about the D Company crime syndicate and police encountering that took place in 90s and early 2ks of Mumbai then kindly give it a try . Worth watching .",False
4,n/a,Oustanding documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is incredibly well done. The real footage from the 90s events mentioned is powerful, the reconstitutions have a real cinematic quality, and the interviews of the ""encounter cops"" are just fascinating. The whole story is wild and seems straight out of a movie.The only criticism I have is that 3 our of the 4 journalists interviewed were very judgmental, in a way that came across as preachy and tone deaf. The female journalist literally says that the death of 1200 gangsters in encounters over the years was worse than the 1993 Bombay blasts... Obviously that's her opinion and it doesn't change how extremely well put together the documentary is, but it overall felt like the makers were trying to push the view that the encounter cops were as bad as the gangsters they killed, which I found to be a very manichean view.But despite the caricatural opinions delivered by the interviewed journalists, the documentary is really worth a watch. The visuals, both old and new, are great and it's amazing to learn about the events through the very honest explanations of the famous encounter cops of the time.",False
5,7,interesting watch!,manishrvce,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mumbai underworld has always been a fascinating topic in Indian films, novels and discussions. Now with the current trend in web series, the Bombay Mafia as it was known is showing its presence on OTT as well. Along with Hanslal Mehta's Scoop, Netflix has created an international crew documentary titled ""Mumbai Mafia: Police vs The Underworld"". This well-shot documentary has been made by British film-maker- Morgan Matthews. It covers the journey and important incidents of the underworld from 1991 to 2022! It covers interviews of major police officers, journalists and ex-D-company person and also shows the impact of shootouts, gang wars, and encounters and also opens old wounds of the Mumbai 1993 riots and the blasts. Although Bollywood has covered almost all of these issues in popular films like Shootout at Lokhandwala, Black Friday,Bombay,Ab tak Chappan etc ,still the documentary with a running time of app 1.5 hours is an interesting watch. A slickly made docu for people interested in real-life underworld and encounter specialists!!",False
6,9,I liked it.,vatsalyabohra,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGrowing up in India, we used to hear about these cops in the media. They were in fact like heroes and we used to think nobody could touch them. Mumbai was in a pretty bad shape in the late eighties and early nineties. The gangsters had taken Mumbai for granted treating it like their headquarters of operations without being checked. The extortion from the businesses was costing millions in losses in form of tax revenues for the govt. These cops did what was needed to he done. Cleaned Mumbai out. Mumbai still has it s problems, but no one is scared to roam the streets of Mumbai anymore. It's because of these encounter cops! I love how this doco has tried to take an unbiased view on these cops, but it's clear to the viewer what side they're on. Well made doco, with long interviews, great background score and factual reporting. The annoying media, the Human rights view is also well portrayed and how they became a thorn in the side for the cops who were trying to clean up Mumbai. Solid 9/10.",True
7,3,A story teller NOT a movie.,mubashirrashid-07973,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just didn't like this movie at all, actually I didn't felt it a like a movie. This is actually some policemens tells their stories about their career cases. I started watching and thought that it will startup on some instance but they kept on telling stories then I came to know the module of the movie it was little confusing. I would like to give 3 stars only because I didn't thought they are going to tell me some of their great stories rather my idea was that they will put some interesting content that would amuse me. You will feel extremely bored watching this. So I would not rate it like a good movie.",False
8,9,Mumbai mafia:police vs the underworld-season 1,puranjanbasak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mumbai mafia:police vs the underworld is a crime documentary film directed by raaghav dar and francis longhurst.This docu does many things right and some things wrong. The police and their functioning is basically the centerstage here. Ravindra angre, pradeep sharma and all the other members of the encounter squad are interviewed and their views are thoroughly shown. They are unapologetic but also remorseful at the same time. 'Nobody likes to kill people' is what one police officer says. AA khan resigns even. This docu does humanize the police officials in a controversial encounter story. The gangsters are hardly focused upon. Dawood's background is touched and not detailed. Minty tejpal and hussain zaidi make appearances here and it was an honour to listen to them.The screenplay during the bombay blast aftermath becomes slow in the first half. It shifts attention and loses its grip.I would rate this docu 8.5.",False
9,5,"It's a documentary, not a film",FanOfSuperHeroes,n/a,16/08/2025,"As you read the title, this is a documentary, not a film. This film, let's say film, uses real life characters, pictures, and footages, means there are no actors involved. Yeah, there are 1-2 actors whose job is to recreate the scenes that were not filmed originally at the time. On the other hand, this film does good job in showing the faces of both underworld and police. Actually, the real people involved in real life incidents are brought to the camera and asked for interview to share their point of view, which is a good job because both police officers and ex-gangsters are invited on the camera. You will get to see the perspective of both police and goons in this movie, as well as some journalists. I will rate this movie 7 stars. The movie does not have a conclusion. It started from one point and ended on the other point, but I never got the point that they are trying to show us. What is it? I never got it. What is their sole purpose of making this documentary? I don't understand that bcause we start from 90's and directly jump into 2022. We never got the conclusion of what happened next after the incidents in 90's. They just showed that this police officer did that much encounter and xyz happened. So what? Everybody knows that. I am just rating this movie based on the real footages that they have collected. Besides, they showed everything that the public already knows. The movie does not reveals any hard secrets. Yeah, you might not know them if you don't read newspapers and encyclopedias but those who read, they already know the things shown in this movie. So, I will rate it 5 out 10.",False
10,8,it seems...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like theres no end to crime anywhere, and where it eventually worked for a while fighting bad with bad and worst for worst, they eventually got punished and dolloped with by their own. Cause mumbai police force encounters, or may i say enforcers, cause it was that their real mission was, upon criminal organisations and terrorists had an asphyxiating effect , and made mumbai for a period become a silent town crimewise...quite unheard of really for western ears and eyes , giving a task force carte blanche authority over life, death and justice. And that really ruined their tactics, when an article in time magazine told the story about them dirty harry's of mumbai.So crime came back, and are still ruling the streets of mumbai...as a documentary production its a historical testament of mumbai, a city of dirt and chaos, where i least of all wouldve acted as a policeman. They use loads of media reels, and interviews, but the historians and humanists are oblivious. I do also miss mentioning of the mumbai hotel terror attack of 201?, that mustve had links to the d-company of gangsters. And in the end must be mentioned the lack of a pure time line, especially the latter third of the film...but its a well made film on its premisses, the grumpy old man who hasnt and wouldnt visit mumbai, will recommend a view, its raw nature of crime shown en masse'.",False
11,10,Pradeep sir stole the show,indexiaqueries,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this documentary last night and i must say Pradeep sir and Khan sir did bravery act by killing criminals,
They are the real heroes and should be given Bharat Ratna.It is not that easy to handle top notch mafias, in fact many other policemen didn't want to take risk but these brave souls didn't care about their lives and went ahead to eliminate mafias.I don't understand why their honesty was being questioned, i am sure who blamed these cops , can never have such gutsRemember Gulshan Kumar ji was killed brutally in a broad day light, he was a good human being and was killed because he refused to pay "" Hafta "",
When he was asked to pay Hafta, Gulshan Kumar ji replied that he would rather give his money to pandaals ,So in my opinion mafias paid for what they did to innocent lives.",False
12,8,History chapter done right,Tubuscus,n/a,16/08/2025,"People who would be watching a Netflix docu are mostly young people who either were too young during the encounter days or weren't even born yet. So for most of its viewers its a history lesson. A unbiased history lesson.Mumbai was growing rapidly, law and order wasn't growing at the same pace, opportunity for crime was increasing day by day.In 90s A few key incidents happened which shook people of Mumbai and made police desperate to maintain law and orderThis desperation resulted into police becoming the law enforcement, the judge and the punisher, and if they found you guilty, then the punishment was DEATH.Was it morally right? No, did it bring peace for Mumbai? Yes.This docu shows how it started, how it happened and what was the aftermath.For me the best part was real interviews of key people involved.Definitely worth a watch for everyone regardless their opinion on the topic.",False
13,9,Underworld of Mumbai,sulemansaeeed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mumbai Mafia: Police vs The UnderworldI agree with Pradeep Sharma, why and how it matters how gangsters are treated, they're neutralised, that's all. In the ending he says, when crime surges, higher authorities grant you freedom of your control, when crime goes down, you're thrown away.This movie shows how Mumbai Police deals with gangsters, terrorists and others from the underworld. Riots, shootouts, snatching, robbery etc, all of these evils are like termites to a society.It should not matter how evil is eradicated, evil is eradicated somehow, that's all that should matter.I still haven't been able to understand the fact that why, just why, why evil human beings do evil things, what good and relief they feel in doing so, just whattt. But it is what it is, God has created both good and evil. Evil isn't gonna leave this world till the resurrection day.",False
14,8,Good Documentary on Mumbai,shashank-m,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mumbai is the financial capital of India and one of major cities globally. It is fascinating that someone controlled mumbai and taxed others in addition to Govt just a few decades ago.Don't expect it to be a movie but it is a good documentary on Mumbai history and some key events which happened in 1990s. I was too young then and this is a perfect history chapter for me I needed.It shows the rise of mafia and how police has curbed down on mafia but then slowly how police started to show power and then slowly eventually there was an equilibrium.Fun fact: the word ""encounter"" was in fact Indian English.",False
15,9,Hats off to sir Pradeep Sharma,nadiahabeeb-95688,n/a,16/08/2025,"A nice documentary making me appreciate the cops who have encountered those who do not deserve a chance at life... thanks to Pradeep Sharma and the rest of the encounter specialists for making Mumbai what it is today. Hats off to them. However, the annoying liberal lady (and they are always at least 80kg) and the white soy journalist are a taint to the documentary. They sided with criminals and chose to humanise terrorists and but never the victims. My sympathy goes to the victims of the Mumbai bomb blasts and those terrorised by gangsters, and also Pradeep Sharma who was attacked by these malicious pro-criminal journalists.",False

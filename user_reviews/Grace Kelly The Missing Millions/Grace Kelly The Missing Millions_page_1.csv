1,3,3 minutes of information in a 1-hour program,henny-4,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe information about how much Grace earned as an actress and model is quite interesting, but the producers hit a brick wall when the Monaco authorities refused to allow access to Grace's will, so the question of what happened to her money is never answered. There is also a sleazy amount of gossip about her affair and pointless comparisons with Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton.",True
2,3,No answer to the MISSING MILLIONS here !!!,lyninbyron,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLovely to see all the archival footage of Grace Kelly but as for the missing millions, there are no answers here!The documentary must have asked the question ""where are the missing millions?"" at least 50 times throughout but no answers to be given. Same old format, same old commentators trotted out and the promise to reveal what happened to the missing millions. So what HAPPENED ???",True

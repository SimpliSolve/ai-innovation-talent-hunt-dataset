2,7,Kangaroo Valley,allmoviesfan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a treat this documentary is!Kangaroo Valley is the story of Mala, a joey, and the first year of her life in Kangaroo Valley aka the Namadgi National Park in the southern part of the Australian Capital Territory, trying to stay one step ahead of the kangaroo's greatest enemy: the dingo (Inset Azaria Chamberlain joke here).The scenery is stunning - I will never get tired of seeing the granite tors and rugged ridges of the Namadgi from above - and the Australian animals are plentiful - possums, wombats, platypus' and sugar gliders, to name just a few; special shout-out to Warren the Wombat - and brilliantly presented in HD. Not sure we have seen the unique creatures so well captured.Netflix has done a great job on this documentary, narrated by Sarah Snook.",True

Hats off.to the documentary makers including the director, the photographers, editors and all other cast and crew. WOW!",False

5,10,Perfect for the family,omallek-41117,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow, the beautiful cinematography makes this a lovely documentary the whole family can watch. Highly recommend it for holiday viewing. There are lots of animal behaviors I have never seen on screen before of Australian animals, especially the Black Mountain dingos and how they hunt to survive. It is not only about one Kangaroo family but a whole cast of animals that live in the valley. Bossy wombats, smart birds, bioluminescent quolls! The narration by Sarah Snook (Succession), the editing, and the music are all really exceptional. It takes you on quite a trip. It is dramatic in that beautiful little valley!",False

7,10,Riveting,dvishwanathan,n/a,15/08/2025,An enticing family movie to be enjoyed by all ages.We are involved with Mala and her surroundings from early on in the movie and held riveted to our screens by the action !The chase scenes are amazing! One wonders how they were done so superbly. The Australian Bush is beautifully depicted throughout the four seasons. The animals seem to follow the director's wishes !Without giving away too much the viewer is totally engrossed and emotionally engaged in the life of 'Kangaroo Valley'The movie ends at Mala being one year old. Cannot wait to see the sequel to find out what happens to Mala after this .,False
8,5,WARNING ARACHNOPHOBIA,Dovyeon,n/a,15/08/2025,As someone who has arachnophobia I would've kept watching the documentary longer if they stopped showing spiders and then theirs the microshot of one which makes my skin crawl.Besides spiders I loved the dingoes and the story of the joey growing up.The dingoes as someone who likes canines were what I enjoyed seeing the most because kangaroos take the spotlight too much.The narrator was fine but I always prefer David Attenborough.I liked how the documentary focused on other animals and organisms instead of just kangaroos.I've seen few documentaries on Australia but all contained spiders.,False

1,10,Awesome Documentary,briananderson-63918,n/a,16/08/2025,"Awesome documentary Kyle. So glad I had the opportunity to finally watch it. I learned a lot more about you as a race car driver. Kind of funny how much stuff you forget over the years. If you're a Nascar fan you need to watch this documentary even though you may not be a Kyle Busch fan. I believe it'll give you a different perspective of Kyle.I have to admit early on in your career wasn't the biggest fan, but in the few years i have become a Proud member of Rowdy Nation. I've love watching Braxton's YouTube channel. You have a great little up-and-coming driver there.Wishing you best of luck with RCR this coming year. I totally see another championship or two in your future at RCR.",False

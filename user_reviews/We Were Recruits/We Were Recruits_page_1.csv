1,8,The reality of being invaded by Russia,mlgcontentlib,n/a,15/08/2025,Not surprised at the number of bot and trolls reviewing here as Russia's priority seems to be to promote some kind of desperate justification for its invasion of Ukraine by down voting pro Ukrainian experience media. Personally I found this to be a refreshing perspective. It took the form of interviews diving into the psyche of before and after combat and weaving in life experience reveals of various military personnel. Nobody wanted to live like this not really and yet they're all forced into this situation so they make the best of it. It's impressive how Ukraine manages to keep the Russian hordes at bay. The film has intermixed news clips and video records of actual situations both during The invasion and in combat after. Definitely worth a watch to get a realistic understanding of how the ukrainians have to fight to stay free.,False
2,8,Forever thank you,bogdan1992,n/a,15/08/2025,"Strange there is only one bot review.This movie is more like compilations of different interviews with soldiers from 3 assault brigade: people, who have seen war, who protected ukrainians, Ukraine; people, who gave and give everything they have in order to protect Ukraine's insependence; people I will be forever in debt for they do.Please, watch it if you want to get acknowledged with one of the most powerful divisions in army of Ukraine, their stories, dreams.Of course, it is not ideal as it was shoot by director Liubomyr Levytskyi, who is mostly famous for popcorn-movies, so there are scenes that were a bit awkward.But in general, I really encourage everyone to see it.Glory to Ukraine!-To heroes all the Glory.",False
3,3,Hilarious piece of incompetent trash,dima-12,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lyubomir Levitsky's My buly rekrutamy is most certainly one of the worst films you can see this year. At the same time, it's so severely incompetent that it's even pretty hard to define what the hell I just watched.It is structured as a documentary even though all the situations are clearly faked and testimonials are obviously scripted and yet you can't say it's a mockumentary either because it doesn't have a dramatic structure and growth of a fiction that just happens to feed on the documentary film conventions.Basically it's just.a bunch of fake testimonials, aimed mostly at Western audiences, amped up with some poor man's Michael Bay coverage, shot in fake and hyper designed interiors, like the Ragnarok MMA gym which looks like a place where MCU heroes work out.It's hard to imagine a person dumb enough to take this seriously on any level.",False

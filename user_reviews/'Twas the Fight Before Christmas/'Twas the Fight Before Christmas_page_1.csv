1,7,This movie will make you think about what's really important in life,story_by_corey,n/a,16/08/2025,"There a several subplots within this story. One of them was Kristy Morris. It wasn't her idea to start the fight, but she also wants to be a good wife and support her husband. She is a brave woman who pays a massive price for that support. She talks about her family being forced into an existence of isolation, so many of life's experiences lost to time and facing down potential financial ruin with each court case. I felt sorry for her situation. I found myself wishing Jeremy would look into her eyes and perhaps see there are more important things in life than getting your way. But that didn't happen and at the end of this show, I felt sad for both Kristy and all the people living in that neighborhood. I hope all of them one day may find peace again.",False

3,7,"Good story,",runner140,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a fan of HOA's in the least bit but I'm even less of a fan of bullies. And even less of bullies who feel entitled to throw their weight around to get what they want and revel in wasting the time and resources of the world at large. I hope Mr. Morris watches himself in the film, reads these reviews, and takes a good long hard look in the mirror and realizes everyone knows he never acted in good faith nor is he a good Christian. News flash, Morris, Christmas isn't about lights and gross displays of entitlement and the desire to be the center of attention. It's about loving and helping OTHERS!! You could have helped so many people with the money you spent on your show.For the record, the filmmakers did an excellent job with the story.",False
4,6,What a jerk,jhwalker-946-914750,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wanted to use stronger language than ""jerk"", but I don't use that kind of language.It was obvious the HOA just wanted to keep down the disturbance associated with his Christmas ""show"", but this guy is a bully and has used the bogus ""religious freedom"" excuse to try to get his way (or the highway).This is the kind of ""Christian"" that gives real Christians a bad name.That said, the documentary was well done and I didn't down vote it for content - just be aware the content may make decent people furious.",False

7,6,Unbelievable,maheushellie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love Christmas and seeing the lights and of course decorations, but this was taken way too far. I can't understand why this person wouldn't have just bought him and his family a place in the country to alleviate all the drama and court cost etc., but instead he chose to
drive his neighbors crazy to just get his way, and that is most definitely selfish, so even as much as I love Christmas, this was extremely selfish and it's also not what Christmas is about.",True
8,8,Well made documentary about a bully hiding behind religious freedom.,danielgray1975,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHEAVY SPOILERS: This is a very well made documentary about a family's legal battles with an HOA over a Christmas light show, complete with a camel, live nativity, choir, and thousands and thousands of lights (think Clark Griswold on cocaine) put on in their Idaho neighborhood. Now, generally I can't stand HOAs, and I wouldn't ever live in a neighborhood that has one, and I totally expected to be on the Christmas guy's side, but man was I wrong. I can't stand a bully, and I have never seen a bigger bully hiding behind the ""Christian Persecution/War on Christmas"" nonsense in my life. He was threatening lawsuits before he even moved into the neighborhood, and btw, he's a lawyer, ""thousands of times smarter than these people"", which he'll happily tell you before he threatens to sue you...which is constantly. As a side note I learned he was educated at Liberty University, so yeah....anyway, he's going to spread Christmas Cheer and if you don't let him he's gonna ruin you, damn it!I feel for that neighborhood. They just wanted to keep their neighborhood the quiet, sleepy little bit of paradise that they moved there to have, and it was all ruined by one guy, not his family mind you, just the husband. His poor wife just wanted to have a nice relationship with her neighbors cause she never had that growing up, as she lived in an isolated area with lots of space between homes, and her husband ruined it. She tried to be supportive, but this guy has a my way or no way mentality, believing he's like an American General, surrounded by hostile forces, to the point of quoting an American General's one word reply to the German Army when they told them to surrender during the Battle of the Bulge in a reply to the HOA. He compared himself to Moses according to one couple in the neighborhood, an actual Christian minister and his wife, whom I'm positive he probably accused of being ""anti-Christian atheists."" He had the Three Percenters running around the neighborhood, armed of course, cause that's their whole thing, and surprise, surprise it upset some people, but it's Idaho, so everyone is apparently armed. Nothing says Christmas Cheer like armed security from a militia! When things turn against him, Mr. Christmas says the Judge is corrupt and they live in a banana republic, cause of course they do. He says the HOA's lawyer is clearly a ""commie."" Jeez...the documentary crew must have the patience of saints to be around this ray of sunshine.These are retirees and families with children for the most part, though the neighbors aren't exactly blameless in this whole thing either. This is a tight knit neighborhood, with everyone being close, and one guy tried his best to mess it all up with his righteous fury (and most likely political ambitions that a kerfuffle like this could jump start in the crazy right wing of our current times), though he actually made everyone else an even tighter group with his bull.In short, he's a child that was bullied, so he became a bully himself as an adult, using lawsuits as his brass knuckles and conservative media as his bullhorn. Who knows how it will all end up cause he wants to take it to the Supreme Court should it be necessary. Keep in mind, nearly every single person in this neighborhood is a Christian of some denomination, they just don't want thousands of people in their neighborhood for several days each holiday season. They also didn't seem to appreciate being secretly recorded every single interaction that you have with a neighbor. I'm sure he's a real hit at parties. It's back and forth in the courts right now.I can't believe it, but I hope the HOA wins.",True
9,6,Good doc. Entitled prick.,jameslacher-94035,n/a,16/08/2025,This dude has no idea what it means to be a Christian. He's a poor man's Trump style bully.Most people LIKE holiday lights. He takes it too far. What does he really want? He's just a narcissist.,False
10,3,Selfish & Entitled,klthurbon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't believe I sat through the entire documentary but it was a train wreck I couldn't look away from. Jeremy is a narcissist who does not put the welfare of his own family before his desire 'to be right'. To move into that quiet neighbourhood & constantly bully the HOA & neighbours without any friendly overtures is beyond belief.Move to a place away from the public & residential housing. Treat your wife with respect Jeremy, you gave her wishes no consideration at all. However, that won't happen because you are the only important person in your life. Sad sad man!",False
11,8,"8 stars for the film, 0 stars for Jeremy Morris",mjoyb1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPossible Spoilers: It takes a real sense of entitlement and shameful arrogance to move into an HOA community and throw around your weight in a most un-Christianlike manner in order just to get your way. Jesus would be positively ashamed. Jeremy Morris has every right to put up a full-on Clark Griswold display of trinkets and lights on a property which has no rules against it. It's not his neighbors' fault that he chooses to battle the HOA rules that are already in place. This has nothing to do with religious persecution and everything to do with a grown man throwing a hissy fit that would put a two-year-old to shame. Also, I would like to know what happened to the third dog who had a loving home with the elderly woman. Because lord knows there's nothing that screams ""Christian"" like sending a poor defenseless creature out of it's loving home for nothing other than spite. Spreading Christmas cheer much? Bah humbug, Jeremy Morris!! Here's to a lifetime of stockings full of coal for your bad behavior.",True
12,6,Wow,defiant-34943,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guy is nothing more than a bully. He didn't get what he wanted so went nuts. It wasn't about religious freedom, it was all about a spoiled brat not getting his own way. Hopefully people in that neighbour is ok with the crazy guy next door.",False
13,5,An ordeal to watch but timely portrait of delusional self interest,mike-3251,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fairly well made documentary, which I guess is why we suffered the whole thing but it also had that accident you can't look away from feel. Lot's of interviews from the effected people, with some pretty intelligent commentary about the ""villain.""A sign of the times in that we have a guy who just wants to do what he wants, and the heck with everyone else in close proximity.

15,7,Documentary? Feels like a sitcom. SPOILERS?,justiceme-43462,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSomeone PLEASE make this into a dark, dark, dark, DAAAARRRRRKKKKKK comedy!!!!!I sit through this documentary and it feels like an episode of the Office or Modern Family.I could easily see that faux documentary style mixed with Deck the Halls and Christmas Vacation with perhaps some American Psycho mixed in for good measure.Now the review:Documentary wise, it's a good movie. Entertainment wise, it's a GOOD movie.The movie starts off with this guy you just feel for! We all know or hear how absurd HOA's are to deal with. I was feeling the ""let the guy have his lights and SURE a couple extra cars might swing by...what's the big deal"".Then it got to the details and when he mentioned the camel... ya knew the guy puts the cray in crazy.After that you begin to REALLY see this guy that has some issues. Only child syndrome? Narcissist? Egomaniacal?When his dad(Great mustache btw!!!) said he became a lawyer to basically feed his bullied inner child....*RED FLAG!!!!!*... after that the guy starts to almost become a Christmas themed Batman villain.The question remains: why does he NEED Christmas so badly!?!!??? It's not because of religion and warm fuzziness. This guy has some DEEP seated trauma that he uses decorating to resolve. I FEEL he's recreating/seeking a lost childhood of sorts through these grandiose displays.Everyone who does huge displays doesn't have issues but this guy definitely has some ticky ticky going on.I ended up actually LIKING the neighbors!! The lady with the dyed hair....omg...I wish she was my neighbor!! And the cute blonde...her energy tells volumes without saying a word. Love them!!!Poor Dolly though! Who does that to a person!?!?? He became the Grinch in the end for sure.This should be a seasonal favorite just like Rudolph and Frosty.But SERIOUSLY...SOMEONE make this into a DARK comedy!!",True
16,6,Man with stunning lack of insight terrorizes neighborhood,sammymitchelltweet,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film serves as an amazing example of ""freedom for me but not for thee"". Or perhaps, ""rights for me with and whoopy, no responsibility for the rights of anyone else"".Suffice to say, a lawyer who considers Clark Griswold a real person as opposed to an amusing character one delights in visiting one day a year, decides to buy a house and bring his Christmas Vacation Vibe to this quiet and rather small subdivision. Esq (dragging his poor wife and kids behind him) purposefully move to a lovely neighborhood in order to have more space, evade any city ordinances that may apply, and to have the freedom to cover the landscape with a million lights and inviting every person within 250 miles to drive over and take a look. The lights and decorations are gorgeous. The family gives away cotton candy and hot chocolate. It's quite nice.Except the other families who live in this quiet, upscale, woodsy, snowy paradise are trapped either inside or, if their luck runs out, outside their neighborhood trying to get to their really nice homes. It's quite the scene. Perhaps, more appropriate for a winter wonderland at the fair grounds?Did I mention the HOA?Anyway, our Griswold decides to couch his Xmas bitterness at his neighbor's concerns as a religious battle. He whines something about christians, declaring themselves to be the ONLY christians in the sub division. They are, of course, the very antithesis of Christianity...but that's another film. The wife gets away from her ""bipolar"" husband to join her parents in another state. This is after the right wing lunatics show up with guns. Did I forget to mention the 3-percenters and weapons performing ""security"" for the Griswold family? The wife is sad and exhausted with worry. She knows her husband has mental problems AND loves to fight. The poor woman and kids appears to be stuck. She seems depressed. Clark is manic 24/7.If you want to feel sort of sad about human behavior, this is your movie. I felt like scooping up Mom and the kids and bringing them to my family for Christmas. We all just get along. Nothing too crazy. Just fun.Our Clark doesn't give his family one thought thru this entire situation. I bet the kids are sweet. I hope they have friends in the neighborhood.",True
17,7,first 25 min review .. A small-minded egoist,office_icarus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like any good, proper, documentary an audience should come in with clean slate (zero presentiment towards producer's agenda), if only to facilitate opportunity for audience to draw their own unbiased conclusions, organically -- it's the definitive distinction between producing propaganda and sincerity, imo.Try as they might (and they do pretty well for a bit), there's absolutely no away they could make Jeremy Morris appear as anything else but the bigoted tyrant, Anti-Semite, Black Hat, VILLIAN he so natively inhibits.Approx. 8-10 mins in producers are editing around Morris' injured party-posturing; via L-cuts/cutaways, tightening (delivery) cadence (diminishing inflection(s) in speech), clipping Morris' pantomiming authenticity... there's no getting round Morris has only TWO Modes (in front of the camera):
1. Acknowledging (concurring with Producer/interview queries), and
2. PanderingOnce you're cognizant this (i.e. Jeremy Morris' narrow outlook) it's only so plain what producers/editors are scrambling to obfuscate, e.g. Suppressing those Cues that might reveal Morris' temperament / the documentary's Anti-hero.",False
18,9,"Love Christmas, hate the dude",cyfhwcrc,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet me preface this with the fact that I absolutely LOVE Christmas. I went into this absolutely sure I was going to at least feel empathy for Jeremy's plight, if not taking his side entirely. Alas, that wasn't to be the case. Not without diligence in the documentary making - both sides presented in a balanced way. But it's easy to see how Jeremy made an attractive story - he appears to be the true epitome of an egotistical eejit. I felt the most sorry for his wife, who was obviously looking for a sense of community in their new home town. Instead, she's been isolated with her children in a new place as her husband wages a ridiculous war against his new neighbours, just for the sake of his ego.A real life Griswald - if Griswald was a narcissist. I can't wait to see the outcome of the ridiculous legal case underway. I hope he's thrown out of court!",True
19,6,Unfortunately Incomplete,pacocharte,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWithout actually spoiling anything just yet, it's important to note that the court battle behind this case is still pending and could be unresolved 3-5 years from now. Hence, the filmmakers should have probably waited until we know what the final outcome will be.**Many Spoilers Ahead**Basically what you have here is a disruptive, spoiled manchild in Idaho who - unfortunately for the HOA of his neighborhood - happens to be a hyper litigious person, even for a lawyer such as himself.Long story short is this guy had a known history of hosting disruptive, potentially dangerous ""Christmas"" events at his previous residence which was under the jurisdiction of a certain city government that began to deny him permits for his spectacles. So being the fake and disingenuous purveyor of ""Christmas cheer"" and the entitled brat that he is, he finds a new neighborhood outside of any city's jurisdiction and thus an opportunity to circumvent the permit process and host bigger ""Christmas"" events than ever, despite his neighbors (by way of the HOA) stating right up front that this type of gathering (and lighting) were not permissible under their bylaws. Naturally, being who and what he is, he immediately embarks on a lawfare and intimidation campaign against his HOA using every legal trick and bad faith action in the book in order to 1) force his neighbors to allow such an event, 2) satisfy his obvious ego and lust for attention and 3) ensure that his wife and kids will probably never have any friends in their neighborhood on the basis of his childish and incessant adversarial posturing.Ultimately he settles on a First Amendment platform and cites as his primary piece of evidence a letter that was sent to him by the HOA stating that his over-the-top ""Christian"" or rather ""Christmas"" displays and bringing large numbers of strangers into the neighborhood could, among violating HOA bylaws, also offend non-Christians or those who don't celebrate Christmas in the neighborhood. Never mind the fact that most of the members of the HOA and residents of the neighborhood are themselves practicing Christians. But his true piece de resistance was that he secretly recorded all of his communications with neighbors and the HOA and selectively edited several audio clips to paint the exchanges in the worst possible light and help him weave his religious freedom/pro First Amendment narrative. It should go without saying that Fox News and every possible ""conservative"" media outlet and columnist then took up his ""cause"" and casy a national light on the poor people in this quiet neighborhood. After all, when important context is ignored, it played right into the insufferable Bill O'Reilly's annual whine-fest he called ""The War on Christmas.""All in all the film was well made by a British crew (judging from the accent of the director) and the story is presented in a logical, linear fashion with copious interviews, audio recording snippets, and down-home genuine neighbor involvement. Perhaps the saddest and most genuine personalities to come through (in some ways unintentionally) were those of Mr. Christmas's wife and children. His wife demonstrates all the textbook behaviors of Stockholm Syndrome and my guess is that she doesn't have a high paying skill that she could fall back on so she stays with her husband rather than divorcing him and forces herself to adopt his narrative so as not to do any more damage to her mental health than his crusade has already done. His poor kids are of course too young to realize that the reason other children don't come over to play is that their father has made it his mission over 3 years to essentially terrorize his entire neighborhood and push them to the point of exhaustion and potential financial ruin.At the moment, the case is in sort of legal limbo awaiting the decision of an appeals panel of judges who are tasked with reviewing a lower court judge's overturning of a previous unanimous jury verdict in the manchild's favor. It could still be appealed to the SCOTUS as he insists he will do if the appeals panel doesn't find in his favor, so this could stretch out for quite some time.One thing I wished the producers would've done is seek out any neighbors who might have been in support of Mr. Christmas and his plans, which - by the way - he has carried through with every year anyway despite the HOA's attempts to stop him. It would have been interesting to see IF any of them support him and how many if so. But alas, my suspicion is that there aren't many, or the ones who do don't want to upset friendships and neighborly relations by going against the HOA and bylaws they agreed to when purchasing their homes.6/10 just for something Christmas-themed and entertaining to watch during the holidays.",True

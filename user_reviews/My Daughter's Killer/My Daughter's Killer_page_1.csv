1,7,A father's love,Alpharoll,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough the storytelling in this documentary wasn't the best, this is truly a touching story of a father's determination to avenge the murder of his daughter and expose her killer for what he is. I'm always horrified by how easily sexual predators were able to get away with what they did, back in the day, not very long ago at all. I'm truly grateful that this has changed in later years, and even powerful men are made to pay for their crimes and stopped from harming more victims. I watched it in original language, with subtitles, as I always do.",True
2,8,Bamberski is a Modern Day Hero,saysjenn,n/a,16/08/2025,I love watching true crime stories and this one is quite excellent. It's in a couple other languages but I just read the English captions. The story is about a fathers love and dogged determination to get Justice for his daughter. He went to extreme lengths even when everyone thought he was crazy. I highly recommend this one to anyone that loves true crime documentaries.,False
3,8,Extremely Harrowing,TomatoesareRotten,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's not an easy watch by any stretch of the imagination, particularly if you are a parent. Zamberski is to be roundly admired for his tenacity ( for over a generation ). I'm left with the feeling that justice was not fully fulfilled in this case and several legal figureheads are responsible for abandonment of legal practice - more so on the German side, but more importantly the protection of minors. I really do hope that the beating the pervert received from the abductors, was extremely painful, because he is lucky that was all they carried out.",True
4,7,Wish I had a dad like him!!,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, let's address the elephant in the room that several reviewers called attention to: Voice-overs. They found them difficult to understand. I did not. Maybe it's because I watch so many programs that are subtitled and some dubbed, so I am used to it.This documentary was not the smoothest, but it was heart wrenching. A great ""who done it"" in that everyone denied involvement and yet a child was dead - and in a physician's home, no less.And we've all been conditioned to trust our doctor.There are several heroes in this. And they paid for it, gladly.The last minute is an absolute tear jerker! OMG! Tore me apart! And made me wish that I had a dad like him!",False
5,7,How far would you go?,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"A short documentary about a rather intense true crime story, which meant a lot of story points were skimmed over, but still the main purpose got across. The story was well presented in a doc standpoint, relevant interviews and use of re-enactments and archival footage.",False
6,7,"Compelling, But Flawed",Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou can't watch this without becoming angry and frustrated. The good doctor was obviously protected by his colleagues and dictated the autopsy. Way too many problems with the autopsy and that child's missing genitals. Disgusting all around.The flaws are the gaps in the narrative. One minute I'm watching the interview with the dad, another I'm watching some woman who is taking about investigating the doctor. I believe she recognized the doctor from a sketch as her doctor. The jump was confusing. I watched this in the original French and German.(BTW for people whining about the sound, pause the movie and look at the sound options!) It's that simple!It seems the world over women and girls can be assaulted at will, while men walk away. And naive people can never believe that a prominent figure also be evil. When is that nativity finding to end?Females are no better. I saw an older woman clapping enthusiastically when a law against raping your wife was shot down (the good doctor was known for beating and raping at least one of his wives.)Mother's admonish their daughters that sexual assault couldn't have happened. Women vote against their own interest. No wonder women the world ober are assaulted and abused and killed and men walk (yes, i know women who sexually shakily and advice, too, not letting them off the hook).In the end, you feel at least some vindication of of justice. The only one in this mess who cared about the evil done to his beautiful daughter.Try not to throw your shoe at yout TV as the good doctor giggles his way through an interview about him dragging and raping a 16 yo. Men, people, like him walk free everyday while the rest of us wonder when we'll see justice,Kudos to the dad and shame on her mother for never having any doubt that something sinister did happen to her daughter.",True
7,7,Good storytelling but...,runner140,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a really good story and I thought it was engaging. Certainly gives the viewer a lot to think about regarding parenting and the lengths parents go to for their children. But...the English voiceover does make this documentary difficult to watch. The native audio and the voiceover do seem to be at the same volume and this makes it sound like people are talking over each other. I was so engaged with the film though that I switched to just English subtitles, that was better but found the subtitles weren't on the screen long enough. So then I muted the film and just read the English subtitles. I was personally satisfied with the outcome.",False
8,6,Hard to follow,honeysletters,n/a,16/08/2025,"Only because audio track of the people speaking in their native languages, French and German, is not diminished even slightly when watching the version with English narration. In effect it is akin to listening to two people talk at you using equal volume and vying for your ears attention. It's as if each voice is trying to drown the other out and leaves you not hearing either. Super frustrating!",False
9,9,Don't miss the story,SpacemanBob,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary about a father's 30 year quest for justice for his daughter; murdered by her stepfather; a con artist, rapist, and pedophile. The film is well done; it's nicely edited, so therefore not overly long or hard to follow; however, the real reason to watch is the story. Coming from a father, Bamberski is a legend and a hero!(consider watching with subtitles ON and English audio/dub OFF. At this time, the English voice overlay isn't synched very well)",False
10,6,"You are left in the dark about ""who is who"" during the first 22 minutes",Erik_Surewaard,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I started to watch this crime documentary, I was faced with the original audio with on top an english translation. Since this gives the worst viewing experience imaginable, I changed the default translation to ""original french"" and watched it with subtitles.The first 22 minutes where pretty confusing. You are kept in the dark about what really happened and what the relations are between the people. In my opinion, the producer and editor did a bad job in this first part of this documentary. Only when they start explaining the history - which happens at exactly 22 minutes in the documentary - you understand what each individual's role is.I further advise to watch it at 1.5x speed. This at least gives you the opportunity to get quickly through the first 22 minutes. After that, you can watch at 1x speed.All-in-all, this crimd documentary could habe received easily 7 stars if the producer and editors did a better job in providing the viewer forst with a better overview of ""who is who"" and what the specific events were that led to making this documentary. Since this did not happen, I still give it 6 stars. The events are pretty interesting to know.",False
11,9,Don Quixote's fight with windmills,Dimitra-615-7,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary presents the brutal truth about ""Western culture."" In particular, within 80 minutes, we watch a father's fight for justice against the system in Germany, which often protects abnormal practices (search for the ""Kentler Experiment""). I don't really care about the production quality of this documentary, because the value of this father's story is already immense.",False
12,5,What's with the voiceover?,gzufas,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sure the story is captivating based off the bit I watched, however, the translated voiceover is the same volume as the original audio. This makes the movie hard to watch since it just sounds as if everyone is speaking over each other.",False
13,10,Every daughter ought to have a father like him !!,celesteburman1977,n/a,16/08/2025,"All I want to say is Mr Bamberski , you are a ""IDEAL FATHER"". Parents everywhere should learn from you. It is our duty as a parent to protect our kids from harm, and to punish the aggressor if they cause them harm. You did a fantastic job of it.You kept fighting till the justice was served. I bow down to you. RESPECTShame on human beings like Dieter Krombach. Are they humans even ?? Why did he not receive a harsh punishment???Why to release criminals like him to harm more women? And I was shocked to see that the mother accepted that it was possible that her daughter had suffered from sunstroke. Nobody should have mother like her.",False
14,10,An amazing story of courage and duty.,rxstrick,n/a,16/08/2025,I can't understand why everyone hasn't rated this 10/10. It's an amazing story of one man's compulsion to get justice - through decades. It is harrowing and touching in equal measure - I certainly found the ending emotional.The story demonstrates the disregard for fellow human beings that still exists everywhere - not just related to the crime itself but through the justice and political systems and processes.But it also shows that dogged determination can win through. Many people would have given up. He did not.Everyone should watch it. You may not 'enjoy' it but I think you'll be moved.,False
15,10,Don'r miss it,Luigi Di Pilla,n/a,16/08/2025,If you are interested in mystery case watch this documentary. This man and father of the killed Kalinka is very courageous and combatant who fights for justice and not for revenge. Finally sentence has been done. It was nonstop ride and well reconstructed. Watch it.,False
16,10,Willpower top notch,ljnijman,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerJustice has been served. Touching and powerfull documentary of a father that keeps on figthing for his daughter. Even after all these years he does not give up. The end of de docu was touching. Netflix did a great job on this one.,True
17,9,Closing Line Says it All,hilaryjrp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I paused ""My Daughter's Killer"" only once--it is that riveting.I watched it in its original language and was particularly moved by the (ultimately) international grassroots cooperation responsible for bringing to justice a monster.Anyone who would judge Mr. Bamberski--such as incredibly offensive review on this site--as being ""forever in grief"" clearly hasn't suffered the life-altering murder of a loved one. Shame on that reviewer.Mr. Bamberski himself gives a very ambiguous benediction to his own actions. A few of us will understand exactly what his closing line means. For those few, his confirmation of the road's loneliness to justice is intensely felt.This is a magnificent documentary.",False
18,10,A must see for all,juliahairchick,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot since the documentary Who Took Johnny have I seen a documentary where the child was taken from the wrong parent.At what lengths would you stop to get justice for your child's life and safety being destroyed and completely covered up over and over again????I am soo grateful for this documentary, flawed as it may be.May his daughter truly know how long and hard her father fought to bring this monster to justice.",True
19,8,Grief or Mental Illness ???,JoeKulik,n/a,16/08/2025,"Andre Bamberski is much like most of the grieving relatives of murder victims who I have encountered during years as a True Crime fan, and what sickens me most is the public adulation and public support that such OBVIOUSLY Mentally Ill People receive.Do some research on ""Stages of Grief"" and you'll find plenty of evidence to support the contention that people who grieve more than even a few years for their departed ""loved one"" are VERY Rare indeed. Yet, the Huge Percentage of family members of murder victims who NEVER Get Over Their Grief would seem quite normal from the perch of any uninformed and naive True Crime fan.""Forever grieving"" relatives of murder victims, however, go FAR Beyond what statistical norms of grieving relatives in general reveal. That their grief goes that far to the extremes of the ""Bell Shaped Curve"" technically qualifies them as Mentally Ill even without any further considerations.More to the point, however, is that the more time that has passed after any personal tragedy, the less adaptive it is to a person's present point in life to continue devoting time and resources to somehow remedy the past. What Sob Stories like this one never reveal is the personal costs to truly unfortunate people like Mr Bamberski Who Simply Can't Free Themselves from the past.What really irks me about stories like this one is that they reinforce the belief of those around the grieving relative, and in the general public that it is quite normal, nay even Noble for someone to waste the rest of their life being fixated on the ever more distant past. I submit that if the News Media and True Crime producers REALLY Cared about the grieving families of murder victims they would advocate for getting these poor unfortunate people professional psychiatric services to help them stop living in the Past, and to start once again to look to the Future.However, it seems obvious to me that it is much more financially lucrative for both the News Business and the Entertainment Business to exploit these poor people and their grief on camera, and in narratives, rather than to get them the help that so many of them desperately need. I further submit that ""The FOREVER Grieving Relative of a Murder Victim"" is greatly a Media Fabrication that would not have existed had it not been financially profitable, one way or another, for Big Business Interests.My personal belief is that no matter how great the injustice you have suffered in the past, it's just not worth throwing away your whole future because of it. There is no telling now what personal accomplishments our Mr Bamberski might have achieved, if he could have Just Let Go Of The Past.{ Miss Havisham, where are you ??? }",False

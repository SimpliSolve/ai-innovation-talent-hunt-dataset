1,3,I'm In Shock...,goodwholesomegirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"After everything these people have been through in their lives, three of them (most recently Anjelina Nadai Lohalith, but before that Dominic Lokolong Atiol who also runs the 1500 and Fouad Idbafdil the Steeplechase racer) have been popped for doping recently. I cannot get over not only refugees but people who are on scholarship for the Olympics choosing to cheat. It's disgusting.This isn't a comment on the film itself or the creators, but I think there does need to be some type of follow up dealing with or acknowledging that some of these people weren't who they were portrayed to be in this film.",False

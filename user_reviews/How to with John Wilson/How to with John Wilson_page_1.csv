1,10,Not for everyone but,shelloflite,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's working for me. I like it. Episode 4 is my favorite so far, it was strange. I hope the episodes get even weirder as the series progresses. Curious what direction they will take it. Not sure this review makes sense, I'm stoned.",False
2,9,"One of the most real, refreshing, endearing things on TV right now",Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,n/a,15/08/2025,"No matter what you're into, I recommend you give this series a shot. John Wilson is a timid, socially awkward, but simultaneously brave and empathetic, weirdo living in New York City. He's taken candid footage that he shot over the course of two years (from early 2018 to early 2020) and turned it into a creative docu-series that rides a unique line between satire, exploitation, education, and, well...art.The show was produced by Nathan Fielder (Nathan For You), who in my opinion is the most brilliant person currently working in TV. It's only 6 episodes, 26 minutes each, so it's not a very demanding watch - less than 3 hours. But, since it was all made from the mind of one man, the series as a whole functions as a perfectly structured whole.What's most fascinating about what John Wilson has done here, is turned something that feels like it should be purely exploitive at it's subject's expense, into something that is primarily endearing, heartwarming, and informative. It also does an immense job of diving into true New York City culture and exposing the viewer to the humanity of it all, and the many walks of life it consists of.The last episode ends as the COVID-19 pandemic begins, so there is a surreal and reflective sadness that may wash over you, as you spend the first 5 episodes having voyeuristic experiences out in the (now seemingly pleasant) chaos of public Manhattan, only to watch it organically lead up to our current state of life.I've really never seen anything quite like this, to be honest. It's a very straight-to-the-point experience that is quite calming, almost meditative. It really just feels like hanging out with strangers, in a fully positive way. I heard it got picked up for a second season, and I've got say - it really deserves it.",False
3,10,One of The Funniest Show,mistercingilbort,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved the show because of John's personality. While I was watching the show, I always thought that If I were there instead of him, what would I did? I would automatically judge people's weirdness and it would react awkwardly, they would get angry to me.
But because of he is so nice person and he is okey with people whoever they are, whatever their opinion, weird people is cool around him.
Suprisingly, I learned a good lesson from this hilarious show. Even if I don't say it directly, judging people makes it impossible for me to get along with some people, and to understand point of view.",False
4,10,Absolutely love this docu-series,UniqueParticle,n/a,15/08/2025,"Awkward, soothing, interesting, and funny often! I thoroughly enjoy listening to John Wilson and everyone else talk. There's 6 episodes so far and I really hope more gets made!",False
5,10,Some kind of genius created this,kennethcbenson,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very funny, very addictive, very creative. Rarely have I laughed out loud so often at a show. Frankly, it's almost impossible to believe that it ever got picked up by a network - it's that weirdly, wonderfully strange. Brilliant editing.",False
6,10,One of the most human shows ever,imdanyman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""How to with John Wilson"" is many things. Most clearly, it's a love letter to New York City-- its environment, its energy, its blemishes (I'm sorry but you couldn't pay me enough money to live right next to a Subway station like that one guy does). It's also awkward, hilarious, absurd, nasally, and visually stunning. But it doesn't too take much digging to realize it's a love letter to humanity as well. The range of characters featured on this show is just insane, and yes, despite being a docu-comedy series, some of these people truly feel like characters. But they're not, and that's the beauty of this show.Ironically, even in the final season's most meta moments in which we begin to question just how much of the show has been real and whether or not HBO cares about our eponymous documentarian, ""How to with John Wilson"" is still dripping with sincerity. We see John's continual struggle with his insecurities: the desire to be seen as spectacular, or even to just be seen at all. It's moments like these-- moments with grieving Vacuum Collectors bound by a strange yet earnest love for cleaning equipment-- that pull viewers in and allow them to take solace in the fact that their own problems in life are universal. Fragile, scared, borderline cultists (though ones that are never unsympathetic) in Arizona grasping at straws in pursuit of living forever, humble competitive pumpkin growers in suburban New York-- the people on John Wilson's show are not just effortlessly entertaining given their quirks, they're also all just so relatable given their problems, grievances, and even mannerisms.It's genuinely unbelievable how talented John Wilson is at crafting laugh-out-loud-funny yet simultaneously emotional and poetic stories from what is essentially just random footage of things he sees around New York City. This is a beautiful documentary series that captures the human condition in one of the most meditative (though often cathartic) ways imaginable.People are so much more unique than we give them credit for and seeing people be honest versions of themselves has been such a pleasure these last few years. I love this show so much.",True
7,9,Dry Comedy Brilliance,FKDZ,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you love dry humor, stop reading and go watch.This has to be one of the best comedy/documentaries I have ever seen in my life. The dry humor, the perfect editing, the complete comedy of it all, the weird characters, the heart. It was all there. If I'd have to give any comparisons it would be to the first Borat movie or This Is America. But that would only be similar on the fact that it examens interesting and weird people and concepts.Whilst episode 1 took me a bit to get into, once episode 2 came around about scaffolding I was hooked. Whilst episode 1 was just as good, I just wasn't familiar with the format. Episode 2 is when you really get it and it becomes a continues length of laughter.I haven't laughed, nor be intrigued by odd characters and comedy like this in a long while. It's shows the absolute absurdity's of human behavior and life in general.The amount of footage, and its editing has to be commended separately, as its a big part of the comedy aspect. Besides the great writing, which is mostly dry and awkward (in a funny way). The editing is out of this world. Just having all that footage and lining it up like it's shown is a feat of mastery.Definitely going to watch this again soon. If there comes another season, however long that may take, and it's just as good, its a 10/10.Watch this, it will not disappoint. I can't wait to watch this again with people who haven't seen it.",False
8,n/a,"Funny, awkward, sweet, and surprisingly poignant.",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was looking forward to this series since I saw the trailer. I loved the first episode. It was a great ""slice of life"" kind of show. I came in expecting a weird and funny show (which it is) but I also was pleasantly surprised by how touching it can be. I'm definitely on board for the whole season. I'm sure he shot the whole series/season pre-Covid. I hope this series is successful. If there is a second season, It would be interesting what this series would be like if he shot this during this time of Covid.It is one of the most unique shows I've ever seen, I loved the first episode. The b-roll he captures is amazing, and it feels both genuinely funny and genuinely melancholy at the same time. Looking forward to watching the rest.",False
9,9,The animals of NYC,aarpcats,n/a,15/08/2025,"National Geographic documentaries seduce the viewer into believing that the cameras easily catch the drama and spontaneity of the wild as easily as an American teenager takes a selfie. The reality is that for every adorable clip of baby meerkats playing freely on the savannah, the camera has spent thousands of hours filming everything from empty grass to zoo enclosures to zebras wandering listlessly in the heat. National Geographic doesn't necessarily set out to capture baby meerkats playing. It happens to capture them, and then builds the drama into the documentary the viewer sees.John Wilson uses the same approach to documenting the wildlife of NYC. Because he doesn't know when he is going to catch the human equivalent of playing baby meerkats, he films everything. And then he tells the story the images he as gives him. It really doesn't matter if that is the story he set out to tell. In the process, he tells us about himself, the people of NYC, the human relationship with garbage, his love for his landlady, risotto. Etc.The result is hilarious, and, at times, poignant. Wilson treats all of his subjects with dignity, respect and grace, saving the punch line to aim at himself.Watch it. It will remind you that life is a wonderful/awful mix, and that even the wealthiest person on earth doesn't know what to do with old batteries,",False
10,10,So Glad I Actually Clicked on this Featured Series,meganrogers-43115,n/a,15/08/2025,"Usually, the ""Featured"" or ""For You"" selections are the ones I know I won't like (just feels like they are trying to push them on you too hard, ya know?), BUT THIS GUY is hilarious and worth the watch and rewatch. This is genuinely the series of much needed comedic realism for all of 2020 and it doesn't even verge into politics like literally everything else does! I think he just improv narrates random footage he has collected to generate plot for each episode, or it could just be his delivery of a loose script, but John Wilson certainly provides a refreshing comedic take seemingly about nothing with incredibly relatable actualizations edited together to compose each themed episode. 10/10 would recommend",False
11,10,Brilliant,cekadah,n/a,15/08/2025,I can find no flaw in this series! It's pure stream of consciousness and studied insight into our daily lives.John Wilson takes his thirty minutes of airtime and creates a program that feeds the mind and our daily 'take' on life.I would hope he might do a show on how the english language is short in terms for praise but plentiful in terms for ridicule.,False
12,9,Awkwardly funny,vanguard-54486,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very personal, with touch of geekiness and sprinkled with awkwardness. Very different from what you see on TV today. Really enjoyed it.",False
13,7,Oddly charming,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"John Wilson wanders the streets of New York, filming all sorts of odd things that he happens to see. He then assembles them into the backdrop to what puport to be self-help stories, presented by Wilson in the persona of a nervous, nerdy man who hasn't quite figured out the life-lessons he aims to be teaching. If this was just parody it would lack the charm it actually has, because while it might all be an act, Wilson never breaks character, and there's a pervasive feeling of sincerity in spite of the obviously deliberate construction. The result is not quite comedy, not quite documentary, not quite fiction; and yet oddly watchable and utterly unique.",False
14,5,Meh - I've had enough of this show,GrammarMatters,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've actually watched most episodes, and it seemed more interesting in Season 1 and 2 - but it's now Sept 2/23 and I've deleted this show from my PVR future recording list.The recent show just meandered ALL OVER the place - with no real direction - and it seemed boring, and many shows so far this season (Season 3), just haven't had much to keep me watching.I don't know if John has run out of ideas, or what - but the show seems to have been going downhill for a while now.Today's show, that the description suggested was about theft of packages from doorsteps sounded interesting - but then it got into someone having medicine delivered to help her conceive a baby, which led to how they deliver organs for surgery, and then John said he 'accidentally' ended up doing an interview with people delivering organs (the type you play music on) ....No clear direction and who cares? I don't. I'm out. There is lots of other interesting stuff to watch.",False
15,9,He's a genius,ruthburley,n/a,15/08/2025,John Wilson is truly amazing. How he weaves random images with the spoken word is truly genius. Watching along is one of the most relaxing experiences one can have while viewing tv. Thanks John!!,False
16,8,Great,coles_notes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Previously while waiting ever so patiently for each new episode of The Rehearsal, I decided to finally check out this similar show. Created, directed, and narrated by John Wilson, How to with... is a documentary style comedy bringing answers on how to do the mundane around New York City often with surprising depth and commentary. A definitely laugh out loud, deadpan type humour, if this is your style you will love it. Warning episodes can suddenly and shockingly become very NSFW, but b-roll style shots of people around New York that Wilson are able to capture are unbelievable in the most natural yet still manufactured way. Very excited for more. S3 Update: and season three continues its strengths with another six compelling episodes in the same tone and format we've come to expect and love from Wilson. Honestly one of the best seasons and unfortunate the series has come to a close, but am very looking forward to whatever he works on next, I'll certainly be watching.",False
17,8,"I really like it, but I'm just not sure exactly why",mnhertz26-818-895128,n/a,15/08/2025,"It seems clunky and under-produced, but you eventually realize that it's done like this on purpose...Or is it? It has to be. This is HBO. Right? LOL. While slightly confusing, it's definitely different which is always a good start.The first few episodes took things that I've never considered and made them interesting. It also held my attention the entire time and left me wanting another episode. Those things aren't easy to accomplish these days. Very few shows rise to meet those challenges. So far, I'm very impressed.",False
18,10,Hilarious and heartfelt,jojomalori,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show never fails to leave me with a smile on my face after each episode. I found myself laughing out loud a bunch of times, which is rare for me with other shows. But, besides being funny, it's also very endearing and treats its subject matters with respect, making you appreciate that every person has their own little world around them.I can't recommend this show enough, and although I can understand that it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I don't get how it isn't talked about more.P.s.: Props to the editors who make much of the humor happen together with John Wilson's narration.",False
19,9,A celebration of the absurdity of life,evanf44,n/a,15/08/2025,"John Wilson has captured just how spontaneous and odd humans can be, if you film for long enough. Most of the interactions he has with the people he talks to are so fascinating because you can tell they are real and unscripted. John's dry, deadpan humor is in his camera as much as his voice, and the creative editing of his footage of New York over his raw, earnest narration never gets old for me. A unique and lovely - and often insane - show, definitely worth the watch.",False
20,10,Absolute gem!,thingsager,n/a,15/08/2025,"I simply love this. I haven't seen anything like this. It is informative, weird, hilarious and endearing at the same same. John Wilson is a bright, really funny genius.",False
21,9,Uniquely documented and brilliant in its own right,bajajakshay-36485,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although the narrator is a socially awkward person with cringe tendencies, his nature somehow makes his interactions with other humans a quite compelling visual experience.",False
22,9,Irony is its best virtue,MiguelAReina,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of the weirdest documentary series that can be found. The irony of John Wilson manifests itself in episodes with strange themes such as scaffolding or ways of covering furniture. The mastery of the project is in how it manages to make each episode drift towards unusual paths, which cast doubt on the lucidity of the human being. It is an unusual look at life, a discovery of the most remote places of our existence.",False
23,7,"Quirky and strange, yet insightful and endearing...",tainoarawak,n/a,15/08/2025,"...Not to mention funny, or at the least, amusing. It's the little things. The narrator's awkward annunciation -- If it is stylized, he times it well for comedic effect. The various scenes of everyday New York and its people. How simple subject matter turns into surprisingly significant existential, psychological, and relational reflection. How the visuals compliment the narrative in comedic and unexpected ways. I think this is one of those shows that will probably get better as it goes along. Try it. At the very least, it's something unique you might end up liking or even loving. If not, at least you tried something different. It's worth a shot. I give a rating of 7 because it's new and it remains to be seen how it goes in the longer run, but so far, I'm really enjoying this novel little morsel of comedic food for thought.
PS: I just can't let this one go: Poor Reviewer Fred_Walker. I'm afraid irony is lost on him. His useless review rails against NYC, calling it ""slimy"" and a ""cesspool"" full of deluded, rude people who are all nuts -- and yet here is his profile introduction on this site: ""Hi! im fred ""the white trash date raping personal pharmacist"" walker, your favorite 50 yr old degenerate opportunist born and bred in cincinnati :)"" (I repeat, those are his words on his profile.) No, you're not biased, bigoted, or prejudiced, Fred. And you're certainly not slimy or rude at all, Mr. self-proclaimed date-raping degenerate opportunist -- not like those awful New Yorkers! o_0",False
24,4,Not as good as Nathan for you.,m-76128-42889,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nathan for you had me on the floor laughing through the whole series, it is near the peak of comedy. I really do enjoy this kind of humor, but I laughed just twice during the first episode and the rest of the first episode was incredibly boring. I really hoped I would find something like Nathan for you with this. I don't mind the awkward and cringy humor, but it needs more humor. Maybe it gets better, I'm not sure.",False
25,10,Unlike anything I've ever seen - empathy and curiosity required,tomferlito,n/a,15/08/2025,"The biggest compliment I can give to this show is that I have never once checked my phone during it. The storytelling is overall very intellectually funny and satisfying and fresh. The plot is always new and unexpected each episode and the range of emotions he manages to cover is truly incredible. Not just the range itself, but the speed with which he coaxes the viewer to switch emotions is genius. I've gone from laughing out loud to having a pit in my stomach as these real people describe real problems and real perspectives that I've never considered - or, contrarily, that I've lived myself and find deep connection with. In short, watch this show with the caveat that it requires an open mind, a curious soul, and an empathetic heart. If you go into it with those qualifications I guarantee you will love it as much as I do.",False

1,10,Warm & Fuzzy All Over,jazzywinedog,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was able to see a sneak peak last night and loved every minute of it! I can't wait until its official release so I can watch it again and share the love of watching it with everyone I know. It consists of three stories that revolve around senior dogs and how special they are. And you won't believe what that people at Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary in Mt. Juliet, TN, have accomplished - so incredible! If you're thinking you don't want to see it because it may make you sad, I can tell you that it's the exact opposite. The theater was almost at capacity and all you heard throughout the whole viewing was laughter, collective ""ooohs"" and ""ahhhs"" and many versions of ""so cute"" from the patrons. This is a truly uplifting film.",False

5,10,Best Documentary of the Year,ulf-11065,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI had a chance to watch Seniors: A Dogumentary last night in a special screening. My wife and I watch a lot of documentaries but this was really hit a sweet spot of balance between message and real human emotion.The documentarians were unobtrusive and let each of the set players tell their stories in what felt unscripted and heartfelt. The film follows three primary branches... A senior dog sanctuary, an older doctor and his older, highly trained dog, and a photographer making a coffee table book of human/senior dog relationships. Even within that structure there is so much room given to short stories of the senior dogs that have touched lives. It's a hopeful movie, and it inspires.",True
6,10,What a great uplifting movie,bedney-92850,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gorman Bechard has hit one out of the park here with stories about senior dogs and their role in our lives and in our society.We live in such a 'disposable' society where when something or someone outlives its usefulness, we just throw it away. This movie is centered on the story of Zina and Michael Goodin who have stepped in and saved countless older dogs from shelters around their hometown in Tennessee. They provide a positive role model for the rest of us to fulfill our commitments to our pets and each other.Excellent movie! Definitely worth watching!",False

13,10,"Inspiring, heartwarming and all around lovely",kako-63509,n/a,15/08/2025,"Going in, I expected to hear about senior dogs. I was expecting to hear about how the carers feel, their connections with the dogs, the fosters and their view of fostering senior dogs. I came out of this with a new perspective, one that is really pushing me to look into fostering senior dogs myself.Hearing how these dogs have changed lives even in their old age brought tears to my eyes multiple times while watching.

17,10,Beautifully done,susan_christensen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seniors, a Dogumentary is a beautifully-told series of vignettes about the bonds between humans and dogs, particularly senior dogs. As a dog lover and a rescue/shelter volunteer, I was captivated with its lovely cinematography, the touching stories of love and sacrifice and devotion between people and their companion dogs and of a couple who devoted their lives to rescue senior dogs from shelters and almost certain death. It's inspiring and heartwarming and I can't recommend it enough. Worth the price of admission alone is the story of the amazing Chaser and her relationship with her ""PopPop"" John Pilley, an animal behaviorist who taught her the names of over 1,000 objects among many other learned behaviors. Loved it!",False
18,9,Heartwarming dogumentary that builds awareness of older dogs,mjenki-46773,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you've followed OFDS for any length of time on Facebook, this dogumentary will feel like an extension of their work. But there's more to it than just OFDS story. There's a story about a photography trying to capture the love and wonder of senior dogs with photos and a charming book. There's also a very touching story about a senior dog adopted by a human senior care home. There's also a story about a canine scientist and his very smart dog woven through to show that old dogs can still learn new tricks. If you're looking for a feel good statement piece on a subject that gets too little attention, watch this DOGUMENTARY!",True

It was so neat to learn more about how senior dogs have affected other peoples' lives with all of the unconditional love they have to give - and especially to learn more of the story of Old Friends Senior Dog Sanctuary.

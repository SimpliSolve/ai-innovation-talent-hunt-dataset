1,n/a,"Good subject, I really wanted to like this, but ...",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The one ""but"" is Producer Ari Wallach. First off he turned me off with his speaking mode, frequently using 'kind of' or 'sort of', which are weasel words to avoid making a declarative statement.Then there's the title - ""history"" of the ""future"" makes no sense. I suspect he was trying to coattail Hawking's ""Brief History of Time"" which does make sense.Then after a brief introductory scene the program switches to a group of young adults in a room, like a conference room, around a table, and each is explaining their own take on what today is, and what the future might hold. Fine, that is a good approach.This is a good example of an otherwise worthwhile series that is spoiled by the large ego of the producer, needing to be seen often in the video. As soon as participants begin explaining their points, then for no good reason, we see Ari Wallach nodding ""knowingly"" as a person is speaking. Then a different person for maybe 5 seconds, then the camera moves to Ari Wallach's face, looking approvingly. And it continues this way. As if he were an interviewer on shows like CBS Sunday Morning. It becomes a very quick turn-off.What is with all the face shots of Ari Wallach? He is the least interesting participant. A good producer will try to stay mostly in the background but not Wallach, he seems to think this program is better if he gets his face in it constantly, even when he is not contributing.I couldn't take it any more, a good subject that could be interesting but ruined by Ari Wallach's constant need to be the focus of the camera. It is an example, when you produce a 6-part series then you'd better be SURE that episode #1 starts great and makes potential viewers WANT to see additional episodes. This fails to do that. I did watch some of episode #3 but it didn't seem connected to anything, mostly random snippets from various movies that deal with the future in some way.Sadly, a big miss, it doesn't do a good job of connecting with its purported subject. Also beware of the two quick ""10"" reviews, they have similar wording and are of accounts just established, and having only one review, for this program. While I would not accuse them of being shill reviews, it does raise that possibility in my mind.",False
2,10,The future is bright!,thcteck,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just excellent! Very detailed thought-provoking exploration of humanity's future that is captivating from start to finish. With its innovative storytelling and striking visuals, the film delves into the complexities of progress and survival. It masterfully captures the essence of speculative fiction, offering a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. The cinematography is particularly noteworthy, painting each scene with a palette that reflects the thematic depth and futuristic setting. This film is not just entertainment; it's a profound commentary on the trajectory of human civilization. A must-watch for anyone intrigued by the possibilities of tomorrow.",False
3,10,A Captivating Glimpse Into Tomorrow,danielaustin94,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not often we stop to consider what lies ahead for the next generations. But this documentary? It really made me think. The truth is that there are so many moving parts that play a role in shaping the world that we will live in, and A Brief History of the Future is really opening my eyes to how much we all play a role.The cinematography was shot really well, capturing the essence of each location and individual seamlessly. The unique people that Ari spoke to really shined a needed light on the multifaceted nature of our future. I'm excited to see the rest of this series and hear these different worldwide perspectives.",False
4,10,One of the most thought-provoking shows I've ever seen!,lawrenceelb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I gave this show 10 stars -- for thought-provoking content. Every one of us needs to think about the future and what we want for it. With the Covid pandemic and threats to human life and general state of the world due to climate change, migration, drought, starvation, wildfires, migration crises, and potential and occurring political upheavals, to name a few reasons, all of us need to take responsibility to participate in a HOPEFUL future. Ari Wallach didn't bother me at all as the messenger -- I'm sorry TxMike, but I think it's just super that he put together this show and pulled together so many people to interview re: what they're already doing about some of the world's serious problems. We could use a lot more people who are active thinkers and not just complainers. What do YOU have to contribute to the conversation?",False
5,1,Trite and pretentious,dms-21,n/a,16/08/2025,"This sounded really good, but watching it got boring very fast. Aside from some nice visuals there's not much going on here. Which is probably what I should have expected from someone who makes his living by being glib and nonthreatening to the corporations who purchase his services.It's nice to hear from some of the people who are trying to make changes for the better, but what struck me was the total absence of attribution for the problems being addressed. I suspect that's because the corporations causing so many of the world's problems are Wallach's clients, or at least potential clients.I'm not pessimistic about the future, but this kind of.rose-tinted glass view isn't going to help anyone deal with the changes we're facing.",False

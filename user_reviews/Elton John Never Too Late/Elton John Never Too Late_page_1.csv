1,7,It's okay (I'm a huge fan - didn't quite hit the spot),DirkDiamond,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's a lot of nice stuff for a long-time fan to see in here: new pics, video footage, etc, that has yet to pop up in anything else; however, it was presented and edited in a way that didn't work.There were some nice music choices throughout, but the storytelling elements didn't quite come together very well.The narrative elements were good, taken from the interviews done to piece together his assisted autobiography, but it didn't tell a complete story.I feel it would have served the movie better to be more focussed on the tour while looking back to areas in the past rather more than trying to tell the story of his origins, going on to jump ahead every now and then to aspects of the final tour. Other than the final tour and a limited amount of backstage stuff from that time, it only went as far as 1975.Admittedly, the recent tour book focussed on the tour, locations, reflecting on time spent in those locations over the years, and performing, so I suppose they didn't want to do that again, so why not tell the whole story, in which case, in relation to the final tour.There are key aspects of the narrative that have wiped out the 80s, 90s, 00s, and 10s, 4 decades, but in a way that seems to dismiss several significant strengths. It contrasts the early days, when he said he'd like to be a father, to his last tour when he was one. Basically, it seems primarily to be a way to tell only that particular story - ""Never too Late...."" to be a dad, I suppose, but that's the sort of thing you'd expect from an hour TV special on regular TV. It did feel like a misfire.It is okay to present the contrast as they did, but it limits itself, in rather a less effective way than they had likely supposed.As much as I like it, the new song for the movie also doesn't fit. It works, with reference to the movie, but not as part of it, in the end credits, at least not to me.There are also a few things that go too far. For example, a large section of the movie features Elton performing on stage at Dodgers Stadium 2022, which is already on Disney+, where the documentary is also based. The Rocket Hour segment features too much time spent online with other people. Both segments could have had a much tighter edit, because they lacked the meaning they were trying to convey.It isn't actually bad though, it's just lacking in certain areas.",False
2,8,Never Too Late,petrxpp,n/a,16/08/2025,"A nice documentary mapping the most important milestones in the career of this amazing singer, showman and great pianist.This puff piece with substance is an affectionate tribute to a musical legend who has been a defining voice in pop culture for over five decades. It is a slam dunk for fans of the extravagant piano man.Great editing, effects work and those animated sequences were also successful. The touching last concert in America was a beautiful icing on the cake of this documentary.From its openness about John's struggles in childhood and adulthood to its chronicling of his massive farewell tour, the film feels like a fitting goodbye to a one-of-a-kind artist.",False
3,6,A Safe but Heartfelt Tribute,pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Elton John: Never Too Late"" is a documentary clearly made with love, but not necessarily with boldness. It works like a carefully curated scrapbook, celebrating his journey without too many surprises-maybe that's why it lacks that element of unpredictability that makes a documentary truly memorable. Co-directed by David Furnish, Elton's husband, alongside the experienced R. J. Cutler, the film seems to take an overly reverent approach-understandable, given the personal involvement of the filmmakers, but it also limits the potential for a more critical or revealing perspective. For longtime fans, it's a comforting experience; for those less familiar, it might feel like a predictable stroll through well-known milestones.The documentary's narrative follows a conventional format, mixing archival footage, interviews, and performances, but it doesn't have the energy or visual creativity of ""Rocketman"" (2019), which took a more inventive approach to Elton's life. Here, live performances and old photo montages serve to highlight key moments in his career, but there's a constant feeling that the film could have gone deeper. Elton's journey is fascinating in itself, but the documentary plays it safe, revisiting major events like his meteoric rise in the '70s, his decades-long partnership with Bernie Taupin, his struggles with addiction, his rocky relationship with manager John Reid, and, of course, his search for acceptance and personal happiness. All of this has been extensively covered before, and that sense of déjà vu takes away from the experience.What sets this documentary apart is how it explores Elton's more recent years, particularly his decision to step away from the stage to spend more time with his family. This adds an interesting emotional layer, especially when he reflects on his mortality with surprising honesty. It's a moment that could have been explored more intimately, but the film chooses to keep an optimistic tone rather than diving deep into the insecurities and vulnerabilities that come with that realization. Even so, it's genuinely touching to see him talk about his kids' future and his awareness that he might not be around to witness all their dreams come true.Visually, the documentary doesn't break any new ground. It leans heavily on a traditional style, with editing that sometimes cuts off musical immersion just when you're starting to feel connected. It's frustrating to see that instead of fully diving into a performance, the film often jumps to interviews or archival footage, breaking the narrative flow. The one standout exception is his performance with John Lennon at Madison Square Garden, which brings a kind of energy and historical weight that's missing from other parts of the film. Other than that, the insistence on not showing full musical numbers reduces the emotional impact of the songs, which, after all, are the backbone of Elton's career.Despite its conservative choices, the film does manage to capture something essential about Elton John-his resilience. The archival footage shows a man who's been through deeply unhappy moments, especially during the years of heavy drug use and struggles with identity, and it's fascinating to see how his expression changes over the years, reflecting his inner battles. The montage of old photos-often showing an exhausted and distant Elton-contrasts with the more grounded and fulfilled figure we see today, creating an emotional impact that might just be the documentary's strongest point.Another interesting aspect is how the film addresses the evolution of Elton's voice. In the older footage, we hear his incredible vocal power, with crystal-clear high notes and unstoppable energy, while in more recent performances, there's a noticeable adaptation. His voice is deeper and more controlled now, reflecting a maturity that brings a different kind of emotion to his music. It's a subtle but powerful reminder of the passage of time and the inevitable changes that come with it.Overall, ""Elton John: Never Too Late"" is a documentary that delivers exactly what you'd expect-nothing more, nothing less. It celebrates an icon with respect and affection but doesn't take any risks in exploring the more complex layers of his personality. For fans, it's a chance to revisit Elton's career with nostalgia and appreciate everything he's achieved. But for those looking for a deeper and more revealing dive, it might feel like there was so much more to say-or at least a bolder way to tell it.",False
4,6,A happy ending to an extraordinary life,Vixo_Six,n/a,16/08/2025,"Elton John: Never Too Late is a documentary I enjoyed, even though I didn't feel it brought anything truly innovative to the world of artist documentaries. Still, I appreciate that it was made while he's still alive to see and enjoy it. What stood out to me most is how it doesn't just show his successes but also his failures and torments, making it feel more human and honest. It's impossible not to be moved seeing how far he has come and how happy he seems with his family today, proving that not every great story has to end in tragedy. A heartfelt and worthy tribute to a life full of music and resilience.",False
5,4,Disappointing,mrnickheath,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a fan of Elton (especially those first five years) this looked as though it would be revealing and enlightening.Unfortunately it doesn't really live up to the hype(rbole). It starts very much focusing on 1975 as the starting point. Then suddenly it actually goes back to some interesting bits featuring and The Troubadour. But after that theres nothing new, the footage and photos of Lennon with Elton at MSG and around that time are nice, but they are painted with the hindsight we have now, and not the excitement there was then.Overall it's a real missed opportunity, and it's easy for Elton to not have the energy or desire to do a really in depth multi-part documentary (which his career really deserves), but after Captain Fantastic it barely scratches the surface of his music, there's a 2 min segment of the vile British press. And then boom it's 2024. The whole thing was very bitty, all over the place, not focused and very surface deep.Disappointing, a missed opportunity.",True
6,4,I found myself drifting from this one,mickeythechamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Road to the Oscars 2025: This is nominated for best original song for the song ""never too late"" and it´s a bit of a surprise to see a documentary only being nominated for song, but the other documentaries nominated this year are more hard hitting no doubt but still. This will probably be the last movie I see before the Oscar show that will be on my birthday, fun.Having a doc about Elton John's life and carrier seem interesting enough, but this doc dragged a lot. While I love Elton John and his music this doc just needed to be so much more tight on telling the story it wanted. Why is John stopping his touring career. That is the conclusion here but it is such a long way to get there.We listen to an interview with Elton John, talking about his career and life.This is overall a fine enough doc, but it just needed to be so much more focused on what it wanted to tell. It is a bit all over the place with what it is telling. This was good, but it was actually bad, here is a podcast John is doing, here are some numbers, here are his scandals. It´s a bit all over the place and while it gives a holistic view on John as a person, it at the same time makes the conclusion of the doc ring a bit hollow as it never really feels like that is what the doc is building up to. But I am glad to hear John has turned away from his loneliness and sadness.The B roll here is a bit distracting at times, especially in the beginning ,pictures graphics, whole animations, it gave up some brain rot show vibes at times. Now all the archival footage, that´s amazing! So cool to see all of these pictures and concerts. But the doc sadly just doesn't look the best because of all the mixed media it is going for.The music of Elton John is a incredible and I found myself singing along most of the doc. He is just an entertaining man with an incredible lineup of songs that are all just amazing. Now the new song from him in the credits of this doc sadly is fine. It´s not John at his prime, but still an Elton John song so you can´t go fully wrong.What did this doc really want to say about Johns life? That it was bad? That it was full of accomplishments? It seems weirdly unfocused with a lot of ups and downs with a conclusion that it might have been all bad, or what? Again it´s a bit all over the placeThe cutting from countdown to last concert to the past is also has some pacing problems at times sadly.While I was entertained no doubt I also found myself drifting a bit away from it towards the end. It is a fun enough watch but it has a bit too many production issues and an iffy moral that makes the doc a bit all over the place to really call it great.Oscar Predictions:
Now I only need to listen to the song from ""Sing Sing""(2023) and then I have heard all of the nominated songs. I think this has a fine enough chance of winning since the academy likes Elton John but if it stood to me, sorry, I think I still liked the song ""El Mal"" from ""Emilia Perez""(2024) more. Hope you all have a good Oscar show if you are watching it!",False

1,9,A Worm in the Heart,creatorsahaku,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary will portray the reality of a community of LGBTQ+ across the Russia. This look like a journey of sufferings of their entire life. Our societal behavior's are not open for all. Other's desire decision and thought overlay to another. Never ever think is this right or wrong. Even some time force them their undesired decision. Which is unexpectable measurability. So, judgment should equal for all of the community or entire the universe. Need to raise the voice for all minority group and bring in the front to show their sufferings. I hope this documentary will blow the mind of all community and will reduce the harassment of brutality.",True

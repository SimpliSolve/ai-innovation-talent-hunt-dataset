1,9,Inspirational lesson on not being distracted by a number,kerstenwouter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whereas many dwell on the power of youth and the assumption that young people are our only hope, this documentary feeds us with a much richer perspective: everyone has the power to make, and keep their lives extraordinary, inspire others and not use easy excuses to just point fingers at others for misfortune. Age is just a number, and seldom has this been demonstrated more powerfully. The lucid way the main characters reflect on past, present, future, their roles and their ideas for the roles that others can take is so full of inspiration. It's very uplifting. Especially since they are not portrayed as heroes. Just normal people. Which makes it attainable to strive to keep on living a full life. Heroes are larlgely fiction. Normal people are more identifiable.",False

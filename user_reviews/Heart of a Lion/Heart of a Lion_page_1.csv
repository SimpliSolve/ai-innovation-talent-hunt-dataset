1,8,Wonderful in so many ways,stuartbentley-90743,n/a,15/08/2025,"Such a huge inspiration! The rise and fall of a true warrior. Heart of a Lion, directed by Andy Blithe and starring Aaron Sharp captures a wrestler's passions and sorrows into life and the chaos around it. It cleverly and bravely dwells into the subject matter of mental illness and men's downfall into that career pattern. It's a great movie that doesn't fail to disappoint and such a great story. I wish Aaron all the best. He's a great guy and I hope he has a promising future ahead of him. He's also a terrific actor and does a wide range of performances, not just in the wrestling community. Worth a watch!",False
2,10,Heart of a Lion,r_geller,n/a,15/08/2025,I'm a huge Aaron Sharp fan and Heart of a Lion was an excellent documentary about mental health and fighting for what you believe in. Very good camera angles and subtle editing makes the whole thing looks astonishing. I hope Aaron pulls through from whatever demons he has going for him and manages to spend the rest of his life happy.,False
3,10,Very good,minniebetts,n/a,15/08/2025,"Andy Blithe's Heart of a Lion is a feature length documentary about infamous wrestler Aaron The Lion Sharp. The film focuses on his stability in life, his mental health and his determination to get back in the ring to make a name for himself. I really enjoyed this film because it really captures the essence and feel to what Sharp is going through. Aturn films does it again with another classic. Aturn films' other work are things like Nick Elliott: The Story So Far, Man Up and Veganise Me. All have different qualities that deserve to be seen. Very bold and moving film. One to put on your watchlist.",False

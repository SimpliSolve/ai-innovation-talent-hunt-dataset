1,10,Amazing LiSA's documentary film,Frank_Strk,n/a,15/08/2025,"I did not know everything that could through Oribe Risa's mind behind the scenery. Have the opportunity to see her point of view or watch her telling her story about how she was struggling with herself and how she was losing parts of her life as an adult, and hear her saying that the music and singing were her only support on all that struggle was touching.There is a lot of people fighting for their dreams, watch LiSA overcame her problems and be ready to face the future, makes me want to support her even more day by day, as a fan of her music that is the only way that I have to thank her, because every day when a hear her music, makes my day another great day.",False
2,10,beautifully produced!,samyafairies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was really nice seeing behind the scenes of LiSA's life!! Through this, you can tell she's a truly kind hearted person, especially the scene she thought she would ruin someone's night if she apologized during her first Budokan concert :( i loved seeing her staff members and Jane come back!! Her family and her friends as well. Behind the scenes of her LADYBUG and EB tours were fun too! The whole documentary showed a lot of LiSA's character and her beliefs, including lots about Risa Oribe. This documentary was able to show her emotions and feelings to her fans and others beautifully :)If you love LiSA, watch this 100%!! :) it won't disappoint.",True

1,5,He was surrounded by leeches,cindyrellaexists,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poor kid. What a POS that Melanie Martin is. His mother should be dragged. Holy hell. The misappropriation of his money, the lack of support and direction by every single person in his life is just alarming. It's obvious he was used and then tossed away. Tragic
This was a good doc about how alone he truly was. Why should he have had to ask for help when clearly everyone helped themselves to everything he had.Such a waste. Especially his parents....they are a waste of space and air. It's amazing that narcissistic mother of his didn't want to participate in this doc. Surely she 'managed' to profit off of him only to abandon him when things got tough.Keep his kid away from Melanie and give it a chance.",False
2,6,"When ""drowning"" becomes the actual end of a drowning person",ismihan-nazli-suzer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've got nothing really to say about the documentary other than that it was mediocre but also informative. Aaron Carter was one of my childhood crushes. I never really followed up on him. I had no idea he was struggling this hard. The fact that he was 34 (my current age) when he died; he had serious issues with family (like me); and was alone (like I am now) hit me hard. So many things in common. And there are many people like us all around the world.Yes, we are not alone in that sense. But we are really alone. Once you go through certain things in life, there isn't a good chance of going back, which is what happened to Aaron. The actual tragedy is not departing from this dimension of life but rather being in so much pain from the very beginning to the end. Not to mention being at where you are despite of all the things you are capable of.",True
3,8,What's the ending song??,jazzyplay,n/a,16/08/2025,"Aaron's story's sad enough and the ending song just killed me. Does anyone know the name of the ending song?? Female singing ""go on carry the weight of the world on your shoulder so far you're telling me no words of your own well I've been waiting so long with you give me something to hold on to if you're gonna say it well you better say it now before it's too late"". I tried googling it for an hour, nothing.Go on carry the weight of the world on your shoulder so far you're telling me no words of your own well I've been waiting so long with you, give me something to hold on to if you're gonna say it well you better say it now before it's too late.",False
4,2,Rushed,rubenssss38,n/a,16/08/2025,"It felt rushed - we went from 0 to 100 really fast, and the pacing wasn't great. One moment we're hearing about Aaron Carter's love triangle with Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff, and the next he's on Dancing with the Stars.We needed time to get to know him and understand his story. He deserves justice, not just a trailer of random moments. I would've loved to see more about his relationship with his family, especially his brother Nick Carter.The documentary has good intentions and a meaningful message, but it lacks the depth needed to truly connect with the audience - or at least that's how I felt. I hope Aaron is at peace, and that one day a proper documentary is made with love, not just for profit.",False
5,8,Good documentary about a vulnerable person who primarily needed help,dakjets,n/a,16/08/2025,"People who need to be protected from themselves. That's what I think about when I watch this excellent documentary about the all-too-short life of the artist Aaron Carter. The child star who lived his life first in the media spotlight. Then in reality shows, talk shows and finally social media. Where everything is laid out for the public. At the same time, it is clear that this person needs help, care, possibly treatment and not least personal time.It is actually a dilemma. How to help someone who is unable to accept help? What I think about this documentary is how Carter allowed his most vulnerable sides to be exposed as entertainment. So incredibly sad. And cynical to let him become entertainment. It is obvious that this was a person who needed professional help. Nevertheless, he is invited to post about all the problems on talk shows. Distasteful.It also reveals a lot I didn't know about Aaron Carter. That he was a skilled musician. Self-taught on many instruments. That he worked hard, and constantly tried to come back with his music. But the world had moved on. Instead, there was self-destruction in front of an open camera. This is exactly what I find most disturbing. That people who struggle become entertainment for others.Now he is gone. Perhaps such documentaries can contribute to insight into a side of the entertainment industry that certainly has points for improvement? We can always hope....",False
6,3,Terrible documentary,kat5684,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an awful documentary. Not only the content but the way it's put together. He had a very tragic sad life & it does show this but it's really light touch. It doesn't go into detail about anything. It feels like it needed to be another hour or so & have more people who were in his life in it. They have his ex girlfriend, a few TV doctors, 1 friend and AJ from the backstreet boys. It needed more context about every aspect especially his relationship with his family and how it all went wrong. He had such a sad story, this documentary just didn't feel like it went further than surface level.",False
7,4,Story about a waste of life and time,vanessa-84471,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show was ok, what resonates with me is, these celebrities, vain, narcissistic, self obsessed, seeking constant notoriety and attention from a public who bows and scrapes to a fleeting career based in excess and self indulgence. Very few of them do anything beyond feeding their own egos and narcism and drug, drink, destroy themselves and surround them selves with airhead Leeches. And ultimately the se empty soulless airhead groupies and fans abandon them, because it's all vacuous bs. What?? Do they actually give back to society with all the money and influence they have? Sorry, have no sympathy, they are self indulgent and self destructive and I could probably cut and paste this for all of these low class drugging punks.",False
8,3,Spotlight,Terrorformer,n/a,16/08/2025,"This just felt like a platform for all of these washed up nobodies.Overly long documentary that spends too much time unfocused. Highlighting these leeches that have no clout left in this dying industry. Dude with tattoos all over his body, backwards trucker hat and nose rings talks about himself for most of it.A documentary about Californians, for Californians, made by Californians.It's tragic what happened to Aaron Carter, I would've rather watched a 90 min documentary that was solely about him and more detailed. Maybe shine a light on how terrible Hollywood is, because we all know it is by this point.",False

1,6,"Interesting, but it seems to be holding back.",mmartin64,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn interesting idea, but it seems to be holding back. First of all, the topic could be compelling - the revival of a brand steeped in nostalgia, mostly based on the two iconic players featured in this show, Shaquille O'Neal and Allen Iverson(AI). Famous athletes, billion dollar companies, recruitment of players: the ingredients are all there, but it ends up being a little bit bland.They're given the titles of President(Shaq) and Vice President(AI) of Reebok Basketball with the assigned task of resurrecting the basketball division. Reebok, as an overall brand, has mostly faded into irrelevance. Reebok Basketball hasn't even existed since 2007. However, Shaq and AI are more brand ambassadors than actual decision makers throughout this entire process. They bless off on the color combinations they like on the shoes(the colorways), and some basic design decisions - but the big decisions are not theirs to make. This affects the show in a negative way.The reason is simple, because they have such narrow roles within the company(brand awareness, player ""recruitment"") the six episodes become very repetitive, very quickly. Shaq is boisterous and energetic, as always. AI is more low-key and doesn't seem very enthused. Shareef O'Neal(Shaq's son) is also recruited onto the Reebok team, although he still dreams of playing pro ball. Each episode revolves around recruiting players, designing shoes, and the economic constraints Reebok HQ has placed on both pursuits.To the shows credit, they show numerous players that Reebok is interested in signing who eventually turn them down. Whether the players that Reebok ends up with are they ones they want seems debatable. For example, they do sign Angel Reese. She's one of the more famous players in the WNBA. However, she's very divisive among fans, and she's no Caitlyn Clark, who is with Nike. Nike is acknowledged throughout the show as a behemoth, and Reebok has no notion that they're competing with them. Second place is where Reebok aspires to be.They sign some ascendant male players, but again, they're not on the Shaq/Iverson level. They're basically hoping to lock up a young player for relatively cheap and hope he makes the leap to NBA star. It's the equivalent of signing Nikola Jokic to a shoe deal when he was just a second round pick in the draft. If a Reebok player becomes the face of the NBA, it'll be the result of luck.Again, I'm giving more details about the sports aspect than the actual show. As far as those featured in the show, Shaq holds everything together. His competitive nature makes his quest to make Reebok relevant seems sincere. He is a natural on camera and propels the show forward.Allen Iverson doesn't seem like he wants to be there. There are numerous boardroom scenes where he doesn't say anything. He only seems to perk up when he gets to engage with players, and again, only when talking about individuality. Iverson's impact on the NBA culture is immeasurable, but his on court charisma is balanced out by his muted nature off of it. I understand that Shaq commands a room when he walks into it, but AI continually receded into the background.Shareef O'Neal is the third part of the recruitment team. He's a young man, and his heart is still clearly set on playing pro ball. His involvement with this project isn't so much about his passion for the shoe business as much as it seems Shaq just wanted to give his kid a job. He warms up to the role, but his first few scenes highlight his unease in a new career field. Also, it should be noted that later on in the show he gets a tryout with the Sacramento Kings. The show plays this as his dad has no idea this is going on, but Shaq used to own a chunk of the team, so it seems implausible that he had nothing to do with it.Various other scenes in the show feature a little bit of Reebok history, some design talk, and some boardroom scenes featuring all the usual brand marketing jargon. In the world of marketing a shoe can't just be a shoe, it has to tell a story. A Reebok shoe from the 80s isn't outdated, it's the ""heritage brand.""Speaking of ""heritage brands,"" the show dances around the idea of using Shaq(53 years old) and Iverson(50 years old) as the ones tasked with connecting with 18 year olds basketball players, and how tricky that might be. It gives a passing acknowledgement that these guys have different ideas on what looks good and what's important to them as opposed to the kids that are the future of the company. I wish they would've gone further, but that wouldn't have helped the optimistic vibe of the series.Overall, the show looks good, and it has a few interesting characters, but the sterile and corporate tone of the show definitely makes it feel like the Reebok PR department gave this one a few edits before it was released.",True
2,10,Brought me back to the VH1 days,sumonkakati,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a truly fun and engaging show! From the moment I started watching, it brought me right back to the nostalgic glory days of VH1 and MTV. The entire vibe of the show is incredibly similar to those classic programs that defined an era, making it feel both fresh and wonderfully familiar.One of the aspects that truly resonated with me, bringing back so many fond memories, is the presence of Reebok. As a brand, Reebok was absolutely my favorite during the 2000s, and seeing it prominently featured in such a captivating way is fantastic. It evokes a strong sense of nostalgia for a time when certain brands truly shaped pop culture.Beyond the aesthetics and the fantastic throwback feel, the dynamic between AI (Allen Iverson) and Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal) is, of course, a huge draw and a major highlight. Their chemistry and insights contribute significantly to the show's entertainment value and make it genuinely compelling.I honestly believe this is a great show with immense potential, and it absolutely deserves to go viral. Everyone who appreciates a good dose of entertainment, a trip down memory lane, or simply enjoys seeing iconic figures and brands re-emerge, should definitely watch it. Moreover, supporting this show could play a role in helping a once legendary brand like Reebok truly re-grow and reclaim its well-deserved prominence in the cultural landscape. It's a fantastic blend of sports, nostalgia, and pure entertainment, making it a must-watch for a wide audience.",False
3,10,So entertaining!!!,amyhuntermail,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a great and very entertaining show! I binge watched the entire series in ONE NIGHT!!! The dynamic between Shaq, AI, his son Shareef, and Colin was so fun and interesting to watch. I learned a lot about the history of Reebok and what it takes to get the brand back on top. Another part of the show that was super interesting was getting introduced to the players that Reebok is trying to recruit. I think their marketing approach is really smart and it was cool to see their strategy came to life. I also can't forget to mention the shoes! I love the design of the Engine A shoe. I liked them so much I went online to try to order a pair and they were sold out in my size! It was bittersweet. The show got me excited about the future of Reebok. Hope they release a season 2!",False
4,10,Reeback!!!,jlbcoupondeals,n/a,16/08/2025,Really FUN documentary! Shaq is such a charismatic & funny dude. You can see how important family is to him. His love for his son is something to be admired. All the players the team recruited seem very authentic. Looking forward to watching them now and in the future. The shoe is fire ðŸ”¥!! AI still real as ever! I remember back in the day when Shaq came out of LSU he was just a freak athlete! The most dominant big man of all Time. Me being a sixers fan I remember when he beat up on dikembi mutumobo ( RIP) in the 2001 Final. I also liked all the aerial shots of the different cities. I bringed the show in one afternoon!,False
5,10,A must watch! It's fantastic!,KathySmithTV,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very insightful and inspiring documentary about Shaq & AI's mission to revive Reebok's long lost basketball shoe line"" now that Adidas no longer owns the brand... Incredibly informative! I honestly had no idea he was even bought Reebok in 2007.The funny thing is I'm not even a big basketball fan (aside from college bball), but I couldn't get enough of this show-I watched the entire series in one sitting! SO GOOD.It's super addictive, interesting and fun. You'll be rooting for Shaq, his son and the entire Reebok crew. Trust me. I hope there's a season 2! Would love to hear what their plans are for the brand's next phase/goals.",False

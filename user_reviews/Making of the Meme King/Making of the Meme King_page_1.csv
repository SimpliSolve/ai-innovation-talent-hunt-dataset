1,1,Shameless hit piece. Not much truth to it.,blakearmstrong-21315,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a sponsored hit piece, nothing more. I don't have a horse in the GME stock race, I've just watched pretty closely for over 2 years. This isn't a documentary, it's a commercial paid for by the people who short sold a stock by more shares than even exist who are now stuck holding the bill. Utter trash.There is not so much as an attempt to be objective in any way. The attempt at sympathy for one investor who made arguably one of the dumbest plays possible out of pure greed is laughable.In a world where nearly all media is owned by Wall Street, this STILL rings clearly as a manipulation attempt. Pathetic.",False
2,1,Fiction and not worth your time,deannavaneerde,n/a,16/08/2025,"The people talked about in this are not in and do not contribute to this. Not even close to a documentary but I would agree with the fantasy horror tags. I would think a documentary would have facts, unbiased accounts and input from the people it is about but this has none. I cannot believe money was wasted to make this however the fact that it was rushed to release the day before the earnings of the company one of the main people chairs make this whole production stink of market manipulation and I really hope that at least is looked into. People who make hit pieces intended to affect the stock market prices of companies should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.",False
3,1,An unbalanced portrait,reyraccoon,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Making of the Meme King"" (2023) opens with promise, offering viewers a deep-dive into the life and times of GameStop meme-stock phenom, Ryan Cohen. The potential for balanced insight quickly takes a backseat, however, as host Melissa Lee's evident biases color the narrative throughout.From their attempt to over-intellectualize simple concepts like 'Call Options', to their exhaustive dissection of Cohen's past trades, the documentary's intent seems less to educate and more to undermine Cohen's credibility. Despite his proven success as an entrepreneur, his strategies and motives are often unfairly questioned, seemingly to shift attention away from mainstream media's role in the GameStop scandal.The piece suffers further from its ill-advised choice of contributors. Most notably, 'cybersecurity expert' John Reed Stark, whose insights feel awkwardly out of place. Furthermore, his questionable credibility and expertise found with a simple Google search makes his inclusion even more perplexing.The attempt to visually embody the narrative via an evolving abstract painting of Cohen feels like an overdone trope, missing the mark on artistic subtlety and symbolic depth. This lack of originality, much like the documentary's core content, feels more like a distraction than a revelation.The documentary shines a harsh spotlight on Cohen's supposedly 'inappropriate' tweets, while failing to recognize the community he has built around shared goals and humor. Its overt attempt to tarnish Cohen's reputation feels heavy-handed, especially in light of his journey as a self-made entrepreneur.In all, ""Making of the Meme King"" falls short as a fair exploration of a pivotal figure in the meme-stock world. With its blatant bias, misplaced expertise, and failure to constructively question or present facts, it does little more than muddy the waters of financial journalism. For a man who started his first business at 15 and made billions before 40, Ryan Cohen deserves a more impartial and comprehensive portrayal.",False
4,1,A One-Sided Hit Piece on Ryan Cohen,benjamincleaf,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Making of the Meme King"" is a heavily opinionated ""documentary"" that focuses on GameStop Chairman of the Board, Ryan Cohen. Unfortunately, the film falls short of being an objective exploration of his achievements and struggles. Instead, it comes across as a hit piece designed to create fear and doubt surrounding GameStop's stock, particularly timed to impact the earnings call with investors, which took place the day following.The documentary's clear agenda is to undermine Ryan Cohen's credibility and portray him negatively. By framing him as the ""Meme King,"" it attempts to dismiss his achievements and label him as a mere product of internet culture. This narrow perspective fails to acknowledge Cohen's remarkable business acumen and his crucial role in GameStop's transformation.It is disappointing that ""Making of the Meme King"" chooses not to present a balanced view of the situation. By releasing the documentary right before the earnings call, the filmmakers seem intent on influencing public sentiment and influence the stock value. This deliberate act undermines the integrity of the entire documentary itself and raises questions about the motivations behind its creation.Ryan Cohen is widely recognized as a brilliant businessman who has played a pivotal role in GameStop's revitalization efforts. His visionary strategies and emphasis on e-commerce have breathed new life into the company. Unfortunately, the film overlooks these crucial aspects and instead focuses on painting a negative picture.It is essential to question the underlying motives of those who control the markets and the shorts. The concerted effort to silence Ryan Cohen is a testament to his influence and the potential threat he poses to established market forces. Instead of succumbing to this biased narrative, viewers should seek a more comprehensive understanding of Cohen's accomplishments and the challenges he faces.In conclusion, ""Making of the Meme King"" fails to offer an impartial and insightful exploration of Ryan Cohen's journey and his impact on GameStop. The documentary's evident bias, coupled with its ill-timed release, suggests an ulterior motive that detracts from its credibility. It is crucial to recognize the significant contributions Cohen has made and to approach media portrayals of individuals with skepticism, especially when they appear to be driven by an agenda.",False

6,1,Cnbc is a joke,saviortrucking,n/a,16/08/2025,Most bias financial news network ever. Ken griffin lied under oath in front of congress . Because Ryan Cohen won't let them know what Gamestop is up too . It drives there little minds crazy. These people will destroy anything and everything associated with Gamestop . There paid by Citadel ie(Shitadel) to crush all his short positions to bankruptcy. I would never follow anything these losers say. Cramer is also the dumbest guy on this network or anywhere. He is a liar and a thief as far as I am concerned. You can just about do the opposite of everything he says and do better. This was a total hit piece on Ryan Cohen but he will have the last laugh and so will I.,False

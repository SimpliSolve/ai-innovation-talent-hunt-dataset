1,9,Perfect introduction to the saga!,JoshuaTrudell,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great to watch, and so happy with the representation of the events. YES IT INCLUDES DRS! I can't wait for the follow up movie once this is all finally over. This did a better job in an hour and a half explaining what's happened so far than I've tried doing in a year and a half.Covers the initial bear and bull theories from the middle of the 2010s onward.Covers the build up during the changes to the company and the community leading up the the sneeze in January 2021.It covers the manipulation and the systems used to do so including the abusive shorts, payment for order flow, and failures to deliver.",False
2,9,Must watch.,biotic101,n/a,15/08/2025,"Most of us rely on the financial markets and financial institutions for their retirement assets.Investors are responsible for their investment decisions, so it makes sense to verify if there is conflict of interest or if there are illegal practices involved.There has been a lot of negative publicity related to retail investors. But only on a very emotional level, never talking about the systematic problematics in todays stock markets.This film offers another perspective, might shock you. Experts expose practices and give insight what is really going on behind the scenes.Nowadays 90%+ of retail orders no longer see lit exchanges. Brokers can take your hard cash and you only receive an ""IOU"" instead of a real share, yet you have no real visibility. Wondering why banks are crashing lately? Well, lets talk about campaign funding and deregulation, revolving doors and the lack of risk management and accountability.It is about time people educate themselves, this is the only way to stop the growing corruption that threatens not just the financial markets, but the foundation of our society.",False
3,9,A Great Learning Doc on Wall Street,robertbx,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you decide to get into investing, this documentary is a must see. Learn before you Earn as we say in the retail investor world. This breaks down the recent saga of Game Stop and shows you the nefarious inner workings of how corrupt Wall Street has become. I really hope documentaries like this are finally shown in schools and taught to the next generation. And there is more to the story & I just hope the next saga gets to be told as well. Thanks to the Mulligan Brothers, for calling out the thieves that need to be investigated and for showing everyday people that are committed to see real change happen.",False
4,10,Fantastic documentary,cycoconutz-75297,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Mulligan brothers did an exceptional job maintaining a balance of humor, and relaying factual knowledge while covering an incredibly complex topic.The stock market, and economy as a whole, is a very convoluted subject to attempt to make a documentary on. I think they did an amazing job of focusing on the people that were affected during this saga. There are some huge personalities in here that have done a tremendous amount within the APE community. And now I believe the Mulligan brothers can join that all-star APE lineup.""I grew up learning about super heroes doing the right thing, about standing up to the bad guys, about being courageous in the face of adversity. I guess I just latched onto that idea that we can be super heroes."" -Buttfarm6910/10 Proud to be an ape.",False

6,10,Finally a good Gamestop Saga documentary,nugsymcb,n/a,15/08/2025,"For the first time, we get to hear the story of GME's meteoric rise from the Apes' perspective. The Mulligan brother's pull no punches and lay bare the corruption of short sellers, market makers and hedge funds that have seized control of the US capital markets in order to enrich themselves at the expense of working class household investors. Through naked shorts, failures to deliver, and rehypothecation Wallstreet artificially inflates the supply of companies' shares and suppresses share prices. They call it sophisticated trading, in Texas we call it stealing.For all the Apes out there, this is the one. Our humor, from our brothers and sisters, telling our story.

7,10,Truth,pascaldeve,n/a,15/08/2025,"The one and only truth about what really happened.After the big hype about the Gamestop share in January 2021, there were several documentaries and many articles about what ""really happened"". However, these documentaries do not show the whole truth, or even distort the truth completely. Apes Together Strong is the only documentary that tells the real events and shows that the community is still active. Anyone who thinks the Gamestop affair is over has not yet understood. It is just beginning. It is admirable to see how the community managed to create this film with the help of crowdfunding and tons of uncovered cases of the machinations of WallStreet.",False
8,1,Gamblers mad because they lost,joetrader-46517,n/a,15/08/2025,"The entire ""revolution"" is ridiculous. A combination of brokers like Robinhood making it too easy for new investors and Stimulus checks created a stock buying frenzy amongst mostly new investors. With the exception of a few, most lost their money, and now they're blaming the system.Why did they lose their money? Because they didnt do any research.. none! Somebody, came up with the idea that their were ""fake shares floating around"" and they could squeeze hedge funds and get rich. That's not research, thats conspiracy theory gambling.Everyone in this video has something to sell, or is trying to pump their way out of their bad investments.The market isnt easy, but it's not designed to take your money. You just have to take the time to understand it and have rules in place. These ""apes"" did neither.Grifters! Dont waste your time or money on this.",False
9,10,This needs to be seen by all investors.,zuzuredman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Think your money is safe in the stock market? Guess again. This film tells exactly how the stock market is rigged and sets up the home investor to fail. Shady practices are rife across the market where hedge funds engage in shorting stocks, trading in dark pools and cellar boxing. Sound confusing? You won't be confused anymore after watching this.The doc has interviews from average Joes as well as stock market experts to explain how hedge funds are using the investors' own money against them in a rigged game. Yeah, it sounds a bit tinfoil hat-like on paper, but through thoughtful interviews provided by a wide range of people, the filmmakers set out to explain in clear language exactly what is going on.",False
10,10,Excellent.,will-baker974,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary explains wonderfully the corruption and legal theft of wallstreet from the retail investor.They explain what happens when you place an order through a broker from what is supposed to happen to what actually does happen, but they do it in a way that makes it easy to understand.I feel they sum up the average retail investor in such a good way. Tired, fed up and angry at a corrupt system that is solely made to take advantage of them.I found this educational, funny and damn right shocking.Great documentary and I would recommend everyone to watch this ""ape"" or ""non-ape"" before investing into the stock market.",False
11,10,ü¶çü¶çüí™,frankanthonyoverton,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been waiting for this movie since the directors first shot the idea across the bow. This is probably the MOST anticipated movie about the stock market ever. I am flabbergasted at all the details they put into the movie. The facts speak for themselves.This movie covers the entire saga from 2019 all the way up to date. Plenty of interviews, graphs and all the due diligence your little heart could want. Plenty of truth, but no financial advice. We are retards who eat crayons.Find out the truth behind the greatest stock scandal in history.

12,10,"An superbly done documentary. Funny, clear and informative.",stephengrabowski-54619,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is perfect for anyone who wants to really learn what's been going on with the ""meme stock"" movement. It covers how ""Apes"" are learning about market structure and how that is changing the face of Wall Street. It's lighthearted, fun, digestible and easy to watch- while being extremely clear and informative. There are a few documentaries on the subject you could choose from, but this is the only one that comes from within the Ape community, doesn't have a corporate agenda, and really lays it all out there. If you have friends or family who are curious- show them this movie. It's simply a superb film. Finley and Quinn- Great job guys...y'all are true Silverbacks.",False
13,10,Absolutely a fantastic documentary on the absolute Greed and a true story of David and Goliath,spaboy-31711,n/a,15/08/2025,This was just fantastic. I loved everything about it. I think everyone should watch it and learn something about community and standing up to the corrupt markets that run so much of not just America but most of the world. Finally a voice in the darkness and corruption of greed. It was so well done. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. This is a true modern day David and Goliath story. The Mulligans knocked it out of the park and are shining a light on what is actually behind bringing down the middle class of today. It was told with love and humor that everyone could relate to. I believe one of the best documentary that I have seen on Amazon.Do yourself a favor and watch.,False
14,10,Great Documentary,josh-17466,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved it, well worth the purchase price. It was funny and clever and clear in its presentation of a complex topic layered over a multi-year saga that involves hundreds of thousands (if not millions or more) of individual players interacting in a non-uniform way. Well worth the investment of time and money.I particularly enjoyed the segments by people who understand market structures like Dave Lauer and Dr Trimbath. Because they have a greater knowledge base to pull from they have identified specific and actionable ways to adjust the market system and make it more fair for the people who try to use that system to gain financial stability (regular people, i.e. The poors).",False
15,10,This is exactly what I have been looking for!!!,bghjjzhz,n/a,15/08/2025,So first off I would like to say I'm not really good at explaining to people what exactly is going on. I find myself adding too many characters to the GameStop Saga when explaining it. I don't do a good job at explaining how the market works because A. It's convoluted to begin with and B. I find myself jumping to concepts that are so counterintuitive to what people think is going on. I can almost see it in their eyes. That glossy eye look and I know I lost them along the way.I love this film for how well it summarizes and goes over the basics of the Markets. It does it with humor. How it shows the pain and frustration of the people who were cheated. It really does capture a quick peek into the community that grew from it too. This isn't over by any stretch of the imagination. I can't wait to show this to my friends and family.,False
16,10,Great Doc by Apes. Truth with heart.,benjamincleaf,n/a,15/08/2025,"This breaks down the GameStop saga from the 2021 sneeze through today. You can tell this was made by apes who actually went out to talk to the people directly involved in the saga. Great explanation of short selling and the evils of Payment for Order Flow. Really shows the blatant greed and corruption that is seeping through our markets, regulators, and government. Inspiring tale of regular guys just trying to improve their lives through what should be a fair market. Instead they find themselves battling against the media, government, disbelievers and everyone else who refuses to see the injustice and corruption.Great doc with heart that gets to the truth. Highly recommend.",False
17,10,ü¶çü¶ç Exposing the US Stock Market,alexball-75494,n/a,15/08/2025,Brilliantly put together by a number of Apes prepared to fight back against a corrupt and unfair market.Great insight into how retail is fighting back against the hedge funds and market makers who continue to shaft retail investors.Exposing the dark arts from Robin Hood who took the buy button away.Wonderful overview in layman's terms of PFOF (Payment for order flow) and also Dark Pools and how our money is diverted away from Lit üî• markets.A must watch for all retail investors.Great job to everyone involved in putting this together.#ApestogetherstrongerDedicated to Ken Griffin ü§£ü§£ü§£,False
18,10,Visually as striking as the information it reveals.,acoleman-95066,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Mulligan brothers have created an aesthetically, captivating, fine-tuned information dump of the greatest financial crime organization, still in business today. Ape Together Strong breaks down how hedgefunds, banks, and the government are fleecing money from you, the average citizen consumer, at every high-frequency trading second. The film displays the corruption that is allowed to occur in our markets from a digestible, systematic level of a highly convoluted and vague system. I remember when the buy button was taken away in January of 2021. This film makes a strong case that our definition of ""free market capitalism"" is nothing more than shadows, ghosts, phantoms consisting of price fixing, pension stealing, spoofing, and other RICO related crimes. The film showcases how by taking a bet on yourself, you can hodl forever.",False
19,10,Must watch for every investor,anishbob-53630,n/a,15/08/2025,"Incredible documentary talking about the Gamestop story.But this is about more than just what happened to Gamestop. Interviewing people who have been at the heart of the saga for the last few years, they touch on everything from what happened in January 2021 to how Robinhood works to how Citadel continues to fail to deliver and how the market is really structured.Needs to be a must watch for every investor because people don't realize the stock market is rigged. Has been for decades. Michael Lewis told the world in 'Flash Boys' in 2013 and no one listened.Hopefully people are listening now.",False
20,10,A fine documentary on this ongoing saga,manuelcastr,n/a,15/08/2025,"There has been quite a few approaches from the media to this ongoing event. None of them until now took the time to look at the root of the problem and explain it in a way that's understandable to someone completely oblivious to the matter. I thinks this one gets it, and breaks away from the usual stereotypes with which retail investors have been characterized by the MSM.Also, points for interviewing some key players of a broader movement for market reform that have been a part of this specific issue too. And points for bringing to light some topics like DRS that others do not ever mention.Job's not done, so may we get more of these docs as the plot unwinds.",False
21,10,This is it.,matsegutt,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Mulligans really did a fantastic job with this documentary.It is funny, witty and the most important thing of all, it gives you the information and the whole story that the main stream media and the one percenters doesn't want you to have.Forget about all the other ""meme stock"" documentaries. If you want to learn about the rotten and corrupt US stock marked, watch this. Even if you're not invested in Game Stop, AMC etcHell, even if you live outside the US, you should care. Just look at what happened in 2008. The wrongdoings of big banks and wall street threw the whole world in a financial crisis.

22,10,Financial Education for normies,spprnrfnx,n/a,15/08/2025,"It breaks down stock market complexities, revealing surprising insights. If you buy shares through a broker, you don't actually own them. This film explores the reasons behind this and offers guidance on true ownership. It empowers viewers to make informed decisions about their investments. Additionally, it decodes the GameStop phenomenon, unraveling the complexities and consequences. With analysis, interviews, and captivating storytelling, the film provides a comprehensive understanding of the event.

23,10,Very well explained,kkievits,n/a,15/08/2025,I enjoyed watching it!It represents the apes and all the things that happened in a great way. The Mulligans did a marvelous job by telling the story of this movement from the beginning.What I liked most is that it explaines a lot of stock markets terms in a very simple (and somethimes hilarious;-) way so anybody that is not familiar with it can watch and also understand it.I would recommend this documentary to anybody that wants to know who the apes are.Because it only covers a specific time frame (but a good one to explain the build ups to some events) there is room to make a part 2.I'm looking forward to it!,False
24,10,Must-See,mamariesjack,n/a,15/08/2025,"Covering the buildup to the current state of an ongoing issue which will affect people's money across the world, this documentary succinctly explains what is actually happening behind the curtain of finance and the disastrous effects of a de-regulated market.For the person who is too busy with work to study up on the markets, this is one to buy and watch twice. Many different Americans are represented and explain their perspective including household investors, short sellers, and regulators to name a few.The story describes this once in a lifetime opportunity, this ongoing David-and-Goliath battle, which is currently poised to affect countless individuals in a time when it appears all watchdog agencies have failed American and international investors.Will the Apes outlast the hedge funds and be the harbingers of a new era, or will the lack of regulation and transparency pull the hoodwink over the people once again for a '08 Financial Crisis on steroids?Only time will tell, but if you don't see this documentary, you'll watch it years down the road and wish you had.10/10, marvelous.",False
25,10,"luv it, everyone should watch it",waffleschoc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Its a great documentary, educational and fun. Luv it, everyone should watch it and get educated. I really enjoyed watching it. And i think it will help people understand more about the investment and financial markets and help with their investment choices. The documentary also shows in an easy to understand manner, how the financial markets have been rigged for the last 30 decades against the ordinary investors. The MULLIGAN BROTHERS did a great job with this documentary. I am also very proud to be holding with all of you apes. Also, the visuals , the whole filming is very artistic, i love the comments and the whole film is fun and enjoyable to watch.",False

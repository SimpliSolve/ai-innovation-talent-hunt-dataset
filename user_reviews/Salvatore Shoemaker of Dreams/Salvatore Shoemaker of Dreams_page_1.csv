1,8,"Inspiring And Innovative, Exploring A Creative World That Shaped Our Lifes",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Salvatore: Shoemaker of Dreams is a striking documentary that's inspiring and innovative. It welcomes you into a creative world that shaped multiple aspects of life today.Salvatore: Shoemaker of Dreams follows the life of Salvatore Ferragamo, the incredible shoemaker with insane intellectual talent. By the age of 16 he was off to America where his career exploded as he built a huge reputation in the film business. Although he provided shoes for some of the biggest icons in history, life wasn't always the easiest for him. However, Salvatore Ferragamo remains one of the most loving, caring and well-known shoemakers to this day.I really enjoy the storyline of this film; it's not only extremely inspiring, but educational as well. It shows viewers how you can do anything that you put your mind to. I also appreciate the fact that it includes interviews with people who know Ferragamo and understand his culture. It really emphasizes the importance of his childhood and how that shaped him. Additionally, the structure of the film is really helpful. Using actual video clips from Ferragamos life, plus close friends and family members that explain his history is a really nice feature. This allows us to view Ferragamo on a more personal level. Plus, the quality of the more dated clips still have great sound and picture quality, which gives it a modern feeling, while remaining authentic to the time period. I also enjoyed the soundtrack and background music. The music is subtle and really makes a difference. In most of the montages, there is light piano playing in the background which elevates the film and really sets the mood/tone.The message of Salvatore: Shoemaker of Dreams is to always follow your heart, passions and dreams.I give Salvatore: Shoemaker of Dreams 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. You can watch Salvatore: Shoemaker of Dreams in select theaters now. By Mikella G., KIDS FIRST!",False
2,5,undeserving production for an unbelievable tale of human greatness,JustHavingALook,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had to check who the director of this so called documentary is and I have to say I'm even more disappointed. The guy obviously knows how to put together a visually engaging product (be it movie, doc or commercial) so what happened here?This looks like a high school project: plenty of stills, meaningless pauses, excessive exposition (telling, telling telling) and not enough ""showing"".The Voiceover is awkwardly confusing. I meant voiceovers, because we have Salvatore original comments plus someone else. Why?Original footage from that era is basically gold and the interviews are neat and entertaining, but it's not enoughMaybe the Ferragamo clan commissioned this doc in exchange for funding the director's next project? Who knows.What is particularly irritating is that Salvatore life is so full of turns and twists, with so many goals he wants to achieve and so much at stake and yet... it falls so flat it actually hurts. I mean, this guy basically helped creating the Hollywood star system as we know it today, plus popularizing Italian craftsmanship to the Americans. He was a genius since young age, a brilliant entrepreneur and able to discern (and create) real beauty.How about having reenactment scenes here and there?",False
3,5,"Fit for a museum, not for a documentary",bardavidi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Messy, long and lacking cinematic storytelling, we basically get an elaborate 109 minutes slideshow of the designer's life instead of an expression of who he was. Too often choosing to tell (and by so many talking heads!) instead of show, a Hollywood biopic using the archived materials and family interviews for once might actually be fitting here, considering just how much Ferragamo helped shape the industry from the inside. It is bewildering how this is the same director for films who put so much emphasis on form, as it stretches on from one point to another, without any attempt to create anything beyond an assortment of testimonials.",False

1,6,Angry Round Earthers,xqkpkd,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Because their fantasy is instantly debunked with a single photograph from space (see Blue Marble, 1972, for the classic example), flerfs are compelled to deny everything space related.""2
@vaulthunter-11946 You do actually know that The Blue Marble is not a photo from space, don't you? There has never been a photo of the whole of earth taken from outer space. The original image taken by Apollo 17 was the most accurate, hi-resolution photo of the Earth ever, but the NASA Blue Marble pic isn't a real photograph. It's a composite of numerous images layered on top of each other.Created by Robert Simmon, the Photoshop whiz used a 43,200-pixel by 21,600-pixel map of the Earth stitched together by Reto Stöckli. Stöckli used about ten thousand 300-megabyte satellite scenes captured by the Terra satellite over a period of 100 days. But his image was just clean land and sea, having removed all the clouds.And why are you so rude and angry at people who just want answers to questions about a spherical earth?",False
2,6,"All ""outer space"" agencies are scamming billions off the population",johnfzw-26359,n/a,16/08/2025,"Level With Me - goes into how nasa is scamming billions of tax dollars then lies pushing their outer space agenda for an fake alien invasion which I understood years ago is possible. Level With Me is amazing putting together the nasa lies & how they fake everything they do at the same time msm uses fear mongering to set up the fake alien invasion more & more everyday. Sorry to the powers at be, too many people understand the nonsense from cv19 & more than ever don't trust anything the msm pushes. I also recommend watching ""The Next Level"" and ""Level"" the prior sequels explaining Flat Earth & how we believe the nonsense globe model just because it's taught at school from generation to generation only recently.",False
3,1,Perfect display of scientific illiteracy,mihaimm-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe ""documentary"" starts by claiming we live on a level plane (clearly showing the authors have no idea what level means, scientifically speaking). And that you can't see the curvature with your own eyes, you can't measure the ball we live on, you can't detect it's spin. Ignoring hundreds of years of research and students doing exactly that: measuring the Earth, detecting it's rotation, and seeing the curvature.Then it goes on to say the astronauts on the Challenger shuttle are still alive. As if this has anything to do with the shape of our planet...Just as an example, I'll comment on Michael Smith.... This is the 2nd most popular name (after James Smith)... What are the odds you find somebody looking somewhat like the astronaut in the 35k currently living in US? Never mind the ears and the teeth are completely different (both identifying markers) in the pictures they show on the screen!!!, they must be the same person because... reasons.Total garbage, don't waste your time!",True
4,1,Complete BS,elt-90940,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is simply untrue/false information. It is almost like a copy and paste of the previous one, and many, MANY people have debunked ALL your claims multiple times. When the facts are put forward, all you seem to do is ignore them and/or come up with a whole new theory. For the billionth time, show me some CREDIBLE research done on every single claim made during this documentary. You can't just say, ""Oh, the stars are just filaments on a canvas"" And with the Challenger Disaster, this is not only completely false, but is also incredibly disrespectful and hurtful towards everyone involved. RIP Challenger crew.",True
5,3,At one point it reveals itself to actually be parody?,JayTeamman,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo, I am not sure what to write here. Pretty painful to get through. I heard Hibbeler on a podcast claiming ""you can google everything in this and verify it is true"". The thing is, you won't have to. Most of the stuff is visual - videos, live feeds, archival footage, animations and such, but you can pretty clearly see in most cases where they ""get it wrong"", for example with the ""power boar wake rocket"" skimming the firmament. In that segment, they clearly show they do not even understand in what direction the rocket moves during that footage, completely getting fooled by the lack of reference points in the sky and ""seeing what they want to see"". However, what brings me to say this might actually be parody/trolling after all. I kid you not at one point someone says ""just close your eyes and imagine""... as the screen goes black. Shortly after, the screen reads ""please open your eyes"" to make sure you don't miss anything. Can't make this stuff up. It was fun to watch, i think Hibbelers and some of the other peoples hearts are mostly in the right spot, they seem like fun guys to hang with and have a beer, but apart from that you just realize they are not smart enough to realize they have fallen for a giant distraction that occupied so much of their curiosity because they crave to be in on ""the biggest possible conspiracy out there"" so much they are blind to the obvious problems of their theory. 3 stars for pretty decent production value. Also you could have done without that scene of the astronauts parents ""laughing"" at their daughters demise. It doesnt prove anything and even from your point of view, on the off chance you are wrong, thats pretty disgustingly tasteless.",True
6,10,Excellent TRUE depiction of Earth's Cosmology,slushy-35327,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series of documentaries are one of THE BEST I have seen that show realistic and scientific based and proven representations of what Earth's cosmology truly is. This is not pseudo science, as modern day science deniers try to portray. Finding truth on this topic is incredibly difficult. The powers that be are trying to sensor, hide, block, and misdirect with blatantly false information to avoid true study and understanding. This documentary can be a jumping board to like kind videos/content providers who are diligently seeking the truth.As time goes forward, more and more are beginning to see the lies, misinformation, and deception being put out by the government organizations behind the heliocentric model. It's time we stand up and demand answers.",False
7,7,Good one,misterhorseshoer-83095,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you believe in flat earth or not shouldn't be a reason to be ""cancelled"". The truth does not fear questioning, the truth is truth whether you believe it or not, truth needs no defense, truth doesn't feel threatened. Only lies fear being questioned. We all know in real life interpersonal interactions that when in a conversation if anyone personally attacks someone or makes fun of them or scoffs in any amount that is a giveaway that something is not kosher, and someone is afraid of something. Confident or truthful people don't stoop to such low heights. Any great scientist, philosopher, great thinker, or wise person knows that listening is better than talking and an open mind is smarter than a closed mind.",False
8,1,Same old tired nonsense sprinkled with paranoia.,FilmSquatch,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this one is an improvement for not having a droning narrator spout baseless assertions for an hour, it's only a slight improvement in that it has a variety of speakers choppily cut together spouting baseless assertions and accusations for an hour. It closes with another appeal to conspiracy and some weak fear-mongering.As a factual ""documentary"" it fails on every front, and is more reminescent of 1980's public-access infomercials from various cults (look up the Heaven's Gate VHS tapes for an example).You could argue that this entire series is a successful record of the wide-ranging baseless conspiracy theories of the early-21st century's flat earth cult. It is fascinating how these ideas find something to resonate with in the vast echo-chambers of social media and the way the resulting mishmash of vague untested ideas, factually incorrect memes, and conspiracy theories tie together for the ""true believers"" (who are, ironically, urging other people to questions the liars). In that sense, this film and the others in the series might be worthwhile for current and future social scientists who are researching the way online cults form.For everyone else, this is a bad-faith attempt at a ""documentary"" that's nearly unwatchable. Believe the bad reviews, save your time, and watch anything else.",False
9,1,Offensive,michaelnoahmccauley,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first two level movies I actually enjoyed watching just to hear the insane theories that flat earthers come up with. This movie however decides to jump into a conspiracy theory not as innocuous as its predecessors. When you become so deluded and out of touch with reality that you start attacking families of people's whose love ones have died, that's when you have to stop and reassess what led you to this moment. In 1986, the space shuttle challenger exploded, killing the seven astronauts on board. To pretend that this didn't happen and that each member is alive and well is a disgrace. To create a documentary highlighting this ridiculous theory is an abomination.",True
10,10,Highly Educational,billyphilly-90258,n/a,16/08/2025,Sean Hibbeller yet again has put together another beautiful documentary. Within are things that the indoctrinated mind will struggle with. A thinking person will have a lot to chew on here. Special thanks to the cast. I admire your courage to go against whatever it takes to push the truth into the light.My personal favorite is Witsit gets it. I've seen him in debates just totally dominating the other guy. David Weiss helped me to confirm things about the Flat Earth to myself. I've enjoyed watching him wake up dozens of people. I do wish there was a lack of curvature confirmation in this doc as it is my favorite 100% globe killing proof. Much love Sean!,False
11,1,Same rubbish... Different day.,spamgrabs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Remember, these ""brilliant"" flat earthers want you to believe the Challenger astronauts who died just got moved but didn't change their names. Seriously?Utter garbage from con artists. Not even anything different from before. They just regurgitate the same nonsense from video to video and expect their tinfoil hat followers to stand in awe of their brilliance.Go watch SciManDan's recap of these on YouTube for a better understanding of how terrible it really is.Get back to us when you flat earthers find a working map of Flatopia... one with a scale so it's useful. Until then we all know the saying... Gotta lie to flerf.",False
12,10,Eye-opening,lukerigel,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie has opened the eyes of a few friends.The fact that satellites are all suspended from balloons should be very telling about ""space travel"".You will not be disappointed if you watch Level With Me, unless of course you're atheist. The powers that be have hidden away your true nature and this is only a small piece to realizing it. The true power starts when we as a community start taking back what's God given to us.This movie does an incredible job at showing the facade that is nasa. They're stealing American tax money by the billions every single year to give us nothing.Watch this with an open mind, especially with everything else that's going on in the world.Real Eyes Realize Real Lies.",False
13,1,More of the same flatatohead drivel,rbtree-54425,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fantasy that is FE is dying. And with good reason. All these fools can do is spout nonsensical fantasies that have ZERO basis in fact.This third film is as far from a ""ducumentary"" as the other two. It's unwatchable nonsense for anyone with half a brain.Not much more to add to this excellent review by vaulthunter-11946:""A bunch of conspiracy crackpots showing off their incompetence and ignorance. The first couple of times were pretty laughable.The joke stops being funny the third time.Because their fantasy is instantly debunked with a single photograph from space (see Blue Marble, 1972, for the classic example), flerfs are compelled to deny everything space related. To them, there's no such thing as space. The stars are just spots on the ""firmament"", the sun and moon are so close that planes are in danger of crashing in to them (or they're illusions, or they're also just lights on the firmament, or anything else but the truth). Every video, every photo, is a CGI fake (even the ones so old that they predate CGI). Satellites obviously don't exist, they're either held up with weather balloons or they're faked with ground-based systems, including a network of oceanic buoys to explain how ships can use GPS when far from land. The ad hoc nonsense, often contradicting itself piles higher and deeper.Moon landing deniers, BTW, hate them for stealing their work and tying it to even stupider nonsense.And then there's Challenger. For those out of the loop, that's the space shuttle that exploded in 1986, killing seven astronauts.But since ""space is fake"", the flerfs have to convince themselves that the disaster was fake. And so they've decided that those astronauts were never in the shuttle, and are still alive under fake identities. And they've picked out a few people who they've decided are those fake identities.Some of them are completely unrelated people who look kind of similar, if your glasses are smudged, and have similar names. A couple are siblings of the departed.The ""identification"" requires the idiotic assumption that the mysterious ""They"" who orchestrate these conspiracies were dumb enough to create entire new identities for the dead astronauts, but for some reason gave them the same names, or change only their first name and pose as their own fictional brother.And they proceed to harass these people, trying to get them to ""admit"" to their part in the idiotic ""conspiracy"". And that's a substantial part of this video. Footage of them harassing people who have no connection to anything and just want to live their lives, or worse, people who lost a close relative and are now being accused of faking the whole thing.A despicable thing to do at all. But worse to film it and publicise it, and implicitly encourage others to likewise harass the unfortunate targets.These vermin are proud of their harassment. They shouldn't be. This is beyond any standard of decency""",False
14,10,The perfect film,thetracefork,n/a,16/08/2025,"We live in a society that refuses to question the narrative. It's a breath of fresh air to see such a high quality production film. These are the thought provoking concepts you won't find anywhere else. Hibbeler and his team understand the vast difference between real provable science and new-age pseudoscience garbage. The film is great because it involves so many successful people who have risked it all to shut down the global lie. Earth is not what we've been told and the controllers do not want this film to get into the hands of free-thinkers. High Resolution, informative, intriguing 10/10.",False
15,7,On the right track but a few missteps,perreo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thanks to all involved for continuing the fight against the 500 years of brainwashing and nonsense that is the utterly wrong heliocentric and spinning globe-Earth cosmology theory. Movies and media like this will become more common and prominent as the blunders and deceit filters into the wider consciousness. Having said that, this documentary has some dubious material that could have been discarded. The last two entries in the series probably paint a fairer picture of the situation Not sure all of the topics here needed to be included. Still, overall fine effort, let's keep going til eveeryone figures out the earth isn't a spinning ball shooting through a vacuum-space millions of miles a day with half of us upside down on the opposite side of a ball to the other half!",False
16,1,Laughably wrong....,resipsaloquiteractual,n/a,16/08/2025,"If this had been presented as a satire, it would work. Sadly, they think this rubbish is true. I've never seen such a twisted, border-line insane take on science.How this currently as a four star rating is a mind-numbing mystery. It's proof of how many uneducated, naive and gullible people there are who will believe patently false nonsense.Every true scientist should be posting reviews, although this is so ridiculous as to not even require debunking. Why someone would chose to believe something that can be proved incorrect through a variety of real-world observations without scientific instruments is shocking.",False
17,10,"Eye-opening, life-changing",bigtiddiesforlife,n/a,16/08/2025,"At first, one may consider this the most ridiculous thing in the worldBut while you continue watching it, you start to question yourself things you would have never thought before. Is this world as we know it... The way we've been told?Is everything we've learned so far... Fake? Or half-true? How would you feel you were to discover the truth?Mohammed Ali once said a man who sees the world at his 50s the same way as in his 20s has wasted 30 years of his life...So go ahead and find the truth.

18,10,Flat out it was fantastic,brkzhrqzzq,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hibbler has done it again! Another great film on the reality of the realm we live in. It's refreshing to see folks like this putting in so much effort to get the truth out there. This man must have some immensely deep wells of motivation to be able to continuously put out well-made, polished content like this. There are quite a few guests speaking in this film, people from all walks of life and from all over the world. The truth of this reality is self-evident, seen and experienced with our own senses. No amount of posturing or trickery can change this for those who have eyes to see. We have been robbed of our cultures and our history, but we are collectively waking up to the truth.",False
19,10,Best one yet,mariuscnrd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Covered the big topics very, well. Amazing how much you covered in such a short time. Great collaboration. The start was awesome, that was new for me. It is definitely a unique film/documentary that covers issues rarely covered. Compared to a national geographic film on the same topic, this one is a much better piece. Great cinematics, use of drone footage, excellent camera work and great sound with lots of music I didn't even know exist. The way everything is put together is nothing short of superb. Hibbelar is a very talented man and is even greater at bringing the best people together. Loved it.",False
20,10,Great documentary,losrajvosa,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI recomended highly to watch it , it is truly eye opening and truth teller at this lieing times all arround us literaly everywhere just like we all live in idiocracy movie. 9) Engineer, W. Winckler was published in the Earth
Review regarding the Earth's supposed curvature, stating,
""As an engineer of many years standing, I saw that this
absurd allowance is only permitted in school books. No
engineer would dream of allowing anything of the kind. I
have projected many miles of railways and many more of
canals and the allowance has not even been thought of,
much less allowed for. This allowance for curvature means
this - that it is 8"" for the first mile of a canal, and increasing
at the ratio by the square of the distance in miles; thus a
small navigable canal for boats, say 30 miles long, will
have, by the above rule an allowance for curvature of 600
feet. Think of that and then please credit engineers as not
being quite such fools. Nothing of the sort is allowed. We
no more think of allowing 600 feet for a line of 30 miles of
railway or canal, than of wasting our time trying to square
the circle""
10) The London and Northwestern Railway forms a straight
line 180 miles long between London and Liverpool. The
railroad's highest point, midway at Birmingham station, is
only 240 feet above sea-level. If the world were actually a
globe, however, curving 8 inches per mile squared, the 180
mile stretch of rail would form an arc with the center point
at Birmingham raising over a mile, a full 5,400 feet above
London and Liverpool.11) A surveyor and engineer of thirty years published in the
Birmingham Weekly Mercury stated, ""I am thoroughly
acquainted with the theory and practice of civil engineering.However bigoted some of our professors may be in the
theory of surveying according to the prescribed rules, yet it
is well known amongst us that such theoretical
measurements are INCAPABLE OF ANY PRACTICAL
ILLUSTRATION. All our locomotives are designed to run
on what may be regarded as TRUE LEVELS or FLATS.There are, of course, partial inclines or gradients here and
there, but they are always accurately defined and must be
carefully traversed. But anything approaching to eight
inches in the mile, increasing as the square of the distance,
COULD NOT BE WORKED BY ANY ENGINE THAT WAS
EVER YET CONSTRUCTED. Taking one station with
another all over England and Scotland, it may be stated that
all the platforms are ON THE SAME RELATIVE LEVEL.The distance between Eastern and Western coasts of
England may be set down as 300 miles. If the prescribed
curvature was indeed as represented, the central stations at
Rugby or Warwick ought to be close upon three miles higher
than a chord drawn from the two extremities. If such was
the case there is not a driver or stoker within the Kingdom
that would be found to take charge of the train. We can only
laugh at those of your readers who seriously give us credit
for such venturesome exploits, as running trains round
spherical curves. Horizontal curves on levels are dangerous
enough, vertical curves would be a thousand times worse,
and with our rolling stock constructed as at present
physically impossible.""
12) The Manchester Ship Canal Company published in the
Earth Review stated, ""It is customary in Railway and Canal
constructions for all levels to be referred to a datum which
is nominally horizontal and is so shown on all sections. It is
not the practice in laying out Public Works to make
allowances for the curvature of the earth.",True
21,9,Surprised,memphismim,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I'm not sure about the conclusion, this movie is really well done, for such a low budget film. I think anyone who honestly, approaches the work, with an open mind, will at least be intrigued, and come away questioning everything they thought they new.The lighting is not perfect in some scenes, the audio can be a little uneven, but there is a lot of outdoor, real locations, pretty brave move by the director.The participants are the real hidden gems in my opinion, they each add their own flavor, to what I found really entertaining, and that's what it's about.I was actually surprised how the story came together, and must admit, I have a lot of questions.Great job!",False

Let's expose the Vatican, City of London and District of Columbia. Let's expose that people already lived in America. Millions. Let's expose all the plans behind 2030 and all the agendas. Expose all history is fake and is His-Story. Expose words and meaning behind our language. Tell people how to awaken their third eye and their chakras. Governments are a means to control.

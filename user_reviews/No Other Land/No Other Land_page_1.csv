1,9,The most important documentary of this moment,TheVictoriousV,n/a,15/08/2025,"No Other Land is one of the most important documentaries of this present moment -- it is a shame (but not a surprise) that it's become somewhat difficult to find/see anywhere.Like 20 Days in Mariupol did with Russia's 2022 siege of Mariupol in Ukraine, it speaks to us bluntly right from the eye of the storm, that storm being the Israeli occupation of Palestine (chiefly the demolition of the filmmaker's home region in the West Bank, in this case). It may seem infantile to use terms like ""pure evil"", but there's basically no other way to describe some of what we witness in this footage.It also involves a fascinating friendship, as Palestinian activist Basel Adra, who documents the gradual ruination of his home in Masafer Yatta on video, finds a connection with an Israeli journalist named Yuval Abraham, who wishes to help him, even as it becomes clear he can never quite understand his struggle. Nevertheless, their material became this film; both are credited as directors and writers alongside Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor, who is also Israeli.Why this film would be inconvenient for Israel-sympathizers is obvious (when the film began to receive awards recognition, the IDF promptly surrounded Adra's home). But its central friendship -- and the fact that the friend in question demonstrably agreed to help get this movie made -- likely makes it inconvenient for those who use this conflict as an excuse for anti-Semitism, asserting that any Israeli person or even any Jewish person is fair game to brand a monster, if not outright kill.Fact is, there are plenty like Abraham and Szor. For as much as Zionists like to insist that all ""true"" Jewish people ARE, in fact, on board with the whole Zionism thing (and in so doing they effectively agree with the aforementioned anti-Semites), there are several Jewish people and indeed Israeli citizens who are aghast at the idea that their ancestors survived The Holocaust only for the descendants to rework ""Never again"" into ""Never again... to us"".",False
2,8,A film to make your blood boil,rubenm,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJust imagine. The house you live in, being destroyed by bulldozers. Imagine having the choice: living in a cave or building a new house. Imagine having to watch the new house being destroyed by bulldozers too.This is what is being documented in 'No Other Land', and it makes your blood boil. The film shows how a village on the West Bank is being systematically destroyed by the Israeli occupiers. Its inhabitants resist, organize protests and start a court case, but nothing can stop the process.The film hits you like a punch in the stomach. A lot of the footage is filmed by small handheld cameras or smartphones, which gives it a genuine authenticity. Another strength of the film is that it not only documents the demolishing of the buildings, but also the friendship between the Palestine activist Basel and the Israeli journalist Yuval, who wants to raise public awareness about the injustice. Although friendship is perhaps not the right word. They are colleagues and brothers-in-arms, but the difference between them is always palpable. ""You have to learn to lose"", Basel tells Yuval when the journalist notices that there is not much interest in his stories. ""We have been fighting for decades, you can't change the situation in a few days"".Yuval's involvement gives the film an extra layer. For the Palestinians, he will always be a 'yehudi' from the other side, who can go home to his comfortable life. But for his fellow Israeli's, he is sympathizing with the enemy, and they accuse him for his involvement in Palestinian activism.The film contains peaceful moments, when Basel and Yuval discuss the situation by an open fire or smoke a hookah, but also shocking images of villagers being shot down, in one case paralysing the victim and reducing him to a miserable life without proper care.The film has an enormous emotional impact. It reminded me of similar documentaries like 'For Sama' or '20 days in Mariopul'. The film makers stopped filming in october 2023, when everything changed in Israel and Palestine. Of course, the events of the last 12 months give the film an extra urgency. We know that the village is a symbol of so much more injustice, bloodshed and cruelty. And we also know that now not only houses are being destroyed, but the lives of thousands of innocent people.",True
3,10,One of the most urgent and timely documentaries of 2024,felipefollador,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary, created by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, captures the destruction of villages in Masafer Yatta, Palestine, and explores the alliance and friendship that forms between Palestinian activist Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham.This is one of the most urgent and timely documentaries of the year, and arguably one of the best.Filmed between 2019 and 2023, the film is the result of a collaboration between four filmmakers-many of whom are stepping behind the camera for the first time. Their coming together to create this work is an act of resistance in itself, showing how people on different sides of the conflict can join forces to expose and challenge systemic injustices. The filmmakers' determination underscores the power of storytelling in the face of oppression.The film is deeply distressing to watch, as it captures the utter disregard shown to the Palestinian families who have lived in Masafer Yatta for centuries. These families are being forcibly displaced, their homes destroyed to expand Israeli military training camps, designated ""Firing Zone 918."" The disregard for their rights and history is deeply disturbing.The relationship between Basel and Yuval is a highlight of the film-not because of any perceived improbability of an Israeli-Palestinian friendship, but because of the genuine mutual support and solidarity they have offered each other through years of unrelenting challenges.As violence and tensions in Israel and Palestine have escalated since 2023, the documentary provides a vital lens into the human cost of military policies in the region. A stark portrait of the daily struggles of Palestinian communities subjected to Israeli home demolitions, forced displacement, and restrictions on movement.This documentary is essential viewing, both for its profound story of human resilience and its urgent call for justice. It should be required viewing for anyone seeking to understand the harsh realities of Palestine.",True
4,10,Bearing Witness,pinkmanboy,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary ""No Other Land"" is an open wound, a visceral experience that goes beyond mere viewing to drag us, unapologetically, into the heart of a conflict where human dignity is methodically crushed by cold, bureaucratic machinery. Directed by a team of Israeli and Palestinian filmmakers (Rachel Szor, Hamdan Ballal, Yuval Abraham, and Basel Adra), the film doesn't offer comforting solutions or conciliatory narratives. Instead, it delivers an unflinching portrayal of life in Masafer Yatta, a Palestinian community living under the constant shadow of destruction.The film's power lies in its ability to capture the absurdity of brutality with harrowing clarity. A woman screams for her daughters as her home is demolished, only to be met with a cold, ""It doesn't matter."" That phrase echoes not just as a symbol of dehumanization in the conflict but as a cruel reminder of the disconnect between oppressor and oppressed. These moments of chilling indifference punctuate the film, each more gut-wrenching than the last, as the directors build a narrative where pain is constant, but resistance is inevitable.Basel Adra, one of the central figures, emerges as a living symbol of Masafer Yatta's resilience. The son of activists, his life has been shaped by the conflict, and his footage of demolitions and attacks serves as both documentation and defiance. His relationship with Yuval Abraham, an Israeli journalist accompanying him in the struggle, adds layers of complexity to the film. There's a fascinating dynamic between them, marked by their contrasting perspectives and experiences. While Yuval approaches the conflict as an outraged observer, Basel experiences every moment as a fight for survival. This disparity never becomes antagonistic; instead, it reinforces the documentary's authenticity and the stakes at hand.The aesthetic choices in ""No Other Land"" are another of its strengths. Chaotic scenes, captured with shaky cameras and improvised angles, are juxtaposed with contemplative shots that reveal the fragility and beauty of everyday life in Masafer Yatta. Images of children playing in a park that's about to be destroyed or Basel's father's solitary gas station act as poetic breaths amid the storm. These moments not only humanize the region's inhabitants but underline the tragedy of a world under constant threat of erasure.While the narrative is deeply political, ""No Other Land"" avoids rhetoric or didactic monologues. It presents the facts with brutal clarity and leaves us to grapple with the emotions they evoke. When soldiers pour cement into a well or a man is shot while trying to protect his generator, the outrage doesn't need to be spelled out-it's palpable. This is a film that understands that, in situations like this, images speak louder than any argument.At the same time, the documentary doesn't shy away from tough questions. What does it mean to rebuild homes repeatedly, knowing they'll be destroyed again? How sustainable is resistance in a system that seems relentlessly cruel? These questions linger in every demolition and reconstruction, every cry of despair, and every hollow gaze of soldiers blindly following orders.But ""No Other Land"" is not just a portrait of despair. It's also an ode to resilience, even when that resilience is steeped in pain and exhaustion. The people of Masafer Yatta keep rebuilding, keep fighting, even when victory feels unreachable. This duality-the tragedy of the situation and the immeasurable strength of those who resist-is what makes the documentary so powerful and so necessary.Ultimately, ""No Other Land"" is a plea for us not to grow numb to cruelty, to reject the notion of ""It doesn't matter"" as a response to the world's injustices. It's a film that challenges us to look, to feel, and, above all, to care. It doesn't offer solutions, but perhaps it doesn't need to. Simply bearing witness-in all its complexity and discomfort-is a first step toward refusing silence.",True
5,8,An unflinching portrait of settler-colonialism,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know the route to a happy Middle East any more than the next person; that it will never be achieved if Israel continues on its current path seems certain. Defenders of the Israeli state dislike the use of the term ""settler-colonialism"" to describe what has been happening, but it's hard to find an alternative for the bleak reality shown in this film, a collaboration between a Palestinian facing eviction from the family land in the West Bank and a sympathetic Israeli. That collaboration is perhaps the only heartening thing in an otherwise deeply depressing, but important, film. Tellingly, it was all shot before autumn 2023; it's hard to believe that anything has got better since then.",False
6,8,"Impressive and unique footage showing how Israel evicts villagers in the West Bank, turning the law around to ignore the rightful ownership of the people living there",JvH48,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSaw this at the Movies That Matter 2024 filmfestival in The Hague. Impressive and unique footage about what happens on the West Bank, particularly urgent nowadays when our newspapers and talk shows are focused on Gaza. As a logical consequence, the West Bank does not really exist for us, despite many similarities. In both areas, Israelian politics are steadily turning the law against the people living there. And we, at a safe distance, let it be and easily ignore the suffering and the constant humiliation of the Palestinians.What happens in the West Bank is rarely shown on TV or written about in newspapers. The footage in the movie at hand is unique and exposes how Israel turns the law around. They completely disregard the villagers and their rightful ownership, forcing complete households to move to caves, short of better options, while their houses are bulldozered one by one. Each time the army and bulldozers arrive, it is uncertain until the last moment which houses are to be destroyed.The soldiers who accompany the bulldozers are briefed that the people live there in illegally built houses. It is thus useless to yell at the soldiers and to call on their conscience, as they are spineless tools. The soldiers repeatedly say to people resisting that they only had to ask for an army permit, and all would be solved (but villagers know, and we know, that such a permit will never be issued).The politics behind the forced evacuation is appalling. We learn from secret documents that annexing that piece of land was not really intended to create a training area for the army, as repeatedly told by the invaders. Instead, its only purpose was to prevent the village from expanding.An issue that came about in the Q&A was if and how this footage can serve in a judicial investigation to establish war crimes against the Palestinians. New to me was that a considerable part of the soldiers involved are international and not native Israelian. Based on this material, they can be identified. Their acts can be prosecuted as it is generally deemed unlawful how Israel comes to these eviction orders.During the Q&A a very different important question was asked: how do you explain all this to the kids?? Denial is impossible, as they see it happen before their eyes. Anyway, it all leaves us speechless when we leave the venue after the screening. It happened for many years already, and still happens as shown here. It is even reinforced since the Gaza war, when nearby living settlers are even more than happy to help with the evictions, feeling entitled to revenge after 7th of October.",True
7,10,What the people want.,imdbfan-2143139986,n/a,15/08/2025,"Incredibly hard to watch, but vital. The viewpoint we in North America are not allowed to see. Documentation of the devastation wrought by modern day colonialism, which needs to remembered, and recognized. History is being made and it the film makers are telling the side of the oppressed, who have been ignored for too long. This film is a complete embodiment of what the people need to see and hear. The truth in this movie is unwavering and its depicted with live footage throughout the entire documentary, leaving no other conclusions to be made but the one that is in front of your eyes. Captivating for any fan of real life documentaries, this is as real as it gets.",False
8,10,A masterpiece,aushro,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerCentering the relationship at the movie's core is its smartest choice, as it portrays a relatable, awkward friendship. This friendship's attempts to prevent the Israeli army from destroying a local school, despite facing assault from soldiers, highlight the importance of solidarity. The film combines dangerous phone footage, beautifully framed village scenes, and historical news reports, creating a powerful mix. While some discussions seem staged, the emotions expressed feel genuine. This blend offers ample time to reflect on the depicted horror, which has worsened since filming. No Other Land is a crucial documentary, impossible to watch without connecting to the suffering it portrays-a devastating achievement.The filmmakers skillfully navigate the complexities of their subject matter, ensuring that the voices of the affected community resonate throughout the narrative. By focusing on individual stories within the larger context of conflict, they manage to humanize a situation often reduced to statistics and headlines. Each character brings a unique perspective, allowing viewers to form a deeper understanding of the personal toll that geopolitical tensions impose on everyday lives.In moments of levity amidst the despair, the film captures the humanity that persists, even in dire circumstances. This balance serves as an important reminder of the resilience of the human spirit, showcasing how laughter, camaraderie, and hope can thrive in the face of adversity. The authenticity of these relationships is especially highlighted during moments of vulnerability, where the characters openly share their fears, dreams, and aspirations, contrasting sharply with the chaos surrounding them.The cinematography, too, plays a pivotal role in immersing the audience in the reality of the village life under threat. The camera often lingers on the landscape-sun-drenched fields, bustling marketplaces, and the haunting silhouettes of crumbling buildings-which evokes a sense of place that is both beautiful and tragic. These visuals ground the documentary, providing context to the voices and stories that inhabit it.Meanwhile, the chilling score enhances the emotional impact, weaving through scenes with a haunting melody that lingers long after the credits roll. It punctuates moments of tension and relief, urging viewers to feel alongside the subjects instead of simply observing them. This multifaceted approach ensures that ""No Other Land"" does not merely inform; it transforms the audience into witnesses, compelling them to confront the harsh realities faced by the people depicted.Ultimately, ""No Other Land"" stands as a poignant call to action, imploring viewers to acknowledge the ongoing struggles of those caught in the crossfire of conflict. It challenges audiences not only to empathize but to advocate for change, reminding them that awareness is the first step toward solidarity and support. This film is not just a documentary; it is a vital part of the conversation surrounding human rights and social justice, engaging its audience in a way that resonates long after the viewing experience. As the credits fade to black, one cannot help but feel a profound responsibility to share the stories that have been bravely laid bare, ensuring that the suffering depicted is neither forgotten nor ignored.",True
9,10,"When education is not liberating, the dream of the oppressed is to become the oppressor",rudykawa,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs once a great educator said about our society when we deny ourselves history lessons.All the parallels that are done in this documentary are baffling and poignant even if it's not intentional and not explicitly thrown at the audience. Yellow badge / green passports or car licence plates, the stoic and emotionless obedience from the military and public service people doing atrocities with people's lives and not flinching a little bit claiming only that it's the law, it's legal, the mount of shoes that is shown at one point, etc. And to be honest, it's probably even more poetic if the parallels were not intentionally chosen but were just so ingrained at the situation that makes it more unequivocal that what is happening is indeed what Freire's quote was talking about.Great documentary.",True
10,7,"Indeed, Where Is the Humanity?",brentsbulletinboard,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerRegardless of how one views the ongoing volatility between Israelis and Hamas in Gaza, there's another little-known yet equally explosive crisis in the region that has been going on for far longer. This nearly 30-year-old conflict has been quietly but unsettlingly unfolding on the Palestinian Occupied West Bank involving parties not tied to the better-known current conflict, a confrontation that has not received nearly the same level of attention - that is, until the release of this troubling film. Shot over the course of four years, the writing-directorial team of Yuval Abraham, Rachel Szor, Hamdan Ballal and Basel Adra have compiled this shocking documentary about the atrocities that have been relentlessly and mercilessly inflicted upon West Bank Palestinians in the Masafer Yatta region. This collection of approximately 20 small villages was summarily seized by the Israeli government (with the blessing of its courts after a 22-year litigation battle) to develop it as a training ground for tank regiments, an undertaking that has involved the demolition of existing structures and the displacement of the area's residents, some of whose families had occupied their land for nearly 200 years. Many of those who resisted were forcibly removed, imprisoned or subjected to the heartless, uncompromising wrath of Israeli troops, responses involving bald-faced hatred, severe injury and even death. To make matters worse, the displaced have often had nowhere to go in the wake of these actions, some being forced to live in caves in the adjacent mountains. To be sure, locals have consistently fought back, and some have even attempted to defiantly rebuild the homes and schools they have lost, only to have their hopes dashed by subsequent rounds of sanctioned destruction. It should be noted, as indicated above, that these actions predate the Hamas attacks, so not even retribution can be used as a convenient or ""justifiable"" excuse for these actions. In light of that, then, can those who profess to be humanitarians realistically call themselves by that name in the wake of an immoral tragedy like this, no matter how much its execution may have been declared legally permissible? Indeed, where is the compassion, the fairness, the justice? This on-the-ground account of events unflinchingly documents this horrific situation, an inexcusable exercise in overreach between the two factions, one that's impossible to rationalize in the face of vastly uneven odds and especially when the real, previously undisclosed basis behind this land grab is disgracefully revealed. This scathing chronicle, primarily filmed by Palestinian activist Adra and Israeli investigative journalist Abraham, shows the degree of atrocity that has been unleashed in the area, as well as what's conceivably possible when individuals from two opposing backgrounds begin working cooperatively to expose what's happening and to concertedly look for a workable solution to stop this inhumane, indefensible madness. ""No Other Land"" is not an easy watch by any means (sensitive viewers take note), particularly in light of its graphic depictions of violence (some of which, in all honesty, become somewhat repetitive after a while, what some might arguably characterize as overkill). Nevertheless, this Oscar nominee for best documentary feature shines a very bright light on this wholly unacceptable act of barbarity, one that any supposedly civilized society should be completely ashamed of, especially now that the whole world is watching.",True
11,10,A powerful experience.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"One minute you're in your home, the next minute it's demolished by The Israeli Army, and further, you're not allowed to drive, and told it's illegal to be on the land, that reality is captured on film.Where to begin, first off, it fully deserves the many accolades, it's not just a fascinating storyline and a daring piece of journalism, but it's actually a terrifically well made documentary, it's impressive.There are no grey areas or 'misreading' of events here, it doesn't really matter which side of the fence you sit on, and whether you lean one way or the other, it will hammer home just how appallingly The Israeli Army behaved, against people who literally had nothing, and could offer zero credible resistance. You see what it is to live under occupation.Several times it had me in tears, if you're not moved by it, I'd suggest there's something seriously wrong.There are some astonishing moments, the scenes between Basel and Yuval are fascinating, two incredibly brave men.Revealing, powerful and sobering, don't go in expecting any happy resolutions, as we all know this painful, excruciating war marches on.This will make every liquid in your body boil with anger and rage, it's obscene.

12,10,A Masterpiece & A Must-Watch,Papaya_Horror,n/a,15/08/2025,"I usually steer clear of political discussions - not because I lack opinions, quite the opposite - but because even those who claim to be open-minded and well-educated often struggle to engage in meaningful conversations without turning them into hostile debates.Too often, discussions dissolve into battles of empty rhetoric rather than genuine exchanges of ideas.That said, ""No Other Land"" is not an easy documentary to review. Created by a group of Palestinian and Israeli activist filmmakers, it captures the destruction of Masafer Yatta, a cluster of villages in the southern West Bank.Once home to generations, this land has been transformed into an Israeli military training ground, rendering its residents' presence - and even the act of rebuilding their demolished homes - illegal.Filmmakers Basel Adra, Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham, Palestinian director and farmer Hamdan Ballal, and Israeli cinematographer Rachel Szor present the harsh reality with raw honesty.There's no embellishment, no forced emotional manipulation - just the infuriating truth. The film doesn't tell us anything new about war crimes, occupation, or the fight for Palestinian sovereignty. Instead, it shows us what those words truly mean for the people living them every day.Why is this documentary so important? Oscar or no Oscar, ""No Other Land"" is perhaps the most authentic depiction of life under occupation - a stark contrast to the shocking, sensationalized videos that flood social media.Not that those clips aren't real, but let's be honest - most of us have no idea what life on the ground actually looks like. We aren't there, on the frontlines, facing the devastation firsthand.This film strips away the spectacle of war, the manufactured narratives, and the distant outrage. Instead, it presents the quiet resilience of a people fighting to preserve what little remains of their homes, culture, and dignity.No dramatization, no spectacle - just silence, destruction, and the unbearable weight of injustice.Perhaps it's easier to look away, to stay in a comfort zone of selective outrage while ignoring the real crimes happening in plain sight.But ""No Other Land"" makes looking away impossible.If this documentary is still playing at a theater near you, don't hesitate - go see it.Be ready to witness a raw, unfiltered reality that rarely makes it to mainstream screens. Let it challenge you, make you uncomfortable, and most importantly, make you think about the truth this collective is revealing.",False
13,8,"Should be watched, regardless of how you feel.",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"No Other Land was a quieter kind of angry than I was expecting, but I think that approach is the kind of thing that could well change a person's mind on the whole ordeal if they were to seek this out. I guess with documentaries on subjects like this, getting someone who already feels a certain way to watch this when they might want to otherwise resist an alternate point of view is the difficult part, but there's still a lot of madness in the world, and the approaches that have been taken to sway people haven't really been working.So it's not that No Other Land reinvents the documentary genre as a whole, but I think it has a distinctive way of presenting its central thesis. It's not peaceful, but there is a quietness to it that will likely lead some people to reflect on what they might've thought about before. Again, if they were to watch No Other Land in the first place. That's a whole other obstacle. But the approach here is more than sound and it's quietly powerful, and I'd hope that's an ultimately effective way to do it.This did have some slower moments as far as the editing goes, but there were other sequences that had fantastic editing, and there's some striking imagery in here, too. I don't think it's a perfect documentary but it is an important one (""important"" is a word I'm sure every review of this has used, oh well). Watch it regardless of how you feel about the conflict in question and I think it will help, so long as you go in open-minded. It's not necessarily subtle (and it shouldn't be), but it isn't aggressive, and if it does change minds - which I hope it can - I think that might be the reason why.",False

Ive followed the palestinian struggle for years and right NOW in this time with the genocide going on in Gaza and the strong solidarity for the cause of the palestinian freedom this was a must see for me.I loved this film. The friendship between Basel and Yuval was strong and touching. It shows unique footage of HOW the settlers destroy the houses of people belonging to citrus that have excited since the 1900s. Its a moving and touching film that shows the true Nature of the zionist project.Israel is a country build on blood and war. And they want to destroy Massafar Yatta to build a military training camp (!) you cant make that up. Its like a horror story. I cant recommend this film enough.

Exile or a bullet-those are their remaining options, all for the purpose of creating space for IDF military training grounds...A film that exposes the greatest human disgrace of our time, revealing how deeply evil, oppression, fascism, and racism can take root in the human heart, but also how vast, yet powerless, human suffering can be. It also reminds us that, without a tyrannical regime, a life of mutual solidarity, respect, and friendship is not only possible but natural.

19,n/a,A Stirring Testament to Resistance and Resilience,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"No Other Land is a compelling 2024 documentary that delivers a deeply emotional and politically charged look at the Israeli occupation of the West Bank through the eyes of those most affected. At just over an hour long, it is a brief but profoundly powerful piece of filmmaking that doesn't waste a single frame.Co-directed by a team of Palestinian and Israeli activists-including Basel Adra, who also appears on screen-the film is a raw, on-the-ground chronicle of demolitions, displacement, and daily life in the Masafer Yatta region. Its strength lies in its intimacy: we aren't watching distant politics unfold, but rather the human cost of those politics, captured with urgency and empathy.The documentary doesn't just inform-it confronts. Through candid interviews, real-time footage, and quiet personal moments, No Other Land demands the viewer's attention and emotional investment. The collaboration between Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers gives it a rare dual perspective, showing both the suffering and the solidarity that emerge in the face of systemic violence.Heartbreaking and vital, No Other Land is more than a film-it's a call to witness, remember, and resist.

When the weak become powerful they forget what it was like and they become oppressors without a second thought.What a tame word ""settler"" is. It doesn't say anything, when in fact it means occupier.",False
22,10,Enthralling,nickymorley,n/a,15/08/2025,"An enthralling documentary that is a must see. Now it's very difficult to write anything meaningful here, without being politically biased or showing allegiance to one side or another, however it is a film to watch with an open mind. And I encourage you to watch this film. It follows two journalists, both from different sides of the fence, but without dichotomy. The story of Yuval and Basel is told cleanly, without contradiction, and with first hand video footage taken in the West Bank. This is footage during 2022, and follows the two unlikely friends as they build an understanding of each other's worlds. Family relationships are witnessed, along with events that mark history.",False
23,10,Reality Right Now,crimeagainstcreation,n/a,15/08/2025,"No Other Land describes the situation at the occupied West Bank. The Israeli occupation and apartheid policy has been going on there ever since 1967, and the film describes the situation through the relationship between two friends, one Israeli and one Palestinian. Obviously this film is heavily criticized by those who get their true cruel portraits painted in it, but it's a documentary, and then again the Israeli settler mob has again just confirmed their real nature by violently attacking Palestinian director of the film, Hamdan Ballal. Further, the IDF does the same as Ballal has been attacked in the ambulance and detained by military personnel. This is Reality, happening Right Now.",False
24,10,No to apartheid!,ayoubchaouch93,n/a,15/08/2025,"An inside look into modern apartheid inside a country that claims to be democratic. The whole movie feels surreal, like watching your worst nightmare come true. And yet it is real. This is a movie about power, those who abuse it, and those who claim to be the protectors of democracy. If this was happening in a European country, the media would have been all over it. The world is a real unfair place and this movie is a sober reminder of that fact and of the fact me and you can actually do something about by sharing and talking about these things.A must-watch regardless of your political or religious views.",False
25,10,"Heartbreaking, a completely necessary watch",imdbfan-3609000201,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think everyone should watch this, it doesn't matter what 'side' your own, this is a story of humble, normal families whose lives have been completely and utterly destroyed. Please consider watching this, if you consider yourself a good human.I thought i knew about the goings-on in Palestine, to a certain extent but this has shown me that what has happened to these communities is far far worse than I could've imagined. The story is mainly filmed on phones and camcorders and although it is very difficult to watch, I found I couldn't look away. It's a compelling and thought-provoking watch. I will hope people can encourage people who need their minds to be opened to watch this.",False

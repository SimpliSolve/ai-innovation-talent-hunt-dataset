1,1,Apologists for serial killers,sugarqueen2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, you started out your ""series"" with a notorious female serial killer, Aileen Wuornos. And then you immediately introduced huge apologists for her, and seriously, defenders who insinuate that she is not responsible, because she was raised by her grandparents. What a crock. Well, millions of Americans have been put in the same boat, and have not emerged as serial killers. How in any way does that defend the 7 men she murdered? What about their lives? What about their loved-ones? I believe that none of you believe you or your families could ever be victims. This is gross. I expect that you put this on the air for ratings.",False

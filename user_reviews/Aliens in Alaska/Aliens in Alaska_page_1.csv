1,5,I was so ready for something out of this world.,ChristyGuinn,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love this kind of stuff and I'm not naive enough to think we are the only, or certainly the most advanced, beings in this VAST unending universe. As far back as Hieroglyphics to BC art they've told a story...a story that we are not alone. As much as I believe this I still want visual proof. Sure the retelling of personal accounts is awesome, but I NEED to see what you saw. I was really hoping this series would show us some things. Especially since some of these accounts were from 2019-2020. With the government declassifying some UFO stuff in the past year I thought okay, now we're going to have something. Now we will know what they know. At least part of it. Well, I was wrong. I was wrong about his show too. I didn't get nearly enough information to curb my curiosity. Gave it 5 out of 10 because there were a few pics and videos. But all in all, I was bummed",False
2,6,Sound quality,tipper-81992,n/a,15/08/2025,I like this kind of story but my problem with this show is the narration is over riden by the back ground noise. Would really like to hear what they are saying without all the noise and muffled voices.,False
3,n/a,Loved IT!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,If you have never seen a UFO I guess the show will not be that great because your looking for proof from a TV series lol?!? If anyone is reading this and wants to be disturbed watch UFO WITNESS the last episode! I haven't been right ever since!,False
4,1,Terrible,dakota_kendle,n/a,15/08/2025,Being an Alaskan resident for over 20 years this show is an embarrassment.,False
5,8,Actually quite good!,drisley-72230,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had low expectations based on other reviews, but was VERY surprised at the quality and entertainment value of the show. There are some really great stories by eye-witnesses, and even some evidence here and there.I think the only downside for me was the host/voiceover between stories. I think he was way too dramatic in tone, and some of the writing was bad (ie, always drawing to conclusions when there was no evidence at all just to make things seem more spooky). Also sometimes he would repeat and drag things out.Overall good job by the production team.",False
6,1,"I'm not sure how this gets approved. All stories. Zero video, just some lame pics.",Xavier_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,I skipped ahead rather quickly once I figured out that they are going to draw everything out about each story. Nothing of interest at all. All stories without any real proof besides a few pictures.Throw something at the wall and hope it sticks. Low effort show.,False
7,10,Great Show. Ignire the negatives.,paulcspiers,n/a,15/08/2025,"I throughly enjoyed thus show. Not sure if that's because I'm British and we aren't used to all the dramatisation, big powerful medical and so forth but the accounts of the guests involved are real. Give it a try. You can tell these accounts ar real judt by watching their faces and actions.",False
8,1,Here we go again..,nimitz541,n/a,15/08/2025,More recycled stories to try and make a buck..It's worth no more words than that..,False
9,10,REAL EXPERIENCES,breasyllc,n/a,15/08/2025,"For that ""UGH"" negative reviewer underneath here, these are real stories and they're not dramaticized and fake like Hollywood! These are real stories and real people and I've had experiences and it's exactly the way they say it was! Maybe not interesting for you so go back to your Hollywood shows and leave us to our trying to figure out what is really happening here in my home state! I appreciate hearing ALL THESE ENCOUNTERS! Thank you!!!!",False
10,3,Ugh,hvacguymichaelc,n/a,15/08/2025,I've had a big ufo experience with 3 friends. I love alaska spent a winter there. I should love this show but it pretty much sucks. It's as if they just asked random people if they ever seen anything weird until they could fill a show. Boring stories most of what can be easily dismissed. Pics of white light and clouds. Just bad. I'd be surprised to see a second season. Lazy very very lazy.,False
11,n/a,This is Renee Bullock from North Pole Alaska,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,When the movie company contacted me about saying telling my story about what was seen in North Pole Alaska I gave them the whole story my husband also saw the same thing I did I held it inside for many years because of this reason here about how a lot of people don't believe it but I assure you it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life and they did a pretty good job at depicting the story withholding things out because of the fact that my husband didn't agree to do the show because he never thought it was a big deal I just want you to know that if you ever get to see what I have seen you'll feel very different about these kind of stories I assure you it was worded different ways than I told the story but they did a pretty good job at the special effects.,False
12,1,Total Garbage,dgreatgnazzini,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJust got done watching the fist episode. Not expecting much, got even less than expected.One segment depicted a witness who supposedly saw 7 orange orbs and even took a video of one of them. Thinking this would be interesting to get a video of seven orbs, only one was shown in a very shaky video. Why show only one? Hmmmmm. Another segment showed a lady seeing a very large craft hovering over her house for around 6 minutes. No video this time.She also talked about a cell tower that was installed close by over the winter months and also talking with a couple of folks, men in black types , at a local bar.I am interested in finding proof of extra terrestrial life and believe that something may be out there. But this show is not helping the cause.",True
13,8,"Surprisingly Good! Great Stories, Good Evidence.",drisley-72230,n/a,15/08/2025,"Based on other reviews here I wasn't expecting much. This once again proved to me that I shouldn't always trust other reviewers.The production quality of this documentary series is actually quite good; better than average for this genre for sure. I really learned a lot about the geography of Alaska too.The witness stories are mostly quite good and very genuine. I think a problem is that the ""believers"" and the ""skeptics"" are all so hard core in their beliefs, that they don't put any trust in others, and don't respect humanity enough to take somebody at their word. This doesn't mean that everybody saw ""aliens"", but a lot of people have had interesting experiences and wish to share their stories. Watching this sort of reminded me of sitting around a camp fire and having people share ghost stories.As for evidence, somebody else here said there was ""none"" and there were no videos or photos. They are either lying, or they watched 1 episode and didn't see the rest. There is a fair bit of photography and video presented in this series which I appreciate. Is it HD, professional quality? No, of course not. It's what you'd expect: people taking photos and video with their phones which is acceptable when paired with their stories.The only real negative I have of this series is the host/voiceover. He tends to be way too dramatic in his presentation, and tries to jump to conclusions that every little thing must be ""aliens from another world"". I can look past that because of the number of great stories presented by witnesses in the series.",False
14,2,Demon-haunted world,VHSdynamite,n/a,15/08/2025,"UFO tales are always really about something else. They may serve as a hope for someone to come and make peace on earth, or a way of dealing with childhood trauma (abductions). Often they are a part of bigger belief system of conspiracies. People who believe in ufos, usually don't trust the government either.In this show, these people get to tell their tales without being challenged. Debunked theories about aliens building the pyramids aren't opposed at all. The narrator is fueling the fire.Life on other planets may exist, but are they visiting us? Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. This show provides the usual photographic artefacts that can be given more ordinary explanations than ufos.This show shows the importance of critical thinking. Without it you will draw the easiest conclusion that supports your existing belief. Everything becomes a nail if all you've got is a hammer.I'd recommend people to read Carl Sagan's sobering book mentioned in my title. He had a good balance of scepticism and open-mindedness many can benefit from applying themselves.",False
15,8,Eye opening into what's going on in Alaska!,danthescorpio,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had no idea Alaska was such a hotbed of ufo activity. I like the show's interviews with residents. Seems quite no-nonsense and authentic. My criticism would be the dark, ominous edge the show has about what's going on. It makes it inherently scary, adding to the understandable fear some of the interviewees have about their encounters. But, it's unnecessary and seems somewhat manipulative to the intelligence of the audience.Overall, definitely worth a watch for ufo lovers.",False
16,1,"If Fox News made movies, this would be one of them.",chatwithmichaelmac,n/a,15/08/2025,A credible examination of why Alaska produces people like Sara Palin and why they should stay there.I'm sure she's had more than a few orange orbs floating around her head. What else could explain it?QAnon must have funded this...the Lies are out there.AMERICA needs to go into collective therapy.,False
17,10,Good Show,bprante,n/a,15/08/2025,I binge watched this show today. I had not seen it before and it is very well produced. The people are believable and there are no far out there reporting. I like that you let the people tell their stories. I hope it continues. Amazing how many UFO's are above alaska.,False
18,10,I would bet there wont be a third season,terrencepurdum,n/a,15/08/2025,If you think for a second what you see and hear is a crock id love for you to sit down at my poker table for it could only mean you cant read a human being when he or she is telling the truth or lying. All ive got to say from here is i hope you non believers are ready. Keep believing what they tell you. If you did your own dd you would soon realize that theres more than enough evidence out that no one can dispute.,False

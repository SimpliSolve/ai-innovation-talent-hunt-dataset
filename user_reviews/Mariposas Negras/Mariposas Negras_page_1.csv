1,6,A colorful and interesting documentary of Animation coproduced by Spain and Panama.,ma-cortes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Climate change impacts the lives of Tanit, Valeria, and Shaila, three women from very different parts of the planet but with something in common. The three women face the same problem: climate change. They will lose everything because of global warming effects and they will be forced to emigrate to survive. A theory for some, a reality for millions !.This film ¨Mariposas negras¨ turns out to be a transposition into animated cinema of a previous film by the same director made into real images entitled: Climate Exodus (2020) that narrates the tragedy of three women who have lost everything due to climate change and now emigrate to start a new life. The film is notable for its magnificent drawings, which are beautifully brought to life, being full of brilliant color and almost seeming like living paintings.A well-intentioned film that attempts to force a message about climate change, which, according to the film, is apparently to blame for all the world's ills, disasters, catastrophes from continued emigration, sexual exploitation, violence, wars, and every other curse that exists in the world.Eventually, the story unfolds with a long message in the final minutes of the film, accompanied by images of global disasters. It is as follows: ""Rising temperatures are causing increasingly violent hurricanes in the Caribbean. Irma was the longest and most destructive on record. The thawing of the Himalayas is causing rivers to overflow throughout India. Rising sea levels threaten crops on the Asian coast. War over water is constant in the Horn of Africa. Monoculture plantations and neoliberal policies are spreading drought across the continent. It is estimated that there are currently more than 200 million people forcibly displaced due to climate change. These migrants are not recognized as refugees because their reasons are not covered by the Geneva Convention. Women and children are the ones who suffer the most violence during their migration¨.Although the plot is rather mediocre with several disjointed stories that don't fit together very well, this animated film was professionally directed by David Baute (Milagros, Ella (s), Climate Exodus, Rosario Miranda). Rating: 6/10.",False

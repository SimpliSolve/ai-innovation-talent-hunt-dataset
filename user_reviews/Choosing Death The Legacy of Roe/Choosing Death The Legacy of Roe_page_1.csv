1,10,Powerful Truths Many Hide their Eyes From,bradencn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Look - this is not a popular thing to talk about. It's uncomfortable. It's not the mainstream narrative.This documentary is a non-religious, scientific, secular understanding at the reality of abortion. It's bold for the Daily Wire to put their name, and the names of those they interviewed, front and center against a large and expansive left-wing media that preaches for pro-choice.Here are some facts that this documentary defends, and I challenge people on both sides of the issue to digest this information and ponder its truthfulness.1. Abortions were NOT accepted during the time of the Constitution.2. Those that voted for the 14th amendment in 1868 did not have any context of the idea of abortion being included in the interpretation of its reading.3. Minority communities (even on the left and democrat/civil rights leaders) were strongly against abortion, likening it to murder.4. Abortion does not, as Planned Parenthood and the left claim, ""alleviate social and racial inequality."" It doesn't protect the vulnerable, women, or the impoverished. You cannot abort your way out of high welfare costs.5. The black community has only been hurt and further impoverished because of Margaret Sanger's plan to advertise abortion mainly to minority communities.6. The reality of Planned Parenthood's plan to turn profits through abortion, taking advantage of vulnerable pregnant women.7. Legal abortion does NOT save women's lives. Bernard Nathanson's work has documented this extensively. Maternal deaths prior to Roe v Wade is essentially identical to what it is today. When women have an abortion, there is an increase to maternal mortality - 3x higher risk.8. Most statistics the promote pro-choice claims are falsified or misrepresented and are not held accountable by the media on social media sites.9. Pro-life advocates are misrepresented to simply be anti-women: people that want to control women's lives. In reality, sexual abuse is often covered up in abortion clinics to keep abortions secretive and ""off-the-books."" Abused little girls are sent for abortions by their abusers, and then sent right back without issue or reporting to police.10. Is a fetus a ""human?"" When does human life begin? Scientific consensus (5,000 biologists), in 95% agreement, say that moment of conception is when a fetus is a living human being. Babies kick and push away at abortion tools. In addition, those that go unsuccessful, those babies are victims of infanticide as well - with a myriad of issues and developmental problems in their lives because of botched abortions.11. There is blatant disrespect to the most vulnerable, the voiceless: the infant human in the womb. Who is their voice?12. Law enforcement does not often question ""botched"" abortions - where a baby seems like it may have been actually born and THEN killed (drowned, left alone, etc.).",False
2,10,Must See For Left and Right Wing,givemearereson,n/a,15/08/2025,"Facts surrounding abortion are so difficult to find in a organized manner, there is much deceit surrounding the procedure, and what follows for the survivors afterwards. My own grandmother had an abortion and was so horrified as a teenager, by what she was pressured into, that she only spoke of it once. She simply said she regretted it and everyday she wished she could trade her life for that of her 4th child... but time doesn't run backwards. This documentary allowed me to understand her trauma and anguish without having to bring her more pain. It also furthers my belief that girls must care for girls. The answer to abortion is supporting the women around us, no matter what. Thanks DW for such a well rounded expos√©!",False

1,6,"While many fellas today suffers from the problem of inactivity, there is a smaller group, namely athletes/bodybuilders, which may be exercising excessively.",Fella_shibby,n/a,16/08/2025,"And believe me, as a gym instructor for the past two decades, i have seen clients getting obsessed with their workouts.This documentary is informative but it doesn't shed light on the narcissistic attitudes/obsessive compulsive disorders plaguing many fellas around.None of the bodybuilders or actors (specially Bollywood stars) are healthy.Health: a state of complete, mental, social, and physical well-being, where all bodily systems (nervous, hormonal, immune, digestive, etc.) function in harmonyFitness: the quality of being able to perform a specific physical task, which includes exercise and sports.",False
2,6,may be trying to fit too much in,mdcollinsbarracuda,n/a,16/08/2025,"Early on, I felt the film doesn't really help someone understand the illness, more just to exploit these people. But eventually it does provide more insight. I've been in and around body building off and on since before Schwarzenegger was famous yet this bigorexia is a newer phenomenon for me, probably because a lot of common things have been given a psychological label since the early days. I can see some of these people have a genuine disorder -- the guy with the massive lopsided biceps is truly disturbing, especially because he clearly made little real effort to sculpt or train any other part of his body -- but the blond guy was probably more brainwashed to believe it's a disorder when really it looked more typical to the profession; there is very hard work and dedication involved but that doesn't mean something is wrong with you. So I feel this film tried to include too much when this is really rare rather than labeling every person who spends 6 hours in a gym for a competition. People have for centuries gone to extremes to be bigger and more powerful. It's just that in modern times we have modern inventions that make the bar much higher. Dolly Parton had her breast enlarged 8 times but no one said she had body dysmorphia except her doctor probably. Which she clearly did. Models would be accused of this, too, yet they are simply fitting in to their industry. I think it's dangerous to try and label everyone who doesn't look like Mr or Mrs Cleaver. Everyone feels the desire to improve themselves and it's always a personal thing. There's a lot of pleasure in weight lifting and sculpting the body. If it's destroying your life, only you can really make that determination.",False
3,8,Fascinating Musclemen,KatMovieLuver,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked how this movie gave the psychological reasons men who are bodybuilders never feel big enough. The movie focuses on several individual stories of bigorexia.Bigorexia is a condition where men never feel big enough. They can have huge muscles but don't see the hugeness. Some resort to steroids and even injecting synthol into muscles.One Russian man has freaky results but think he looks good. If you enjoy the psychological reasons behind obsessive disorders you will like this one. Also, I think this would be a good movie for sports coaches or health teachers to show to their students. Interesting film.",False
4,9,Great documentary.,bzeldin-06539,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could have gotten deeper into the pain and suffering. Great otherwise.Would love a follow up on kirril and his arms, how the surgery went and what he did afterwards.Also details on the first guy with the glutes and what the issue was, how it happened and how his health is now, especially in his ass.Ironic how doctors are allowed to discuss this body dismorphia honestly but can't the transgender issue.Have positive friend who confirm you do look good. That your body is right and looks bettwr then you think. How it's a mental issue, trying to fit it and one up everyone else. The parallels are there, the honesty isnt.",False
5,10,Massively interesting,rcollins20,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis documentary is a truly compelling and fascinating look into the world of muscle dysmorphia - a form of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). The film follows the stories of several well known body builders who suffer from this condition and the physical and mental ramifications their activities have on them. Some of the more interesting individuals featured are the late Brazilian bodybuilder Valdir Segato and Russian muscle man Kirill Tereshin - as both had become internationally infamous for their excessive use of the highly dangerous and controversial Synthol - a substance used by body builders as a temporary implant which is injected deeply into the muscle.,True

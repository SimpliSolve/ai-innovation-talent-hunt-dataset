1,4,A tribute to past and present Disney Princesses,lisafordeay,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI may not be the target audience for this but as a 30 year old woman,I've always loved watching Disney Princess films from The Little Mermaid,Aladdin,Beauty And The Beast,Cinderella to Tangled and Frozen.To be honest the songs in this were completely butchered especially the Broadway song Home from Beauty And The Beast. I was like what were they thinking.",True
2,4,I hated it. My 6 year old liked it.,patriciamantooth,n/a,16/08/2025,"I mean, kudos to giving others a chance on the stage- but this remix was really horrid. Choreography, music, costumes, concept... horrid. I'm actually shocked this made it to Disney plus. I won't review the actors because they honestly did their best and it's obvious they were full out in everything they were asked to do... but no one should have ever asked them to do this. The stars in my review were literally only for the performers. I also think it's kind of crappy that all of the characters got to keep their real names except the lead girl whose name is a little difficult to pronounce. Seems sketchy they made her name different. And brandy...why... why did you do this.",False
3,3,What did I just watch,sstubbs87,n/a,16/08/2025,I am a Disney mom/wife. I love all things Disney. This was an insult to all these butchered princesses.,False
4,1,Indicative of the level of garbage Disney shovels into its barely curated Disney+ app,fastpuppy,n/a,16/08/2025,Indicative of the level of garbage Disney shovels into its barely curated Disney+ app hoping parents don't actually watch the content. Shamefully bad with the thinnest relationship to Disney princesses.,False
5,2,Missed opportunity,mrzmarie-80054,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not here to tear down a bunch of lovely young ladies who are living out their dreams of singing. I am disappointed in the adults behind this however. The dancing for some and heavy auto tuning was so hard to get through. I love love Brandy and her song starting now-my daughters and I watch song and listen to it often and that piece is the only thing that made this worth the watch. My daughters know her as Cinderella which brings joy to my heart for them to have that opportunity. So removing Brandy and her beautiful self and equally beautiful singing, this show dropped the ball. I get the point-girl power and girl empowerment but they could've went about it in better executed ways. Disney princess songs are so beautiful and have held up for time but they, I don't see them going further than the streaming service.",True
6,2,Could have been so much better!!!,claddbashford-38260,n/a,16/08/2025,"My kids and I were so looking forward to this!!! The remixed music was a great idea but the singers; lead and back-up, were terrible!!!! After such amazing musical feats like ""Zombies"" and "" The Descendants"" how did they settle on these singers?!?!",False
7,1,Terrible. Just terrible.,chumpy_dwarf,n/a,16/08/2025,"My 4 year old niece can practically quote every word from Frozen, Tangled, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Frozen 2 and Princess and the Frog...and yet she could only sit through one song. Having watching it with her, it felt like I was watching a 4th grade talent show. The singing was OK but not great (and waaaaay too much autotune). The dancing and backdrops were below average and a lot of the time unnecessary. With so many amazing singers in Disney's repertoire, not sure why these people were selected.Even fans of Disney should give this a miss. Remixes sound like a great idea...unfortunately the great idea is poorly executed.",False

1,5,EV truck,GoBlueJohnny,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rich guy spends hundreds of thousands of dollars to convert an old square body pickup from Internal Combustion to an Electric Vehicle...because it's all about the environment. Meanwhile, the show features a helicopter, a 20Ton massive diesel powered heavy equipment hauler, an Abrams Tank, and a 100+ Army troops. The carbon footprint to make this episode alone hilariously illustrates the hypocritical nature of these Hollywood Elitists. It's like watching Leonardo DiCaprio jet all over the world, lecturing people on caring for an environment as he flies in his friends and 25 year old girlfriend to party on his 150 foot yacht in the Mediterranean.Do as I say, not as I do.",False
2,5,Car restoration show for the layman,AfricanBro,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're a fan of Robert Downey Jr., you'll likely enjoy it regardless of your interest in cars. The show blends cars, car restorations, and climate change concerns. While Robert initially hinted at converting everything to EVs, but certain things out of his power prevented that.In comparison to shows like ""Fast N' Loud"" and ""Diesel Brothers,"" this one falls short, especially for car enthusiasts. While it addresses carbon footprint reduction, it also features contradictory stunts and cars. Some builds seem not thought through, possibly due to RDJ surprising his team on which car they're restoring next or maybe they just wanted to have hiccups for authenticity. It often feels more suited to YouTube than TV, lacking urgency and excitement. It oscillates between a rich man's whim and genuine passion, making it hard for me to get fully invested in.Though I learned a few things, being a car enthusiast already, the show would benefit from a clearer direction amid the evolving landscape of car transportation. Like it's still a little too early. It's at the start of that transition phase from petrol/diesel cars.Overall, it's more enjoyable as a casual watch, particularly if you're a Robert Downey Jr. Fan. For staunch climate activists or dedicated car show fans, it might disappoint. Personally, I found it a decent pastime, i liked some of the restoration outcomes, just without forming strong opinions for or against the show.",False
3,5,"Corny, ugly color combos, too much virtue signaling",martingtodorov,n/a,15/08/2025,"RDJ is incredibly corny all the time. I don't blame him. He is a dad after all with all of his dad humor. The color combos are mostly hideous. Matte wrap is very 2010. I love all of the conversion ideas, but the reason for doing them is presented as saving the world one classic vehicle at a time by electrifying them. Im sure the positive impact of electrifying them is negligible. The proof of concept is amazing, but the impact of it is overexaggerated. Rich rebuilds carried the first episode with the amazing conversion. I would love to see more rusty project vehicles be converted in driving electric cars. This would even go more in tune with the idea of the show: saving the world one classic car at a time.",False
4,7,Enough is enough,jack-70480,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first two episodes made perfect sense. Episode one made great sense. Take a giant gashog truck and convert it to electric. The colors and the details worked well. The demonstration and use of the military was over the top, but the episode didn't offend car guys. Episode two made even more sense. Take a dirty diesel and convert it to eco-diesel. Robert's mother must have been spinning her grave at the color combination he chose to use on the car. UGLY. Episodes three and four are probably the most offensive to my sensibilities as a car guy that I could possibly dream of. Take two of the most beautiful cars ever made and trash their value. It was a sin to paint it any Riviera in the chosen colors. Pale peach matte finish???? UGH. Then a '65 survivor 'Vette cut apart and turned over to electric? OMG The car may look the same, and it may be faster, but again the color of the exterior and the trim are ghastly. I know it's too late, but if you do a 2nd season, take some better donor cars where the changes make sense and add value to the vehicle rather than devaluing a perfectly good classic.",False
5,8,Great show!,bonhult,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really liked the show. Could have been even more episodes. I love seeing classic cars/trucks get a second lease of life by turning them into more modern versions of themselfes. And it seems RDJ has a whole lot of them to fix/convert! Maybe a second season?RDJ explores and explains a lot of new eco-friendly technology. Some cars get new interiors with vegan leather made from mushroom. It looks and feels like real leather.Anyway if You like Wheeler Dealers You're gonna love this. You get to see old classics getting new drivetrains, some EV, some biodiesels, hybrids or just more modern versions.",False
6,6,Had promise,docwisdom,n/a,15/08/2025,"Roberts personality is the highlight of the show. He is funny, has a good concept for what he wants to accomplish and interacts with the guests and crew well. Unfortunately I can't enjoy the vehicle projects themselves. They go into very little detail on the build. Everything looks kinda hacked together and not high quality craftsmanship. Overall, the end products are kinda ""meh"" and not very interesting. Don't get me started on the choice of paint colors...they are some of the worst I have ever seen.If you are a car guy and into restorations, I don't think you will get much enjoyment out of the show. If you are a novice to cars but enjoy climate related content you may like it.",False
7,2,Just bad,katrinaroman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Third episode they don't even go electric. They have a plan to go hybrid, but because they aren't actually planning any of these builds out the way professionals would, they purchase a 2009 hybrid engine from a totaled car, realize it won't fit, and say ""well, we tried"" and they just put a slightly more fuel efficient ICE motor in place of the original.RDJ attempts to prove his excitement at the prospect of turning his Riv into a hybrid by stating that his every day driver is a hybrid, but conveniently omitting any details on make or model. Minutes later we see him driving himself to an unrelated hangout meeting and mysteriously, he's not driving the daily driver hybrid, but instead a vintage corvette. No explanation. Where's the hybrid daily driver? Does it exist? Does he think the Corvette is a hybrid? Who's gonna tell him the bad news?Back to the project Riviera... with the hybrid plans scrapped (along with the purchased junkyard Tahoe), we slap a pollution sensor on top of the Riv, connect it to a tablet, hand it to the guy in the passenger seat, drive around NYC congratulating or condemning each block for the numbers on the screen, and we pat ourselves on the back for a job well done.This show is a joke.",False
8,9,This is a fun show.,NBrava,n/a,15/08/2025,"Why do I have to write 600 words to tell you this show is entertaining. Anyway, I love to watch something where you learn things and it's enjoyable. Downey goes big for all of it. He really makes the show fun and not political. Regardless on how you feel about ""eco"" stuff. The show has designed a challenge in converting these beautiful machines from gas to electric. On top of the conversions he adds other elements to the show such as visiting the military and learning about their initiatives for using different fuel sources. I think there's something here for most people to enjoy. As I said, it's a fun show.",False
9,7,Entertaining but...,dtm-84333,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I first saw the name of the show I was hesitant to watch it as I was expecting another celebrity showing off his collection. I was pleasantly surprised once I dove in. However, it would be nice if more information was provided about the cost of the modifications (parts and labor) that are being done. Granted the biggest cost on some of the mods is the original vehicles themselves, so I'm only talking about the modifications. As a 60+ gearhead myself, I'd be very interested in what it would cost me to do something of this type. It's easy to go out and shop for a ready made Tesla etc., assuming you can afford it, but why not EV in style.",False
10,9,Love it,ienetta,n/a,15/08/2025,"People's envy gets to vote badly for such a useful, fun and flowing program, without understanding the real message that Robert is giving us... but the human being is an i***t and will never look further than his own nose.. pathetic ...Without going into the details of Downey's wealth, he is making an effort to make us concretely understand that the planet needs a big change from everything, especially from those who have the money to be able to do it and who ultimately pollute the most. He is funny, empathetic and brilliant, and despite the fact that I am not too fond of cars I am following him with great interest. I really appreciate it.",False
11,n/a,RDJ HEAR ME OUT....,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a great show, episode 1 was great & currently watching it all right now actually. BUT HEAR ME OUT....Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, James May....Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo....See where I'm getting at?Loved the car's development. Loved how there's huge feature of the United States Military. Definitely a fun show & much more to come.RDJ by himself is fun but we've seen how he is with groups. If this show had 2 additional co-hosts, top gear challenges, car features, unique experiences, I'm pretty sure we would be seeing the next generation of Top Gear viewers favorite.",False
12,7,"Fun to watch, but...",dsb-02142,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well, it was fun to see Robert Downey, Jr. On screen again. And all those great muscle cars. And it's great to see the renovations in episode one - that they were able to do not only to military vehicles, but to personal vehicles also. But as a normal person with limited income, I can honestly say that this isn't realistic for the common Man. Unless Robert Downey, Jr. Wants to pay for my conversions... it won't be happening. And unless car makers bring the cost down of electric cars and battery replacement, I'm pretty sure I'll stick with gas powered engines. I'll keep watching it though. Cause it's interesting.",False
13,8,great show about where we need to be,perfecthouse-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Love this show; innovative brilliant people bringing new ideas to an outdated industry. One of the reviewers here is mad about RDJ pushing his ""green agenda""; where do you think everything is going? If you don't like learning about the future of the car industry, there are plenty of shows about gas guzzlers-go watch those. The automobile industry is going electric/hybrid/self driving.In the next 10-15 years, all cars will need to be electric-it's awesome! No one will take your gas powered car away from you but wouldn't it be great to not have to pay for gas anymore? This show is not only funny and entertaining, it's educational. Embrace and grow!",False
14,2,Disappointed,lowo_lowo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wanted to express my disappointment with the show's excessive focus on climate change instead of cars. As a car enthusiast, my primary interest lies in thrilling races and insightful discussions centered around the automotive world.I understand that climate change is a topic of significance to many, but I watch this show to enjoy and learn about cars, not to receive a lecture on climate change. I would greatly appreciate it if the show stayed true to its premise and focused more on delivering content that caters to car enthusiasts like myself.Furthermore, I would like to mention my appreciation for Chris Benoit's involvement in the first episode. As a fan of his work, I was excited to see his expertise and insights on cars. I believe that featuring him more prominently in future episodes would enhance the overall quality of the show.But even if Rich was on all of the episodes, it would not be enough for me to sit through a whole season.",False
15,8,Set your personal politics aside snd enjoy the show.,cgqnwxhcd,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show is DEFINITELY not for you MAGA heads out there.... If your a Trumpsketeer, just keep moving along. RDJr isn't for everyone, but I enjoy his particular brand of entertainment. So he takes a couple of gratuitous rides in Blackhawk helicopters. He is reducing his carbon footprint overall. And if you LISTEN while watching, you might actually learn something. The army is VERY interested in moving to E-vehicles. When you think about it, they're almost silent, provide NO heat signatures for targeting systems, and aren't dependent on foreign oil. So they're. Win, win, win. Plus they build some badass cars and trucks. Just let it go, already. Come on in for the big win.",False
16,8,More than just converting to electric batteries,kuku-38620,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerUnlike most of these reviews where they didn't get past the first ten mins, it's not just swapping an engine for a electric battery. They cover that the first one the second they make a biodiesel engine. Changes each time. Fun show, easy watching perfect for summer lull. Also the history parts are fun to know.RDJ is his usual self and keeps things fun. Would say a bit more on the work they do on the car would be fun but I'm not about to tell them what to do hahah.Seems like it's getting low reviews from people still denying climate change which is their opinion. Fun show none the less would recommend.",True
17,10,Great Show,campbellj-62274,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great show! Loved watching and hearing about the difference in efficiency and performance with each swap! It was so cool, as someone who loves classic cars to see someone make them more eco friendly. It also got me into watching Rich Rebuilds on YouTube. I hope there is a second season so that we can witness some new cars and electric gear. The military episode was especially interesting to say the least. The best car of course is the Rimac Nevara it was absolutely beautiful, and the performance was absolutely insane! Overall, it was really cool to see Iron Man in real life and to see his car collection was wonderful as well!",False
18,10,Nay to the Naysayers!,kimmber-14976,n/a,15/08/2025,"RDJ = Iron Man/many characters. Got it Naysayers. Doesn't take fr clout of Dream Cars. It's educational, relevant, inspiring, entertaining. Bought 1st EV off teaching of Dream Cars & Youtube EV reviews. Gas guzzlers; EV is eco friendly, cooler, faster, advanced, cheaper. Won't die in garage while started! Despite how bat migrated. No gas, oil change, just tire rotate we do 4 free! Impressed w military use & future of hydrogen charge. Y have flip phone car when u can have a smart car? It's coming no matter what! Why not take advantage of tax break while u can b4 govt finds way to take away? RDJ good job. U reached me!!!",False
19,5,A bad way to explore an important (and interesting) topic,azurekic,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's just not a fun show, most of the time while watching it something just felt off, cringey and awkward. My guess is this is due to the fact that it is more about the host, who seems like he is forcing or just acting unnatural in some interactions, and less about the technology and the cause.In the first episode they use military helicopters and tanks while talking about the importance of environment, and they spend only three minutes talking about the (arguably) most interesting electric car in the world, while not using the expertise of Rimac to push the narrative of the show. Rimac is the main reason I started watching, but he barely appears.It's about Downey, his mom, his grandma, his son, his cars, his feelings, and spending tens of thousands of dollars on restorations.I don't really get who is the target audience for this show. Conservative American petrolheads? And what are they going to do, use their yearly salary to restore their car?Electric cars and the whole sustainable energy technology sector is such an interesting topic, and climate change one of the most important topics. It is a shame that a show you get on that topic then, on HBO nonetheless, is a cheap show with a vibe that matches that of Pawn Stars or other History Channel shows, with a self-indulgent host.EDIT: Ok, in the third episode they do interview Rimac, but the show still isn't top quality, many issue remain as pointed out here and by others.",False
20,8,Amazing show,darkwingvenom,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerMany people have lost interest in restoring classics and this show shows a new light on restoration. The show has a good amount of comedy bits and they usually goes well. My only issue is that Robert repeatedly claims the quickest accelerating production car is the rimac nevera even though the Dodge Demon 170 holds the record currently but that is just a small nit pick. This shows many ways you can be environmentally friendly and many alternatives to gas guzzlers that many car enthusiasts enjoy. Also I enjoy the different type of classics that they use for this show. The show gives you a deeper understanding of many different types of environmental friendly modes of travel.,True
21,5,Very preachy,sirchrisd-05702,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a car builder myself, I like the idea of thinking outside the box. Before I go on let me say I do love a classic, restored to original, or original car. But the show takes a newer hybrid and puts it in an old car that gets 9 mpg, uses an electric motor to power a truck, and the series goes on. It's really no different than doing an LS swap into a 57 Chevy, is it? Better fuel economy, more power, better reliability, all in all a better car. Keep it clean and do it right and I'm all in. That's the good from the show. The bad is Iron Man, I literally see Tony Stark living high on the hog for all those years and then preaching to Captain America on how he's wrong because Tony had a touchy feely moment. Half the show is Downey preaching to the audience how we've been wrong all along and he's going to save us if we'll just follow along. He even has one guest who believes we'll all give up our cars soon and use robot taxis. I have news for you, step out of your penthouse and see how the country, no the world lives. We're not crammed in a few city blocks and can all share a cab. Sure, some things need to change. His desire and the cars is why I gave it a 5. Maybe I'll get a few ideas from it.",False
22,1,Such hypocrisy,angladafrank,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not only this show has the terrible premise of turning collection cars into RVs (that are in no way shape or form green when we know how lithium is mined) but filming it using helicopters, tanks and other heavy carbon footprint devices makes this show a bad taste okeLeave these cars alone, the entire world thermal cars are responsible for less than 15% of global CO2 emissions while most modern EVs made in CHina arte done so using electricity produced by coal.Downey's want to drive EVs? Just buy a freaking Tesla or any Supercar running on batteries, the choice is large. Not only it will give those beautiful classicval cars a rest but will also avoid making shows like this.",False
23,5,Not for car enthusiasts.,daniel-52700,n/a,15/08/2025,"Since I've followed Rich and his YouTube channel for a long time and love Robert Downey Jr I really wanted to like this show.But I struggled through the comedy and silliness of the first episode and a bit in to the second episode I couldn't stand it any more.This is as far you can come to calling something a documentary, it's a kind of comedic scripted reality shows with ""experts"" that either don't know what they are doing or being told to follow a script that's clearly not written by a documentarian or anyone with much knowledge in cars, mechanics or physics.So if you are looking for a ""comedic car show"" go watch Rich Rebuilds on YouTube instead because even though he appears in a couple of these episodes the videos he produces himself are of much higher quality.",False
24,5,"Too bad, it lost its charm",klikzg,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe show start great with 1,5 episode...first a EV transformation of a big 4x4, then they come to lovely Downey's mom Mercedes with a great idea of running diesel on bio-fuel (esterificated vegetable oil) - only to fit a Dodge 4-cyl diesel into a Mercedes. They could have easily put OM617A, OM603, OM602 or OM605 inside that lovely W109. Too bad they did not do it.Then it gets worse, instead of keeping a original engine or even to rework an engine in C2 Corvette, with doing a ""bio-fuel conversion"" to 100% ethanol. No, they ruin the car with going fully EV on a perfectly good oldtimer. Call me a purrist, but that is just simply wrong!In all, they keep on doing the same stuff - never really educating people with a show, what could be done also. So they don't do:bio-ethanol conversion (like said previously)hybrid conversion (though, they do try but give up)hydrogen conversionOK, they do talk about hydrogen in 5min part, but no conversion? What is that all about? Robert, if you could not find somebody to do ""a hydrogen EV conversion"", come to Croatia (again). I can hook you up with someone to do a proper ""hydrogen EV conversion"" for your car. It is not only Rimac, that we have here! ;)",True
25,4,I've seen this before somewhere!,admiking,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTo be honest, it resembles a pumping car that was on MTV at the time, only with a focus on ""environmental friendliness"". I didn't find anything interesting from a couple of episodes in this regard and stopped watching. I do not recommend watching it, it's a stupid waste of time!It's strange, of course, that Downey decided to star in such a show and kill his cars at the same time. I wonder how much he was paid for shooting in 6 episodes!If, of course, you don't mind wasting your time, then you can watch the series for your own development. New technologies and methods of changing machines in 2023 are interesting!",True

1,9,Different subject and Captivating story,ToddRee,n/a,16/08/2025,"Metal music is an underground music genre. Not everyone really knows about it. This documentary is definitely one of the great music-related documentary. It takes us through the journey of the musicians and the highlights of their career. The way the film is directed is like a full-length dramatic film. It shows friendship, success, sacrifices, emotional turns and struggle. It does makes the viewer emotional but its its own musical way. The background music is theme related and carries the mood of the documentary till the end. With zero knowledge about Metal music, I still enjoyed the film till the end. A great delight to watch.",False
2,9,Viva for Real,rodwill1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The band, the music, the story. I have read some reviews with differing and varied views and opinions. Armchair critics can be harsh. Pretentious indeed! How can this story be deemed to be of a band with a pretentious mindset. NO other band metal or otherwise has managed to achieve what Parkway Drive has achieved completely on their own terms. Self managed, mostly self funded and with a single focus - to put on the best show for their dedicated fans. Me, I've been in since day one and I am proud of their single minded determination to ""make it"". It's not easy and many have failed. This film highlights the sacrifices needed to make something of the short time we are given on this earth. The drive and will to create something memorable is truly admirable and has been achieved here. Viva Parkway Drive for having the guts to see it through!!",False

4,6,Pretentious band bio,magoo10498,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could have been a 30 minute DVD bonus on their new album, there is nothing objective about this ""bio"" and the band comes off as very pretentious. I am a fan of metal bands and Aussie bands but not particularly this band, and this did nothing to sway me.",False

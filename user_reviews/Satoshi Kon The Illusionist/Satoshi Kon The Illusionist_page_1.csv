1,4,Hagiography is thy name,TooKakkoiiforYou_321,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yup, this is another hagiography masqueraded as a documentary of sorts when the documentary stuff in it is few and far between (namely the influence of Slaughterhouse 5 on Satoshi Kon's movies and of the actress Setsuko Hara of Ball at the Anjou House fame on Millennium Actress, yet strangely there is no mention of Hideko Takamine and Mikio Naruse in regards to the latter). And I say it as a fan of Kon's work, his unrequested personal opinions on animated life-changing, everlasting Experiences I would have rather not heard or not (life-changing Experiences I myself I've positively compared to his movies of all things). I sincerely don't get what's the point of any of these pretended ""documentaries"" on well known industry people (actors, directors, etc. Etc. Etc.), you've seen one of them you've seen them all. Satoshi Kon was infailable, Satoshi Kon was an unheard genius, Satoshi Kon was a landmark person in the industry doing things nobody did before him (like promoting other people's work the way Osamu Tezuka did in the 60's?), Satoshi Kon was alone when everybody didn't believe in him, etc. Etc. Etc...so boring, so useless, so uninteresting. I wouldn't bother even in case you're a fan not just of his work but also of some of the people interviewed (I'm specifically referring to Megumi Hayashibara and Iwao Junko, both to my knowledge still active Idols/singers to this same day when this ""documentary"" suggests otherwise). Avoid with no remorse whatsoever.",False

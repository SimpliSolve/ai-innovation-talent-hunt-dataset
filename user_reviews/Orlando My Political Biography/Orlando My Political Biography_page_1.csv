1,8,Great queer movie,lolax-08405,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whole movie revolves around gender. It tells stories about transgender people, their relationship with their gender, their identities and sometimes parts of their transition stories. It shows various people - younger and older, white and BIPOC, fat and thin, with different level of passing. You can really feel inclusivity and diversity of trans and non-binary community.These different portrayals combined tell a longer story of Virginia Woolf's Orlando and sometimes they are even creating monologue (or letter) addressed to the writer herself.Whole movie is a meaningful voice in a discussion about gender. It critiques gender binary as a patriarchal concept. It shows different perspectives, experiences, transgressions.The movie is not so much about sexual orientation though (which was written in a movie's summary on a cinema's webpage) if you're more interested in that topic. Although these two are deeply intertwined.Also, I think you should have at least basic understanding of concepts like gender, gender binary, transition etc. To enjoy it. I wouldn't recommend it as a first movie for cis straight people who are far from queer culture and community.I hope this movie will be available on streaming services so a broader audience could access it.",False
2,8,A stunning integration of biography and literature,dngoldman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film combines memoir and literary critique in a powerful way. It shows how trans artists relate to their own life stories and to Virginia Woolf's classic, complex, poetic novel Orlando. Woolf did not have the words to describe transgender or gender fluidity that we have today. But the experiences she depicts in the novel inspire today's trans activists. The fact that Woolf, the great writer, was grappling with an issue that she had no language for, shows that being trans is not something new and what it means changes over time. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish if the characters are speaking their own words or those of Woolf. The blending of Woolf's prose with the personal stories is haunting and beautiful. Mostly this works but it can be confusing. Fluidity is a main theme of the stories and the novel. The film concludes with an uplifting courtroom scene in 2028, where a judge, authorized by Woolf, abolishes gender assignment at birth.",False
3,4,"A meditation on gender, history and identity",filmreviewradical,n/a,16/08/2025,"A 2023 French dramatised documentary feature film from writer/director Paul B. Preciado (a transgendering individual formerly known as Beatriz) which is based on and inspired by the 1928 Virginia Woolf novel 'Orlando : A Biography'. Here in this reimagining and updating of the novel, and the 1992 film 'Orlando', a series of individuals portray Orlando (including Preciado), in what is a meditation on gender, history and identity, as well as the filmmaking/storytelling process. Although not as good as the 1992 film 'Orlando' this film makes an intriguing counterpart (and counterpoint) to that film. Virginia Despentes plays the judge who (in 2028) gives all the Orlando's their desired identities. One for J. K. Rowling.",False

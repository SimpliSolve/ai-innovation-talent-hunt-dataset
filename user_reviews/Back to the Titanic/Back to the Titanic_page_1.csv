1,7,A very beautiful return to the wreck of the most famous ship in naval history...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was thrilled and happy to get to see this 2020 documentary titled ""Back to the Titanic"" made available by National Geographic.And I must admit that this was definitely a documentary that was well-worth taking the time to sit down and watch, and it was also a documentary that was very much welcomed. The only downside to the documentary was that it was way, way too short. I could have spent hours perusing through footage of how the wreck of the majestic Titanic looked in 2020. And it was very fascinating to see the process of deterioration to the ship.""Back to the Titanic"" gives us some really great footage of what the wreck looked like in 2020. And the graphical presentation of the wreck that they made possible with this documentary was just spectacular.Everyone is familiar with the tragic events of April 14th, 1912, so this documentary definitely is a monument of historic progress and gathering facts.I can highly and warmly recommend that you find the time to sit down to watch ""Back to the Titanic"", if you have the chance to do so, especially if you have an interest in the ship or the events that transpired back in 1912.My rating of ""Back to the Titanic"" is a seven out of ten stars. Just a shame that it was only 1 hour long - as it felt much shorter, and could have given so much more with more time and footage.",False
2,6,Ok,kakaxplivebr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerContinuing my marathon of Disney + documentary films, this is my tenth watch. I'll watch and comment.What a pity not to have pt-br subtitles available.Reminds me of the recent deaths of people who went to see the Titanic.Wow, there are microbes. Interesting tributes to the dead of the shipwreck.Conclusion: it is important for us to discover new things, to dazzle real old events, but with caution so that there are no more deaths like the most recent one, it was a good documentary.I liked the specialists, they even included a descendant of one of the deceased, I found it interesting. Cool.",True
3,7,Decent,Kingslaay,n/a,16/08/2025,"Always exciting to go back to the Titanic. A concise and interesting documentary, kept things on point. They even showed some original footage and pictures from 1912 and it was remarkable how they went searching for the suite of Benjamin Guggenheim and they had one of his descendants as part of the search. The work and modelling they did was great to show us more of what was happening. Enjoyed it.",False
4,n/a,"Neat footage of the wreck, but suffers from pointless dramatization",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere's some really interesting footage of the wreck and the technology they use to get there. The 3D modelling based on dive footage is especially cool. It's really neat to see how the wreck looks, 35 years post-discovery and 108 years post-sinking.That said, the production suffers from way too much pointless dramatization. The narrator sounds like he's auditioning for action movie trailers, and the music seems like a low-budget attempt at an homage to Hans Zimmer.They've also contrived some stupid moments of ""suspense"" and ""danger""...oh there's jagged metal on a shipwreck? And a current in the ocean? You don't say...Bad writing throughout, too. Lines like ""if true, it would be INCREDIBLE"". Just, stop. Please.And during the dives, when they should just show the ship and shut up, they spend half the time showing the guys inside the submarine reacting to the wreck. Or the irrelevant great-great-grandson of a dead plutocrat, also just reacting to footage of the wreck, on a macbook back on the surface.You shot hours of wreck footage. Just show that, and stop with the goofy drama and the human interest stuff.",True
5,6,Simple but interesting enough...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Back to the Titanic"" is a Documentary in which we watch a modern-day exploration of the Titanic wreck, using advanced technology to capture new footage of the sunken ship and its surrounding environment. It offers a unique opportunity to revisit one of history's most infamous maritime disasters, showcasing the wreckage in more detail than ever before.I enjoyed this documentary because the story of Titanic is very interesting by itself but when it is combined with stunning visuals and high-definition footage then we observe a fresh look at the Titanic's remains, capturing both the haunting beauty and decay of the once-grand vessel. The exploration of the wreck itself is fascinating, revealing new perspectives and areas of the ship that have remained largely unexplored. The impressive technology and visuals of this documentary give an emotional depth in all of these that is truly captivating. All in all, I have to say that ""Back to the Titanic"" is an interesting documentary that gives an intriguing look at the wreck in a way we've never seen before and it's visually impressive thus, I recommend everyone to watch it.",False
6,5,ok for the shots,eamonnh-89469,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's not a lot new in this and the thing that bug me most was the way they kept making out it was ""nearly 15 years since anyone went down"" which is lies, as there was a dive done in 2012, and given this dive was done in 2019, thats only 7.",False
7,3,disappointing reality tv schlock,TheGMang,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNational Geographic continues its decline into dumbed down mediocrity. This 'documentary' plays like a cheap reality show. The fake drama is so forced it's almost impossible to watch this. There is almost no good 4k footage of the wreck in this. Mostly the same footage over and over and then reaction shots or b roll inside the sub. These are the people who crashed into Titanic but there's no mention of it here. Poorly directed and shot this is really a shadow of what it could have been. 5-6 minutes of great content stretched into 45+ min of stupid tv tropes. The expedition itself seems half baked, especially with technology available today. The narrator is awful. The only interesting person is the historian.",True
8,9,"Short, but intriguing documentary about the latest dive to titanic",salmanhaider-16981,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a short but interesting documentary about a recent dive to the titanic. It features scientists diving down to the ship a few times during a mission to rediscover parts of the ship and study the decay of it. We see some new pictures of the wreck captured with 4K cameras which are later shown in 3D thanks to a software. Interesting documentary for followers of the Titanic and the general audience.,False
9,1,Nothing new at all,PeterWanderingSoul,n/a,16/08/2025,"What we thought we'd see was Titanic's wreck. Instead, they repeat things we know already. Everything the voice over guy (whose voice doesn't belong in a documentary) says are things we've known since the late 90s. James Cameron has given us hours of incredible footage, these guys show us 4 minutes of the bow, some close up of some metal, and then it's all footage of either the guy in the sub, b rolls, reaction shots, cgi stuff.The wreck looks exactly the same as it did in 1991. These guys keep saying ""oh it's corroded!"" Really Sherlock? It's a shipwreck.The search for Guggenheim state room made me laugh. Who cares. There's a guy who's supposedly a descendant of the G man, and he's like ""oh it's cool I'm standing where he last stood"".Boring.""This is it, this is the state room right there"" turn camera to: a piece of metal on the floor.Boring.All of it, boring.",False
10,3,Poor,jdabronus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sadly, this is one of what I call the 'dunta-dunta' class of documenteries - in reference to the frantic drumbeats overwhelming the soundtrack, together with the turgid pauses, synth breaks, meaningless hyperbole and all the other desperate attempts a poor documentary makes to raise the sense of drama when there's not actually that much to say. Worse, they've skipped over any exciting angle they COULD have taken. Surely the primary value of the dive was to come up with an accurate and usable 3D model? Focus on that then. Or create a compelling narrative tied in with the history. Sadly all that potential gets lost in the sensationalist rubbish. No-one's going to learn much watching this.",False

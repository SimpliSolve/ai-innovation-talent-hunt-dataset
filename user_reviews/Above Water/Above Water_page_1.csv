1,5,Great but...,gutierrezfederico,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved the movie in general, i fund it entertaining and inspirational the only problem i find is the noise on the background and the music, it ends up being to comftarble an making one tired. I do recemn the movie very strongly, i had the oportunity to have a chat with the director after watching it and got to know more about the background of the movie and the current state of the represented tribe shown thanks to the actual political situation in Niger. My favourite thing in this movie was to put myself deep in the shoes of this tribe and get to see their life in a closer perspective, if you have the chance watch it !",False

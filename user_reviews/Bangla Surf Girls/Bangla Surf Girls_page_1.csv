1,9,"Enlightening, heartbreaking yet brings hope",kristin-53256,n/a,15/08/2025,"Visually beautiful as well as educational and heartfelt storyline. The documentary gives us a sliver of insight into the lives of not only those featured but the reality of so many across the world. While my heart hurt for the suppression, poverty and hopelessness I also felt much hope and gratitude for those with the courage to follow their dreams and rise above so many obstacles. Having founded a non profit (LETSempower.org) to prevent human trafficking, poverty and abuse, this film touches my heart deeply and inspired me to continue to bring education that can liberate humanity. I want to follow their stories and ensure that each of these young women and families have the resources and tools to continue their dreams.",False
2,10,Surfs up in Bangladesh.,morrison-dylan-fan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Finding the likes of The Mushroom Speaks (2021-also reviewed) to be superb discoveries made at the online WOW Film Festival, I was excited to find that one of the films which was to have a live Q&A at the event, was a documentery, this led to me surfing up.View on the film:Detailing in the Q&A after the screening/ stream that the movie was filmed over three years, debut director Elizabeth D. Costa is joined by editors Matthew Cohn & Jordan Kawai incredibly make the passage of time feel seamless over the compact 86 minutes, via the years of production jetting pass in smooth up-close panning shots following the surf girls from the Cox's Bazar surf training school, to their family life.Due to the long period of pre-production and shooting, D. Costa gets an unfiltered glimpse at the differing reactions from the families over the ambitions of their daughters to become major surf stars.While staying grounded in the stark reality of the girls households, D. Costa captures the sense of wander which makes each of the girls connect with surfing so strongly, thanks to beautifully composed shots which glide right next to the surfboards, spinning out to shining wide-shots of the girls catching huge waves.From the high of the waves, D. Costa crashes the waves with extremely raw, long-take mid-shots, which stand back and record with an unflinching eye the abrasive arguments that the parents have with the surf girls.",False

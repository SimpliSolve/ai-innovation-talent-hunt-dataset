1,8,"""Untrapped"" is much more than just a Rags to Riches story",dgarcia97,n/a,16/08/2025,"At only 27 years old, Lil Baby has been able to reach levels of success and fame that most people in the world will only be able to dream of. The title ""Untrapped"" foreshadows the transition of Lil Baby from the hardened streets of Atlanta to a life of wealth, luxury, and power. At one point in the film, while preparing for his ground-breaking 2021 Grammy performance of ""The Bigger Picture,"" Lil Baby triumphantly repeats, in a crescendo: ""I could be out in the street selling dope somewhere right now!""At its' surface, the film is about Baby's individual come-up story and his journey through the whirlwind that is the Hip Hop industry - as an artist, a father and a change-maker. Lil Baby's story is unique for a different reason, though. His story, the story told through this film, highlights the importance and the power of community in breaking down barriers to 'success' in the United States, namely financial freedom and influence.The film makes sure to emphasize that Lil Baby was always respected in his community, long before he took up music. When he was caught up in street activities (activities that eventually landed him in prison for 2 years, which the film addresses in detail) he was still making enough money to provide for his family and to be the leader that he longed to be. It was his community members and mentors that were looking out for him, his future, his long-term, and, really - his life. In an interview with Young Thug, Thug explains the lengths he was willing to go to keep Lil Baby off the streets. ""I would have given him a million dollars,"" he told the audience, after explaining how in the past, he had given Lil Baby, also known as Dominique Jones, payments of up to 20 thousand dollars in one day to replace the income he would have made in the streets. Lil Baby's community members saw the potential that he had, and they supported him and invested in him to help him become ""untrapped.""The film also showcases a supportive and healthy relationship between Lil Baby and Quality Control Music Co-Founder Kevin ""Coach K"" Lee and Quality Control Music CEO Pierre ""P"" Thomas, in giving audiences insight into their intimate moments as a team, including moments of reflection and tough decision-making. ""Untrapped"" is filled with wholesome content. Although there are heavy subjects addressed like poverty, drugs, death and prison, the overall feel of the film is very upbeat, positive, and hopeful. The film showcases Dominique Jones as a person, and not just the artist that is Lil Baby. There is an abundance of footage of him as a child himself, as well as footage of him in his everyday life as a father, and as an active member of his community and communities like his across the US.One subject that was almost completely left out of this film, possibly reflecting the all-male team of producers, was the role of women in Lil Baby's journey --and it's not because they're not present in his life. The film had some brief moments with Lil Baby's mother who told us that Dominique, his siblings, and her had always had a close relationship. Women are a big part of his life, he grew up with two sisters in total and co-parents children with two women. Yet most of the female figures in his life remain hidden in the story that was portrayed. There is a woman who appears in the film that he references and speaks to often, ""Britney,"" who seems to have a lot to do with his day-to-day life, but she is never formally introduced at any point in the film. A quick Google search will tell you that this Britney is actually Britney Davis, VP of Artist Relations, Marketing, and Special Projects at Motown Records and Billboard 40 under 40 honoree, someone who would still be worthy of an introduction without her impressive accomplishments. There are continuous appearances by the female CEO of MoTown Records, Ethiopia Habtemariam, but barring that and the moments with his mother, women are largely absent from this film.Ultimately, however, this film was a compelling and insightful look into the journey that Lil Baby is on. He showcases his intelligence, moments of compassion and self-awareness, as well as a consistent and respectable willingness to better himself as well as give back to his community and the larger communities that are in need. One can only hope that with time, reflection and growth that he will also come to understand his impact through the lens of gender, and beyond. Still, this film is sure to leave you excited about the future of Lil Baby and even more excited for Dominique Jones' personal development as a cultural leader.D. Garcia

2,8,If you didn't like it then your hating just my opinion,joeybeck-22072,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHe didn't tell much of a back story other than him growing up selling drugs and eventually went to jail which changed him, he gets out of jail, sells drugs while also trying to start a rap career and eventually his rap career takes off...... what so hard to believe, it's not like he was making up stories, or glorifying the streets, he told an honest story about how he was rich on the streets and gave it up to make legit money and became even richer then he was when he was selling drugs, which is a great message to spread and if you relisten to his music that's all he talks about and it's crazy how he's so big and so underrated at the same time......what's not to like, unless this isn't your genre of music.",True
3,8,He's the literal greatest,Kaitlynsanaa,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary really showed where he came from and what he had to go through to become who he is now. That wasn't an easy process he went from making fast money in the trap house to building a rap career which is long term money. When he first started out he was trapped in the cycle of the trap. He didn't want to be a rapper because it wasn't making him no money. But he over came that and he is legendary. He literally became untrapped. This documentary is one for the books he's literally the G. O. A. T. He came up, it's so hard going from making fast money to building a career and he did that! Don't ever play with him!!",True
4,10,Great Job,chehill215,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well done. Gave a clear descriptive insight of life in the West end. (I wanted to hear Rags to Riches in the documentary, but I run it in the car everyday anyways) lol, and Time with our Philly's own, Meek. I wanted to cry on some parts, but his smile makes me laugh. Anddd he do talk a little funny..lmaooo. Evolving and learning is black excellence, Super proud of ya. My sons took a pic with him in ATL, true native. Wonderful to see your moms in the documentary, thats where it really all started. You have many awards of achievements, fatherhood, street smarts, to business man. Stay busy, and Be Blessed!",False
5,10,"Lil Baby, Thugger, Gunna n Drake is in this.. LOVE IT.!!",repairguyz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow this was filmed in past few months or even farther back.. You can tell this watching it.. Like the story starts in begining of pandemic, early 2020 when Baby dropped his biggest album but bcoz of the covid it shows a very interesting world(Fans) response..PLS Watch it.. I don't want to spoil anything.. YEAH, see because YSL Crew, thugga n gunner got locked up 2-3 Months before this release, makes it so interesting to watch because it shows all of them in it (Baby AND The Ysl) and now we are all just wondering are they gonna take Lil baby too as he is the leader of 4PF crew, the next on Atlanta DA's List.. . But this documentary is so good and thorough.. Shows who baby really is and was.. 5 STARS ****""",False
6,5,Better than I thought,RazorPalo,n/a,16/08/2025,Overall pretty good. The rap music it self is lyrics are good. The production beats and sounds the same lots of auto tune. Very good family man and like able guy. The only thing that confused me or the message they are trying to deliver didn't make sense. They were saying if you are a drug dealer you can turn to music and make it out. How about the poor kid born in the hood who isn't famous or looked up to and doesn't do drugs how does he or she get a music deal? I'm pretty sure if Lil Baby was just a poor kid without drug money Coach Kevin Lee and Pierre P Thomas wouldn't have put that much time and sweat towards Lil Baby. I would like to see those guys find non drug dealers in the neighborhood into stars. So now the kids are going to watch and think we got to get drug money build a home studio get followers then go find Kevin and Pierre for a record or label deal.,False
7,10,If your a fan of rap and a underdawg story look no further.,Madethistowritereciewfortopboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a amazing and inspiring documentary about life in the trenches, you really have to go through things in life to understand and appreciate this documentary. Growing up rap was a big influence in my life from Dre to 50 cent and then new school rap came and i never thought i would enjoy gritty rap like i did get rich or die trying and then baby came through and when you listen to him you instantly realize hes not like any other rapper lyrically and then you see this documentary his life and where he came from and how he is a person is truly amazing. So if you really enjoy the rags to riches from nothing to everything while still staying loyal to your roots this is a great documentary.",False
8,10,A Cinderfella Story with hard work and determination!,kkleopatrajones,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm a believer in that you are a true product of your environment. It can make you or break you. It's your choice as too how you are going to proceed. With the knowledge you have been given and the circumstances you have been dealt. LiL Baby had the power within himself. He just needed to know how to navigate it. Even though he saw many negative influences he had just as many positive influencers around him. They all had something in common and they used one another as a catalyst to survive and ultimately make a difference in their own way. As a mother of 2 young black men. I am so proud of the man he has evolved into. He is not a victim of his old environment. Once he opened his mind to except his fullest potential he became woke and untrapped. He's done so much in a few short years that many will never achieve. I'm so glad he allowed this documentary. It will touch a few souls that watch it. The love he has for his family and his children beams through the screen without words. He moves like poetry and his words is an extension of him.,False
9,9,Lil Baby is the next Street Poet,mryoung-38956,n/a,16/08/2025,"***Disclaimer*** Call me biased b/c I live, reside and claim the A. But Dom aka Lil Baby is the truth and this shows it. A young brother born into poverty...a product of a problematic system.Much like Pac and others...Lil Baby is a Rose that grew from the concrete. A survivor of said system built to trap young men like him.Although still young into is career, this main stream doc felt like a trap mixed tap. With camera photo footage definitely from the jump.All accolades aside, he hasn't gotten the respect he deserves. #1 album of 2020 and he was robbed. Not of an award(s), but of a single substantial nomination. Proud of this young man and this doc only strengthen that support.West Atlanta stand up!",False
10,9,Life is scarier than death,drug_dealin,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a very interesting story, and I like that his lyrics tell a real story. Honestly, I have always turned the station when I hear his music, but the only reason is that they Autotune his voice. Very in depth story that you really need to hear to understand where he's coming from. One thing that really stood out to me was his wisdom and blunted emotions toward death around him, but the raw fear he expresses toward life and how one choice, past or future, could profoundly change everything. The story not only shows his transformation, but really makes it so clear that he had some truly caring people around him that carried him until he could stand on his own, so to speak. Very good. The Biden clip, saying to lock them all up, was a surprise to see, otherwise there is no ""agenda"". Might be a little harder for them to tell black people how to vote after throwing that in.",False

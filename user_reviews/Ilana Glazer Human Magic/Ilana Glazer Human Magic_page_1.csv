1,7,for her fans,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm a big fan of Broad City. I love the chemistry with the two ladies. There is something about them that makes the sum greater than the parts. This standup was filmed in a good-sized Toronto theater. There seems to be a quick turnaround with no behind-the-scenes material. It would have helped to have a bit of before and after the show. Ilana Glazer is a particular flavor of comedy. It is a matter of taste. The sexual subject matter is nothing new. Her new kid is par for the course. It's her delivery that most haters find most problematic. It can be a lot. That's why I love her chemistry with Abbi Jacobson. They balance each other.,False
2,1,What is this?,movieed1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't waste your time watching. This is a canned, empty halled tomato. Seems the 'stand up' did not wish to trill through the crappiest comedy clubs to pay her dues and refine her jokes. This is painful to watch, as IF we were in s crummy comedy club in Wisconsin.She has plenty of venues ti refine her materail, we know she has the talent, but this is clunky, and unfunny.She must have friends in high places to get this act green lit for HULU.Not something to visit or re-visit or even to have on to enjoy in the background. It seemed women-directed humor, not ready for family or a fun-night to sit and laugh...
Save your money and watch someone who is willing to pay their dues trekking the USA comedy clubs ..
This is lazy sophomore college stuff.",False

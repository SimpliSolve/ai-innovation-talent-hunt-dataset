Excellent re-watch. Highly recommend.",False
2,8,Big things have small beginnings,ahegde3149,n/a,15/08/2025,"Never watched any Argentine/Spanish film before. Actually, the number of foreign language (ie. other than English and Hindi) films I have watched till date is not even two digit. Still, this movie was mind-blowing!! Wild Tales, is a package of 6 short films which are dark and explosive comedies. All of them has the theme of revenge strikingly common and each one of them is unique and funny in its own way. Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.Besides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can't highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story. The soundtrack is also quirky and beautiful.The two hours fly away like a breeze. Even if you don't understand the language you will be so invested that after sometime you won't even realize that you are watching a Non- English film. Highly enjoyable!RATING: [4/5]",False
3,8,"Clever, dark and funny",sanarg,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie is actually 6 short films, all related by brutal violence motivated by different situations. Family. Society. Government. It works very well like that, lasting over 120 minutes that go by quickly. It feels very fluid. Szifrón's eye is very precise. You can tell everything was very well thought. I wouldn't say this is a philosophical film, but it is clever entertainment, that makes you think if this wild tales are actually that wild... Even though this stories are taken to the extreme, everything feels somehow possible when you look back.Darkly humorous. Watch it.",False
4,10,Brilliant,perica-43151,n/a,15/08/2025,"Perhaps the best omnibus dark comedy ever made. This movie is funny, it explores some of the darker parts of humanity but it does so with so much wit and intelligence. It was a great hit in South America, and understandably so. Despite dark and cynical take on the human condition, the movie is lighthearted and highly watchable, and uncompromisingly original.",False
5,10,Too much fun and human darkness for one day.,patrickfile,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched last night at the theater with my girlfriend.It's a compilations of 6 tales, but they don't have the same type of lenght, humor or darkness. Each one is unique.1) Airplane tale: fantastic, hilarating and surrealistic story to open the series.2) Coffee shop tale: shorter, but dark and makes you wonder what's ""freedom"" for some people.3) Road tale: excellent. A really LOT of violence and a little bit of humor makes this one of the best tales in the movie.4) Human limit tale: a man that's having a couple of really bad days explode when he runs out of patiente. Great acting.5) Accident tale: 90% darkness. And the fact that could be a very possible story makes it even darker. Shocking finale.6) Wedding tale: almost impossible to qualify. Hilarious for the most part, but at the end, it will make you wonder to whom you are spending your whole life with.Seeing this compilation in a theater for the price of one, its a damn good deal if you ask me.Go watch it.",False
6,8,Wildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original.,twilliams76,n/a,15/08/2025,"This Argentine film that found itself nominated for the 2014 Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award comes to us from director Damián Szifrón who has crafted a feature film comprised of a series of 6 vignettes/small stories about human beings from all walks of (Argentine) life who are all tested and taken to their limits ... until they finally lose control. While mostly disastrous the film is also WILDly thrilling and wholly original in its daring cheekiness ... as the film is a bitter dark comedy (with tinges of brutal drama).It is a film about a myriad group of people on a plane; a young waitress who still finds herself grieving over a family tragedy of the past; an encounter between two men from different social classes on a desolate highway; a man growing tired of the rat race of life in which we are all destined to lose; the aftermath of a horrible automobile accident; and a wedding reception like none you've ever seen before. All feature one or two characters taken to the edge ...It is how each of them handles their various situations that give us our WILD stories. Fascinatingly grim at times, the film almost always miraculously produces laughter and grins. Much of the laughter might be heavily muffled as one chuckles under his/her breath as others around them fail to see the director's (WILDly) wicked sense of humor come into play in some of the film's intense situations; but the dark tone pervades the entire film.While the film is most definitely tragic in many instances, Wild Tales is a comedy of errors about human nature and who we are. Some can watch this and most-likely not pick up even a hint of humor; but it is there ... and it is fantastically facetious.Wildly thrilling. Wildly fun. Wildly original. It is courageously wild.",False
7,10,What a wonderful idea!,romanvartanov2014,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went to see this movie hoping to get a brake from Hollywood production. And I did. It was amazing, one of the best movies I've seen on big screen in 2 or 3 years.Plot consists of different stories which all have one thing in common: they are about revenge. Every single story starts rather boring. At the very beginning I was thinking ""What's so wild about it? It is just lame"" and by the end of the intro I was like ""Holy God! No, they did not just twist it like that! OMG!""And it gets better. A true masterpiece. I am from Russia so for me it was rather interesting and surprising that Latin America is so similar to Russia. The views, the behaviour of the people, the insanity - all like at home.You won't regret seeing this movie. Don't take your kid or your grandmother though.",False
8,9,"Forget Wild, These Tales Are Savage!",nicholasruddick,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a very watchable and often extremely funny anthology of six short films. The dialogue is in Spanish, the director and settings are Argentine. The stories are all slightly-over-the-top-realism in the manner of Almodóvar tinged with the dark surrealism of the Buñuel of The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie. The scenarios are graphic rather than subtle, but they all work well most of the time, because most of us can identify with the main characters, recognizing how little it can take to shake us from complacency into violence.The official English title ""Wild Tales"" suggests madcap craziness. But these tales are savage (""selvaje"" in the original Spanish), a word that better suggests the ferocious beast lurking not far under the skin of all of us. The beast can be unchained by nothing more complicated than being cut off by a driver who doesn't signal or finding that our car has been impounded for an unwitting parking infraction.In the first and shortest episode, what appears to be an absurd series of coincidences linking all the passengers on a plane turns out to have a logical and sinister rationale. The ending explains why in the opening scene the woman checking in at the airport is told that she will not earn frequent flyer points for her trip! And the final, longest episode hilariously tracks the chaotic degeneration of a stereotypical Jewish wedding party, initiated by the bride's discovery that the groom has been cheating on her with one of the guests. This is not a film for young children or for people who aren't willing to admit how close they sometimes are to dissolving in animal rage.",False

11,n/a,Hopefully Damián Szifron is on his way to Hollywood,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hopefully Damián Szifron is on his way to Hollywood. Simply the most refreshing and entertaining film that I've been lucky enough to watch since Nightcrawler...really it's that good. The darkest comedy you'll have the pleasure to experience. Ticks all the boxes, cinematic, a superb ensemble cast deliver in every short story, dead pan humour, intelligent, thought provoking, terrifyingly realistic, wonderful camera-work especially in the final story, with a couple of explosions and some (thankfully) subtle CGI thrown in to complete this masterpiece. Lovely to once again sit amid an audience all happily laughing out loud, without the need to lower itself to racist, sexist, ageist, homophobic humour, though the scatological humour is surprisingly perfectly appropriate and carefully framed to make the point without unnecessary vulgarity. Ten out of Ten. A new name to watch. Kudos to Damián Szifron.",False
12,7,Very good Argentina/Spain co-production being stunningly  directed and efficiently produced by Pedro Almodovar .,ma-cortes,n/a,15/08/2025,"This picture displaying genuine humor , thrills , chills , suspense , dark atmosphere and twisted conclusions , being skillfully proceeded .

Sitting in a strange middle ground between the completely absurd and the stylish set pieces , adding some enjoyable moments . It is an Argentina/Spain co-production by El Deseo : Agustin and Pedro Almodóvar , that turns out to be an acceptable film because of the thriller , tension , Kafkaesque suspense , embarrassing humor as well as an interestingly written script concerning complex episodes episodes in which our protagonists are in such extreme situation and their subsequent instinctive urges for exploding violent feelings . We immediately see that the stories are going to be told from some unorthodox perspectives as each scene and its conclusion result to be surprising and shocking . Despite its disturbing as well as violent developing the picture manages to be intelligent , intriguing and thrilling , being entertaining to follow . The good thing about this film is that the director made it on an enough budget , including several sets , yet the movie works on many levels but is constantly reconfigured . The final outcome is an offbeat picture that's captivating , in spite of not being all that fun , resulting to be thoughtful and thought-provoking , dealing with the impact of violence nowadays .

13,4,"Superficial, full of stereotypes and clichés.",MdPField,n/a,15/08/2025,"We might ask ourselves what we pretend of cinema. If we look for simple minded ideas burden with commonplaces, compliance with common sense and compromise, then this is your movie. Rich or poor people, fathers, mothers, brides, society: all is what you expect to be, all subjects are treated on the surface with no discomfort for the viewer. All situations are made with an effectist purpose to amaze you in a childish way, like a trick from a chip magician. If you were looking for a dark humored exploration of the Argentinian society in all his violence, desperation and the grim reality lurking in everyday social and political developments, you will be disappointed. There are a few great actors like Darín, but they are wasted in all their potential. Even the few funny situations are lonely islands in a sea of nothingness.

14,8,"Rage and Revenge, Guilty Laughter",ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Do you often get accused of having a slightly demented sense of humor? Do you have secret crazy thoughts of seeking revenge on those who have wronged you? If so, writer/director Damian Szifron has a collection of short stories just for you!Nominated for Best Foreign Language Oscar, Argentina's entry is just now opening in the Dallas market where I live. To say Wild Tales is a wild ride would be quite an understatement. There are six short stories blended together, and while you may not recognize the theme immediately, it doesn't take long before rage and retribution jump to the forefront in these seemingly typical slices of everyday life.The best short stories make a quick grab for attention, and manage to convey character and setting from the beginning. The writing is crucial and can easily collapse in the hands of a less-proficient short story writer. But when it works, it's fascinating to watch, and Mr. Szifron has a real talent for making us laugh in the midst of truly awful situations.Not to give away any details, but the six stories involve: a remarkable ""coincidence"" on a flight, an unwelcome customer at a local diner, a close-quarters brawl at a bridge, the frustration of dealing with ""the system"", misguided parental instincts in protecting their kid, and the most wheels-off wedding reception ever filmed.If you are ever searching for an example of a dark comedy, this one will provide clarity. The seemingly unrelated stories are woven together through payback, though the price is often pretty high. Mr. Szifron's stories remind us that life is not fair, but when it's happening to someone else, we can still laugh about it.",False

16,10,What a Ride,WilliamCKH,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had an idea from the opening credits that Damian Szifron's WILD TALES, was going to be fun. Images of animals with the actors' names as counterpart, preparing the audience for the animalistic behavior about to come.The film is comprised of six separate vignettes, short stories, if you will. These vignettes all begin innocently enough, passengers boarding a plane, a man driving through the desert, a restaurant on a stormy night, a wedding, everyday slices of modern day life. Something occurs to break the routine, the main character responds, then the scene escalates, and escalates, and when you think you've reached the peak, it escalates even more, and finally in the end reaches a perfect balance of comedy and tragedy. The tales are all perfectly relatable and escalate logically and realistically, nothing comes out from left field. All the characters, each flawed in so many ways, remind us so much of ourselves, both at our best and at our worst... and make us laugh and feel in recognition.Great Movie.",False
17,10,Six stories of frustration leading to joyous revenge,maurice_yacowar,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Spanish title is more apt: Savage Tales. Six short stories show various ways in which savagery persists in the highest levels of civilization. The titles appear against a montage of wild animals. The twist is that here the savagery is celebrated not rued. Where civilization was supposed to free us from savagery, as in the American Western, here the savagery liberates the characters from their civilization. As director Damian Szifron told the Palm Springs festival audience, ""The theme is the pleasure of losing control. Releasing the beast.""In each story a modern frustration wells up until the character erupts. All the stories involve a furious revenge, with a broadening range of characters. To convey the tensions in modern life, ordinary sounds are amplified, like the luggage wheels in the opening shot.In the pre-credit tale, the pilot turns out to be a lifelong failure who has collected the various teachers, friends, psychiatrist, who have thwarted him, on a flight he will crash into his parents.In a diner the waitress recognizes a customer as the smalltown gangster who drove her father into bankruptcy and suicide. Now running for mayor, he is rude and abusive. As her anger and conscience struggle the cook takes over and kills him. She's content to return to the security and comfort of jail.An Audi driver rages at a redneck who blocks his way. When the rich guy stops to fix a flat tire his nemesis stops and assaults him. The road rage turns into class warfare. Ironically, when they're found burned alive their clutch suggests it was a crime passionel.When an explosives expert gets his car towed for an unjustified parking ticket his angry campaign for justice blows up his marriage, job, career and even shared custody of his daughter. When he blows up the tower's yard he becomes a local hero, Mr Dynamite. In jail his wife and daughter bring him a birthday cake and all the inmates and guards celebrate his day. His last act is blowing out the candles. Terrorism works.A spoiled teenager's fatal hit and run accident leads to a steadily expanding chain of corruption as his wealthy father tries to get the family groundskeeper to take the rap for him. As the bribery balloons no-one is innocent. Even the humble groundskeeper raises his demands. When the father decides not to pay to save his spoiled son, his lawyer says it would be dishonourable for him to renege on his bribery of the the public prosecutor. When the boy decides to confess the greedy renegotiate their scheme. As the fall guy is led away an angry citizen kills him. Amid all the bribes and false honour the poor worker pays the price.In the climax, a rich Jewish family's wedding, the bride explodes after the groom admits he had sex with a colleague who's a guest. The demure bride turns into a vengeful virago wreaking massive destruction, reducing the groom to tears, the ceremony to chaos, and her rival to a bloodied mess. When the newlyweds reconnect — making passionate love amid the ruins of the cake — their union feels more honest than the initial smiles and formality. Now their union expresses more passion than manners. The chaotic wedding is more honest than the ceremonial ritual was.The anthology structure hearkens back to Italian neorealism, where separate short stories provided a wide-ranging survey of social issues. Apt for a celebration of the unruly, the film is exuberantly comic but with a black undercurrent. As its initial frustrations are so common, the film provides its audience with a greater catharsis than most comedies or tragedies. We're left calm of mind, frustrations spent.",True
18,9,"Wow, Anger is really a powerful emotion!",Mmpelit,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat movie telling stories I would label centering around anger. I realized how powerful anger emotion is and how quickly it can ruin your life for good.1) Airplane: It was developed beautifully and gratz to the pilot for determination.2) Restaurant: The douche bag of a guy basically kills the girls father, girl thinks about confronting him and the chef lady thinks confronting him is not enough at all.3) Car: Need to be careful about road rage, you don't know who is the guy in the other car. I think this goes for any rage. I think I can conclude that we shouldn't rage.4) Tow away: Really good criticism of government and it's fines. There should be a better method to determine which fine is just. Also I agree that most government workers are really annoying, they don't enjoy their job at all and the mind set ""I am just trying to do my job"" is absolutely true.5) Hit and run: Really good visualization of what money can make people do. Basically if you have enough money, you carry a get out jail card with you. The twist in the end was really awesome, poor gardener.6) Wedding: This was my favorite story by far. It shows that how things can escalate quickly out of hand. Also it is easy to make bad decisions while under so much pressure like a wedding ceremony. I must say bride was really good and very nice acting. But I doubt that make up sex will solve their problem...Awesome movie, really effected me while being entertaining.",True

You never feel satisfied with short stories like that but in Relatos Salvajes you don't get that feeling. Every single story is fun to watch. They are all with a bit of violence , but that what's make it great. Watching people loosing it. I thought all the actors that participated in this movie did a great job.

23,n/a,Born to be.....,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSurprise, surprise. A wide (kinda) release for a Spanish language film, that's sub-titled, in a region such as this, where even film festivals struggle to find an audience (other than for 'those' 'specialty' flicks).Needless to say, anything that supposedly corrupts audience members in this region has been excised, so you can be sure that your moral compass remains intact even after viewing the sinful acts committed by the main leads in the 6 shorts that unfold.The first one, beginning something as a slow-burn dramatic thriller, was the perfect kinda short to grab everyone's attention by the eyeballs with its pitch-perfect/ironically poetic denouement.The 2nd one, consistently enough, continues the introduced theme of revenge, while being consistently slow-burn enough, ends with an appropriate (although a tad lesser) display of irony.The 3rd one, on the other hand, plays out like Steven Spielberg's 'Duel', or 'Joyride', and is very tight, perhaps the tightest of the bunch, and very effective. Overarching the theme of revenge, and a huge touch of irony towards its final sequences, especially, make it really special, almost dominating the very strong initial short.This almost immediately leads into the 4th segment - almost the longest of them all, and sets up the main lead as a lone/reluctant crusader against the typical stuff one Has to Put Up With nowadays, a la 'Falling down', or its local cousin, 'Dombivli Fast'. however, in spite of the time spent in characterization and the ironic sense of revenge, and pride, I felt it was the weakest of the bunch, since there was no sense of a hard payoff. However, this one had the strongest lead of them all, the Argentine De Niro - Ricardo Darin (Carancho / El secreto de sus ojos).The one that comes next though, sweeps aside the theme of revenge, but follow up on a theme introduced in its previous segment, Bombita, of a corrupt system allowing certain perpetrators of crime not to pay the price, for a (ahem) price. The sense of irony, though, is at its strongest in the narrative of this segment, especially when one of the characters who's been meek and kinda cowed down by circumstances starts exhibiting atypical responses, that lead to...ahem...you gotta watch it, and enjoy it.The final segment, embraces irony completely, and keeps you guessing right until its denouement, while eschewing revenge (umm, some might say its all about that emotion though - not for me) almost completely in favor of something even nastier, cutting-edge, and something that hurts immediately, right out in the open, almost completely naked (emotion). Powerful stuff, and wonderful in terms of the milieu against which the entire tale is enacted.A thoroughly entertaining time at the movies, but to be enjoyed theatrically only at a progressive location, unlike where I got to watch.",True
24,3,short hit and long miss,sugarfreepeppermint,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film isn't deserving of the excess of praise it has been lauded with. It's entertaining, thought provoking at times, but not by a long mile, a master piece.The third short is the most exciting. I would have much preferred this story to have been a main feature length road movie. It captures beautifully the lush landscapes of Argentina, underscored by an 80s Giorgio Moroder music soundtrack. Leonardo Sbraglia is excellent in the lead and so is the insane brute, hot on his heels.By the end of this third short however, the film has climaxed. And there's still more than 1,5 hours to follow. How is that time going to be filled?More shorts follow where the corruption of humans is exposed and offset against pitch black humour. They are criticisms against sick modern day over-bureaucratic societies, in this case Argentina (but it could be transposed to most other parts of the world). It shows how people create hell for each other; and how some puncture that infernal catch 22 to cathartic effect. It does a decent enough job at it.The 6th and last short film is a relentless frenzy of noise and visual chaos, and fittingly so, the story is also a convoluted mess. Unfortunately this short is the longest of them all. It makes the entire film end on a bum note for me. Annihilating all the goodwill, the director had garnered from me up until then.It made me realise that at no single point during any of the shorts, had I been emotionally touched, nor did I have a moment of intellectual revelation. The film is made up of smoke and mirrors, hiding the fact that there's no heart in the film. Nor is it a product of a great mind; just some half-finished ideas strung together to add up to the duration of one long feature. It's simply one of those movies that a certain public must see and talk highly of, because it's a case of the Emperor's new clothes, really.",False
25,10,"Very dark, very funny, extremely realistic",abisio,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wild Tales (Relatos Salvajes) is perhaps the darkest and funniest movie I saw in years; but is it really a comedy ?. No it is not. Six tales about human that are obviously related to the Argentinian reality (abusive government, corruption, people indifference) but certainly can be applied to many other countries in the world; USA included.Telling about each tale will cut the impact and somewhat surprise of each one. Let's just say that the outcome of each tale is sometimes predictable; but driven by logic not clichés.As always happens; some histories are better than others; but even that will be different for different viewers.In brief; an excellent movie that deserves to be seen by people with a brain and a will to think.",False

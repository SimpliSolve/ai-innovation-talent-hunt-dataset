1,3,"Jaye McBride killed it, all the rest ain't worth your time",eunbi0530,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't quite get Amy's text, she introduces ideas that aren't developed, for instance when she is saying her mum wrote scrapbook's for her and her siblings, wouldn't you expect her to talk about her and her siblings? She only talks about her, either she is too narcissistic or she can't write a cohesive text.Then we get to her first guest: Ron Funches. He has a story about how his first marriage prepared him for his second marriage, then he talks about how his second wife cares about his hydration, water this, water that, was I the only one expecting for him to say something like: ""she is preparing ground for if she leaves me everything will remind me of her: shower? Water. Pool? Water. Sea? Water. Rain? Water.""Jaye McBride follows and what an amazing comedian she is! She has some clever jokes and her text is well written, but she feels a bit awkward in stage.Back to Amy, she throw some quick jokes, all of them are bad and not funny, and she still manages to be cringe.Next is Christina Pazsitzky, she feels really comfortable on stage, but her text is all over the place, a few nice jokes though.Rachel Feinstein is presented as Amy Schumer's best friend, and I guess they have a similar sense of humour? Couldn't really find any of her material interesting, mediocre writing.Chris DiStefano, he sounds like a male Amy Schumer and it is as bad as it sounds.Lil Rel Howery is the last guest, it was a weird stage, some of it was funny, he would laught at his own jokes, but it felt like it was edited or he was rushed to end it?At the end they share some of their family pictures, and all, but Christina Pazsitzky, share their family pictures - mostly pictures of themselves younger. What is the point on having a show about family if you ain't sharing pictures of your own?",True
2,4,Well...,stevenswig,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't say I was bored, but I didn't laugh either. It's like normal people telling stories that are kind of interesting. Nothing special about this special.",False
3,4,Not a very good line up,MikeHunt1075,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amy Schumar hosts a Netflix is a joke night of her comedian friends and proves just because they're your friends, doesn't make it a good line up for comedy.I have no idea who any of these people where, and still don't. Jaye McBride was the only comedian appearing here who actually made me laugh. The rest where pretty poor to mediocre having only maybe one decent joke in their routine, if that, and usually as their final joke.If Jaye McBrides bit if on the Tube of You, maybe check that one out, but don't bother with the rest. Even Amy's sets are not her best work, and she comes off more sounding full of herself for real than playing it up for laughs.",False
4,1,Trainwreck,79lt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jaye McBride is great, and Rachael Feinstein is always funny (although how hard can she flog the Staten Island firefighter horse for material).The rest is unfunny and awkward, and the selection of comics is not at all cohesive. What genius thought it would be fun to have Christina P's casual transphobia on the same show as Jaye McBride? Like all her current angry white mom material, it's about as funny as moving from LA to Austin to avoid taxes.Netflix is a joke has other great specials with multiple comedians, like Ladies Night Live with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin; and Stand Out (Wanda Sykes etc etc).",False
5,n/a,"3/10. Mostly groans instead of laughs. If you want to see a much better group from 2022 ""Netflix is a joke"" festival, see Bill Burr's group from last week or Pete Davidison.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSchumer hits the stage first. She does what every comedian has done over the last year, tackles COVID. Yawn. In fact you have heard this joke before. She makes a few covid jokes. Which get more groans than laughs, deservedly so as the jokes were subpar and not really funny. She makes a few ""new mom"" jokes, complete with old unoriginal mother-in-law trope stories. She doesn't seem to realize that a zillion women comedians have told the same set of jokes a zillion times before. We then get an a tramp stamp joke that garner simply a forced audience chuckle in politeness.First up in the line up of showcased comedians is Ron Funchess, who also has nothing original at all. Lots of jokes fall flat I had never seen Funchess 's work before, and after seeing this, I am not seeking to watch anymore. The special is ""0-2"" so far.The next comedian is Jaye McBride. Great, a covid joke followed by a covid sex joke. Zzzzzzzz. Then a politically correct trans joke that is a big swing and big miss. Don't quit your day job Jaye.OK, Schumer comes out again to try and save it. She tells a ""Oscars slap"" joke that goes nowhere, and a few ""Oscars"" jokes she claims the Academy refused to allow her to do. They are the opposite of edgy. One gets the scene that Schumer thinks her audience is dim and feels the needs to over-explain her jokes . IWe have reached the point where most people may turn off this special. The show continues its descent into mediocrityOverall, the one or two good jokes can't outweigh the truly bad parts of this special. I had strong expectations for this, and I wanted to turn it off several times. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.If you want to see edgy, smart and relentlessly funny, see the Netflix outings by Chapelle, Gervais, and the curated new comedians with Burr or Davidson's ""Netflix is a joke"" from last month.",True
6,1,God I wish I could rate this lower,daken-67544,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish Amy Schumer would just go away. She isn't funny, has no talent and invites people that are just like her.Save your time and don't watch this or anything with her. She isn't Bold and Powerful she is just sad and Pathetic.",False
7,1,Extremely disappointing,caseypthompson,n/a,16/08/2025,"It felt really awkward the whole time, especially Christina Pazsitzky (condescending and rude). Bad jokes, weird mix of comedians and even the audience wasn't that engaged. Like there wasn't a lot of rolling laughter. In fact a lot of the comedians seemed to have a lot of arrogance. I really like Amy Schumer, but I have no idea why she chose these people. Did she read their jokes first? My spouse and I chuckled a few times and by the time Christina rolled around we were just confused about what the heck was happening and then some guy started with the dead dog jokes and we were like ""eh, nope"".There's a lot of dark humor which I usually like, but these are just bad dark jokes.An absolute no for me.",False
8,2,I so glad I not the only one!,dorrioconnor,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like all these comedians. Truly thought this was going to be good! If it wasn't for McBride, this would have been a Tuesday night local bar talent show! It was so bad, I came on here to see if it was just me?! McBride is the only one who showed up as a stand up comedian! She had a well written set, some good jokes, and delivered well! The rest was just sloppy! Lame. Seriously! I have seen better professionalism from cruise comedians at their ""family friendly"" matinee show! What happened? I get it, some sets are better than others. It just surprising to see a Netflix special of a group of talented comedians, and only one knew what she was doing! And it wasn't AMY!",False
9,1,"Should have left the "" friends"" home",mgentalen,n/a,16/08/2025,"What is this new thing of having a name emcee, then five ' friends"" having a set? I don't care what Lil Rel or Ron or the others have to say, I am sure they are great people in private, but this special was far from special. I would have preferred one hour of just Amy; I just don't find ' family life jokes "" laughable. Maybe I don't "" relate"" as I don't have a kid, but this wasn't good. Come on guys.Such a shame. I had high hopes for the Netflix is a Joke, but third let down..",False
10,1,Gross Dude!,txenergyattorney,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix used to have a mediocre rating system, but it at least left you the ability to rate on 5 levels (I think). Then Amy complained that her special was rated very low by those misogynistic Conservatives who don't approve of her brand of gross out humor. Shortly thereafter Netflix scrapped the rating system and went with the useless thumbs up or down system. All the more reason to check out IMDB for every show! (Not perfect, but still the most helpful). Right now new show is at 2.7 on IMDB, which appears very generous.Amy Schumer is not remotely funny (maybe to a middle schooler seeing their first bit of dirty humor...and that's a big maybe). She is getting grosser and meaner as time goes by. And she is increasing the value of Dave Chapelle in the comedy world. Watch Amy then any of Chappelle's shows right after. Amy couldn't carry Dave's jock strap!",False
11,1,"Humor is not dead, but woke humor is just not funny",ralphhelm-69745,n/a,16/08/2025,"What do I mean by ""woke humor""? By that I mean the try to make fun without mentioning any of the subjects any person might find offensive and only talking about stereotype subjects which have been disproven (like the pay gap, the glass ceiling, all men are bad atc ...) which are also offensive, but only against people those who want to make the rules tell us it's ok to make fun of. Oh, and if you don't agree you are obviously an *ist and a *phobe.So what do we get here? Misandry and heterophobia which are supposed to be funny, but are simply sterile, tasteless, uninteresting and not very thought of attempts of jokes.Amy Schumer is not funny, not for one cent and I don't think even anyone from her ideological echo-chamber could claim the contrary.",False
12,2,What happened,clg1983,n/a,16/08/2025,"WTH! How did a pool full of good to great comedians Netflix gathered all bomb so hard? Yeah, there was moments of giggles but it's like the Netflix check was so... idgaf that they spewed top of head goo. Maybe I am being too harsh cause there are a few gems in this new bout of Netflix conglomerate comedy specials.Amy started this fiasco in her headliner from the start. Her richer than tho Schlick hurts in todays world. Happy life don't give a **** humor is old and unwelcome. She's rich and we get it. Glad for it and happy we helped you get there. Just wrong climate even sarcastically. Remember all the great humor when these comics were hungry vs the specials running now.The greats learn from, build from, move on from, to not repeat again on their 'what did I just do for money moments.Let's hope the comics showcased here and the rest of the Netflix's (help keep us alive service) can make us laugh past todays troubles again and not turn the handle to rotisserie us in this heat.And yes it truly was A Netflix hAs become A Joke Festival.",False
13,2,Out of respect...,lucianmmatei,n/a,16/08/2025,"...I gave it two stars. Holly santa....seriously? So I am not going to those rund down pubs to watch so called standups, so now that has been brought to me unasked straight into my room. Thanks Amy, you did way better before. Hope you get yourself together.",False
14,1,"No, oh no. She is lost up there",iamjamalwhite,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sad. Saw her a decade ago in person. She was hilarious, on it, current. This new 2022 show, not. This was disappointing and just sad. Unfunny. There are people leaving during the show. Sad and unfunny.",False
15,4,Fantastic Comedians; Horrendous Crowd,cuzinit-90838,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not sure Why Netflix put this out with this crowd. This was the most dead, uptight crowd for a Comedy special I have ever seen in my life. They could have done this in a morgue and at least one of the bodies would have farted here and there because that would be more reaction from the crowd than this theater had. The comedians were all pretty much really good, but you could tell the crowd was bringing them down and killing the vibe of the whole thing. Amy was trying to butter them up as much as possible. But when you have a crowd like this, it kills a show. It felt like these people thought they were going to a PTA meeting and ended up at a comedy show with no clue what to do with themselves. I mean seriously. Netflix couldn't even just pump in some fake laughter to the theater to sort of get the crowd going better? That's a thing they can do you know? I felt bad. It felt like watching comedians bomb, not because of their material which was good, but because the crowd was like a morgue. Seriously! Film multiple takes, multiple crowds. Get the best ones. Don't just put out a show with a dead crowd. They might as well have had a room full of caskets instead of people in chairs. This is why people don't like Netflix so much anymore. It's not password sharing, it's lack of decently produced and polished material that is the problem. You don't put out a live comedy special with a crowd who thinks they're at the library. You just don't. You do it over and over until you get it right and you use production means to make it better. It just felt so awkward and the comedians felt just as akward, you could tell. Bad call Netflix. Bad call. I feel bad for the Comedians who don't get a good exposure now because of the tension and just overall horribleness of that crowd.",False
16,1,Tone Deaf,cidadeboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I normally love Amy Schumer but this was an extremely offensive show. Jaye McBride was the only saving grace. She was really, really good. After Chris DiStefano, we turned it off, he was so awful. So disappointed and really surprised that Amy would promote this sort of ""humor"" which was really insulting.",False
17,5,I should have read some reviews before watching,Harlowwinslet-292-209346,n/a,16/08/2025,Amy was funny but the rest was just eh. I know it's hard for stand up comics now because everything is off limits but this was truly rough. I could have skipped this.,False
18,8,Haters,jessimartone,n/a,16/08/2025,I love how all the people who commented didn't like Amy Schumer before. Well of course if you didn't like her before you didn't like her after. Let's hear from the Schumer fans of the World. Also if you have issues with people making jokes about certain issues get over it! THEY ARE JOKES!! ! If you have an issue with jokes don't watch stand up!,False

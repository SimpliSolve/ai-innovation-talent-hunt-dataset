1,10,"Nothing Left To Do But Smile, Smile, Smile",janiceforlife,n/a,17/08/2025,"Lon Frazier did an amazing job explaining the cultural experience of The Grateful Dead. Listening to each of the documentary guests and Lon share their experiences, seeing the photos and video clips took me back to my own time of stumbling into this magical experience when I needed it in my life. The music, the kindness and the love in the community is the most uplifting experience anyone can ask for. Lon brought the experience to life again through this documentary. I recommend all Deadheads watch this and share with others who are unfamiliar with the experience so they may be uplifted as well! Great job Lon!",False
2,10,Marvelous!,rkristopher-85935,n/a,17/08/2025,"Here is the wonderful thing about this film: While avid Grateful Dead fans will obviously love Box of Rain, it's appeal comes in many forms outside of mere admiration for the Grateful Dead.More so than being a film about a band, it's largely about how a band or style of music can create a certain dynamic when it weaves itself within one's life at a particular time. It's a film about freedom and self-discovery...inspiration and admiration. It's a film about LIFE.Box of Rain manages something not easily accomplished in documentary film making- which is to meld all of the most interesting and desirable aspects of good story telling into a immensely enjoyable watch.",False
3,10,Love will see you through,sswann-06533,n/a,17/08/2025,"Lonnie Frazier has created a wonderful addition to the archives of the Grateful Dead and Deadhead history with her documentary Box of Rain.With heartfelt honesty and bravery, Frazier shares her personal journey to the land of the Dead. And she opens the space for others to share their journeys along the way, illuminated by happy meet ups, warm memories, wonderment and love for that band beyond description that has changed all of our lives for the better.This film stands as a testament to that magic that we know and love so well. And as a testament to the Deadhead community and that there really is goodness in the world.",False
4,10,"Deadheads, Woodstock Fans, Women Survivors - this one if for you!",martabethleipzig,n/a,17/08/2025,"Buckle up for a journey you won't forget. Lonnie Frazier in her debut documentary takes on a colorful, profoundly touching, cross-country road trip visiting longtime devotees of the Grateful Dead along the way. You'll be treated to vivid flashbacks, vintage photography, and most of all the introspective reflections on how the Dead community enriched the lives of so many. Lonnie, herself, a survivor of a brutal assault, recounts how discovering the Dead brought her back to life. Hers is just one intimate story shared in this beautiful, life-transforming film that reaffirms how music can heal the soul like nothing else. Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.",False
5,10,For those not allowed to go,echousmc,n/a,17/08/2025,"Growing up in a xenophobic household with boomer parents, the Dead were like a fairytale. Folks traveling together, free, authentic, and full of passion. Box of Rain made me jealous, sad, and nostalgic at the same time. Having missed that ride and now with a mortgage and family, I get to vicariously go along with Box if Rain and glimpse what was.",False
6,10,Must see for Deadheads,glennlowe-65652,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's cool to see Deadheads share their stories of how it was like to follow the Grateful Dead around the country.If you're a Deadhead, I'm certain watching this will bring you back to those great times you had sharing the magic that is the Grateful Dead.Most importantly though, this documentary is about Lonnie's personal journey and how being a Deadhead gave her a place that she could call home.It's about the wonderful people she met, the unforgettable memories, and the bond created between a group of people that is everlasting.Enjoy the journey!",False
7,10,"A box of rain will ease the pain, and love will see you through",mikehonig,n/a,17/08/2025,Lovely story of discovery and renewal. Watch it over and over to catch all the cosmic love letters and tales from the various narrators.Lonnie and team did a great job curating these scenes and contributors.,False
8,10,Great film about an overlooked American Subculture,louisesawyer-32336,n/a,17/08/2025,"Really enjoyable and relatable film that explores an interesting American Subculture: Deadheads. Deadheads are super fans of the Grateful Dead. They created their own community and culture with their own set of rules and traditions. Box of Rain shows those of us who weren't part of that community what it was all about, and undoubtably will take Deadheads on an enjoyable trip down memory lane. The archival photos and footage really brought the scene to life. Especially when combined with the interviews! The filmmakers interviewed a whole range of people, from fans who only saw a few shows, to some very prominent Deadheads. The whole film is tied together with the story of how the director got involved with the Deadhead community in the early 1980s and how it changed her life. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who loves music, travel, and anyone who dances to the beat of their own drummer. Or in the case of the Grateful Dead, two drummers.",False
9,10,The Grateful Dead made me visit Red Rocks Ampitheater,thehapagirl,n/a,17/08/2025,I learned about the Red Rocks Ampitheater from a Grateful Dead documentary. I was born in 1992 so I wasn't a boomer or Gen X Grateful Dead fan in their heyday. My parents weren't either. My mom was born and raised in SoCal like me and my dad in Hawaii. Laid back lifestyle like many Deadhead fans but my parents never got into their music even though they're the prime age. I got into the Grateful Dead on my own. I saw Red Rocks for the first time this year. So much fun. I wonder what it would've been like had I grown up here in SoCal in the 70's like my mom. But yeah Red Rocks is beautiful. I wish I could post a picture.,False

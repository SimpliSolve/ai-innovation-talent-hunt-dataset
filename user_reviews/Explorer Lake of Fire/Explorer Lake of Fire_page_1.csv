1,3,Waste of time,TiaraB-69,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGlad no one was harmed. I admired the enthusiasm and courage of the group but all this gave the me was DRAMA AND DISAPPOINTMENT.DRAMA
It showed the struggles of the team and challenges that nature gives. I've watched other documentaries which featured way more difficult climbs than this so I don't know why this appeared more dramatic to the point it bored me Sorry, I am not impressed by the ""This will not break me!"" declaration of the doctor. I thought you prepared for this? It has not been 4 hours that you were climbing with that weather. Again, I have watched far more difficult climbs than this and the climbers were not as dramatic as the doctor so whatever.DISAPPOINTMENT
This did not provide anything whatsoever of the much-awaited volcano. No deep dive analysis nor useful info about the volcano. In the end, they just used a drone and showed a hole with lava AND THAT JUST IT!",True

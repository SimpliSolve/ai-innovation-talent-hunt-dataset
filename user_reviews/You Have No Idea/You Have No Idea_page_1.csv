4,9,Heartwarming And Honest Presentation,mtcsr,n/a,16/08/2025,"You Have No Idea is a heartwarming, thoughtful and candid look inside the day-to-day challenges, struggles, and joys of raising a child with autism, during a time when precious little was known about it, and the continued and necessary love, care and commitment when that child grows into an adult that depends on those things.Beth's determination to prepare Evan for his best life is inspiring, and I was moved by the friends and family that gathered around them to create a ""village"" to support them in that endeavor.I really enjoyed seeing the interactions between Paul and Beth's blended family, the honest assessments from family and friends, the video clips of everyday moments, and the obvious love they have for Evan and each other.You Have No Idea is educational, moving, and a joy to experience. Enthusiastically recommended!",False

The reveal of where the title comes from is also a favorite moment.""'You Have No Idea' is a captivating documentary that delves deep into its subject matter. With compelling storytelling and powerful insights, this film educates and entertains. A must-watch for documentary enthusiasts!""",False

7,9,A documentary that everyone can relate to,carusoambrosia,n/a,16/08/2025,"""You Have No Idea"" is poignant, timely and raw. It lifts back the curtain and provides a loving inside look at a family in southern Arkansas and their journey with an autism diagnosis since the early 90s.As much as the film captures raw emotions, it also shows how the family navigated the muddy waters of medical knowledge at the time and discovered things that worked for their son along the way. I think anyone who watches this will not only fall in love with Evan, but also be in awe of Beth and her advocacy for not only her son, but the other children in her community.The film depicts the importance of community and lifelong friendships - how bringing people in to your life with openness and honesty creates a better situation for everyone.",False
8,10,Such a great movie!!!,madilyn_bonsall,n/a,16/08/2025,"You Have No Idea is one of the best and sweetest movies I've ever watched! It was heartwarming, educational, and really drew you in from the moment it began. I would watch this movie over and over if I could. Beth is an amazing mother to Evan and that's so clearly seen throughout the film. Being from El Dorado, I can easily say that there is a community there like no other, and it's so heartwarming to see the community that is surrounding Evan and the James family. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in learning more about Autism or just to anyone wanting to watch a good heartwarming movie!!",False

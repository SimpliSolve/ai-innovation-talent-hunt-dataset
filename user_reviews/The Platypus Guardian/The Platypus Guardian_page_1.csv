1,9,Strong nature/animal/human film,neongen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not often a documentary allows for a focus on a human helping a wild animal that contains a meaningful message for its community. Viewer gets to care about the individual animals in the film and the circumstances in which they live. Narrator/human in the film makes a difference for the subject of his interest . Nice connection to film maker's medical condition and the problems of the animals he follows and helps. Good blend of mystery, emotional investment and explanation of the world in which these animals live. Don't recall seeing another animal/urban setting piece that has the same film maker involvement..",False

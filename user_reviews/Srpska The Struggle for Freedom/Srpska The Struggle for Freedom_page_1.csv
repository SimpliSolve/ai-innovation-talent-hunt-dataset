1,7,"not as controversial as you may have heard, yet broadly informative",Aylmer,n/a,16/08/2025,"For anyone expecting something shocking and outrageous, this film will somewhat disappoint. I had heard a lot about activist groups trying to block this film from screening in certain countries but such a reputation only makes the film more intriguing than it actually turns out to be.I did learn a lot here though as this well-produced documentary fills in the gaps on what the difference is between Bosnian Serbs, Bosniaks, and Serbians in the country of Serbia. Having grown up in America in the 90's with only mainstream news filling me in on the details, I had never been all too clear on the conflict other than it being some sort of ethnic tension over the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Is the documentary biased in favor of the Bosnian Serbs just as American media was biased against them? Certainly, however the documentary does maintain some surprisingly balanced objectivity in its discussion of the war crimes committed by both sides.This film invests heavily in two areas; the lengthy history of how the Bosnian Serbs got to where they are today and some travelogue style celebration of their current culture and historical sites. We see the host take us skiing, sample cuisine, dance with a basement band, and leap off a historic bridge into the Neretva. However, the film does not really tie things into the current geopolitical environment at all. It seems to avoid discussing the relationship between the Bosnian Serbs and the country of Serbia at all. Do the Bosnian Serbs actually enjoy the status quo, or do they want to be absorbed into the Greater Serbia? What would happen then? Would we get another situation similar to the Donbas situation of 2014, or is the current situation a result of fatigue over so many years of war already? These questions may be obvious to Serbian viewers, but would need to be answered to help persuade an outsider like myself in one way or another. I was left confused over what the thrust was, other than to make us think a little differently about the 90's Balkan Wars from what was presented by the mainstream media.It did give me a new impression of why Serbs may be considered so ""dangerous"" by so many invading powers in that they have a strong tradition of liberty for hundreds of years. It makes a few broad, disputable historical claims to the point but makes no mention of the Yugoslavian Monarchy or the Chetnik Royalists (which significantly would muddy the waters), but overall stands as a valuable piece to balance out what we've heard elsewhere.",False
2,10,Informative and objective documentary. Highly recommend.,cxsgcg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Despite what some groups may think of the film, it does not push any agendas or nationalism. It is highly informative and objective, presenting facts throughout history. It doesn't deny genocide or anything like that. It recognises wrongdoings of the past but also wrongdoings that happened to the Serbs. It very very balanced.I recommend people to go watch it and go with an open mind if they have preconceived notions as to what it is.I was very impressed with it. It doesn't try to sway you with emotional music throughout like many documentaries/movies are known to do. A proper documentary. Well done Boris and team.",False
3,10,Recommend for watching,mare-89247,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very professionally made documentary movie. I suggest to anyone who want to learn about the history of a Serbian people in Bosnia to watch it. Objective and human film which reveals many things you didn't know.From Middle Ages to modern times film shows the history of that part of Balkan peninsula and in the same
way showing the natural beauty of this country.Scenario is very interesting and marks also wilt some very funny sequences the tradition and some specialities of this region. I recommend this film specially to the people living other parts of Europe and the world because that can learn something about the country they really don't know much.",False
4,10,Very objective Movie!,mcdcycnw,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Film was very objective and absolutely informative. The history of the Serbs was presented concretely, without omitting the other sides, or even putting them in the negative background.Above all, I liked the way the narrator of Main character conveyed the Story of the film. Also, the presentation of the places where this story took place was wonderfully staged and gives the audience an absolute sense of presence und the film and in the theme of the film. By conveying the theme and this story, the suspense of the film remains at the highest level Form beginning to end.I'm already looking forward to the next film!Amazing!",False
5,9,Very informative movie about the history of the Serbs in BIH,fabianvendrig,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this movie and it is a very interesting movie about the history of the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The movie really portrays it very well.There is no hate speech neither there is any denying of any crimes from any side which some people were advocating without even having seen the movie.It is really a must to see this movie and to get a more objective view of the history of the Serbs in BIH. I highly recommend this movie, because too many times we have seen movies and documentaries which are only portraying one side of the story.Mr. Malagurski managed with this movie to finally show also the other side of the story which was never shown. It is hardly needed that, thanks to this movie, a greater audience is able to see a more objective view on the history of Bosnia-Herzegovina.",False
6,10,History of Bosnia and the region explained in a very entertaining way,nenadluk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good and pretty objective movie about history of Republika Srpska and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the region as well. Production is at very high level and storytelling too. The movie is made with high standarad and it combines new beautiful footages with other sources of video materials. Narration is high level and it keeped my attention during the whole movie. If you want to learn about Serbian history and history of Bosnia, this is the movie you should deffinitely watch. Malagurski cinema showed once again that they know how to make great documentaries which will drove attention of public for selected topic.",False
7,1,Extremely biased!,xqyckbbd,n/a,16/08/2025,"How can anybody call this objective. This is Serbian nationalism at its best. Terrible!The people from former Yugoslavia know the truth, there was no nation being completely innocent in decomposing of Yugoslavia but Serbs from Serbia and Serbs from Bosnia and Hercegovina definitely have done most of atrocities. There is historically no doubt about it.It may be nice for foreigners to be presented with heroic Serbian nation through centuries, being the victims of big and powerful countries, and now being the victim of an international plot of Western countries. However, the world knows who was the aggressor and who was the victim.",False
8,10,Rs borba za slobodu / The struggle for freedom,perokovljenic,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film shows all three entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It describes the development of the country before the First World War until today. The tradition in the Balkans is also shown and that all the population groups have a lot in common. Also the atrocities during the civil war, which happened on all three sides, are addressed. In general, a very informative film, which brings the hospitality and the happiness of the Balkans closer to the world. Boris Malagurski has again created a great work which shows once again who the people in the Balkans are. It was an honor for me to be at the premiere and to get to know a great person with Boris.",True

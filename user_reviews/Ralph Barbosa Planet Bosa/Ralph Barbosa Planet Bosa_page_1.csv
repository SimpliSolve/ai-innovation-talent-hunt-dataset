1,5,Practice makes perfect,stevendillon,n/a,16/08/2025,He is a fun y comedian and has been doing a lot the past couple years.... This feels like it was a good hour that needed about another 4 months to clean up the silence and a few of the punch lines could have hit harder and that all comes from running the hour relentlessly even after you think it's ready. I'd say this was a money grab. Joe DeRosa just released one and wanted to a year ago and his friends kept saying no keep running it it's not ready... And it was epic.,False

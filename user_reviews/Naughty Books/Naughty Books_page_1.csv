2,8,much to consider,taylmarianne-79981,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere's a great deal to consider in this film. Yes, it is noted that one could profile these women in many ways. However, these ladies are well aware of their deficiencies. They know only to well they are overweight, have poor educations in many cases and so on. They are to be commended because they have managed to survive anyway.Please understand these ladies are, in many ways pioneers. As a world we are in the early years of Self publishing, Amazon, pod casts, blogs and so on. Ten or fifteen years ago, none of this existed. It's anyone's guess what all this will look in another twenty years. Most of these ladies are approximately between 30 and fifty's? How many of these people will write into their 70's and 80'? A guess is not too many, for a variety of reasons. Worth watching.",True

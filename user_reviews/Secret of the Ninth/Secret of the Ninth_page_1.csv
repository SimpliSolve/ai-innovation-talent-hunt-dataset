1,10,MASTERPIECE,Shams74,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary about the Egyptian club Al-Ahly achieving the title of the African Champions League for the ninth time (2020) after failing to achieve the title since 2013, and the film revolves in several chapters between failure and fear until we reach the title.",False
2,10,"""As a player I also say either I win or die..."" Al-Ahly player Mahmoud Metwaly",KareemHassan5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Secret of the Ninth is a really wonderful documentary, It is very breathtaking, it shows how it was very hard for the players to win the championship and that they suffered a lot to win, how the players could die in Sudan just because they are playing football, how the players were terrified but didn't lose their Perseverance and determination to win even if they are going to be hurt. They just want to win no matter what !
It shows how Al-Ahly players played like an army of one not for the person, they played for the fans, They wanted to make history by their own, and the documentary showed that very well, the dialogues with the players were great, the exclusive photos and videos from the trainings and in the matches are great too.
The documentary will give you that goosebumps felling, it will make you feel proud that you love and support this club "" if you are an Al-Ahly fan of course "". If not, then it will be good for you to know how this club is so big and famous and I'm sure this documentary will make you love this club, these players and those fans.
In the end, we all must know that "" A few may leave. but Al-Ahly remains unbreakable.""",False

1,6,I think 6 stars is accurate...,NYCsOwnPiTO,n/a,16/08/2025,"Comedy is about more than what the comedian is talking about it's about where it's coming from whether or not it's true and whether or not we can relate to it so in the definition of a true standup comedy show I think he nailed it because it was actually funny. I saw two stars and four stars and I don't think that's realistic because it's more than whether or not you were offended by it. It was still funny and it was even funnier the way he told it I read one review that was titled I'm not easily offended, but why would you be offended by someone else's pain? I thought that was pretty corny Marlon is a staple in the comedy scene. I think no matter what he talks about It's going to be funny Because he's just a funny person. Six stars is pretty accurate.",False
2,2,I'm JUST BEING HONEST!,hiphopphotos,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I'm an old die-hart fan of the Wayans family, I was excited optimistic and hopeful that I would not only get some good laughs, but that I would have some insight on a family we all wish we had. Sadly, I was disappointed-I'm certain his jokes came from a place of pain but I don't think the audience really needed an insight on his experiences that were all but funny! I sat there watching in wonder of what his famous siblings thought! I even tried to understand the funny flip side of it all, but unfortunately that side never flipped. I did chuckle when he discussed the 'great Shaquille O'Neal-but that smile was quickly saddened when he noted who should've been killed from all great NBA giants.",False
3,4,Depressing and vulgar,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's 2 critic reviews on this show and both clearly have a sense of closeness to Marlon that I don't have, blubbering on and on about the honesty and vulnerability of this comedy special. But I, personally, don't tap Play on a comedy to hear about death, regret, and heartache. Especially not with the N word substituted for each verb, adjective and comma. Think of the last time you heard your male cousins all in the corner of the yard at the bbq trying to console that one dude that got stood up, spit on, run over all in one week. Marlon is that one dude here. But unlike that backyard convo where the N word substitutes for feelings and the meaning changes by the way its said, here Marlon seems to be just trying to use it as a way to interrupt the heavy topics, like someone insulting you but calling you babe and honey in between to throw you off.I skipped ahead a few times but that didn't get me past the droning self-examination and geriatric potty humor.If you want to reflect on how you've treated your parents and listen to revelations about life and death, then give this a try.",False
4,10,"Over the line, vulgar, and Originally Brilliant",jpclevprops,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is my facorite comedic special of the year if your ride with it. I don't usually like this guy, but this older more mature version is turning up. I am optimistic for the second half of his career.The content in this special is raw, and you will not see Netflix specials that come close to the level of vulgarity and sometimes meanness that Wayans exhibits.No one has really touched on the topics he does in this special and it is hilarious if you ride with it. He goes much farther than you I was expecting or frankly ready for him to go.But he brings it back on track in each circumstance, keeping it light while playing with the darkness. I hope folks respect this for the masterpiece it is. Its apparent he (and probably his team also) put a lot of work into this.",False
5,2,"Not Easily Offended, But",seansoulo73,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo I tried to stomach as much as I could of this Marlon special after barely making it thru his last one. Sadly, I had to turn this one off after the attack on Magic, his disease and his trans child. But worse than that was his overboard attempt at making his elderly parents genitals funny. Damn, it just wasn't and I was weirded out for all of his brother's and sisters that had to watch this bit. Sorry, but this healing journey was a lil sick and twisted bruh! A man explaining his mother's punani for a bunch of strangers was way too weird and not in a funny way. Then making light of which Laker should have died instead of Kobe? I'm from the City of Champions and none of that ish about Kobe, Shaq or Magic was funny. I had to turn it off. This special solidified that Marlon is more of a clown than comic.",True
6,10,A Must See,theblueprintfmm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pure comedic genius and authenticity. Marlon gave the audience an intimate look into his family life and dealing with life issues such as grief/depression, through a comedic lense. One second, I'm laughing and the next, I'm crying. The show really made me think about the most important things in life while keeping me laughing nonstop, quite literally. This show is a must see. I don't write reviews often but I thought I would be doing others a disservice by withholding my opinion in this scenario. I like to let others know when I have found a true gem. I have always been a huge Marlon Wayans fan but this allows me to see him in a more intimate way.",False
7,4,Yikes,ubalmond,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI rated this as a 6 as I was watching it because I love Marlon and he had me laughing some but it was more crass than funny, like a high school class clown standing up in class and making jokes more to cringe and laugh awkwardly than to laugh from wit and cleverness. Granted, class clowning is the wayan brand so I wasn't going to doc because of that. But I simply wasn't laughing enough for a higher rating. It was more nostalgic than anything.HOWEVER, when he got to the segment about Magic Johnson, talking about how he has AIDS and his son is gay so that means double AIDS, that's not just offensive as in a joke that hits a nerve. It's inaccurate (Johnson is HIV+ which is not at all AIDS, this spreads false and dangerous information about the disease that already cause so much more stigma than needed) but it is also prejudice against gay men. AIDS has not been a ""gay"" disease since the early 90s - anyone can get it and anyone does. It was a very ignorant and ill informed joke about a stereotype that doesn't even exist. That is definitely not helping that audience with their existing prejudices against gays and people with HIV. I had to turn it off after this segment. Kind of ruined it for me. And I have a very strong stomach for offensive jokes in standup. I've never not finished one.",True
8,2,Describing his parents genitals and lots of N word,mluinstra,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was not funny. He was cracking himself up a lot though. I haven't heard the N word used so much since....never.He then does a detailed routine on both of his parents genitals. It was cringe as hell. He also talks about changing their diapers, which was brutal as well. Then he changes gears and talks about how much he loves his mama? Wierd.Even worse, he talks about which Laker should have died instead of Kobi. He does a whole routine on it.I like dark humor, and jokes should be taken as such, but you need to make it funny. I didn't find him funny at all.He did have one truth in his routine when he said that the most funny Wayans was his mother. All I know is it's not Marlon.",False
9,10,Keep it real!,Papa-Moe-88,n/a,16/08/2025,"What I enjoyed most about this performance was the honesty and heart felt moments. I can tell you wanted people to feel a little hint of what you might be going through with your craft. I applaud you for it.Which explains the title good grief, very clever. Dark humor can definitely get overwhelming sometimes. On the other hand, it did not make me want to stop watching. By the end of the show I actually forgot about the dark.When you started talking about what you're going through that's what stood out the most and being able to make me laugh and feel I was very entertained. It was a roller coaster of emotions.Keep up the hard work and ignore the haters. This will go down as one of your best performances. Well done. Very well done.",False
10,10,Comedic Genius,tntvrn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I truly enjoyed this special. It was raw, unapologetic, and relatable. This man poured his heart out on the stage and did it with the upmost skill and finesse that only true artists can achieve. Many reviewers expressed their displeasure with his language and subject matter, but nonetheless, the old adage rings true ""there's many a truth in jest."" This man spoke his truth in his darkest hour and for that alone no one can truly provide a rating for the level of humanity he displayed and realness he craftily demonstrated during his special.I laughed, cried, and celebrated alongside Marlon as he took us through a comedic memoir of his childhood, career, and personal journey. Everything doesn't always have to be done within the boundaries of this new society's fragile constraints around political correctness and aversion to being offended sometimes. There's really no place for that mentality, especially in comedy. When you compare him to the likes of a Richard Pryor, Paul Mooney, or the the many other greats...he's in lockstep with their uncanny ability to be both crass but also witty and funny at the same time.This man was legit funny and has undoubtedly demonstrated growth in his craft, and I can't wait to see what else he has in store.",False
11,9,Gotta laugh to keep from cryin',missvhunter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being a person who critically watches most productions, I trust that finishing it & watching til the very end would've made all the difference & bought it all home!I saw S1E1 as a definite comedic juxtaposition of joy & pain, life & death. Found it to be a heartfelt & heart-full ""Wayans"" project worthy of every laugh an outsider could munster up & give in the vein of ""good grief.""
And the SMH references & roastings of some leading vet Celebs was like the litmus test for Wayans' emotional extremes.Those ""oh boyyy wow-did he go there jokes"" I saw them as exaggerated takes on his own everlasting & overwhelming Grief...
Marlon took it as far as his LOL mind could but with a consistent thread of Humanity, Hope, Healing & Honor 🎖 in his own 'kid @ heart' Marlon slapstick kinda way.I think true comedy appreciators would definitely find it giggle worthy & see the art imitating life parralels.And if there's any truth to his Mom being the comedy springboard of the Wayans family...then I would think she gave ""her baby Marlon"" her total blessing to take his ""off-brand of humor"" ALL the way!...just my opinion 😉🍷
O, and also: minus the profanity, I was actually wondering if my deceased parents could've or would've found him entertaining or atleast artistically amusing. If they had a clean version recorded, I surely woulda tried to watch with an 80+ year old for their sense of humor commentary.✍🏽",False

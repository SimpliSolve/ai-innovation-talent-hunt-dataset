1,6,Not a good documentary but artistic one,Oguzhan06,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie tells about NÃ¼khet Duru who is a legend in Turkish music by that time. We get a chance to watch the process of making her last album with other young Turkish musicians in this movie.
Unfortunately, we can't get much chronological information about her life and her musical journey through different periods of Turkish music. But we get to know her by the end of the movie. One way or another, she speaks candidly of herself and sometimes she exaggerates herself a little bit but she has a right to do it for sure.
I think the most important of all is that Istanbul scenes. These are the most delicious ones, and I can definitely say that those scenes will give you perfect pleasure. You may want to watch it with one another with a good conversation and greatest artistic pleasure.",False

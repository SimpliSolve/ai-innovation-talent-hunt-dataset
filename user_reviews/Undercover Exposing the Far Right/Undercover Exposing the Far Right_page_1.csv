1,2,Smooth But Shallow,dude-56-495337,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was reasonably put together for the first half, but quite quickly started to fall apart. It seems to draw in countless elements such as British Fascism from the 1920s, British nationalism from the 1970s, social disorder from contemporary times, 'race science' enthusiasts from the same period, Tommy Robinson, far-Right political groups, a nod to Hitler's SS etc etc and in the end, apart from the emotivism, one is left with a jumbled mess. The danger seems to be 'everywhere' and everything the filmmakers shine their camera or their outrage archeology archive footage researcher on. The lack of focus, the lack of a consistent underlying argument meant it will be quickly forgotten.",False
2,10,Nail-Biting Ride Following Undercover Heroes,wkrhdf,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an eye-opening thriller of a doc, following two modest young men in a perilous undercover operation to expose a far right group. They work for Hope Not Hate, which has been battling racism for years - this is the first time they've let the cameras in. From the testosterone pumped street violence to the monied suits trying to resuscitate race theory, this is a dark and complex world we rarely see. You can't help wondering what the police have been up to while these young idealists risk their lives to expose violent racists.. With their courage at the heart of the film it lightens what might otherwise be a depressing look at the billowing racism from Europe to America. After a summer of the worst race riots in decades in the UK, this is an essential watch.",False
3,10,Fascinating insight to far right,mrghn-10988,n/a,16/08/2025,"This compelling storyline of an undercover journalist gives a fascinating insight into the activities of the far right. The film uncovers the different fractions within it, exposing how the far right networks operate and are funded by multi-millionaires, the dark side of what the far right are up to behind the scenes and the front it presents to the public. This is a powerful and important film exposing the dangers of the far right but told with a very empathetic and human approach. It presents the importance of the peaceful anti-fascist demonstrations which are preventing the violence far right groups are trying to rally. A must watch.",False
4,1,one sided,waylonc-16724,n/a,16/08/2025,Agree that some far right fringes are dangerous but the same can be said for the far left fringes equally. Would love to see an honest non biased account of both the far right and left and the division that both are causing. Also a unbiased account of the media and groups like the one that made this into their own agenda of hate. If you only show one side then the entire premise is not authentic. This so called documentary is so biased and one sided that you can't take them seriously because you know that they will edit and take out of context many things to go along with their own personal agenda.,False
5,10,Brilliantly constructed,mary-332,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love the way the doc is led by the journalists sharing their skills with each other and us. As the undercover journey throws up moments of uninhibited misogyny and racism, the film drops in the motivation behind each member of the team's commitment to Hope not Hate. Their personal stories pepper the thrilling unfolding narrative. They are diverse voices that reinforce the breadth of opposition to violent far right hatred. Their humanity emphasises the narrow mindedness of the fascist groups they are exposing and diminishes their posturing.This gripping filmmaking shows in real time what positive action looks like.",False
6,10,An excellent expose and education,kjgwhmpz,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well put together film which follows some extremely brave people from the UK based antifascist charity Hope not Hate. They film undercover, infiltrate the far right groups and disclose despicable and revealing conversations by UK fascists at their meet ups and rallys.The film focuses in part on the Human Diversity Foundation who are manipulating genetic data in very wrong and evil ways.... ie: scientific racism. They want to use this false data to argue for what they call 'remigration' ( reversal of immigration).Some far right media savvy tactics are explained. How they feed on fear and disbelief and shift the general view of what's acceptable and normal using the concept of the Overton window.A film that clearly shows how close the surface modern fascism is. A very educational and gripping film.",False
7,8,Heroes without hate,Devo-McDuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's only one other review of this (IMO) excellent documentary on IMDB currently, hopefully this one will provide a tad of counterbalance.I was aware of Hope Not Hate prior to watching this, but only on the limited level that they are an anti-fascist organisation. I had no idea that as well as highlighting and campaigning against bigotry and racism, they also place themselves in the uncomfortable situation of infiltrating organisations peddling such views to highlight the bits they leave out of the public soundbites and reveal how deranged and dangerous the people within them actually are. They succeed on this.This documentary style is fairly standard fare, but the content conveys exactly what is needed and the arc and chase to potentially highlight the rich funder of an underground modern day eugenics organisation (tenner if you can guess which race they favour!) is quite thrilling.The Hope Not Hate team are heroes in my eyes.",False
8,8,Essential Viewing,jemma-jupp-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"A brave and authentic investigation into the dangers of the far-right through the undercover work of Hope not Hate.Filmed over many months with exclusive access to this organization that gathers information about the far right. This film lifts the lid on some of the extreme views the far right hold and that they would rather that the general public were not aware of.A timely and vital piece that should be seen far and wide. Much of it is shot undercover as senior members of the far right movement show their true colors. From the award-winning documentary director, Havana Marking, originally screened on C4.",False
9,10,"Ordinary racists and extraordinary ""spies""",rreid-12553,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a remarkable film, following for the first time the young undercover ""operatives"" from Hope Not Hate that infiltrate far right racist groups to monitor and expose them. They have the earnest intent of charity geeks, but using all the tools of spy thrillers, and putting their lives very clearly at risk. There's no bravado here - these are very likeable characters, the hope in the face of race riots and death threats that hang over the film. There's a satisfying exposé of repellant advocates for race scientists (no spoilers), all in all making a very compelling film. It seems insanely cowardly that the London film festival apparently backed out of showing this - for fear of the thugs - but do watch at home - they deserve eyes on their important work.",False
10,10,Exposé on disenfranchised men,ilseweisslijn,n/a,16/08/2025,This is compelling storytelling. It clearly demonstrates the violent lengths various groups of men who feel disenfranchised will go to in the pursuit of feeling in control and having power. These groups think up rationalisations such as the much misused 'scientific evidence' for genetic supremacy to support their narratives in an almost desperate attempt to sound legitimate and sane. Unfortunately some charismatic members manage to use the peddling of fear to manipulate others and convince people to believe in hateful sentiments. It is sad to watch and also brave. This is important viewing and we applaud those involved for staying the course.,False
11,9,"A fascinating, watchable and very timely documentary",deltuforebecca,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a watchable documentary that takes us on the (terrifying) journey of a group of Hope Not Hate investigators who go undercover with far right groups to find out what they actually say and share behind closed doors. Beautifully made and with a narrative that is clearly imparted. A vital documentary in these difficult times.We are introduced to a number of journalists, and a number of far right activists, across the documentary, and what is terrifying is how indistinguishable they are - you could meet any of these men at any point and not immediately clock them as far right instigators with alarming views.",False

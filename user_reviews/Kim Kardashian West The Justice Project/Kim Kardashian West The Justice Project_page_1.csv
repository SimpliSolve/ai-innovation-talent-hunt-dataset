1,10,The Users whom rated this a 1 should be kicked off the app,honornowacki,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary highlights the ONLY MASS PROBLEM in our country with BIPARTISAN support. It is NEVER given the media attention it needs due to police brutality yet only 611 died via police in 2020. This effects millions. It i includes hours of victims telling their stories about being raped, trafficked and molested at 5. The only reason one would give this documentary a 1 is because of their bias associations of Kim Kardashian- whom only takes up about 15 min total of actual talking. It's disgusting that IMDB would allow people to ""rate"" people being raped and drugged and trafficked telling their story. If you don't like hearing it don't watch but you don't get to rate it. Get out.",False

1,8,Gordon Ramsay expects nothing but the best quality!,freddy_at_home,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am that kind of person, who can watch almost anything as long as I have some sort of food in my mouth. Or need to watch something while I am eating. If you have ever been to London, you know that some places can be quite the fancy place, but still you are in the harsh location of bad smells and somewhat grey surroundings of London. But who am I to judge.The food looks very good and the service seems very nice. I've never been to this place and as the looks of it, I can't afford it neither. I think it's fun getting a inside-view of this high quality place, especially the famous Savoy Grill. The food looks amazing, but as always at these places, the portions looks to small for me. Sweat and blood behind each creation.Fun show, great and hard working staff. Some fun celebrities here and there. And you might pick up a trick or two. And maybe plan a vacation after this pandemic is over. I hope the place is doing alright now, all things considered.Take a look, you might like it. 8/10",False

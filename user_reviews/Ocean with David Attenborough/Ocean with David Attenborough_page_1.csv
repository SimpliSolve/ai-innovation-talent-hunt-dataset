1,8,Absolutely brilliant,RalphW-9,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Thoughtful and Enthusiastic Review of an Outstanding Film ExperienceI recently had the pleasure of watching what I can only describe as an extraordinary and profoundly moving film. I had the joy of sharing this experience with my son, and both of us came away from the theatre deeply impacted and in complete agreement-it was an exceptional piece of storytelling that everyone, regardless of age, should take the time to see.From the very beginning, the film captures your attention with stunning visuals, captivating narration, and a compelling message that is both timely and timeless. There's a sense of wonder that runs throughout the film, a quality that Sir David Attenborough always brings to his work. His passion for the natural world is, as ever, deeply inspiring, and the way he communicates it draws in the viewer emotionally and intellectually.What makes this film particularly powerful is not just its subject matter, but the way it is presented. It weaves together beautiful cinematography, thoughtful commentary, and important environmental themes with such clarity and purpose that it leaves a lasting impression. I found myself reflecting on it well after the end of the film, and my son was full of thoughtful questions and observations-something I always hope for when we watch something educational or impactful together.That said, I would like to share two small points of constructive criticism, neither of which take away from the overall excellence of the film, but are worth mentioning in the hope they might improve future viewing experiences.First, the sound mixing presented a bit of a challenge. On several occasions throughout the film, I found that the background music was simply too loud. This may not affect all viewers the same way, but for me-and others I've spoken to-it meant that some of Sir David's narration was difficult to hear clearly. Given that his voice and words are such a central and powerful part of the experience, this was a little frustrating. It seemed that the music, although beautifully composed and emotionally resonant, occasionally overpowered the dialogue, making it hard to catch every word and nuance.Second, before the film began, we were told to remain in our seats after the film ended in order to watch a special behind-the-scenes feature, which would be shown after the credits. Naturally, we were very excited to see this extra content. However, the credits were exceedingly long, and although we waited patiently, the extended duration made the experience feel slightly drawn out. It would have been much more viewer-friendly to place the behind-the-scenes footage immediately after the film concluded and before the credits began. This is a common practice on television and would have been more effective here as well. The current placement meant that some audience members left early, missing what turned out to be a fascinating segment.Despite those two relatively minor issues, I want to stress again that this is a truly exceptional film. It is rich in insight, full of heart, and offers a powerful call to action that feels both urgent and hopeful. It's not just a film for nature lovers or documentary fans-it's a film for anyone who lives on this planet and cares about its future. Sir David's work continues to be a beacon of knowledge, inspiration, and advocacy.In conclusion, I cannot recommend this film highly enough. Take your children, your friends, or simply go alone-but do see it. It's more than just a film; it's an experience, and one that has the potential to change how we see the world and our place in it.",False
2,8,Ocean,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of those films that really does resonate. Using some phenomenal archive photography of the realm beneath the sea, Sir David Attenborough narrates a story of devastation, desperation and ultimately optimism as he takes us on a journey around the globe evaluating the damage caused to the Earth's oceans by a mankind who has treated this vast resource with contempt ever since industrialisation enabled us to ignore the protective forces of nature and pretty much fish at will. Some of the imagery here is truly breathtaking. It's beautiful, colourful and vibrant with creatures that look every inch as if they came straight out of science fiction. It's not just the sheer variety of life that we see that takes your breath away, though. The effects of the trawlers scarifying the scallop beds or the coral reefs renders them akin to a waste ground after a bomb has been dropped on it. The ruin is profound and quite frankly upsetting. Our continuing reliance on cheap and abundant food for ourselves and our pets is compromising the very existence of species that have existed in harmony with nature (and even humanity) for millennia. In his usually potent but understated manner, Sir David makes his points without resort to hyperbole and superlatives and as he lays out the scale of this problem before us he offers us hope that there is still time, should we take a longer-term view, for us to leave well alone and allow this crucial part of the planet's infrastructure to recover and assist with the fight against global warming. The message is clear as a bell, but it isn't laboured by the dialogue. It is illustrated by odd looking crabs, seahorses and magnificent blue whales. The production is top class and as an educational piece of cinema, this will take some beating - especially if you can catch it all on a big screen.",False
3,8,Ocean with David Attenborough,jboothmillard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBroadcaster, natural historian, and filmmaker Sir David Attenborough has been on our screens for seven decades and has been part of some of the most ground-breaking television documentary series, including Blue Planet (and its sequels), Planet Earth (and its sequels), Frozen Planet, Life, Africa, Dynasties, and many more, at age 99, this was his latest feature-length documentary with an important message. Basically, presented by Attenborough, it starts with an introduction to the great age of ocean discovery, featuring coral reefs, kelp forests and the open ocean. It shows us the towering skyscraper-like structures on the surface deep beneath the oceans of the world. It shows beautiful and recognisable sea creatures, including dolphins, turtles, sharks, whales, seals, marine fish, bait balls and many more, as well as the creatures that rely on the seas for food and sustenance, including penguins, seagulls, and other sea birds. Then it moves onto the important issue that endangers the planet's undersea habitats. The main threat to the ocean is from destructive and highly wasteful forms of fishing, specifically, industrial bottom trawling, where ships are fishing for small fish, such as krill, and literally digging into the ocean beds, transforming once-thriving underwater habitats into desolate deserts. These trawlers ploughing and over-fishing also impact communities near the shores that rely on fishing. Obviously, there is mention of plastic waste polluting the ocean as well. The imagery of the underwater surfaces becoming grey lifeless places, the creatures of the ocean tangled in netting, and dead and decapitated in the backs of the ships is truly horrific. But it shows that there is hope and opportunity to make a change and an optimistic solution. It does not mean stopping fishing entirely but controlling it with less evasive techniques and protecting parts of the open ocean. It is explained that when parts of the sea have been left alone, they have bounced back and recovered with underwater plant life and creatures. It is suggested that underwater plants can absorb and store more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than most on the land surface; the ocean is our life support system and our greatest ally against climate catastrophe. It concludes with Attenborough saying that there is the upcoming United Nations Ocean Conference on 3 June 2025 where member states will hopefully agree to protect up to 30% of oceans from destructive fishing by 2030. There are only small areas protected but have thrived from this, the convincing argument is that the protection and sustainability of the ocean are vital for all existence. The end credits feature the song ""One World"" by Coldplay and there is behind-the-scenes footage. Attenborough has a great voice for narration and outspoken moral authority without being lecturing, at ninety minutes, it is a good-length film with a message to take away and a narrative to make a point that horrible things are going on in the open sea but that something can be done. The photography, captured by the filmmakers over two years, is astonishing, both the beauty of the worlds under the water and the tragic stuff happening. I will admit I prefer the programmes which focus on creatures, as opposed to the location in general, and the music score by Steven Price, does overwhelm the imagery sometimes, but these are only slight criticisms. This is an important film for recent times, with climate change and heightening temperatures across the world, it is bound to make an impact on how ocean health keeps the entire planet stable and flourishing, it is informative, awe-inspiring, devastating, and hopeful in equal measure, an engaging must watch nature documentary. Very good!",True
4,10,A living legend,majeda9,n/a,16/08/2025,"Went to see this documentary, released to mark the 99th birthday of David Attenborough. The plea to save our oceans is heartfelt and moving, with David telling us that he's coming to the end of his days. I was appalled at the wanton and greedy destruction of the ocean habitats and sea creatures through profligate overfishing. However, despair turns to hope as David explains how easy it is to repair the ravages we have wrought on the marine environment. We really must not turn a blind eye to the blight of overfishing, horrific trawling and the near extinction of marine species. David narrates with as much passion and dedication as ever, and it was quite poignant to see him standing on the white cliffs at the end.",False
5,10,The most important documentary of our time,CarlyanneB,n/a,16/08/2025,"To me, this feels like the most important documentary of our time. Whilst watching, I felt the full spectrum of emotions - despair, awe, wonder, fear - to name of few. The biggest emotion I am left with, however, is hope. I have complete admiration for Sir David Attenborough and his significant contributions to our world. The message in this documentary is a gift to the planet and I hope it is received with the importance and respect it deserves.The documentary was visually beautiful and the musical score moved me as much as the message. In my opinion, the best pieces of television vibrate within you long after you've watched them - I am still fizzing with thought and emotion hours after watching.",False

To have experienced paradise on earth many times over in the adventure that has been his life ... And to share with the world how important it is to cherish and look after our natural world. David is a living legend. What a legacy!Here's to us protecting more than a third of our ocean. I hope we can protect even more. How embarrassing the lengths we go for profit and greed. I knew we pillaged our oceans but I had no idea how bad it was. Or didn't want to know.We really need to consume less, lol. Not just from the ocean, but in general.",False
7,10,Magnificent documentary on the wonders and challenges of marine life,edezagon-102-677773,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to view this film in the presence of the director and a panel of European dignitaries, scientists and policy makers. I cried. Trawlers have destroyed the oceans, with government subsidies! Insane. But the cinematography was beyond beautiful. I cried at the beauty, despair and glimmer of hope the movie portrayed. David Attenborough is the world's best narrator and lover of nature. At 99, he has inspired generations and I hope, like Carl Sagan still inspires today all things of the Cosmos, Attenborough will continue to do so after he has been gone. And like Sagan's 21st century inheritor, Neil Degrasse Tyson has continued his legacy successfully, I still cannot imagine who can take Attenborough's place yet. He is legend. Pure visual and intellectual delight. Thank you for making these films. They inspire.",False

9,10,#SOSforourplanet,garymtaylor-84739,n/a,16/08/2025,"Profoundly highlights the ubiquity and devastating impact of industrial fishing practices, particularly seabed trawling, on our marine ecosystems (that otherwise have the potential to save our planet from climate catastrophe). This method indiscriminately scrapes the ocean floor, destroying fragile marine habitats such as cold-water coral reefs, seagrass beds, and nursery grounds that are essential for fish populations and carbon storage. The documentary makes a compelling case for global action to ban this destructive practice and establishing no-fishing zones, which have been shown to have rapid success in allowing marine life to recover. Let's save our sea, save our planet.",False
10,7,Update to His Ending,keithdt,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, I wanted to add a note regarding the United Nations treaty he talks about at the end. Halfway through, the decade commitment to protect 30% of the ocean is currently estimated at only 3% implemented. Further, the current Trump administration has officially withdrawn from the U. S. commitment.As for the film, maybe my expectations are somewhat different from many of the reviewers, but I felt it was somewhat lacking in details, data and specifics, while having an overabundance of generalities. Also, it felt a little too long.Still, it is a very worthwhile film (i would say a 7.5) with a worthwhile message, some excellent sections and wonderful videography.",False
11,10,Beautiful and Devastating,sepetcenk,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first 25 minutes of Ocean with David Attenborough are breathtaking-filled with stunning visuals and fascinating, little-known facts about marine life, much like Attenborough's other masterpieces.But then came the industrial bottom-trawling scene-and I was overwhelmed. Watching the destruction of the ocean floor was brutal. It was not just shocking; it was heartbreaking. I had to stop watching. It hurt deeply.I'm not sure if I can bring myself to finish the documentary. As a human being, I felt ashamed. We are destroying everything that is beautiful and vital. This film is important, but it's also painful. A must-watch-but not an easy one.",False
12,7,A Solid Addition to Attenborough's Legacy,AxelAzzopardi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just finished watching the latest David Attenborough ocean documentary, and while it delivers the expected quality we've come to expect from the legendary naturalist, it doesn't quite reach the heights of his most memorable work.The cinematography is absolutely stunning - the underwater footage is unreal and surreal in the best possible way. The beautiful ocean imagery is truly spectacular, showcasing the majesty of our marine environments with the technical excellence we've come to expect from modern nature documentaries.What really struck me was the powerful juxtaposition between pristine ocean landscapes and scenes of environmental destruction. The imagery of damaged ocean ecosystems genuinely made me feel guilty about humanity's impact - the message really comes through when you see these beautiful seascapes destroyed by our greed.I was particularly impressed that David Attenborough, at 99 years old, is still doing this work. His narration remains as compelling as ever - he's always good, and this is no exception.The most memorable scene featured gigantic factory boats in Antarctica catching hundreds of thousands of kilos of krill, then cooking and packaging them right on the vessel. I had no idea about the scale of these operations - it was both impressive and sobering.I also learned about water reserves in Hawaii that are creating new life and helping produce food in more sustainable and ethical ways, which was genuinely educational.The musical score perfectly complemented the visuals, moving you seamlessly through the imagery without being intrusive. The documentary flows beautifully from one ocean environment to the next, maintaining perfect pacing throughout its concise 1 hour 20 minute runtime - a length that held my attention completely without overstaying its welcome.While everything about this documentary is competent, nothing feels particularly groundbreaking or impressive. It's good, but doesn't offer much that's new to those familiar with ocean conservation documentaries. Compared to other nature documentaries I've seen, it's on par, maybe even slightly less impactful.The focus is heavily educational rather than entertainment, which isn't necessarily a flaw but may limit its appeal to broader audiences.This documentary succeeds in raising awareness about conservation and the human impact on marine ecosystems. It evoked genuine concern for ocean conservation and opened my eyes to the industrial scale of modern fishing operations.However, I probably wouldn't actively recommend it to others - while it's a solid watch for nature documentary enthusiasts, it doesn't transcend the genre enough to convert new audiences or leave a lasting impression.Rating: 7/10 - A technically proficient and emotionally resonant documentary that delivers exactly what you'd expect, but nothing more.This documentary succeeds in raising awareness about conservation and the human impact on marine ecosystems.

13,1,Terrible Documentary,ChristianF-755,n/a,16/08/2025,"The way the topic of the ocean is presented to viewers is terrible.-A documentary that's more superficial than any puddle. There's no solid data, no nuanced information. All the information in the documentary is contained in the first three sentences of Wikipedia about the ocean.-The music is far too loud and far too dramatic. There isn't a single second of silence in this film.-The entire film is completely incoherent.-The story is totally confusing and weak. ""Everything is broken - We can save everything - Everything is broken - We can save everything.""

16,10,A Stark Message by the Legend,farshidkarimi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Millions of us are carelessly and thoughtlessly producing or dumping millions of tons of plastic material and other trash around, especially in rivers, indifferent to the damage and hurt that we cause to the water, rivers and ultimately to the oceans. We are too greedily busy consuming and consuming to know that this Planet does not just belong to us. Big companies are cracking up production of plastics with some false label claiming the plastic they produce is degradable. The goal to make more money at the cost of the decimating ocean creatures.We are too ignorant about the impact the loss of marine live can cause to the existence of man.Sir David Attenborough has been raising the alarm about this danger.

19,10,"We're Not Doomed, Man!",JamesHitchcock,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sir David Frederick Attenborough is, by common consent, a British national treasure. He is probably best-known for his series of wildlife documentaries made for the BBC, but his range of activities- naturalist, conservationist, broadcaster, administrator, activist, educator- is much wider than this. And perhaps the most remarkable thing about him is that he remains active in many of these fields at the age of 99.Sir David has long been a campaigner for environmentalist causes, but this has not always made for an easy relationship with the Beeb, which prides itself on its political impartiality. For example, ""On Thin Ice"", the final episode of his ""Frozen Planet"" series from 2011, was criticised by some who took exception to his stance on global warming, and some American networks refused to show it.This may explain why ""Ocean"", Sir David's latest production, was not made as a TV series but as a feature-length documentary, shown in cinemas as well as on television. His subject is the threat to the world's oceans caused by human activities. He does not neglect pollution and global warming, but this latter topic is less of a hot potato in 2025 than it was in 2011, largely because there now seems to be a political consensus that global warming is both real and a serious threat about which we need to take urgent action. In ""Ocean"", however, Sir David turns his attention to a subject which remains controversial even today, namely the damage being caused by the fishing industry.This damage is not confined to the depletion of fish stocks caused by overfishing, although that is certainly one of the problems. The removal of the target species from an area can adversely affect the local ecosystem by disrupting natural food chains. There is also the issue of ""bycatch""- the taking of species other than the target one- and, potentially the most serious, the devastation of fragile marine environments by modern fishing methods, especially ""bottom trawling""- the dragging of heavy nets along the sea floor. As with all of Sir David's documentaries, the photography is stunning, although there is a lot more to ""Ocean"" than beautiful pictures of wild creatures in their natural habitats. We also get to see those habitats being destroyed by trawling and then a series of bleak shots showing the aftermath of that destruction.Given this widespread devastation, it would be easy for Sir David to exclaim, along with Private Frazer from ""Dad's Army"", ""we're doomed, man!"" And yet he does not. And the solution is not simply for everyone to give up eating fish, a vital source of protein in a hungry world. Sir David shows how it is possible to reverse the damage we have caused, not just by limiting fishing catches but by declaring certain areas, to be off-limits to fishing altogether. This can do more than reverse the damage within the protected zones themselves. What is known as the ""spillover effect"" means that wildlife from the protected zones will start to recolonise other areas, even if they are not protected themselves. If we get the balance right, this can mean that fish stocks will start to increase in the non-protected zones, which combined with less environmentally destructive practices could lead to a sustainable fishing industry.""Ocean"" is a much-needed wake-up call, yet it also has a message of hope, making it inspiring enough for me to award it one of my rare examples of a perfect mark. 10/10.",False
20,10,"Much more important than any war based documentaries where most of them is about innocent peoples,they r more important than human.",aushro,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ocean with David Attenborough is a monumental documentary that stands as one of the most important environmental films ever made, combining breathtaking cinematography with a deeply urgent message about the fate of our oceans. Narrated by Sir David Attenborough on the cusp of his 99th birthday, the film is both a celebration of marine life's spectacular diversity and a sobering exposé of the devastating damage wrought by industrial fishing, pollution, and climate change.The documentary takes viewers on a mesmerizing journey beneath the waves, exploring coral reefs, kelp forests, and deep-sea habitats with stunning visuals that rival science fiction. Attenborough's narration draws on his 70+ years of experience, reflecting on how our understanding of the ocean has evolved dramatically during his lifetime-from mysterious depths to a realm now better known yet perilously threatened. The imagery includes vibrant turtles grazing on coral, majestic whales gliding through dark waters, and swirling schools of fish, all captured with extraordinary clarity and scale that are even more impressive on the big screen.However, Ocean is not just a nature film; it is a powerful environmental call to action. It presents unprecedented footage of destruction caused by bottom trawling-giant nets dragging across the seabed, devastating scallop beds and coral reefs as if bombed. The film exposes the grim reality: two-thirds of predatory fish populations have been annihilated, coral reefs face collapse within decades, and iconic species like turtles and sharks are on the brink of extinction due to human exploitation. Attenborough's tone is more urgent and candid than ever, yet he delivers these truths with his trademark calm authority, avoiding hyperbole while making the stakes crystal clear.What sets this documentary apart is its message of hope grounded in science and real-world examples. Attenborough highlights how marine ecosystems can and do recover when given protection. Currently, only about 3% of the ocean is fully protected, but these no-take zones have shown remarkable resurgence of life. Experts featured in the film emphasize that if fishing ceased in critical areas, recovery would begin almost immediately. The film stresses the need to expand protected zones to at least a third of the ocean to restore balance, combat climate change, and preserve biodiversity.The film's production is top-tier, co-directed by Toby Nowlan, Keith Scholey, and Colin Butfield, with a stirring musical score by Steven Price that enhances the emotional impact. The combination of stunning visuals, compelling narration, and a clear ethical message makes Ocean a cinematic experience that is both awe-inspiring and deeply moving.In summary, Ocean with David Attenborough is a soul-stirring, visually magnificent, and profoundly important documentary. It educates audiences about the ocean's critical role in sustaining life on Earth, exposes the catastrophic damage humans have inflicted, and inspires hope by showing that recovery is possible with immediate, decisive action. This film is a must-watch for anyone concerned about the planet's future and a potential game-changer in raising global awareness and motivating conservation efforts.",False

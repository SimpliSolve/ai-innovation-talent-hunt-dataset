3,9,I am not a fan but this documentary is fantastic,godsnames,n/a,15/08/2025,"As I stated above, I am not a definite fan of CP. This documentary, however, captures the feeling of being one. It is a strange thing but I like them (CP) very much for whatever reasons (I don't know). It is a very well crafted documentary. If I were a Palace fan, I would save this for myself and kids and for the ages that come. Tell you what: Even if I'm not a fan, I (will) save this to my server just to remind me what 'fan' and lifetime support really means. Excellent work.",False

1,8,Actions and Consequences,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - if you believe that all was blown out of proportion ... well this documentary has a story to tell you. We are talking about a man kissing a woman that just won an international title in football (or soccer if you are in the US I reckon). Now while some may wave it off as something small and belittle the woman ... well you can guess where this is going.You may not be able to guess (if you have not read or followed the story of the team and the horrible men leading them) the rest .... Spanish women had a lot to endure - there was a happy ending of sorts - and I hope your mind did not go into the gutter.Interesting and insightful ... and quite sad. And showing what should happen with someone who is not respectful of women ... well the bare minimum that is ... you wouldn't want him back in power ... anywhere. What do you mean I am making connections to a different case? If you think so, maybe you are doing them - for better or worse! And with or without my consent ... whether I like it or not.",False
2,7,Intriguing and Informative,keikoyoshikawa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hadn't follow closely the World Cup in 2023, and so the uproar over the non-consensual kiss on Spanish player Jennifer Hermoso by RFEF president Luis Rubiales was not a big item on my news feed.But I definitely had heard about it. What I hadn't known, however, was the entire backstory about and the role of two men - Rubiales and the women's team head coach Jorge Vilda - in the leadership and management of the federation and the team.The strength of this documentary are the interviews with key players and witnesses. It's weakness is not being able to get interviews with Rubiales and Vilda, to get their side of the story. It would also have been nice to get commentaries from neutral people who had in-depth knowledge of the whole thing.My key takeaways: Had Rubiales not done what he did, probably none of this would have come out into daylight - at least not for many years afterwards. Also, the women players persevered and won - on and off the pitch.",False
3,6,"A balanced perspective, featuring interviews with key figures in football",panta-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"""It's All Over: The Kiss That Changed Spanish Football"" is a documentary that delves into a pivotal moment in Spanish football history, exploring the cultural and social implications of a controversial incident that captured national and international attention. Released in 2024, the film presents a comprehensive examination of the events surrounding the kiss that sparked widespread debate and reflection within the sport and beyond.The documentary provides a balanced perspective, featuring interviews with key figures in football, including players, coaches, and sports analysts, as well as some commentary from sociologists and cultural critics.

The pacing is steady, allowing for thoughtful reflection on the themes presented, although some viewers may find certain segments could benefit from a more dynamic editing style.While the documentary does an admirable job of addressing the complexities of the situation, it occasionally falls into the trap of being overly analytical, which may detract from the emotional weight of the narrative for some audiences. Nevertheless, it succeeds in prompting important discussions about accountability, respect, and the role of sports in shaping societal values. It could serve as both an informative piece for football enthusiasts and a catalyst for broader conversations about culture and ethics in sports.",False
4,7,How the Spanish soccer federation treated its women's soccer team,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""It's all Over: The Kiss That Changes Spanish Spanish Football"" (2024 release; 95 min; original title: ""SeAcab√≥: Diario de las campeonas"", in English ""It's Over: Diary of the Champions"") opens, the Spanish Women's soccer team has shocked the world by winning the 2023 World Cup. Immediately after the game, the players meet with the President of the Spanish Soccer Federation, and he promptly kisses one of the players on the lips. Almost immediately the moment goes viral around the world, baffling just about everyone: what has just happened here? At this point we are less that 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this movie is really and two-for-one: first, how did the Spanish Women's team actually win this against all odds, and despite the horrible treatment by the Spanish Soccer Federation, and second, the fallout of an unwanted kiss of one of the players by the President of the Spanish Soccer Federation. Please note that this documentary is bringing the perspective of the Spanish players. In that sense it's not really an ""objective"" or ""neutral"" documentary. On the other hand, this film synthesizes the sheer hell that these women went through, as team's head coach and the President of the Spanish Soccer Federation were completely out of touch with reality. At just over 90 min., this documentary just flew by. Please note that for whatever reason, the documentary's original tile in Spanish is quite different from what we are now seeing in the US.""It's All Over: The Kiss That Changed Spanish Football"" recently started streaming on Netflix, and I just watched it the other night. If you are a fan of soccer or of women's rights, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False

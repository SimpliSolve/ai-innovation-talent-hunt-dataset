1,7,We can all agree the scale is not sustainable...so just think about it,ryan-80772,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie does a very good job of starting an important conversation. As someone who is vegan, the parental dinner scene is all too familiar. Unlike the other vegans in this movie, although I understand where they're coming from, I do believe reducing is by far the superior solution in our current world state. Everyday people aren't going to ""go vegan"", I know I didn't want to. However everyone can reduce. Everyone should reduce, and not just when it comes to food. That is another ballgame altogether though. Watch this movie, and even if you don't enjoy it, start a dialogue within yourself. Could you reduce, or rather, could you substitute?",False
2,3,It Gets better after about 30 minutes,mikemed-659-258843,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you can stomach the vegan propaganda at the beginning, there is some interesting stuff in doc'.In America the consumption of beef continues to fall from 1968 yet it says they are eating more meat? I presume it because Americans are eating more chicken, which are not ruminates and therefor it is good for the environment. If eating beef has been falling since 1968 how can it be driving Global Warming? Pork and Beef are the scapegoats of a larger problem of industry and transport.The documentary maker is young and na√Øve. Hopefully his vegan diet, for him, can be sustained but for many it can't hence the point of the movie, I guess. If he is carb adaptive then he is lucky, if not he will suffer many health problems later in life. Most people in the world are not designed to tolerate a plant based diet, maybe only up to 15% can stay healthy on PB. Our bodies are designed to tolerate poor diets like vegetarian/vegan ones but only like the body can tolerate smoking for 40 years until it kills you.It is annoying that they say meat they are really talking about the standard American diet(SAD). They is no meat in Coke Cola or Doritos(which are vegan), even an hamburger is 60% plant based. Processed and refined carbs are fatting, especially when they are designed to make you addictive to them. Meat and fat are satiating.",True
3,1,Propaganda Film.,z3rocool,n/a,16/08/2025,Some serious propaganda here. I couldn't get 10 mins into it without closing it. The first two guys that talk literally have heads bigger than their stick bodies.,False
4,2,No thank you,trademarklife,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just so the makers of this stupidity know, we are not gonna change the way we live or eat.You have no business to shove your beliefs on others and call it science.Kindly let people do what they wanna and you can have your vegan plant based stuff by all means.",False
5,10,Excellent ideas. Learnt a lot.,alebs5,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched tons of documentaries on this subject but this is so far my favourite. It's in the middle. It's not trying to convert you into a vegetarian or a vegan, it's exploring ideas on how and why to consume less meat. Definitely worth my time as I love learning about different ideologies and ways to contribute to less harm in animal factory farming.Just open your mind a bit. Nobody is trying to convince you to be this or that.",False
6,10,A must-see documentary,jennyedwards-64256,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is relatable, non-preachy, easy to watch and filled with expert knowledge. It does not push you to do anything. It gives you the facts and allows the viewer to make their own decisions. I enjoy the personal approach and I think it's one of the best food documentaries out there at the moment!",False
7,10,A fantastic take on the concept of a middle ground,archiemccarthyy,n/a,16/08/2025,"A well-balanced look on the subjects of meat consumption. It grips you from the start, wanting answers from the professionals to the questions laid out. Different from other similar documentaries it has a great practical approach and that it doesn't have to be 'all or nothing'.",False
8,10,Really Good Film,becomethesignal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most films about social causes come off as heavy-handed and preachy. This film doesn't. It's a good introduction to the concepts behind the Reducetarian movement, and for more in-depth information, I recommend checking out the book, too.",False
9,10,It Gets The Reason Why You Should Stop Being Selfish Numb-Nuts Across Superbly!,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are all sorts of things that humans are unbelievably ignorant, totally stupid and completely selfish about. The state of the Planets health - not so much its inhabitants - is one of these numb and dumb topics.This documentary is different in that it is not telling you to be a Vegan etc (therefore putting a stop to all those trolls who are pro meat from mouthing off) but is instead, asking you to become aware of your world and your health! Many people will recognize their attitudes in various people in the film.Meat does have a place in life but it should not be used, as it is, to replace Health and Wellness for profiteering money barons!",False

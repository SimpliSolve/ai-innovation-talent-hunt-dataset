1,1,PERVERTED OLD MAN,wolverinexfitxmma,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI LOVE GEORGE LOPEZ stand up skits. But as soon as he got older he became more perverted and seems very short with his words. Spanglish!! I get it. But he mumbles way too much.I'll never forget he said ""I can't move on to the future I'm stuck in the past!"" He is still stuck. If he wants new material he should talk about the new political system. President Chump and the boarder stuff. I love when he completes a sentence and not mumble.He is very very perverted when he talks. I'm disappointed in his new comical skits. He needs newer material. He needs to dial down on the perverse comedy and talk more about politics and make fun of it.",True
2,3,Hard pass,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"George has been around a long time and was a super funny guy in his early stages (for that reason, I tried to give 5 stars as a gift but the difficulty of making it through the current rules on this platform has altered my decision). Not just (not allowed to identify) - but everyone could relate to Lopez's humor back in the day cuz we all got along. He ventured off into the valley of having a tv show, which always ruins a good comic. He will always be famous for lines like, ""You're in America now, speak (not allowed to say)!"" and ""I used to be a poor (not allowed to say) but now I'm a rich (not allowed to say).""But this show tells me he just doesn't care who likes him or who doesn't - and by now, he's entitled.But I couldn't make it through the whole show. Early on, he taps on the p urity button by asking how many (not allowed to say) in the audience are married to a (not allowed to say). (not allowed to say) do this kind of staying among themselves thing, but if (not allowed to say) did that, people would lobby their job until they got fired. They wouldnt be allowed in certain stores anymore. There'd be vir al so cial m edia posts about how '(not allowed to say)' you are.Ironically, though, he's also not afraid to hint at the fact he w alk ed away from the (not allowed to say). Me, also.There was a few good parts here but there was tmi; nobody wants to hear that from an o ld guy. And while I can appreciate the classic (not allowed to say)-mafia hair (and suit), it was a little too long reminding me more of an Italian caricature from the 20th century.This show is aimed at a small s eg ment of the po pul ation with some wider-audience humor.There were 3 r e views here the other day, now only one. I'm guessing it's hard to write one for this that is acceptable to the (not allowed to say) personal code of ethics despite the show having zero.This is what not caring looks like.",False

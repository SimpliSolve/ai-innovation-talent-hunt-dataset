1,10,Pretty even handed primer,pabrucefan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Pretty even handed primer on how we got to where we are with wild horses. A few factual errors but over all, not the usual overly sentimental presentation. As an FYI, romantic horses didn't win the west. Mules and oxen did that. Horses didn't hold up. The film didn't really get into the actual sources of wild horses. That would be the Californio land grant rancheros and the Great Basin ranchers that turned out good stallions using it as free range breeding ground for ranch stock and war horses. Today we're faced with an overly successful recovery and the supply exceeds the demand. Completely agree with the film's point that massive fertility control is desperately needed. Yesterday.",False

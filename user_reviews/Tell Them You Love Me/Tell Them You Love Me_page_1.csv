1,8,Disturbing and compelling,margauxmorrone,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had such a hard time watching this. The way it's laid out, you're on this journey of ""yeah.... facilitated communication sounds helpful"" to ""WTAF did this woman do?!?""Essentially, Anna is in a position of power and influence within the accessibility community, and she makes the decision to have relations with one of the people she's helping. Derrick, a nonverbal adult with CP, is introduced to Anna by his brother John, who was one of Anna's students. In the end, she's convinced that they're in love because they've bonded while she was using an assistive keyboard.Daisy and John, Derrick's family, are devastated to learn that Derrick was not communicating with anyone, he was being manipulated by Anna. I saw one reviewer say that Facilitated Communication is akin to a Ouija Board. Yes. This is junk science, and they do a great job of decoding that fact in this doc.In the end, I was repulsed by what Anna did, and even more upset that apparently she sees nothing wrong with what she did to Derrick. It's baffling.",True
2,8,Facilitated Communication is akin to a Ouija Board,fanofmovies124,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGood documentary, but Anna Stubblefield, a white Rutgers University professor in the field of philosophy-with an emphasis on disability and race, is a predator. Period. She used her position to prey on Derrick-a nonverbal man with cerebral palsy-and his family, beginning by telling Derrick's brother, John, that they wouldn't be able to afford the facilitated communication program at Syracuse, but she could help. She could give a voice to Derrick, who she decided had a voice, just no one had found it yet.From the moment they talked, Stubblefield made gross characterizations of what John's life was like and whether Derrick was properly cared for. How dare she? What she saw and manipulated was a vulnerable man that she could control and ""mold"" into a stand-in for her husband and their failed marriage. Derrick has a cognitive level of 6 months to one year! He hasn't moved from a physical world to a spatial or cognitive one, let alone an associative one!For those who think FC has some legitimacy, how do you explain literacy magically appearing where no education existed before? Because literacy doesn't just magically appear. It takes work, practice, and repetition, which ANY EDUCATOR in early developmental education would attest. Furthermore, the written English language is NOT an easy one to grasp without some form of literacy being accompanied by it.It's just some overzealous person with an Ouija board.One last comment: reviews that have ""questions"" after clearly didn't watch the entirety of documentary (or watch at all?). Derrick was evaluated HUNDREDS of times in his life, if not more, and especially by respected researchers. He was evaluated for the court by Dr. Shane.Anna stubblefield is an either a psychopath who doesn't know the difference between right and wrong (no) or a vicious sociopath who doesn't care (yes).",True
3,6,Director Misses Opportunity to Ask Obvious Question,cgho56,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't accept we're led to believe a mentally disabled individual suffering from a severe case of cerebral palsy - who was evaluated multiple times prior to his exposure to Anna Stubblefield and deemed to posses the intellectual capacity of a baby - would miraculously make an astronomical leap from the inability to associate basic inanimate objects when given verbal cues to somehow expressing argumentative critique on academic subjects. Huh?It takes years of education to learn language - vocabulary, grammar, syntax - let alone development in logic and critical thinking. Derrick can't identify a spoon, but somehow can give a salient review on Harriot Jacobs now? Give me a break.The director egregiously misses an opportunity to confront Stubblefield on this premise, and the documentary is significantly weakened because of it. She is instead able to justify her actions with dubious claims like ""I'm not guilty If the accusation is I have some weird perversion that makes me want to molest helpless, intellectually impaired people."" Redeeming.The nuance rather is Stubblefield shows various signs of self-interest (having published work on FC in the journal Disability Studies Quarterly), and elements of sociopathy and psychopathy. This can be a diabolical cocktail for crime, although seemingly innocent on the surface.",True
4,7,I had visceral reactions throughout my viewing of this film,Flang,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFor quite some time into the documentary, I felt like i was missing something (knowing that facilitated communication has been discredited for many years, but the controversy was not mentioned until much later in the film). Then I realized that I was not missing anything. Rather, the scenario was so truly bizarre and disturbing. Regardless of Anna Stubblefield's pathology, it is very difficult for me to wrap my head around the idea of how she could have claimed (and believed?) that Derrick seduced her. I hope for healing in the Johnson family. I was disheartened to learn that Syracuse University continues to utilize and support FC.",True
5,6,His Name Is Derrick,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stop attributing nonsensical gibberish to your clear malice which you clearly meant to inflict, AND STILL seem intent on believing. What Anne did to this man with the comprehension of a child is absolutely disgusting and beyond my ability to comprehend. What she did was clear and intentional manipulation by way of Florence Nightengale Syndrome- falling in love with someone you care for, but went into territory of illegality and manipulation.I'll admit to having a pang of knowledge the minute it was cast on the screen that there was no admission of FC in the trial- while it's largely viewed as junk science by many of the prominent academics in society, it was still a crux of this case and should have been allowed to be heard and shown in order to shine a spotlight on her fraud. Rather than allowing her to manipulate his supposed conversation and intelligence, it should have been performed with Derrick by an outside source, accompanied by a double blind example as shown to see if he was capable or was obviously being manipulated to convey what she wanted. That her case was overturned and she took the option to plead to a lesser charge shows she knew what would be the outcome. Of course her mother and her friend took her side in all of this- but where were the people who were in Derricks corner, besides his mom and brother?It's absolutely appalling that she still sees absolutely nothing wrong with what she did and what her behavior has left him with. It's quite clear merely by witnessing his mother discuss the need for medication due to his excessive masturbatory practices after Anne's disgusting behavior- how? Because his brain hasn't experienced any sort of pubescent behavior. Thereby introducing her deviancy into his subconscious, he began experiencing something unfamiliar, but pleasing. So as a result, he began behaving in ways that simulated the pleasure in other ways.It's beyond insulting how these so-called 'white knights' think they're so necessary in saving black culture- and I've no doubt Anne pictured herself on the whitest horse, cloaked in goodness and godliness to somehow save Derrick- yet in her blatant disregard for facts and evidence, saw only her needs and her elevation as the most important factor. She was willing to completely disregard her own family-(husband, children) career and status to be seen as the heroine in her own story.The most confounding part of all of this though- does anyone realize that Anne fell in love with herself? It's classic psychotic narcissist syndrome- she loves her own image so much that she projected it onto Derrick. That's beyond sick.",False
6,9,Very good documentary about a Rapist,JaneYork8178,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's start with the obvious : Anna is a rapist.Derrick wasn't reading any books. He never wrote any essay.This was all a creation of Anna and his ""assistant "" - who I don't believe was credible. The PROFESSOR of the class did not believe Derrick had any understanding or was actually participating at all.The people who were credible: Derrick's brother and the man who PROPERLY evaluated Derrick.His mother is also extremely credible .Yes. She calls him her ""baby ""
He has the cognitive ability of a 1 year old. He is, in a sense , a baby.The fact that Anna had never taken responsibility for her crime of rape is appalling .Her mother is also seriously deranged and unable to hold her daughter accountable.This is BOTCHED AND FAKE ""treatment"" that has proven to be bogus and they won't admit it.She should have spent EVERY DAY of her original 12 year sentence in prison.",True
7,6,Could have taken an hour,DVK1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAnna Stubblefield is delusional and it's a shame that she was let out of jail after serving only two years for sexually assaulting a man with the intelligence of an infant/toddler. If I were his mother and brother, the early release would infuriate me.Derrick Johnson had a voice only when Anna Stubblefield found it for him. The breakdown of society is when we see women behaving wickedly in the exact manner that Anna Stubblefield did. She will reap what she sows.The documentary was way too lengthy and it probably could have been whittled down by 30 or 40 minutes. I believe that Anna Stubblefield is still delusional. Her mother too.I recommend this documentary, but be prepared to be annoyed at its length.",True
8,8,Very confronting,xhdmkcm,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI appreciate the way this was put together. It does not give you a specific POV which it forces one to adopt, but allows you to be the judge and jury. But it's still haunting.If you accept that Anna is right - then DMan's family felt uncomfortable letting him become an adult man and live independently. Which would be really sad because they'd have centred their comfort over his needs. There is some anecdotal evidence that perhaps he was fully aware of what was going on (especially the addiction he has now). If that is the case, removing Anna from his life was the wrong decision. That possibility makes his current existence a very haunting possibility.On the other hand, if facilitated communication is a hoax (and again there is anecdotal evidence), then Anna is a villain and DMan's family did the right thing.Someone is a hero and someone is a villain. But it also feels like whoever is the villain was an unwitting villain. What then is justice in those circumstances?I appreciate the way Louis Theroux does documentaries. He documents and lets us sit with the burden of deciding and finding a resolution.",True
9,7,Not what you might think...,jenniferwarnock,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI turned this on thinking I would be anti-Anna, and pro-Derrick's family. But...it's not so clear cut. There is alot of solid information, and I think both side make compelling points. The family is highly problematic, and makes a lot of far reaching racial conclusions. Anna was married to a black man, which the family knew and then they sling a bunch of racial tropes her way and compare her to being a"" Sandra bullock from the blind side"". Never can have a story without a bunch of racial accusations...so tiresome. Omg, your son masturbates, wow. So, let's put him on meds for it? Huh?Still worth a watch.",True
10,8,"Great documentary, well done. I only have one question.",bananas-06047,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf the man was capable of writing his thoughts, feelings and emotions, why couldn't someone else (who was independently appointed by the court) just ask him his side? If a judge could independently adjudicate his personal take they could judge. I thought throughout this whole documentary that this was building up to a climax where we were just gonna get to hear him speak and understand his side and that never came.For example, did Derek's former teacher actually call him DMan?! Could Sharona attest to Derricks personality/voice?I did appreciate the clarity of thought and emotion that Anna had. Added to that, the ability of the family and friends to add thoughtful and powerful perspectives made this.",True
11,7,Shame on Dman's family,DarknessVisible20,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerShame on Dman's RACIST family, and thr racist kangaroo court judge that convicted Anna. Thankfully the appellate court overturned the travesty of justice that was done to Anna.The fact that so many people simply can't wrap their minds that relationships can be 'different', and yet still be valid and sincere is sad. The fact that they find a white woman and a disabled black man together so abhorrent that they consider it a crime speaks volumes about their own racist and ableist prejudices.I believe Anna and Dman did have a real, mutually consensual relationship.His brother and mother who are raging racists hit the roof only because the relationship was with a white woman.Obviously Dman became distraught when they forcibly separated him from Anna, and instead of respecting the fact that this grown man wanted to pursue this relationship, they separated him from Anna and turned this woman's life upside down.And the fact that his lunatic mother put him on psych meds because he was -gasp!- masturbating! This is a grown man! The fact that he had a disability does not cancel out the fact he's a sexual being! Disgusting behavior on the part of this family, shame on them.I'm just glad Anna didn't spend more time in prison that she did, only thanks to a saner court stepping in.",True
12,3,From the opinion of someone with mild cerebral palsy,cieciep,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI just watched the ""Tell them you love me"" documentary on Netflix and I have a controversial opinion.I may be biased due to the fact that I have the same disability as Derrick, in a much milder form and I am able to verbalize and communicate.I believe Anna Stubberfield was professionally and morally wrong, however not legally. Professionally wrong due to the fact that she crossed a "" code of conduct ""boundary between client/instructor.Morally wrong because she cheated on her husband, but because Derrick had the intellectual capacity to complete college level assignments with the assistance of a student aide, and she claimed she did not read the material or complete the work for him; that shows that he did have the intellectual capacity to consent, he just couldn't verbalize it.I believe Derrick was his mother/brother's ""Entire World ""and they couldn't fathom that because he couldn't speak he would possibly have any chance at a normal life, I believe they were more than likely receiving government assistance for him and didn't want to relinquish it. They also should have had someone with a disability on the jury.Lastly, the psychological assessment was done unfairly, his communication device should have been admissible in court because that is what he was educated with to communicate . If he had been unable to communicate on that device before the jury , then that would have proved her wrongdoing, but the device was considered inadmissible.",True
13,7,its the worst...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNightmare ever for every proffesional health and otherwise caretaker , when it comes to a point where love has become a part of the interaction, and non of the parts really cant protect themselves from the consequences of their acts...its a documentary that may disgust most people where the one eyed pea just looks in one direction, whilst the defendant (and in this case also the victim) may have a more nuanced picture of the whole affair, and isnt allowed to tell that side of the story because the public has only one consideration of her deeds, thats called indespicable pervertions...i shall not say whats wrong or not, but i cannot stop myself from imagining them as a kind of couple, and i think that none other than the family of the victim would feel as the purpertrated ones...do not misunderstand my thoughts, many relationships among ''normals'' shouldve been avoided too, look at all the domestic violence that happens within the realms of a ''normal'' household...i 'll admit that i got angry by this documentary and its outcome, let this woman regain freedom from her deemed excile to do what she does best of all, namely teach that nobody else dares to ...",True
14,7,The only thing missing is Reverend Al Sharpton...,dnevitt-60896,n/a,16/08/2025,"That movie scream racism and control... but a lot of it from personal experience. Both disability and having some interracial relationships in the past.From the start you could see the family was going to be the issue. Example, mother seriously needs to cut the apron strings, she's just keeping Derrick tied down and isolated because she doesn't want to be alone. Her husband left her due time him. Like they said and she don't want the child she choose over husband to leave. She acts just like my dude mom has acted and has said the same things. She even guilt trips him whenever he tries to stand up to her. Brings up the time he was in the hospital for 5 months in a coma and having seizures, that she was there everyday and no one else.The brother is super raciest as well. Saying Derrick doesn't like our gospel music, because of Anna. That he never cried like that in front is a white woman. Why does it matter if she's whites. Why not just say, I never cried like that in front of a woman in a professional setting? Everything was about black and white with him.As far as, Anna I'm conflicted. It's hard to know exactly Derrick's mindset, but I do believe he's a grown man. Even if they act like his mentality is of that of a 12 month old. I do find it odd she knew so much about him and his life for her manipulating his hand and thoughts. Specially after Anna stopped coming around, he was showing signs of distress and self harm.However, common sense like never bring up your sex life with anyone outside your lover and friend zone... never parents or in-laws. That's why I feel if she really was raping him she wouldn't bring it up.I agree and believe people with special needs don't have low intelligence and that we can all learn to communicate. My son whose autistic show's me this everyday. He might not be verbal, but we find ways around to communicate. Be it pictures or sign language, that way he's not getting frustrated as easily and so he knows that he's not being isolated and not heard; and so he knows he has a voice.",False
15,6,Telepathy tapes justifies the professor,austin_250,n/a,16/08/2025,"As much as everyone wants Derrick to be a vegetable who doesn't mind being a virgin living with his mom until he dies, he isn't. Telepathy tapes justifies the professor and it's just sad the jealous brother got in the way of the love of his life. The brother got his way tho, he stopped the perpetrator and now he's brother can live by himself with his mom decade after decade not getting any of his sexual needs met and then age and die slowly always remembering Anna as this bright spot in his youth that could've blossomed him into the sun but now he gets to act like a vegetable to please his brother.",False
16,10,Thought-provoking look at disability,jordyanne_xx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary really threw me for a loop. I went into it expecting a classic cut-and-dry true crime doc, but it ended up leaving me with an empty feeling in my throat. This, because either way the cookie crumbles, someone is suffering.It began with a great story of a man and a woman working on the man's ability to communicate, and overturned into something completely different.I really loved the way this was filmed, and how it really gives you, the viewer, a chance to see where you fall in the (unfortunate) black and white world of disability. I hope it generates more awareness of the polarizing effect so many people with disabilities face.",False
17,8,Shocking,cutie7,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Tell Them You Love Me"" is guaranteed to blow your mind. This thought-provoking documentary tells the extraordinary and controversial story of Anna Stubblefield and Derrick Johnson, challenging our perceptions of disability and consent. Anna, an esteemed university professor, claimed to unlock Derrick's mind from his body through facilitated communication, sparking a complex and shocking relationship that led to a sensational criminal trial. The film skillfully uses exclusive footage and interviews to create a narrative that is as riveting as it is nuanced, exploring deep themes of communication, race, and sexuality.""Tell Them You Love Me"" sucks you in from the very start, making it impossible to take your eyes off the screen. The way it's filmed captures the raw and unexpected turns of this fascinating case in human psychology, offering a unique perspective on true crime. It draws you into a story that is both shocking and profoundly interesting. The documentary not only highlights the ethical and legal dilemmas faced by those involved but also raises important questions about the nature of love and agency in the context of severe disability. This is a must-watch for anyone interested in the complexities of human psychology.",False
18,8,Guilty as charged,luvireland-11253,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is shocking. Anna should still be in jail. Can you even imagine had the roles been reversed, with the perpetrator being a male and the victim being a thirty-something female with the mindset OF AN INFANT. Derrick has the mannerisms of a baby; rocking his head back and forth, playing with his hands. Now, his 30-something BODY offered a quasi-consent, but there is no freaking way that Derrick has the ability to mentally consent. Anna used her position to take severe advantage of this man. I can't imagine how she sleeps at night. Derrick wears DIAPERS for god's sake. Anna caused Derrick to get rug burns on his back....this is NOT someone who could initiate a change of position. This is not a person who could undress and REDRESS himself afterwards. He's a severely mentally-challenged man who was a victim of rape.",True
19,3,Shocking!!,blaquegurl-25986,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI am both shocked and appalled at some of comments. I understand that realistically we want to believe when our loved ones are a prisoner in their own bodies that they are able to communicate in different ways but are we really going to overlook the study that proved most of the test subjects were not accurate on what the aide and student were visually viewing and concluded that only the aides view was being entered. And you all claim nothing is about race but if the races were reversed none of you would be happy to with this happening. Otherwise the documentary was insightful and informative.,True
20,8,Thought provoking and balanced documentary,ljberesford,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs the mother of non-verbal teen with epilepsy, autism and LD I probably approach this from a slightly different perspective than most.There were red flags with all parties. Anna clearly has an obsession with the disabled lived experience; it isn't normal for a child to want to try and experience different disabilities. Her mom struck me as a very odd person.Derrick's mom clearly still views him as a baby. She called him that numerous times. She seemed disgusted by him masturbating and seemed to think he wouldn't know how to do that if it wasn't for what Anna did to him. Learning disability or not any young male discovers that without help.Add in a racist brother and a controversial technique like facilitated communication and you have a perfect storm. I would like to know more about how Derrick managed to write those college papers when his assistant hadn't read the books. It feels like there's more to the story than we are presented with.",True
21,8,Speechless. I was not read for this story.,sassyfloridabrown,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis story is as sad as it gets. Anna has this weird obsession with the
disabled. My honest opinion is that Anna and her mother are delusional. Anna stated that Derrick was the most important person in her life, were you small kids not the most important? Throughout the entire documentary, I never once heard Anna acknowledge her kids until the sentencing, when she pleaded with the judge to, ""let me take care of my daughter.""Anna became obsessed with a disabled man, who can't communicate, cant do anything for himself. Derrick wears diapers, he can't walk on his own. Yet she wanted to divorce her husband and marry Derrick. I think Derrick was an escape from a marriage She wasn't happy.It's like she felt like she was his savior. She inserted herself in his life. She really lost touch with reality and I believe that in her mind she really felt that she did nothing wrong, even though, she took advantage of someone who couldn't protect himself. She betrayed his family, who trusted her with their loved one. This is revolting.Why did Derrick not respond with his brother or mom with the machine, but supposedly he responded with Anna?From Derricks brother describing the scares on his back from Anna dragging him to have sex, to Derrick now masturbating, its insanity.",True
22,10,"Excellent documentary, exposing utter fraud",janemccready-43316,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs mum to a disabled and similarly vulnerable adult son, I found this exposee of what was essentially rape by a deluded scamster very chilling. Imagine if the genders were reversed? The outcry would have been faster and greater. I thought the documentary makers did a good, balanced job. Only minor criticism is that it wasn't made clear why Anna S got out of jail early - she accepted a plea deal on 'aggravated criminal sexual conduct' and also admitted she knew he could not give consent. A fairly crucial admission. This programme though was the first time I've seen anyone question the utter fraud that is 'Facilitated Communication', too many other programs and indeed universities have swallowed it hook, line and sinker.",True
23,2,"Typical Luis Theroux, documentary - shocking subject, lazy treated.",marin-79103,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is mostly a series of baffling monologues.We still do not know if the poor guy was assessed by someone else during his apparent college carrier. How did he attended college classes? Are any other professors or colleagues who saw him at that time?Was Anna Stubblefield mentally stable?Was she philologically tested during and after the trial?How can a ""respected academic"" have sex with a disabled patient?What did the support assistant do and thought about the state of the patient?Was anyone else involved inTypical Luis Theroux, documentary - shocking subject, lazy treated.",True
24,10,are you in love?,jaredechavez,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the beginning, it was made clear that, to tell this story, we had to present all angles and involve all those who were part of it. Newark ethics professor originally convicted in 2015 of sexually assaulting Derrick Johnson, a nonverbal man with cerebral palsy. The two met in 2009 through his brother, John Johnson, a student of Stubblefield's. After John Johnson approached the professor, then 39, about his brother's condition, Stubblefield offered to help Derrick Johnson, then 28, with his communication skills. He soon learned to use a keyboard with an LED screen to type and, with Stubblefield's assistance, began taking a university class. The film explores the unsettling case of Dr. Anna Stubblefield, a white Rutgers University philosophy professor and disability theorist who began working with Derrick Johnson, a non-verbal Black man with cerebral palsy and intellectual disabilities, using a scientifically questionable method to help him communicate. That method, called Facilitated Communication, involves supporting the hand of a person with motor skill issues so they can point to letters on a board or tap letters on a keyboard to express thoughts.",False
25,9,Quite simple ?,belvie_gt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why did the judge not ask Derrick to answer questions with the help of the keyboard after passing the simple IQ-test where Derrick is shown an apple and the keyboard assistant/facilitator is shown a spoon? If the answer would have been ""apple"" then the real questioning could proceed. If the answer would be ""spoon"" then we know the facilitator talks. Alternatively, the assistant/facilitator should not have been shown a picture of apple/spoon at all. It's Derrick that needed to answer in court, right? It looks like Anna was talking to herself through her patient Derrick. By letting Derrick move away from his home to a new home (with Anna) the gov subsidies would have moved too. Anna gets out of an unhappy marriage and becomes a heroine that made an intellectual out of a non-verbal man that was over-protected / locked away by his mom and bro for way too long. It's so simple : let Derrick prove in court that he really wrote those essays etc? Most probably the judge and jury saw that Derrick really wasn't and will never be capable. That's how Anna ended up in jail.",False

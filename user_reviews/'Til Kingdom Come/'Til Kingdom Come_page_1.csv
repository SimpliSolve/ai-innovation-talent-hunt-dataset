1,8,"Good job, BBC",maniort,n/a,16/08/2025,"For years I've been gravitating to the BBC app for my news. They seem to be the current version of what the NYT once was, or as close to.Documentaries these days, however well made, are unapologetically partial. It behooves anyone purporting to document with a camera to present both sides of every coin. A worthy documentary in the present, all things considered, is one that makes you think deeply and leaves you undecided.This one does the job.",False

3,9,Why do some people help Israel?,digiteum,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe writer suggests that there may be something wrong with Christians Zionists who give money to Israel, because their end motivations are different from what the Jewish people believe in. She goes further and suggest the $1.5b gift should be given back!The problem in the documentary mentions that the Christian Zionist doctrine then goes further, so how do we respond to that? People that give alms to Eretz may have a hidden agenda.I asked a rabbi that i know and his response 'A hungry holocaust survivor receiving a hot meal thanks Gd, I believe that itself is more than enough.''The only question is who receives the fund and can they be trusted servants.'It therefore has nothing to do with the giver, they certainly have their own paradigm, but the people of Israel are thankful!This is not mentioned in the documentary, and therefore the director's view is biased.",True

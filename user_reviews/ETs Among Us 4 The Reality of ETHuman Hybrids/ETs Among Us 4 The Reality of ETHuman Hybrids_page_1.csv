1,6,Worth a view,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerRenowned psychotherapist Barbara Lamb - who wrote this film - has proof of ET/human hybrids. What are these hybrid species? What are their abilities? Why are they here on Earth? Not only does Lamb have these answers, she also has had several long-term relationships with several hybrid species.Now, that knowledge can be yours.According to her website, Barbara Lamb is a ""UFOlogy Researcher - Experiencer and Past Life Therapist - Crop Circle Educator."" It goes deeper to explain that ""Barbara Lamb offers personalized regression therapy sessions, books, workshops and interviews. She is a world-renowned experiencer therapist, Ufologist, crop circle expert and past life therapist."" She's also ""a longtime psychotherapist, having been licensed in 1976, and a highly trained hypnotherapist and regression therapist since 1984. She had five years of training in regression therapy by the International Association for Regression Research and Therapies. She became a trainer for that organization as well as for the Professional Institute of Regression Therapy and the International Board of Regression Therapists. In 1991 she began regressing people to the details of their extraterrestrial encounters, and has regressed well over 2000 people (in over 4000 regressions) to those and to other paranormal experiences. This work and her past life therapy and her soul guidance work continues, with sessions in person in San Diego, California and on Skype or Zoom.""You can check out her YouTube channel here.There are four 1 star reviews on IMDB and two 10 star reviews. They are as opposite as you can get, the lower end decrying the lack of evidence and the well-reviewed ones enthralled and sure that everything in this movie is gospel. I find myself somewhere in the middle of all of this, but that doesn't mean that I wasn't entertained by this.",True
2,1,Hope you love stock photos,dtboling,n/a,15/08/2025,"The entire film consists of just one woman, sitting against a black background, speaking directly to the camera as she presents her story without a single speck of evidence whatsoever. She doesn't offer a single piece of evidence at all in the whole film, even though her fantastic and shocking report demands it. Instead, they spent a fortune on standard and various generic stock photos that played under her monologue, with a few generic ""futuristic"" drawings. So if you like those a lot then you'll love this film. But if you need a bit of proof, to either defend or mock as you wish, to go along with your alien stories then this isn't for you. I guess you can tell which camp I'm in from my rating of 1 / 10.",False
3,1,A story and pictures doesn't equal proof,majestictwelve-86062,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before watching this I'd never heard of Barbara Lamb, or Cybela Clare either and I think I know why. There's no substance in this documentary at all, and what is presented doesn't sound novel at all. Surely, if you're going to make bold claims about alien contact and want to be taken seriously, you'd at least provide witnesses or evidence to back you up, but Ms Lamb doesn't and I strongly suspect that's because she can't.",False
4,1,"It's an Opinion, not a Documentary",raiyann-52390,n/a,15/08/2025,"Without providing any physical witness, videos, media about real-life encounters or lack thereof, An apparent expert of alien biology, despite being a psychotherapist herself, just conveys her opinion or fantasy about ET/Human Hybrids. She merely and mostly used artists imagination to substantiate her claims; even correlating human-animal bonding, abnormal human abilities as her so called hybrid-like traits presumptuously.If it was possible for me to give this a negative rating, I would, in a heart-bit.",False
5,1,Serious Drop in Quality beyond the Paywall,esteban_sunchild,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first 3 were pretty good - entertaining at least. They were on Amazon Prime for free, then to watch the 4th one you have to either sign up to GAIA or rent/buy them. So I signed up for a 7-day free trial to GAIA and sure enough, the very next video beyond that wall was garbage. Really, Barbara? All the alien races want to make hybrids with humans? Preposterous. There's no evidence, I wasn't expecting any, but was hoping to at least be entertained but this is just painful to watch.",True
6,10,A Brave New World peopled with strange new creatures emerging from the galaxy,hlgould60,n/a,15/08/2025,"Barbara Lamb has created an elaborate, exotic, fanciful new world that mixes fantasy and fact incorporating her sophisticated familiarity with psychology, knowledge of history and astral science. She delivers the story with
aristocratic grace and beguiles us into a vision of an incredible world of ET's, hybrids, transportation,space travel
and genetics. Whether you believe in the existence of her world or dismiss it as science fiction she is a fun read.",False
7,10,Stunning New Info From Highly Credible Expert. Eye Opening!!!,michaelasslack,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis extraordinary film was truly eye-opening for me! Barbara Lamb presented this esoteric material in an organized, factual and totally convincing manner, comprehensible even to viewers like me, previously unfamiliar with the subject.The illustrations are outstanding, and offer stunning visuals that help add a face to the names of some of these ET/human hybrids!I was fascinated by the various advanced medical procedures involved in creating hybrid beings and by the endless potential combinations of extraterrestrial species with humans.Even more fascinating were the unusual traits and the amazing abilities of these ET/human hybrids. One of the most stunning examples was a particular hybrid's eye, which transformed from human to reptilian in a matter of seconds. Watching that shapeshifting eye totally blew my mind!All in all, this movie was an extremely educational and enjoyable experience for me. I learnt a lot and loved every minute of it!",True

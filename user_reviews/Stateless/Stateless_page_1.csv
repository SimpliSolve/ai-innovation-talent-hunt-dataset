1,10,EPIC 2020 Summation,Znoodles,n/a,16/08/2025,"The year 2020 was devasted by the CoVid pandemic but this series portrays a different one of our greatest human failures.Throughout the world people struggle for better lives for themselves and especially their children.This Australian produced film is inspired by actual events. Stories of asylum seekers wanting to immigrate and being imprisoned for many years while their applications are processed.Racial and cultural lines are sometimes bent or broken but the desire to have FREEDOM, CHOICES to strive for HAPPINESS without fears of being beaten, mothers and daughters enslaved never falters.America is equally criminal in separating families, sending children into religion based foster care systems and supporting government officials who pander to hate groups.The cast of this series are all excellent actors. There are many spectacular scenic shots.The message of Stateless is clear. In such an advanced technological age, why are humans allowing other humans to be imprisoned in harsh prison camps while those with great financial resources are given visas upon demand.I hope in 20 years society will reflect upon these issues and recognize that similar to Hitler's Nazi Germany some things need changing.",False

1,9,Another great documentary from Tony Robinson,alcaamv,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm an avid fan of history documentaries, but unfortunately there aren't many shows out there that really give an insight into how ordinary men and women lived out their lives. In History of Britain Tony Robinson takes us through the people who really helped to build the nation, from miners and builders to the ordinary working women who helped to form the backbone of the country.Tony Robinson also injects a little humour here and there and the show seems to be aimed at younger audiences, but it's still a fascinating watch and you're sure to learn one or two things along the way. Overall it's a great little documentary and I'd love to see more.",False

3,10,Well done Sir Tonyl,jinxieb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love historical documentaries and Sir Tony Robinson's are wonderful I've watched as many as I can find that are available in the U. S. The History of Britain, uncovers the what it was for those who lived ordinary lives, which is what makes it more interesting than learning about royalty and other well known historical figures. One thing is wrong. IMBD lists the series as being available on Pluto TV, that is incorrect, I searched for it on Pluto and didn't find it. I did find it available on Tubi.",False
4,5,Ok but....,edmurray-09818,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't mind Tony Robinson and have watched a few of his documentaries, especially the history ones.However, this series ""Tony Robinson's History Of Britain"" is somewhat ruined for by what to me is the inappropriate and intrusive spouts of music that keep popping up.Not only intrusive, the music is too loud too.I hate the lighthearted jingles that start when Tony is discussing something serious like Highway Men or surgery.It just seems so inappropriate.I know loud intrusive music seems to be a necessary prerequisite for any ""serious"" type of documentary these days, a great point in case being the BBC's ""Horizon"" which used to be a wonderful documentary series until totally ruined by the wizz bang whoosh approach and silly camera work (I never did enjoy looking up people's noses or close ups of the flaking skin on their faces) and am disappointed that Tony's documentaries seem to be going down the same path..",False

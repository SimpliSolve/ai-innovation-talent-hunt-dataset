1,4,Adds nothing new to the story,ossimorko,n/a,15/08/2025,"The whole 2-part document is about the search and rescue mission for the sub (and how the whole world followed the search), while the viewer already knows that it imploded early on in its descent.The document tries to be shocking with pointing out all the time how ""they have this much time left before they run out of oxygen in the sub"" and then it basically ends with ""oh yeah, it imploded during the first hours of the descent, THE END"".It tells nothing about the timeline when the implosion actually happened.Doesn't give ANY real insight into what was wrong with the sub's construction (other than ""it was made of carbon fiber"").Why there's nothing about the communication between the Titan and the Polar Prince before the communication was lost? That would've been interesting to learn about.They teach nothing about what exactly is an implosion and why it happened.Overall, you will definitely find more comprehensive information about the disaster from YouTube or Wikipedia.",False

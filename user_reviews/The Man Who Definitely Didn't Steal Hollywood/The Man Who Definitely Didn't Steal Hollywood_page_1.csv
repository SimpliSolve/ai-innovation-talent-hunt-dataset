1,7,The rise & fall of the elaborate purchase of MGM by a man who doesn't know the film Citizen Kane!,Nina_K9,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a quirky documentary about a story that is almost unbelievable. Giancarlo Parretti is definitely character who has a story worth telling. For a man who doesn't know much about films, he has lived a life that would make a great film. A successful businessman who's had a questionable and extraordinary journey. Is he connected, is he a fraudster, is he the puppet or the puppeteer? Whatever he was he somehow managed to purchase one of the major studios that once dominated Hollywood in the golden age. The filmmakers have a done a great job accessing the right witnesses to help untangle this web of confusing yet impressive transactions which led to the purchase of MGM in 1990. I loved hearing the voice of the Director of this documentary asking the right questions while trying his best to comprehend who Parretti is and how he got to where he did. I think he managed to reach the tip of the iceberg. What a great story and a well made doc.",False
2,8,"Once Upon a Time in Italy, America, and France",paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe fun film begins by introducing us to a very ordinary-seeming elderly Italian man, albeit one whose townhouse, anonymous on the outside, proves suspiciously luxurious within. It turns out he once owned MGM. What then follows is an astonishing story about how he basically blagged his way to a billion dollar loan before everything came crashing down. But even today, both Perretti and his co-conspriator, now an equally anonymous elderly gentleman, deny doing anything wrong, and ask us to believe a story riddled with holes. An American prosecutor makes the point that no-one can do this kind of thing without a lot of cooperation, which in this case came from the French bank Credit Lyonnais, which for reasons that remain unclear was bizarrely keen to do big deals without any kind of due dilligence. Perretti's complete absence of interest in cinema (at one poin an interviewer has to explain 'Citizen Kane' to him) adds to the surreal feel.",True
3,10,this is non-...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSensemantic entertainment for the ever so ridicule nonsense that hollywood were back then and probably still is today, with shy money transactions, heavenfolded bribery and scams that would burst like a troll if shedded into the radiative force of the sunshine(not moonshine!), a heavenly open and forthcomming documentary comedy about the man who definately didnt steal hollywood, but shot carronades of cannon-balls and stole MGM for whatever little it was worth back then...its italianissimo financialissimo bancruptissimo fraudissimo in cinesissimo inprissionamente in absentissimo...a jolly good fellow thinks the grumpy old man, parretti is like berlussconi...the archtypical italian cesarian minded gambler that didnt have a clue about films other than the box-office numbers... take a line and have a jolly good time...its for everyone who were into films in the 1980's and nighties...",True
4,10,"So, what happened?",paul_mcdonald_100,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great account of one of the most complex and baffling episodes in the business history of Hollywood film. Unresolved questions around how Parretti rose from nothing to engineer the purchase of MGM make him an intriguing documentary subject. By the end of this film, you won't know the answers to those questions but you will have a greater appreciation of why you don't know the answers. Access to key figures in the story help verify what otherwise would sound like a totally unbelievable tale. Despite the dubiousness of what (might) have gone on here, Parretti's considerable charm continues to endure.",False

1,6,An Ode to Punk History: Max's Kansas City and underapplauded legacy.,KinoBuff2021,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Nightclubbing: The Birth of Punk Rock in NYC"" (2022) is heartfelt and honest about the deep history and legacy of what some called the birthplace of punk, Max's Kansas City. Overall, the documentary is alright but leaves you wishing that the documentary was really a docu-series or expanded upon some more.With it origins dating back to the 1960s, Max's Kansas City was more than a nightclub (and restaurant). It was a melting pot of ""punk"" culture such as art, music, film, and personality. This documentary might sound like it will focus on the whole early NYC punk scene but it really is a Max's film with some crumbs thrown towards England, Ohio, and the rest of NY (e.g. CBGB). Not that there is really anything wrong with that as Max's started earlier but also closed earlier before punk continued to get more mainstream attention. Max's has become not forgotten but less mentioned than CBGB despite it's deep lineage with the history of punk culture and music.This documentary was great with its many interviews from legendary figures who have somehow survived their peers. But the interviews were all done kind of differently and seemed less than professional than they should have been. At least we are lucky to have footage of this early era in punk. But the footage seems underutilized. We only get a little bit of a backstory of its early days and quick nod to Max's legacy in the development of hardcore punk.I love the music, history, and personalities but this documentary seems disappointing. There's an overabundance of information thrown out but reliant on 50 year old memories to tell the story. I liked it but not a favorite music film for me besides the actual music.Slightly above-average. Worth watching.",False

It's never too late to get hip.",False

Boyan seemed like a very genuine, smart person with an amazing personality and character. It was great to see what he was before the climb of Everest. Also it was great to see Kiril Petkov supporting the search and also all the people who helped in the rescue! Bulgaria indeed thanks you for all your efforts! His spirit was unmatched and we will remember his words, his motivation, his kindness, hiss will to live, to achieve, to climb and to never ever give up! Thank you to the creators of the movie and thank you everyone involved.",False

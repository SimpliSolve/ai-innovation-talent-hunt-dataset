1,8,Great,PedroPires90,n/a,15/08/2025,"Surprised by these ratings. I know it won't win - the elephants will and I will be happy with it - but this is my favorite of the 5 short docs at these Oscars.As someone who loves narrative stuff, loves character arcs, and redemption stories, this is clearly a winner. I didn't know about this story or this man. I don't even know if all of this is true. I know that how this was told and edited, did convince me and it touched me.Of course, I wanted to hate this man. What he planned to do is unspeakable. Of course, he was racist. But...have I ever been on his feet? Did I have his childhood, his teenage years, fighting and killing at war? No. And I would bet all my money that neither 99.9% of the haters here.In a black or white world - I hate social media and what it made to us, beings with zero nuance - only dialogue and understanding can guarantee that this planet will be destroyed by itself and not by us very soon.",False
2,7,people are strange ... and can change,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Should you ever doubt that kindness and understanding can make a difference, please watch this film from director Joshua Seftel (WAR, INC, 2008). The 29 minute run time may just rejuvenate your faith in human beings to change their attitude and be accepting of those they once distrusted.As a Marine, Richard ""Mac"" McKinney was trained to hate and kill Muslims. He was informed that they were terrorists out to destroy his country, and September 11, 2001 was all the proof he needed. A simple question from his young daughter Emily convinced him he needed to act, so he plotted to bomb the Islamic Culture Center of Muncie (Indiana). So this former Marine, a trained killer and hater, headed to the mosque to obtain the ""proof"" he needed to convince his daughter that his actions were righteous.A funny thing happened. Mac was treated kindly by the folks there. They asked him questions and guided him to a better understanding. Now this didn't happen overnight. A shift in beliefs never occurs quickly. However, their treatment of Mac not only (unknowingly) saved their own lives, it saved his as well. He may have been trained to not think of his war targets as human beings, but he found them to show him more humanity than he'd ever known. It's chilling to see Emily ponder what it would have been like to have a mass murderer as a father, and mostly we are inspired to see good people work so diligently at accepting someone who initially showed them nothing but hatred. Nobel Prize winner Malala Yousafzai is one of the producers of the film.",False
3,6,Stranger at the Gate,CinemaSerf,n/a,15/08/2025,"Richard McKinney spent over 25 hears in the US military and it's fair to say that when he returned home to Muncie in Indiana he was a pretty devout hater of all things Muslim. He despised their beliefs, their clothing and indeed admits that he completely lost the plot when he thought they were mixing with his young daughter. Determined to rid the town of this scourge, he set about planning a bomb attack on their mosque whilst they were all at prayer. It was on a recce, though, that he began to realise that these people were decent, respectful and kindly families who treated him with an humanity he had hitherto been lacking for many a year. Apparently it took him only a matter of weeks to realise that he had backed the wrong horse and that these were folks to be embraced as they had embraced him. It's not a great documentary. It does seem to suggest rather that the Muslim community has all the work to do to prove it's non-complicity in atrocities when they happen and that the armed forces are always acting honourably, but it did also make me wonder what steps the military authorities take to ensure the mental wellbeing of people who have basically given most of their lives to blindly obeying orders that require no compassion, evaluation or validation of the orders given. As one of his superiors pointed out to him - just imagine they are but pieces of paper on a target practice. It just goes to show that communication and interaction can go some way to breaking down barriers and assumptions and hats off to McKinney for his honesty.",False
4,10,Brilliant!,skippernichols,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an intriguing true story, which my wife and I watched at the Walla Walla Movie Crush last weekend. It's a lesson of a dramatic change by a Marine after many tours of combat duty. It reveals that love and kindness can change hearts and minds. Richard McKinney was in Walla Walla and was very open and willing to talk to me (also a Marine). His daughter also plays an important role in this story. Do not miss seeing this .. DO NOT MISS SEEING THIS!!!",False
5,9,Shocked this isn't higher rated than 6.8 especially since its been praised by many!,UniqueParticle,n/a,15/08/2025,"A must see 28 minute short that is well made, genuine and a surprise! About a father that seems normal and gets transformed because of the marine core. The performances are outstanding that stay interesting; I see why this has done well! The interviews/stories are fascinating along with being harsh. Stranger at the Gate is something special that is quite well directed something I probably wouldn't have seen if I wasn't as into the award shows more so than ever before and the subject matter is intense for me yet peacefully told. More than most shorts except The Boy, the Mole, the fox and the horse this is worthy of a win.",False
6,n/a,Well done! BRAVO,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fantastic story everyone should see. It is an inspiring and uplifting movie that gives you a wonderful feeling inside. The lesson you take away from the film is that warmth and affection is contagious, by being nice to anyone even if they are strangers or family brings out the good in people. Not all movies have a happy ending but this one brings a smile to your face and hope for all humanity. It is a true story about an ex marine and his struggle to find a place in society as well as deal with shell shock form his many tour of duties. This film is a must see don't miss it and tell all your friends and family too.",False
7,3,gimmick,katedwyer-76309,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw this at the Port Townsend Film Festival.The film is mostly excellent but I thought the trickiness of setting the viewer up to think the central character was a mass killer when that did, in fact, not happen was gimmicky and not necessary to the story. As if the audience will only be interested in a shoot em up?The story could be compellingly told without the tricks.Otherwise the story is very uplifting and amazing.That's all I have to say but this review requires more characters. Port Townsend's festival is very fine in a beautiful seaside town. Our festival features many shorts and documentaries.",True
8,10,A triumph for humanity,avtarsur,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a heartwarming demonstration of how in the midst of darkness, love and humanity can prevail. An uplifting piece amidst the global suffering of COVID and war.Inner peace is not found in isolation, hatred of others or by renouncing the world, but can be attained as an active family member and member of one's community.The importance of sharing with others what life has given, and living life fully with an awareness of the divine within each of us will make this world a better place.This short films highlights all that is good with community and love of thy neighbour. An important reminder to us all. Highly recommend.",False
9,3,A retelling of something that didn't happen,mickeythechamp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Road to the Oscars 2023. This short documentary is nominated for 1 award and it´s short doc. This is just another primetime doc that really didn't land with me. It tries to fill out it´s runtime but ends up not saying much about the people involved, the interesting aspects or situations at all. It´s fine, but so fine it becomes so bland it leaves you with nothing.A former marine plotted to attack a mosque but changes his mind. We hear from the people involved what happened up until the potential attack.The doc is very boring. There is not a lot going on and it never really engaged me. My main problem is that I´m supposed to feel sympathy to a dude who was about to commit murder and sure he didn't do it, but I hope he seeks more help. The doc itself doesn't really know how to fill out it´s half hour runtime so it must tell you about random refuges and immigrants story, 9/11, military training, PTSD, conversion. The doc is highly unfocused and to me pandering to make something that didn't happen seem more important that it might actually be.The doc really wants me too feel, but it quickly shoots itself down by not having any excitement involved. Instead on focusing how a guy builds a bomb and plans a bombing, how prejudice work, how lives could have been lost, it instead just tells all of these things fast and on a surface level. The doc doesn't delve into anything.It´s tough to make a movie about nothing. While the event is beautiful and touching it is literally a doc about an event that didn't happen. It needs to make you really imagen ""but what if"" and I´m just too grounded in reality when it comes to documentaries to a point where I just think ""but it didn't"". We can all agree the events turned out the right way and a wholesome way, but without anything interesting to grasp to, the doc just bumbles around trying to make people make the event sound much bigger than it was.The unnecessary drama at the start didn't speak to me either. It screams cheap primetime doc and it´s too cliché to really work.Stranger at the gate (also why is it called that?) is one of those made for TV primetime docs you´ll forget existed a short while after you watched it. It´s a doc about something that didn't happen and has to resort to then drag out it´s runtime instead of just being the short story it was at maybe 10 minutes of runtime.Oscar predictions: I could easily see this winning best short documentary. It´s one of those safe docs with subject matter that speaks to Americans. It even sends some signaling about tranquility between different ethnicities. The subject matter is good and compared to other contenders it´s a safe bet. I see this as a high chance, but definitely fighting Haulout. Now it´s up to the academy if they are going the hate crime or climate change way.",False
10,10,Incredible...!!,mnaqashali-14757,n/a,15/08/2025,The story is really something I've ever seen. Everyone should watch this documentary. These type of stories are very few that elaborate how kindness and humanity change the lives. And the story shows the facts as facts. The documentary truly shows the dangerous effects of hate.It also shows how peace can change a personality and mindset. And how love can heal a person and give them courage and strength.I hope no one miss this as it's truly a heart touching story and it shows the real meanings of humanity and kindness.And thanks for sharing this story with the world...!!Thanks a lot...!!,False
11,10,I thank the authors of this film,arra-62558,n/a,15/08/2025,"Perhaps this is what is called ""metanoia"". Such a change in outlook, perception, a cardinal change of coordinates. And not everyone gets such an opportunity - to gain the experience of rebirth. Any war is always pain, trauma for life for all participants. And in order to overcome this pain, it is probably necessary to experience emotionally something secondary in terms of the strength of the experience. And in fact, what this man experienced - a soldier, a murderer on the threshold of the Muslim community - is a huge pain and relief. The girl, his daughter, is beautiful in her sincerity and spontaneity. Most likely, she is the main reason for the change in his worldview. And also -I admire the versatility of Conrad Fisher's talent! Incredible!...",False
12,10,A MUST-SEE !!,cindyxtyu,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Stranger at the Gate"" is a powerful and emotional true story that shines a light on the importance of love, kindness, and understanding in today's world. The film tells the story of a veteran who, driven by hate and post-war trauma, plans to attack a Muslim community, but instead finds peace and freedom through the unexpected kindness he encounters. This sincere and touching film reminds us of the humanity that we all share, regardless of race, color, religion, experience, or education. The film also sheds light on the mental health of veterans and the importance of a caring community, supportive workplace, and loving families and friends in their lives. A MUST-SEE, ""Stranger at the Gate"" drives home the message that hate kills while love heals, and is a testament to the transformative power of compassion and empathy.",False
13,9,The world needs more kindness,jpismyname,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is about Mac McKinney, a former Marine who struggled with PTSD after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. He developed hatred towards the Islam community. This film tells his journey from hatred towards understanding and compassion.Really a chilling short documentary. The people he intended to kill would save not just his life, but also his soul. I just thought maybe the film could've been a bit longer, I dunno. But overall I find it riveting.People, and I also mean the whole world, needs to see this. Love and kindness are the cure for all these hatred going on in this crazy world.",False
14,10,Love is still a winner,irfan-89473,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is a perfect example of what Rumi once said, ""Let the beauty that we love be what we do"". After watching this I learned that despite the epidemic of hatred and bigotry, love is still a winner. We just need to try it out. It is a cure to who knows how many ailments. Watched this movie three times and it still held my attention till the end. They lit up the candle of love and witnessed hatred disappear. Amazing journey of transformation. Movie also teaches that people of love must not leave those trapped in their ideology of hate alone. The sickest is in need of medicine the most. Love and compassion are the best remedies regardless of the color or creed.A MUST WATCH!!!",False
15,10,"Stranger at the gate, interesting!",drerumzahid,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stranger at the gate, interesting!When I first heard about it, I said to myself, ok, another movie based on war and hate related topic, must be a person kept in captivity or inspired by someone?I have no temptation to have any intellectual, audio, or visual interaction with the movie, as I have seen enough and it's not my cup of tea anymore.I was born and raised in Pakistan watching every evening, on national TV news about the Afghan war and collateral damage effects on my country, in my childhood. This was also a contributing factor for no motivation for these kinds of movies.I got introduce by the cast, director and the producer during the show in my institution, and it was an eye opener for me, it has nothing to do what I have mention above, it's about a person not in custody or influenced by companion ship, planning massive distraction, while doing ground work for his plan of action, got carried away just because one person welcome him nicely and the family ready to share their table with him! This is how strong human emotions can be!As it was said by our Prophet Muhammad PBUH -
""You're smiling in the face of your brother is charity"" book of Jami at- Trimidhi.I was amazed how a simple gesture of welcoming and family interaction on dining table can change the perception of people and can expose the good heart.I have no words to describe my feeling about the movie other than to say,
What a group of people with exceptional basic human qualities!What a person, who was able to open his inner soul eyes to see the beauty and overcome his anger!What a production team, able to see the real face of Islam and projecting it the way it is!And what a movie!!!",False
16,10,Incredible!!!,Samrah123,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is all about love and humanity. I've never seen a documentary so moving and touching! It sends a clear message that love conquers everything. A little kindness goes a long way and can change hearts in an instant! It doesn't matter what race, religion or culture you belong to. Humanity is our religion! Loved the story, direction and production. This documentary is now very close to my heart and no matter how many times I watch it, it still gives me goosebumps. Definitely an Oscar worthy movie.

The story in this film is incredible and heart-warming, it is a real testimony that being kind to each human being regardless of race, color, national origin, or religion, will lead to peace all around, contrary to hate and war!

By doing so, the smile of humanity could be brought to everyone.This film should be one of the best documentaries. A MUST-WATCH and rewatchable film for everyone!",False
18,10,From trauma and hate to love and healing,jmscott-32516,n/a,15/08/2025,"A man comes back from combat reeling from the violence he has committed, the depersonalization of the "" enemy"" that made this violence possible, and the seething hatred for those he was sent to kill. And he is hurting, unable to love, to be comfortable in his own skin. He has absorbed the horror he has seen and inflicted. This film is a sensitive portrayal of one man's journey to shed his burden, walk through the pain and open his heart. The journey is tough, emotionally complicated and unsentimental .The filmmakers present an unflinching portrayal of a tough guy, antisocial, loud and physically imposing yet he is human, he is not a cartoon or a symbol, but he is dangerous. The people who greet him are strong in their faith, strong in community, uncompromising in their love and rejection of hate. We see an honest portrayal of complicated , strong emotions; of power and vulnerability, of intense hate turned on its head forsaking the evil but leaving the strength of love. Believable, unsentimental, heart wrenching. It's a great film.",False

People will get a chance to see the world from a different angle and get a moment to think about what we should do!As per Brilliantio, a good documentary film shows people from a different perspective than they're used to seeing in the media.

It is important to step back and see into why you believe what you do about a person or situation. In this beautiful documentary the step back was actually getting closer to what he thought was ""the enemy"", without realizing compassion was going to be the winner. This is a wonderful example about humanity.This documentary will make you reflect about the fact that we all are human beings and we are more alike than we are different.

23,10,Must watch documentary,marshallgregory-82498,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a must watch documentary. Its about a formal career united States Marine Corps officer who want from hating a religion (Islam)to planning to blow up local masjid to becoming a devoted Muslim.His name was Richard ""Mac"" McKinney, and he was there not to worship but to destroy, CNN reported. He was a former US Marine who had developed a hatred toward Islam during combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. His fury deepened when he returned home to Muncie to see how Muslims had settled into what he called his city, and even sent their children to sit next to his daughter at her
elementary school.Unable to contain his anger, he went to the Islamic center that day in 2009 on what he saw as his final mission. He was going to plant a bomb at the mosque in hopes of killing or wounding hundreds of Muslims. He was on a scouting mission to pick a location to hide his bomb and to gather intelligence that would validate his assumption that Islam was a murderous ideology""I told people that Islam was a cancer; and I was the surgeon to cure it,"" he says.But when McKinney entered the mosque, he encountered a form of resistance that he had not planned for. Something happened that day that would change him in a way he never expected.The people whose lives he intended to take would end up saving his life.McKinney and the mosque's members built 'an impossible bridge' to one another
What happened to McKinney at the mosque is so dramatic that it sounds like something from a movie. And in fact, it is.McKinney's transformation is the subject of a riveting documentary short called ""Stranger at the Gate."" The film, which won a special jury prize at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival, recounts how McKinney abandoned his plot and ended up converting to Islam and embracing a surprising role at the mosque.",False

1,n/a,Right to excist,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Finn I am ashamed how little I know of Sámi people and how our government has treated them. I'd like to think things have turned better but it seems there still is a lot to do. This is an eye-opening documentary about difficulties Sámi people living in Finland still face. Like so many other minorities Sámi people are also peaceful, don't fight back with weapons, don't think people can own land, and have to fight for their excistence. It sounds very wrong that they have to pay rent for Finnish government of their own land. Finns don't quite understand what it means to have reindeer and how they live. I'm glad the railroad mentioned in the movie is not going to be built, at least not this time.",False

1,7,Good docu,eva-21304,n/a,15/08/2025,"I quite liked the documentary. It gave good insight into the Aztec history and building culture. Tenochtitlan is an architectural marvel and it's a shame it was destroyed, so the effort made to document the city and preserve its knowledge is admirable. Definitely something interesting to watch if you're into culture, architecture, history, ... Or just as an insightful watch!Only downside was David Welton and his 'experimental archeologist' commentary. I'm getting second hand embarrassment from him being the only 'white scientist' over there with the much more skillful and experienced locals. Especially his dumb leaps for conclusions and annoying work ethics (just looks around, mouth gaping, and when he tries one thing he breaks a tool or gets injured immediately).",False

1,10,They are truly living legends,petrokgyorgy,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like water polo, you have to see this movie. These Hungarian boys wrote history, and the film reveals a lot of behind-the-scenes secrets about them.In addition to the members of the team, the players and coaches of the famous opponents, all foreigners, among the biggest, will speak. It is touching that, without exception, they all speak with appreciation and respect about the dream team.The entire film is interwoven with camaraderie, love, respect, and
humor. It's a feeling that affects fans of other sports too. It helps if you understand the Hungarian language - but it is not a requirement.A great experience!",False

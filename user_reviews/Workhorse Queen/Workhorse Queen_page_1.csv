1,7,Drag queen comes to the Dryden Theatre in Rochester!,Red-125,n/a,16/08/2025,"Workhorse Queen (2021) was written and directed by Angela Washko. It stars Mrs. Kasha Davis, who is a noted Rochester drag queen. (The ""workhorse"" word stems from how many drag queen events Kasha stages and how many she attends.)Mrs. Davis is an iconic figure in the Rochester entertainment scene. The movie had many references to Rochester--Wegman's grocery, the restaurant Edibles, the JCC. Showing the movie in the iconic Dryden Theatre in the George Eastman Museum was a brilliant decision for ImageOut, the Rochester LGBT Film Festival. I enjoyed the movie, and I was particularly impressed by Mrs. Davis's presence for Q&A after the movie.This film will work better on a large screen, but will do well enough on the small screen. It's worth seeing if you have any interest in, or curiosity about, drag queens.",False
2,10,"Fantastic - honest, authentic, fun and empowering",Justin-81908,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mrs Kasha Davis shines through with her honest, caring, empathetic and sincere ways. It's full of the fun, disappointing, inspiring and dynamic roller coaster that is life - but shows the resilience and perseverance that makes MKD unique and real.
The sharing of family, friends and life is greatly presented by the filmmakers - the journey is exciting and the destination is not the end. More and better follows the perceived idea of getting there.
Well done!!!!",False
3,10,Inspirational and heartfelt - the queen behind the veil,jasonbuitrago,n/a,16/08/2025,"History shapes our present and informs our future - unless we have something to say about it! Mrs. Kasha Davis' story from beginnings to drag race stardom unveils a powerful truth on the deep layers of performativity we each carry along our lives. We all have a little Mrs. Kasha Davis in us - from celebrating the triumphs, to mourning the losses, to developing grit against life's challenges with grace and humility, Mrs. Kasha Davis showcases her growth, lessons learned, and magnificent passion (and talent) for making people smile. While there's always time for a cocktail, there's always time for more Mrs. Kasha Davis.",False
4,9,I'm a sucker for original pieces!,RoyMince,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary that dives into a sector of a community that is completely overlooked and often times recognized as pioneers in a movement. This film was definitely new, and in my opinion, considered groundbreaking based off of the angle that was taken following these young people who are very much so often overlooked . This is one of those films that get you from the start because the topic is so intriguing. The one thing I could tell you was this this documentary is definitely a first of its kind, something I've never seen, and they got my attention from the opening. This is a film that I would recommend to many people because there's importance behind understanding.",False

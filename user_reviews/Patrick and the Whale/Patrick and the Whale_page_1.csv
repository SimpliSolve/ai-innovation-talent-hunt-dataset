1,10,One of the best Endings ever,davematischek,n/a,16/08/2025,"In general this is a very well made documantary. A long time I was not sure in which direction the film want to go. In fact till the very last 15 minutes. But theese last minutes are so extremly well made: great message, better soundtrack and the best filmed scene i have ever seen ever (and this is a DOCUMENTARY!!!!!).I must say I am not a great fan of ""ServusTV"", which foundes Terra Mater Pictures, but i must say that this film studio is making very good documentations on a regular basis. Films from this studio have often more nominations than films from BBC or national gegraphic...If u want to have a happy evening and get some good feeling and also learn something then watch this movie!!",False
2,10,"Okay move, great message.",mfatzler,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie/documentary is very good. The footage is amazing. Patrick is a interesting protagonist. The story is very interesting. Patrick's quest is admirable. Dolores and Can opener are great whale friends. This film really let some insight into scuba diving. One thing that was very interesting was Patrick's bonds with the animals. Dolores was the first sperm whale that trusted him, but in the end grew separate from him. One extremely interesting thing was when he put a camera on the whales. That was really interesting to see a glimpse of their life.What really did it for me in this film was the ending. The ending was great, Alice Phoebe Lou's ""Nostalgia"" playing among a ton of shots of sperm whales.",True
3,10,What a beautiful documentary,mengels-98747,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love documentaries ... all kind of .. not only about or with animals or countries/islands or people / history ...
But this one really surprised me in a positive way.It is so beautifully filmed and the guy really treat those whales with so much respect ...
Her really made contact with those creatures and this is the story. How the relation evolved over the years with this spermwhale ""Dolores"" is just incredible. Please watch it complete, you will not be dissapointed ... The end is just amazing .... We need to respect those big creatures much more than we are doing at the moment ... Great watch and amazing message ! Please watch it !!!!",False
4,5,"Money ran out, had to 'just finish the docu'",hermanobart,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe movie is about what he learned about sperm whales. The answer? Nothing.Sure, it's really hard as someone with a relatively small budget to do research about sperm whales behavior. The images are very beautiful. But still it felt like a waste of time.Is it still a documentary if you 'document' about how you tried something and failed? I guess it is. Once again: I don't blame him for not being able to get more satisfying learnings, but in the end it is still a failed documentary.It reminds me of 'My Octopus Teacher', where it all clicks and he actually documents his friendship with the animal until it dies. They tried and recreate this with a whale, but it doesn't get very far. The whales even end up abandoning him in his failed quest to create a bond.",True

1,10,One Step Above Masterpiece!,MiroslavKyuranov,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's honestly absurd how good the ""Spider-Verse"" movies are. ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is just as great, if not better than ""Into the Spider-Verse"". I really don't know how. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is fantastic! Deftly juggles deeply heartfelt character beats with crazy multiverse content, just packed with so many delightful easter eggs. Loved how Gwen's story is expanded, her scenes with Shea Whigham's Captain Stacy are truly special.Can't wait for the third one. Every frame of this movie is gorgeous! I didn't want to blink because I didn't want to miss anything. You can watch this film over & over & finds something new to enjoy. There are some surprises in this film that I truly wasn't expecting.""Across the Spider-Verse"" is another milestone for animation. Yes it's gorgeous & visually mind-blowing, but this sequel surpasses the first for always putting Miles and his family front and center. The movie feels like a massive celebration for Spider-Man fans everywhere, whether you love the movies, games, comics, etc. But again, all the cameos and multiversal elements come second to both Miles and Gwen's story. Is a stunning achievement. Yes, it's visually dazzling, with expansive, expressive new realms The movie's real superpower is its emotional depth and its beautiful, melancholic tone.What more can I say...It's an actual work of art! Every frame deserves to be hung in a museum. The jokes and nods to Spidey lore are perfect. It's outstanding. ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is yet another resounding win for the Lord Miller-produced universe. Hailee Steinfeld really comes into her own as Gwen Stacy. It's darker and sadder than I expected, but necessary.",False
2,10,One of the best sequels to anything ever made,pugpool10,n/a,15/08/2025,"If it wasn't already obvious in the first film, it's now officially clear as day that the people behind the Spider-Verse franchise (including writers/producers Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who are absolute creative godsends to the once magnificent place known as Hollywood) understand EXACTLY what they're working with.Don't let the marketing fool you: this film has GUTS. It's easily one of the heaviest PG-rated films I've ever seen. Payoffs and character revelations that were only hinted at in the first film are carefully, deliberately unraveled and come around beautifully. It made me think about my own life and what I mean to the people I care about in ways I never expected. The fan-service is BATTY too, and yet somehow it's never too much.I wish every movie was as good as this---but then again if the world was like that this wouldn't feel as special. So I'll just stick to being IMMENSELY grateful that it exists in this universe.This is no ordinary sequel. It's art of the highest form.",False
3,10,Okay This Is Peak,hectorvernet,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off, you should know that this is the first part of one big movie split into two, Harry Potter style. Except, everyone in the theater went nuts when it ended, I guess because it doesn't have ""Part One"" in the title. It doesn't really stand on its own, as far as the story goes. So it's kind of hard to rate it, since it set up way more than it concluded. Can't wait to see the next one.Anyway, even as just one half of a two-parter, this movie is awesome. If you thought you liked the style of ""Into the Spider-Verse"", then you got another thing coming. This movie is so much more than that, it's crazy, and it does not disappoint. Boggles the mind how this much stuff can even be animated at all.The visuals have got to be seen to be believed. Every scene has so much going on, and you could even say each scene has its own art style. It goes way beyond what the first movie did, and that was already crazy. The blending of styles on its own makes this a one of a kind movie, that will be hard to replicate. I'm even sort of mad that this creative energy hadn't been released before, because we are getting some insane stuff nowadays.One small complaint I do have is that all this, combined with the very fast action can make it a bit hard to breathe sometimes. Honestly I can't take too many points off for that though.The soudtrack is great, I can't wait for it to release. There truly are some bangers in there, and most of them are actually the score of the movie, not licensed music.And the story is awesome as well, although again it's hard to judge before seeing the next one. There's a lot more going on than in the first one, and most This movie explores the character of Gwen more and it's awesome. It's still about Miles though, and that part is also cool. I loved the Spot.So yeah I could say more, but I think you should just go see it. This might end up as one of the best trilogies of all time.",True
4,10,A new Empire Strikes Back,rickothan,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is a visual concert. The animation and character design neatly put me to tears. The opening of the film took an approach that shocked me, but it was fantastic to watch. Many of the jokes were in the trailers, but plenty caught me off guard in the cinema. Miguel even had a couple of funny moments. The presence of existing spider characters, such as snippets of the other films, did feel somewhat strange I have to admit. However, it is made up for in how incredible this film was. It was artistic, mature, adult, and profound. It leaves the viewer on a cliffhanger that shocked me. I thought I was an hour into the film, but it was the end. I implore everyone wondering if they should see this film to do so. Easily the best film I have seen in a long time and the best film to see in theaters. A true masterpiece.",False
5,10,Masterful IMAX Spider-Man,UniqueParticle,n/a,15/08/2025,"The animation, flow of everything, genius character development, and action were all electrifying! This is one of the best Spider-Man adaptions deserving of the high ratings entirely. I love all the portals connecting to other dimensions and Spot is such a fun villain. Shemeik Moore, Hailee Steinfield, Jake Johnson, and Oscar Issac among everyone else was superb so much talent this movie better be nominated for best animated feature like the previous one was years back deserving of its win! For a movie that's fairly long it stayed entertaining from start to finish and keeps you wanting more, I loved it all so much.Also since this review is doing well I have autism and would love any opportunity to be more known in the world! My real name is Alex Nolan and I crave movies a lot since I was quite young. I wish I could work on movies and spend time with famous people.",False
6,10,the greatest spider-man film ever.,sfarrow8,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am absolutely lost for words. How the hell did they top the first one??? This is easily, without a shadow of a doubt, the film of the year. It perfectly balances humour and emotional beats on a razor thin blade. It's richly layered, complex and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. The story is phenomenal, the characters are believable and have excellent levels of depth, the soundtrack is fantastic. My expectations were completely exceeded, I spent the entire 2h 30m runtime in awe. But one thing above all deserves very special praise :THE ARTWORK.This films aesthetic is jaw-dropping, I found myself plunged (for the second time now) straight into the pages of a comic book from my youth. The use of colour is remarkable, the animation is smoother than silk, the textures, the backgrounds, the lighting, the style itself - everything blends together perfectly to create one of the most visually stunning things ever committed to the screen. Almost any shot could be a painting, with inextricable layers upon layers of marvellous detail, hand-crafted by some extremely talented individuals. This is cinema.If this doesn't win the Oscar for best animated feature I'm rioting, and you'd better join me. GO AND SEE THIS FILM RIGHT NOW.",False
7,10,This needs to be nominated for best picture!,Marian25,n/a,15/08/2025,"It just excels in every category! Peak cinema right there. I can't imagine the amount of work that went into this movie, every aspect of it just blew me away.Words cannot accurately describe this experience so I'm not even gonna try. I can't remember the last time I was so hooked for more than 2 hours in a cinema. So much emotion, beauty and cool-ness!It's time for everyone to appreciate animation as a veritable film genre and give it the recognition it deserves. Across the Spider-Verse perfectly shows that you just can't do in a live-action movie what you can do with animation. I 100% think that the richness of emotions this masterpiece conveys was greatly benefited by the animation and its mesmerizing style. Just see it and you'll agree!",False
8,6,So Overhyped That I Felt Disappointed,penelopemmorris,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was a huge fan of the first movie, excited for the sequel and pretty hopeful after I saw massive amount of RAVE reviews online claiming it to be better than the original. Well, that couldn't be further from the truth. The runtime was way too long and I FELT it from the beginning of the movie! (during Gwen's 20 minute opening.) By the time the film picked up its pace and stakes (the last 30 minutes) I was already mentally checking out, watching the time and waiting for it to end. And yes, basically nothing is resolved by the end of it, if you're wondering. Multiple people in my theater were groaning as the credits began rolling, due to the cliffhanger. Scenes stretched on far too long, had repetitive dialogue and just set up the final movie. I truly don't see the hype about this one. I think the wrap up next year will be good, I have seen films do a better job in a trilogy of making the second movie mean something. I feel harsh saying this, as the animation, soundtrack and characters are awesome! I just feel like people are acting like this is the best animated movie to be released, but it's just not. It doesn't live up to the greatness of it's predecessor. Hopefully the finale next year will make it all worth it!",False
9,10,"Wow, just WOW!",srdjankostic91,n/a,15/08/2025,"I rarely write reviews, but this movie is truly exceptional. It takes everything that was great about the first film and elevates it to a whole new level. I have honestly never witnessed such remarkable animation as in ""Across the Spider-Verse."" The visuals are breathtaking, featuring a wide array of styles. It is a true multiverse experience, with an abundance of captivating details in every frame, including numerous Easter eggs and a vibrant color palette. I found myself not wanting it to end, despite its substantial length. Knowing that the next part will be released in 2024 brings me immense joy because waiting a few more years to see how this story unfolds would be agonizing.The story is exceptionally well-crafted, expanding upon the existing characters while introducing new ones and incorporating intriguing twists. The humor throughout the film is spot-on, providing moments of levity without undermining the emotional depth of the narrative.Just go and see it!",False
10,7,"It's good, but I still like the first one better. (7.5)",nickryan99,n/a,15/08/2025,"Let me just say that the first hour of this film had me hooked and I just knew this film surpass it's predecessor in terms of the story & entertainment. Around the 2 hour mark I started wondering when or if there would be a climax? Various scenes felt like they were dragging on for way too long. We really didn't need all the scenes of Peter B. Parker and his child. For me personally I felt like there was no build up or anticipation due to how long certain scenes played out. Then the film ended on a cliffhanger and then I understood, this film is a middle movie, a gateway between the first film and the next film and unfortunately it showed. They didn't have a definitive ending for this film which is fine but at some point the scenes just felt like filler. I believe it is still a movie worth seeing, however, it falls short of the first movie in terms of keeping my attention.",False
11,10,Perfect,Tired_Reviewer,n/a,15/08/2025,"The 5 years was worth the wait. Amazing animation, beautiful characters with rich backstories, the fights are amazing, Gwen's story is amazing, EVERYTHING IS AMAZING! This entire movie is gorgeous and keeps you hooked and almost forces you to continue watching, that's how amazing it is. The hype around this movie was 100% deserved and made sense, seeing as how this movie may be the greatest film I have ever seen.This isn't your run of the mill kids move, action movie, animated movie. It's a masterpiece that all ages can enjoy. An amazing sequel that sets extremely high hopes for the third movie.",False
12,n/a,Disappointing,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved into the spiderverse, it had great animation, great characters, great plot development and great music. There is simply no way across the spiderverse is better. By the end of this it felt like they were dragging it out and I had lost interest quite some time previously. The animation is good but sometimes less is more, and there was less differentiation between the styles, I don't think bill sienkiewicz was involved in this one. I remember my emotions building in the first one, peaking when what's up danger kicked in in the soundtrack, but this got into some schlocky emotional teen drama territory that made me yawn. I also felt it was a bit cynical to split it in two, I'm sure the full story could have been told in one movie which would have upped the quality of the animation too. Then there was the sense of universal danger overload that this and other stories revert to to ramp up the drama; whether a universe or every parallel universe and it's uncle is at stake, who cares, trying to make it bigger than before doesn't increase drama, that comes from character and plot development, yeah, like it did in the first one. It needed more jokes too, nowhere near as funny as the last time.",False
13,10,My movie of 2023 so far.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's been some time since I've walked out from a cinema feeling as satisfied by a film as this!I enjoyed Into The Spider-verse, in my humble opinion, this went one better, my anticipation for the next installment has definitely gone up a few notches.The best element for me, the visuals, I'd argue this was a labour of love by the team behind it, it looks sublime, the action sequences are seamless, one to the next, jaw dropping.Pacing is terrific, visit the loo or go for a drink at your peril, you may just miss something.I think this is a film that fans of Spider Man, any fans, new or old will enjoy, its appeal is so broad.I'm not a die hard Spidey fan, so some of it went over my head, but I am reliably informed by my fellow cinema goers that there were plenty of Easter eggs to hunt, lots of references to all forms of Spider Man.Shameik Moore did a first rate job, as did Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen, her character development was a key element.I assume this will win many awards, it deserves to, that good I'm going again!!!Nailed it!! 10/10.",False
14,9,"Across the Universe Of Fun, Excellence, and Adventure: Spider-Man Makes A Connected Web Of Wow",rgkarim,n/a,15/08/2025,"LIKES:The Pace For The Most Part
-Comic book movies are an art that requires balance to tell all it has to tell, and Miles' next story.. has A LOT to tell.-It found a good pace for me to tell the story, giving you the character development, but not at a pace that was too slow and lost on itself, for the most part.-Yet, the movie did manage to keep it slow enough that there was real development, build up, hints, and appreciation to age like fine wine.-This dynamic was very impressive to me, keeping an engaging movie for my attention, but not skimping out on the action like some of these deeper movies try to do.-That takes talent in the cooking pot as big as this, building on the past movie, but yet doing its own thing until the end for the setup.The Voice Acting
-Everyone rocks in this movie, and I have to agree with my friend that it is grade A on many levels with what you get in live action movies.-Isaac is still strong as the anti-hero role that he often plays. His moodiness, his anger, his dark edge are mirrored in the character. There is hurt, anguish, and the fire that he shows so well, and I love how his voice is the main focus in his performance and not the looks.-Hailee Steinfeld is fantastic in Gwen. It's like taking all of her characters from her movie and integrating a piece of them into this Gwen and expanding her far into a character I really liked.-She was vulnerable and strong, a realistic character whose performance came out in spades and fully awakened the character I think they were going for.-And Moore... well Moore is just freaking amazing as Morales. That tone, vulnerability, this maturity but still immaturity cascading and once more evolving a character from the first one being believable. A stellar performance and one that I think brought so many things together, engaging with each of the others into this dynamic role.-It all works so well and I loved the strong talent bringing things to life.The Storytelling
-There are so many who say that comic movies seldom tell a good story or are telling the same story over and over again. And to a degree... they are right.-Yet... for Across the Spider-Verse, that story feels fresh, engaging, and grounded to a degree that helps balance reality and super heroism into a great mashup.-It's not so in your face super adventures that are all about action, violence, and CGI madness, but it also isn't CW bologna about exploring our feelings in colorful underwear.-This sequel really focuses so much on building up characters, but integrating it into this main comic adventure that works to keep both involved and feel like a superhero.-I love the heart into it, and the way they built up from the first movie, but yet made this movie its own thing, until the final moments where the known cliffhanger was going to come in.-And to add relative components to it, engaging characters, and keeping those characters involved in the story... that is tough work.The Comedy To A degree
-I really enjoyed the diverse comedy in this movie, and how many types of jokes and styles that were in it.-Miles is sort of a jack of all trades, sarcasm, banter, slapstick, he has a little bit of everything in it and I love it.-Others are just rambling idiots who are throwing so many jokes and statements that some eventually hit, but you have to listen because they fluctuate in terms of volume and such.-And other jokes are so well-timed and loaded with sarcasm that you just appreciate the laugh from the time alone.-It has it all and in relative balance to keep things fresh and not overwhelmingly stale as they hope from one joke to the other.The Nostalgia and Easter Eggs
-Part of that comedy comes in the references loaded into this movie almost as much as the plot in this movie, and it works.-Across the Spider-Verse, tackles many famous tropes in both Spiderman comics and movies, blending the two of them together into this natural flowing arc that utilizes it well.-Nostalgia reigns supreme in this movie, all the comic and show references of the webbed wonder just taking my child nature and taking it for the roller coaster ride of finding everything I could.-But the movie references as well... so much fun as well, seeing these micro moments and nods to the other universes and watching them blended into the comedy and story.-Then to have it just in the world, it's going to make for a fun rewatch potential in the future.The Action Scenes
-A huge step up, Across the Spider-Verse took my dislike from the first film and unleashed much more of the action I knew it had.-The opening scene paints for some great things to come, but soon the fight scenes and adventure transform into something that is fun, exciting, and family friendly.-Chase scenes have energy, with styles that flow and show off the heart of the animation, feels of the comic book and fan art coming together into this cascade of color and energy.-I loved the way that they evolved past punches and added more emotions and stakes that though predictable still held glimmer of exciting twists if they come.-And the fact they can punch, kick, and slam without being bloody messes should please so many, alongside the fact that the action all goes in line with the actual plot.The Animation/Art Style
-You've seen the trailers and the first one and know how beautiful the movie is. Amidst the blurry backgrounds, the movie really has bold art direction that captures comic book spirit.-The computer animation goes well with the natural feel of the art, and I loved the way it felt like flipping through a flip book and seeing it come to life.-It respects both worlds so well, and like the story keeps things easy to follow and discover to appreciate everything the Spider-Verse had to offer. That was epic.-And to keep all that in relatively stable camera work, something the first movie struggled with, shows how you can really continue to improve if you take the time and think things through.DISLIKES:The Comedy A Bit Too Forced
-There are times where the humor is a bit forced for me, primarily in the moments where they just spout joke after joke after joke to the point where things get lost.-These moments are few and far between for me, but there are times where a character gets annoying over funny.Some Pacing Offsets
-There are times where the movie trips up on the pace for me. A few moments where the conversations are dragged out or we get a tad touchy feeling and not enough of seeing what's going on.-This happened about the first hour or so for me, but once that part passes most of the movie establishes the pace I talked about for much of the movie.-At least until the need.The Ending 20 minutes for me
-The ending 20 minutes felt very dragged out as it set up the cliffhanger we knew was coming the moment it said part 1 long ago.-The ending is very drawn out, you know the movie is over, and you know what is coming, but it uses the art to drag it out, bloating the movie for the twenty minutes that could have been in the next movie.-Fortunately one of the final moments adds that fantastic bridge with music, shots, and feels that work, but still... we could have cut a few things out.-And fortunately there are no end credits, which there does not need to be.The Sound Quality With Some Characters
-It might have been my theater, but some of the characters mumble and talk fast meaning... it's hard to hear them.-Spider-Punk has some of the best lines, but they get drowned out by background noise, mumbling speakers, and sound inconsistencies.-This leads to missing several things and taking away from the character that seems so cool, and this happens to several other characters when there is so much noise. As such, those moments are annoying to me, but again could be theater dependents.The VERDICT:
Overall, the praise is worthy to Across the Spider-Verse, and I was very happy with much of the film that they brought to life to this theater. It's a sequel that does things right, taking the first movie's foundations and bringing with it something to build up and enjoy to the full extent. That bold and beautiful art has been refined to near perfection, and does so much storytelling alone that it's almost enough to go see it just for that in theater. But the movie integrates story, morals, comedy, nostalgia, and action to a degree that really feels like some of the strongest storytelling in a superhero movie. I love the authentic feel of a superhero story, and I love the passion of balancing so much in a movie without every losing track of the story to tell. Sure there were pacing issues and some sound flops for me, but that's really minor when it comes to the movie overall and everything they did to make this movie the middle of the trilogy, but still stand on its own. You can obviously guess I'm recommending this for the theater, and yes families can see it as there aren't too much dark moments. And my scores for those who need it are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5.",False
15,8,Spider-man: Middle of the Spider-Verse,matris1,n/a,15/08/2025,"The good: This is a gorgeous and competently made film. With every scene / direction / frame constructed meticulously and it shows. It pushes the boundaries of animated movies and does it with style. The voice acting is good. The movie respects and pays homage to spider-man lore whilst offering something fresh (hard to pull off). Almost all the side characters feel real and fleshed out - even those with minimal screen time.The bad: It's most definitely a middle chapter and the film suffers for it. The movie is long, the pacing suffers, and scenes feel drawn out - which makes sense when you understand it's not trying to reach the end. The movie 'finishes' literally in the middle of a plot beat - when it didn't need to. Empire Strikes Back has shown us how it's done. It feels like pure marketing/money making tactics. A shame.Should you watch it: If you like Into the Spider-Verse - most definitely. The film pays homage to spider-man (both on and off screen) while offering something new. It's also just a brilliantly made animated film. Highly recommended.",False
16,6,Are people crazy?,armagh-97917,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe first movie was great; original, funny, interesting, diverse. This movie is like you when say you like a song, so they play the same song twice as loud hoping you love it twice as much. It more disjointed, the emotions get lost, and really, the ending? In 2 hours and 16 minutes you can bring this movie to at least a temporary conclusion? The villain does not have a good enough back story to carry one, much less two movies. That said some of the spiderverses we see were very creative (especially India-Manhattan mix), and the lead character is as always very likeable. It's like they really didn't much else to say, and then they take too long to say what they did.",True
17,10,Completely exceeded my expectations,heyrandom,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was worried that Across the Spiderverse would not be able to match the success of it's predecessor Into the Spiderverse, but boy was I wrong. Across the Spiderverse blows it's predecessor out of the water. With higher stakes, more emotion and improvements on the already brilliant animation. My only annoyance with the film was that the British and Indian spiderman were very hard to understand, but once it hits streaming services that can be fixed with subtitles. The movie sadly does end on a cliffhanger as it is being released in two parts with the second part coming out in March 2024. I think Across the spiderverse has a real shot at the Oscar for best animated pictures, which Into the Spiderverse won in 2019.",False
18,6,Over Hyped,jimmystz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Its not bad, it just doesn't fill the shoes.The movie is caught up in doing a bad impression of the original but misses the small details and cleverness that made the original a hit.So much of the plot and dialog is flat. The surprises didn't surprise me. I barely noticed them. The jokes where uninspired. I think I laughed once. The stakes where much higher but the tension felt much lower.Its worse in the technical aspects as well. Sound design, Pacing, Art Direction, Character Depth and Development all worse. Technically Across the Spider-Verse has a deeper world but not much of it was not memorable. I felt like the movie took a long time to say and show very little where the original did the complete opposite.When the squeal was announced and I heard they had different directors I raised an eyebrow. I lightly considered that team to be miracle workers. Unfortunately the concerns seem proven. The current Directing team says they're done after the second act of Across the Spider-Verse.I know a colossal amount of time, energy and love went into this movie and I'm scorching it. Squeals are notoriously hard to balance. They are often caught between what the original was and what so many people imagine that it should have/ could have been. Squeals sometimes they get tangled trying to be an unnecessary correction.Despite all these criticisms its still a good movie. There was a lot to appreciate. It was fun and characters will make you feel something. The best parts of the movie where all around the Parents of the many Spider-Verses. They tried to make the importance of family the core but that is difficult in an action movie were the hero's are living split secrete lives. Holding out hope for the next one.",False
19,5,"I felt like I was going to have a Seizure, while pushing through Lazy Writing.",cstull91,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film made me so upset because there was no epilepsy or flashing lights warning, horrid sound mixing, and overall so flashy it just wasn't fun. I got so overstimulated by the constant flashing lights that I could not enjoy the film. I was having to watch through my fingers. I don't understand why they decided to make 80% of the film a jolting van gogh kaleidoscope, that feels like you're watching it all in VR. It felt as if the Visual Team wanted the entire film to mirror the feeling you get as you're going through the wormhole sequence in Doctor Strange, but for 2.5hrs. Kinda feels Ableist to be honest. I could not enjoy the film, it was torturous. I am deeply saddened by just how flashy the film was. Also, what was the message of the film? Parenting is hard and it's ok to be selfish to get what you desire, regardless of consequences? I'm really confused by the high scores. I consider myself to be a cinephile, with having seen thousands of films and enjoying most all films, sometimes even bad ones. I am saddened to say that I am deeply in disagreement with the 9.1 current rating and 90% rotten, it makes no sense to me at all. This film was so over produced that it made my head physically hurt. Sony, maybe try and be less ableist when you're thinking about creating 2hrs of strobe light animation; it didn't need the consistent glitching, pulsating, and flashing mechanic to the multi-layered animation styles.It honestly felt expensive, but overall just lazy.Really disappointed.",False
20,10,The multiverse has opened the doors to the Spiderverse,gabethedinosaur,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerIt was absolutely awesome. I felt like I was traveling from the multiverse to my childhood back in 2002 when I saw Tobey maguire Spider-Man 21 years ago when I was 7 years old. And seeing all the other spider people including Spider-cat and Spider-rex . The spot traveling to venoms universe was absolutely hilarious. I hope to see ultimate Spider-Man from the video game I never finished on GameCube or Xbox for almost 17 years since I was a kid. Seeing 2018 Spider-Man from the PS4 game was very outstanding. I hope in Spider-Man beyond the spiderverse meets Tobey maguire and miles teams up with him and he helps him build the device and Gwen meets Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and they help build the same device to bring miles home .,True
21,8,Half of a movie,FeastMode,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the first of a two part movie. These studios should be legally required to put ""part 1"" in the title. Fast X did the same thing and I felt unsatisfied when the movie abruptly ends with everything completely unresolved.Now Across the Spider-Verse is endlessly better, but I still had that unsatisfied feeling when I realized I was watching the first half of a really long movie. So much is set up in the first act, including a cool villain, and is left completely unresolved.Think about your favorite movies. Now imagine that when you saw them for the first time, someone cut it off halfway through and made you wait a year for the rest. A movie needs to be able to stand on its own.Aside from that, I pretty much love this movie. I don't think it's as good as the original, but that's a high bar. The animation is incredible, especially during a long intro scene in a different universe. There are so many different styles and techniques. The characters are awesome, as are the ideas in this story.My only real issue is that the story felt a little messy and all over the place. But that made way more sense when I realized it was half of a movie. That's why we're still getting setup and introducing conflicts late in the movie. We'll have to wait and see how the second part pulls it all together. I also found the sound a little low during the action scenes and sometimes had trouble hearing the dialogue, even in Dolby Atmos.I already can't wait to see the next one. And if it does everything right, I can see myself raising the score for this one. I had a great time with Across the Spider-Verse. I also feel a bit unsatisfied.EDIT: On second viewing, I feel the same. It's awesome, but it's not complete.

22,10,Discover the Spiderverse in the biggest way and most wonderful way possible!,Ratingzzz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is whiteout a doubt peak Spider-Man and even peak cinema!Every scene in this animation movie was as good as perfect! The coloring, animation, character designs, music and the way they used the Spider humor was so funny and well timed!Bonding with character hasn't been as easy as it is here, they really explore the backgrounds of the different characters so emotional and passionately at the same time.It's a necessary darker & more emotional storyline for the characters but that's just how Peter Parkers storyline is...
It's a 2h20 movie but there wasn't one scene that I would've left out, I would've even preferred for it to go at almost 3h cause I wasn't a huge fan of the ending! You'll know when seeing it!There are so many Easter eggs & Spider-man's it to crazy for words!What more can i say than this is a masterpiece and probably the best Spider-Man movie to date!",False
23,9,Why Across the Spider-Verse Stuck the Landing,rgpaeplrp,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is a straight-up masterpiece. I'm not even gonna pretend to be cool about it - Across the Spider-Verse blew my damn mind. It takes everything the first film did (which was already leagues above most superhero stuff) and just cranks it up to eleven. Miles Morales is back, older, smarter, but still fumbling through what it means to be his version of Spider-Man. And this time, he's not just hopping through dimensions - he's crashing through them, getting tangled up in a whole society of Spider-People who think they know how the story's supposed to go. And the animation? Holy hell. It's like each frame was hand-painted by a different art god. Every universe has its own style - there's one that looks like a sketchbook mid-meltdown, another like it was watercolor-dreamed into existence. It's overwhelming in the best way, like walking through a museum during an earthquake. But here's the kicker- it's not just eye candy. The emotional core is solid. Gwen's arc hit me harder than I expected, and Miles? That kid's going through it. There's this tension running underneath the whole thing - about identity, about fate, about not letting other people tell you what you can't be - and it's so well done it hurts a little. In a good way. Now, fair warning: it ends on a cliffhanger. And not a gentle one. I mean hang-your-mouth-open kind of cliffhanger. But? I didn't mind. It felt like the second movement in a symphony - the part where everything swells and breaks and leaves you breathless waiting for the final note. Bottom line? It's a visual knockout, sharp, and storytelling-wise, one of the best Spider-Man films ever made. I'm giving it a solid 9.5/10. The only downside is we have to wait for the next one.",False

25,9,Amazing Sequel That Pushes the Limits of Animation,petraktheman,n/a,15/08/2025,"An amazing sequel that carries on that lightning-in-a-bottle creative energy of the original with a visually breathtaking experience that pushes the envelope of animated spectacle with all of its lightning paced hyper stylized colorful expertly choreographed visual sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat for the entire runtime. The story pushes the idea of a multiverse of spidermen/spiderwomen and goes all out with the concept and the dark side it can hold on the demands of ""Spiderman canon"". My only issue is that I think both Miles and Gwen's parents go a little too far at times, but to be fair that is still a part of their storyline. Otherwise, this is still an amazing sequel that makes me hyped beyond hell to see where this all goes in the 3rd film of this spectacular trilogy next year.",False

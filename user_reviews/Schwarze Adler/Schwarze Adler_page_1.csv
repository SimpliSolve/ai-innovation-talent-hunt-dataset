1,10,Not there yet,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Globally speaking many are aware of racism in America. But it is not an American problem! The fact there were so many BLM demonstrations around the world speaks volumes. Like that movement this concentrates on football/soccer players who's skin color is darker than white - way darker in many cases. Many of those players are male, but we also have voices from females. And because they are in this, we also slightly touch the sexism subject occasionally ... which is not less cringe worthy than many of the other things that darker players ... individuals/humans have to endure.My rating alone is evidence of what I think of this. It really got to men, I was not expecting this to be so touching and so well told and edited. There are certain things that some will never experience - and it's good for them but bad for those who have to go through life getting insulted and belittled on every other corner. And when that is being continued during interviews too ... there is a lot of striking and devestating footage from shows atheletes were on ... you kind of can be lost for words.Being also a kid of immigrants in Germany, I can sympathize with a lot. Since I am not dark skinned, I never experienced anything like this though. It is especially striking when one player is telling how he came from Africa and never knew racism until he met and saw it here in Germany. This really feels like a kick in the stomache or groin or anywhere it hurts.Seeing how just a few decades ago things were reported on ... and there are still so many instances of racism sprinkled throughout the german tv/media outlets ... which is also evident in the fan base, though the primitive way the racists express themselves ... there is so much to unpack in this documentary and I could write so much more, but believe me, when I tell you that this will touch your heart (if you have one) ... no matter your stance on soccer/football. Because this is about humans! And while that may sound too optmistic, I will hold on to the believe that one day I will be able to see way more love and less hate and racism ... until then it is imperative that people watch this and educate themselves!",False

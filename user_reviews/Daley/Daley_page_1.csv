1,8,"A warm and charming, yet also frank and unflinching documentary about a one-of-a-kind and iconic British Olympian",martin-backlund,n/a,17/08/2025,"This thorough and unflinching documentary takes us through Daley's life and career, ups and downs, both as an Olympian and a person. Daley's frank and honest participation gives this thorough and well-structured documentary both heart and warmth, and Daley's willingness to reflect candidly about both his success and his missteps makes this a rewarding and insightful watch. Daley's infectious smile and the borderline naive matter-of-factness with which he talks about himself helps us understand the obvious love and affection shown by the athletes who knew him throughout his career, many (all) of whom seem to still have much fondness for him. Yet Daley, and the documentary itself, is not afraid to also examine some of his less positive moments, and how his occasionally crass humour and his singleminded drive and discipline hurt and alienated others around him. Daley reflects on this without defensiveness and we feel towards the end as though perhaps, just maybe, he is learning a bigger lesson as he looks back on his life and career. At least we hope so, because by the end of it it's hard not to love him for who he is. Well worth a watch.",False
2,7,Daley,Prismark10,n/a,17/08/2025,"Daley Thompson was the complete athlete back in the 1980s. Winner of the Olympic gold medal in both the 1980 and 1984 Olympics.He was popularly known as Black superman in Britain. His videogame Daley Thompson's decathlon was ann all time best seller of 1985 as well as damaging many a keyboard.In his day Daley used to joke how he had the wrong physique for a decathlete. He was too muscular.The documentary recalls Daley's troubled childhood. His father left home when he was younger and was then later killed.The young Daley took on athletics at a time when it was a truly amateur sport. He was chuffed to get early sponsorship from Adidas whio gave him a free pair of trainers.He made the British Olympic team for the Montreal games in 1976. Gold medal winner Caitlyn Jenner then Bruce Jenner recalls how the young Daley pestered him for advice and assistance. He told Daley go away kid, I'm busy for the next two days. Come back afterwards.Caitlyn then predicted soon after that Daley Thompson would be the next Olympic Champion for the Decathlon.With success also came controversy. Swimmer Sharron Davies remarked that Daley was a bit mad. In the 1984 Olympics Daley successfully defended his title, then whistled through the national anthem. Made some suggestive comments about Princess Anne. Then heavily implied that Carl Lewis might be gay.The LA Olympics were very much geared towards Lewis when it came to track and field as he won multiple gold medals.Daley could also be supportive of his friends. When Sebastian Coe came second in the 800 meters to Steve Ovett in the 1980 Olympics. He pulled Seb out of the doldrums and told him to get out an win the gold in the 1500 metres.Hus mischievous side is in evidence yet again in the 1984 Olympics. Boycotts meant there would be few defending gold medallists in the 1984 Olympics. Daley was hoping that Seb would not win the 1500 meters again.The 1984 was the zenith of Daley's performance in the decathlon and his rivalry with the legendary JÃ¼rgen Hingsen.After that injuries took his toll. Daley failed to defend his World title and was just outside the medals in the Seoul Olympics where he took part with injuries.Since retirement in 1992, Daley dabbles in football and racing. The documentary has Daley accompanying his son Elliott Thompson who is following in his father's footsteps as a decathlete.This is a good reminder of how great Daley was back in the 1980s and how many others he inspired.",False
3,10,Loved it - ONE TO WATCH,ejswinter,n/a,17/08/2025,"Can't remember where I was recommended to watch this, maybe a suggestion by BBC iPlayer ? Fantastic documentary about an incredible man! Absolutely one to watch. The story told by him, his friends and sporting piers is truly heartwarming, and of course at points sad. Clearly a very inspirational chap, it is worth taking note of his passion to win and succeed. The documentary also showcases snippets and insight now and in the past of not only the decathlon but sports on the whole. Wishing his son the very best of luck in all his sporting endeavours, you have a great role model to egg you on. Good stuff.",False

7,6,A riveting documentary.,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,17/08/2025,"Daley Thompson was a superstar. A genuine icon. If like me, you up in 80s Britain, Thompson was the athletics hero. Yes there were football players that we'd pretend to be whilst playing, but if you were running, jumping, throwing, you wanted to be Daley. Thompson you see was a Decathlon champion. This is an all star account with contributions from Seb Coe, Linford Christie, Caitlyn Jenner, Sharron Davies, Colin Jackson, Tessa Sanderson, Steve Cram and many more. One thing the athletics community does brilliantly, is rally around to support and celebrate its own. It's a story with a sad start, a difficult childhood, bad things happening focusing a child on looking forward, being positive. We're not all like this of course, but this is a clear cornerstone of Thompson's life... drive. That drive opened doors, well that along with being grease lightning on the running track. The 70s were a different era for track and field. Little structure, zero finance. You're doing it on your own, for the love of it. Daley: Olympic Superstar is built around a mix of old archive and the present day, with Daley now there for his son also competing. It makes for a really well rounded picture of the man. Winning sprint races, his trainer, Bob says ""Do you know what a Decathlon is?"". If ever there's a faithful moment, this is it. He's 16, never even tried 7 of the 10 disciplines, gets entered for a last minute event and as he sits there now in a sweatshirt and a grey beard telling the story, with a smile on his face he says ""Guess who wins"". On his way, he's soon bending Bruce Jenner's ear at the 76' Olympic Games in Montreal. Then hitting his stride in Moscow in 1980. The archive footage is lovely and not just the televised stuff, there's lots of shots running round freezing looking streets and training in barren looking gyms, all with that focused stare of a man selfishly obsessed with being the very best. It's a cracking story of a bloke striving and being rewarded for the monumental effort. Gold Medals, sponsorships, those iconic Lucozade TV ads that got me addicted to the stuff and the computer game that I spent hours plugged into my Commodore64. He was everywhere! Sadly another thing that was everywhere in the 80s was the NF and rampant racism. Having Daley then as an icon holding Olympic, European and Commonwealth Titles simultaneously was an even bigger deal that he was black, even though he states it's his actions that define him rather than his colour. Some of those actions though are questionable. It's not all happy happy joy joy, with fame and success comes press intrusion... and competition is never far away. That competition comes in 84 at the LA Olympics. I'm not going to say anymore, but it's brilliant and wonderfully put together. He was an incredible athlete, but not without a prickly side and that courts controversy. Another layer that makes this all the more riveting to watch.",False

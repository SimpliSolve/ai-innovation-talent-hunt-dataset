1,8,Interesting,donnydeckbigbox,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to say, that I found this documentary to be interesting, as it taught me so much about Jesus Christ, that I simply did not know and although I am not religious myself, it was presented in a way, that made it really engaging and insightful.This documentary film is very well put together and as such even though it is quite long, the time seems to fly by, as it runs at a good and steady pace.This is interesting.Offcourse there are some things about the story of Jesus Christ, that are missing from this, but if you were to cover his entire life story, you would probably end up with a 6 hour documentary.",False
2,7,Not Bad At All,michellegoodyear-81498,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary, though not being the best documentary, I have ever watched, is not bad at all, though I felt it was a little long, running at nearly two hours.Despite my critic on the length of it, I have to say, I found it very entertaining, it's just that I feel, it could have been a little shorter.This documentary film is very well edited, with very appropriate music, that helps transport you back to Jerusalem two thousand years ago, which really get you in the time and place and keeps you interested.There are some very good guest appearances on this also, who give different angles on Jesus's life.",True
3,8,Definitely Worth A Watch,eddyeagle-17188,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is definitely worth a watch, because it is packed with information, on the life of the Lord Jesus Christ Of Nazareth.From beginning to end, this documentary delivers, in a very informative way, with great interviewees, that help present the story of Jesus Christ and add information, that I believe many people, will not know.On the editing side of things, I can say for sure, that this is a very professionally done piece of work, that delivers a viewing experience, that makes this documentary film, fly over in terms of time.I would for sure recommend this, to anyone who loves Jesus.",False
4,9,Epic Documentary On Jesus Christ,ronnieclaylovetennis,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a strong follower of Jesus Christ, I am always very picky on what I watch about him, as some documentaries and indeed movies, can annoy me, when they take dramatic licence and this angers me very much, but I have to say that this one despite, providing a lot of new information, stays true to the word of the Lord.This documentary has very qualified and interesting participants, who each in their own way add something unique to the watching experience.This is a must watch for anyone, who loves Jesus and what he stood for, because it gives so much, in the way that it gives fresh information and discussion on Jesus.",False
5,8,Rather Good,wendylaw-64932,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is very detailed and provides some very fresh insight, into the life of Jesus Christ.The interviewees are very interesting, as they all seem to come at it from different angles and this helps to flush the documentary out, in its quest, to provide a comprehensive account, of the man's life and what he stood for.This documentary is rather long, but it does not feel like it, as it is well edited and flows very well, with very appropriate middle eastern music, that helps to put you in the place of Christ, in terms of location, but also historical time.Well worth a watch, if you are interested in Jesus.",False
6,1,Simply and factually not a documentary,elizabethcarolburton,n/a,16/08/2025,"If I were to write a movie about the life of Kris Kringle, it would be fantasy, not documentary.A film about the Easter Bunny would not be labeled as a documentary.Conjecture would be a good word for someone who's very existence is still unproven.Faith, not fact, does not make a documentary, it makes a cult.",False

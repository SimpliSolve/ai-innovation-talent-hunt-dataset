1,6,Falls short.....,themidnitekrawlr-29918,n/a,16/08/2025,The interviews with two of the native actors & revisiting past filming locations was gold but Waddell drops the ball the second half of the doc with his off tangent theories.,False
2,6,Decent effort.,iamkrause,n/a,16/08/2025,"It starts off with some fake drama on the film maker's part, which turns out to be a big nothing burger, so that annoyed me.I really liked the part where he interviewed the native actors. They said they enjoyed being in the movie and didn't feel exploited. They also said they ate all the animals killed in the movie, and back in '79 it wasn't that big of a deal. So please, everyone complaining about that stuff, just shut up.The end got kind of lame because the film maker had a white liberal guilt moment over a native performance he saw, which was lame and annoying. It came across as weak sniveling virtue signaling, as if we don't get enough of that already.The film presents some theories about the production of Cannibal Holocaust, which the film maker himself says he can't prove, so it was kind of pointless but still interesting.But in general it was fun hearing from some of the old cast and seeing the beautiful locations again. It just would have been nice if the film maker could have kept his lame politics out of the film.",False
3,2,Awkward,Leofwine_draca,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the cringiest documentaries I've ever seen. Lots of clips from the original film and you get a chance to see the filming locations as they are now (unsurprisingly, they haven't changed much) but that's about it. Waddell awkwardly interviews a couple of minor players and pads it out with a lot of discussion of modern politics which doesn't have much to do with anything.",False

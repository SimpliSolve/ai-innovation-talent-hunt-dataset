1,9,Brilliant!,tucka1985,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely loved this! The Elton John appearance was brilliant and brought it goosebumps. A must watch for even passive dua lipa fans. Some nice insights to her family and early signing years. Brilliant and recommended! Some emotional moments, stunningly beautiful and the live orchestra is phenomenal. Songs you'll instantly recognise with a different twist with the accompanying orchestra. I've seen many of her shows (non-live just on tv) and I'd quite easily say this is the best one. Classy. All about the music and her passion and love for singing comes across in the interviews and performances.",False
2,7,An Evening with Dua Lipa,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't confess to being a big fan of Dua Lipa, but this was on, so...I have to say that I thought this was excellent. First of all, well done ITV (and having seen their ratings over Christmas, I think they need a bit of a boost, however small) for having three concerts on over the festive period (McFly and Girls Aloud being the others) - it makes a pleasant change from their normal round of doom and gloom via the soaps.This was a classy performance, full of power and emotion. Dua Lipa played the crowd very well, and the songs I imagine had been adapted carefully to suit the big orchestra.It wasn't a cheesy 'Audience With' like we've seen before, with the camera constantly being primed on celebs in the audience dancing, or clearly staged questions being asked- this was a true performance.Can we have more like this please, ITV?",False
3,9,"Casual Fan Here, Go Watch!",jakeB65801,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of those unique opportunities to see behind the scenes footage, hear about a singer's journey to fame and fortune, and experience an amazing, orchestral rendition of modern global pop music. Even as a casual fan of Dua Lipa, her powerful and emotional vocals are coupled with the purpose of reconnecting with the foundations and essential elements of musical creation. These attributes elevate this performance to represent a broader desire by younger generations to seek connection in the arts that have created this new group of true musicians. A truly moving performance by an authentic, beautiful person with the best of intentions in a world full of negative, divisive energy.",False
4,10,Perfection!,esther4,n/a,15/08/2025,"'An Evening with Dua Lipa' was absolutely magical! As a huge fan, I was blown away by her performance at the Royal Albert Hall. The way she collaborated with the 53-piece Heritage Orchestra and the choir was just breathtaking. Her hits, reimagined with such powerful arrangements, gave me chills.The intimate interviews were a lovely touch, and that duet with Elton John? Pure perfection! It was nostalgic and electrifying all at once. What made the evening even more special was seeing how much the audience enjoyed the show. Their energy and excitement were contagious, adding to the overall amazing atmosphere.Overall, the evening was a perfect blend of music, emotion, and storytelling. Dua Lipa's charisma and artistry shone through. If you like her music, you absolutely need to watch this!",False
5,10,MUST SEE TV!,lyndag-86133,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely amazing. A Masterpiece to watch over and over again. With each viewing/listening, I discover more and more of the hedonistic orchestral arrangements.And let's not forget the interludes with Dua reliving and narrating key events in her life. I could listen to her sultry voice and accent all day long.She's credited as the Executive producer and producer with a slew of others including her father and their company Radical22.It's too bad that cbs had to pit it against Sunday Night Football. She actually rated best of the rest aside from football.STREAM IT!Guarantied satisfaction :-)))",False

1,8,"The Art of Forgiveness, Friendship & Empathy",LisaLR1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This weekend, thanks to IDA (International Documentary Association), I was given the opportunity to watch Norwegian filmmaker Benjamin Ree's documentary, ""The Painter and the Thief."" The film follows the 3 year journey of Czech artist living in Norway, Barbora Kysilkova, and her attempt to locate several of her paintings stolen from an art gallery. Barbora connects at the trial with caught ringleader, Karl-Bertil Nordland, a career criminal fighting a heroin addiction and a (possibly)feigned memory loss of the theft, and offers to paint his self-portrait, in hopes this may help her find out the whereabouts of the stolen paintings. What follows this initial meeting between the two is an unexpected friendship and empathetic bond over the next 3 years. Without giving anything away, the documentary's ending is rather extraordinary.",False
2,9,Extraordinary work of art,bettinagh-51115,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Painter and the Thief is about both art and the art of being human. It's a brilliant, beautiful dogma-ish film presented as a documentary.Just watch it. It's charming and utterly engaging and it doesn't matter whether or not it's a documentary- it just is and that's what matters.",False
3,8,AMUSING,js-66130,n/a,15/08/2025,"When a struggling (is there any other kind?) visual artist has a chance to confront the thief of her precious paintings, she does so in a strange, friendly approach of curiosity. Soon the two are meeting for tea and deep conversation. A film so seemingly plot driven is actually a stark documentary, one of those crazy miracles where the filmmaker is in the right place at the right time, and an enthralling story develops before his lens. Benjamin Ree captures their tale in gorgeous shots, unfettered dialogue, and stealthiness. Hard to believe that there wasn't any staging involved, as there is total absence of camera intrusions, or director interference.""The Painter and the Thief"" works on so many levels, but it is the startling relationship that develops between artist and her new found muse that is the heart of this fire. Obviously upset at her loss, Barbora Kysilkova quickly moves her emotions to dig deep into the psyche of the troubled Karl-Bertil, offering branches of support and friendship. He returns the favour, but struggles to shed his bad boy lifestyle, and lapses. Whether Barbora is truly offering up a humanitarian hand, or using the danger boy as artistic inspiration, or both, is an interesting question that looms throughout.Each are enthralling characters, with definitely wildly divergent career paths, that have become entangled like wild weeds of infatuation. Its an enlightening look at how humans interact with each other, who we choose to interact with, what we are looking for, and why do we look in the first place? Deep down inside: are we, or are we not, good?How can this possibly end well? There's only one way to find out.hipCRANK",False
4,10,Breathtaking,ThomasDrufke,n/a,15/08/2025,"A film so different from anything I have ever seen and one that feels like you're watching a real life friendship develop on screen (which you technically are) and it's marvelous. From tragedy to triumphant moments, The Painter & the Thief is the most unique film you'll see in years. Oh, and that last shot is breathtaking.10/10.",False
5,10,An inspiring true story of courage and acceptance.,jjagnew-15940,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not a dry eye in the theatre at its premiere last Friday morning at Sundance. At times, it almost seemed fictional because of the bizarre twists and turns you are taken on as the story unfolds. I sat mesmerized watching as it truly is a beautiful, inspiring story. The ""Painter"" and the ""Thief"" are both remarkable individuals. The cinematography was tight; amazing artwork, too. All in all a feel great experience, without being too cheesy. Have some Kleenex on hand. :)",False
6,6,Caring & Compassionate...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,"A lost and inquisitive bohemian artisan befriends the thief and junkie that stole her art from a gallery in Oslo. As it transpires, an event that won't do future sales of her art any harm at all but does re-instill your faith in the generosity and kindness of people in a world that continually demonstrates the opposite.",False
7,n/a,Beautiful Movie,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you all who worked on this movie for bringing us this beautiful experience. Even though it's documentary it's unrealistically filmy. I mean how would the documentary people would have committed to spend time money and effort without knowing how the story would unfold. That makes it a masterpiece of visual experience. Btw last scene showing Barbora's master piece leaves more questions than answers. It's a beautiful beautiful painting.
Barbora you're a absolutely unrealistically beautiful and kind human being. I wish you all the best with your career. I hope and pray that you are a successful artist.
Thank you all for this movie.",False
8,9,"The more they revealed, the less I knew",thejdrage,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a strange story about an art theft that morphed into .... well, I'm not sure.Two damaged people meet and ........... well, I'm not sure.I have always watched a movie/film/doc and then immediately written a review. I couldn't do that with this extraordinary documentary. I had to sleep on it.The people in this documentary utterly confused me, but I do know they both unsettled me and made me wonder what was really happening underneath.It made me uncomfortable - and that can be a good thing. It made me observe and think - a lot. I went to bed not knowing what I watched and I woke up glad that I watched it.Please - Do watch it - with an open mind. And watching the credits is a MUST.",False
9,7,circles of friendship,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGreetings again from the darkness. Artists think differently than the rest of us. Not only do they see the world with an offbeat or skewed vision, but they process life events in ways we sometimes can't fathom. For instance, if a crime were committed against you - say, your property was stolen - your natural response would be anger, or a desire for justice for the perpetrator. In Norwegian director Benjamin Ree's documentary, Czech artist Barbora Kysilkova reacts much differently when her two most valuable paintings are stolen. She befriends the thief.We see the security video footage. Karl-Bertil Nordland and another man break into Oslo's Galleri Nobel and then walk out with Barbora's paintings. Upon being apprehended, the painter and thief have a chat in the courtroom. Bertil confesses that he chose the paintings because they were ""beautiful."" The artist is intrigued and invites the thief to pose for a portrait when he is released from jail. As if this situation isn't bizarre enough, Bertil claims he has no idea where the stolen paintings are, and has no memory of what happened. Yes, he's also a drug addict.It's a bit uncomfortable to watch post-prison Bertil lounging on Barbora's sofa as she sketches him and they converse about philosophies of life. Slowly, their relationship builds into a friendship. It's an unlikely connection through art. We get a rare glimpse of an artist at work, as we see Barbora in her studio working on her pieces. Of course, she is also saddened by the loss of the two unrecovered pieces, and we also witness the artist struggle with the commerce/business side of art, as she faces frequent rejections from galleries as she attempts to display her work. This is on top of the lectures from her boyfriend ... lectures delivered in the manner a parent would talk to their kid.One of the more surreal moments occurs when the camera films Barbora at Bertil's place, and she sketches him and his girlfriend in a provocative pose. During all of this, we hear Barbora discussing why she finds Bertil interesting, despite his junkie-criminal lifestyle. After all, he is the kind of guy who scores a fix on his way to rehab. Things get very interesting ... in a weird way ... when Ree turns the tables and films Bertil analyzing Barbora.These two have studied each other over the years, and may have a better understanding of their friend, than they do of themselves. Watching Barbora act as caregiver for an injured Bertil is a confusing development to process, but it goes back to how artists see the world through their own eyes. Her paintings may be ultra-realistic, but her life barely qualifies as our reality ... at least until the rent is past due. The connections through the circle tattoo may come across as somewhat creepy, and we find ourselves a bit skeptical of many scenes where the camera is present, but there is no denying this works as a remarkable character study of two people we wouldn't normally categorize as friends.",True
10,10,"A beautiful story of forgiveness, rebirths and friendship",Vickiwind,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't expect to be so moved by this documentary. The first 20 min or so, I had doubts as to the depth of the film - but as it progresses, it builds suspense and substance. The twists and turns are interesting but the real insight is how life is more complicated than good vs bad, and how people can't be categorized this way, and if you can see that, it can change your life. Truly beautiful story about the power of understanding, and love.",False
11,7,Unexpected twists and turns,the-antichrist-is-near,n/a,15/08/2025,"Especially going into this movie without any idea what it might be about, you're in for a treat.Not only the movie bounces around between the two main characters, but they themselves do to. The film does an awesome job showing that, with clever editing and use of time. Showing the artist being addicted in a way to her hobby/profession too makes you think about what can go wrong in life even when you try to live your life the best and kindest way possible. It's a great mirror on the other side of the more 'standard' bad youth>junkie>jail>recovery story.Only downside might be that it feels the makers of the documentary didn't stay as much in the background as you would expect. At times it feels that they steer (influence might be too big of a word here) the whole story a certain way, which also results in the two protagonists seeming unnatural. I do believe that they are real and not actors, but some interactions seem weirdly forced...",False
12,10,Amazing,Craig-darke,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerLoved this story.. amazing artist.. the twist at the end is so good.. a must watch! I even wrote to the artist after I watched it . She wrote back to me. Nice woman . Good heart and great artist .,True
13,4,Not documented in a believable manner,mlambertvaus,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEven though the crime was committed the way this documentary was contrived and scripted (as I'm certain it was) just makes the whole interaction between the artist and the thief seem completely unbelievable to me.
I also feel like there a too many holes in the story that just make no sense at all to me. I won't go into all of them, though there are many (for example the order in which the picture of the crashed car was shown early on before the actual crash even supposedly happened to the perfect condition the thief seemed to be in in the hospital bed after the crash without a single scratch on him).
I love a true story of forgiveness and redemption, but for me this definitely would not be an Oscar contending documentary.",True
14,n/a,Compassion and love and empathy in one challenging documentary. That's art.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"A photo-realist painter asks to do a portrait of the thief who stole her masterpiece from an Oslo museum. He complies and some strange variation of Stockholm emerges, tats and all. The Painter and Thief is a documentary like none you have seen before-the crime is real, and the principles are the originals. Weird and complicated as the real crime was, this documentary beats it by a Louvre mile.Barbora Kysilkova had been a minor Czech photo realism star now settled in Norway. When Karl Bertil-Nordland steals two of her paintings, he is distraught enough that to agree to the portrait. Why she needs to do it would confuse a convention of Freudians, why he does is inscrutable because he can't even remember why he committed it in the first place. Or rather, he doesn't offer his drug intake as excuse.The Painter and the Thief eschews the usual documentary over- analysis of subjects because there is not an iota of chance that either understands their reasons. As far as the realism of a documentary, like Christopher Nolan, director Benjamin Ree skillfully upends the usual chronology and logic to play with their time together and ours to figure out the real reason this is happening.Not that we ever get to that point. Bertil turns out to be much more than an addled addict obsessed with an artist, and in that resolution of character, the film takes off into the abstract world of artistic intent, inspiration, an truth. Bertil's untutored passion for artistic expression (try to take your eyes off his tats-you can't because like his disoriented life, there appears to be no reason for the designs until he starts to explain them). Same with the film, so keep reading good critics if you want to find Ree's labyrinth.Perhaps this film is memorable because it looks like boilerplate docudrama and it isn't or because it looks like art and it is actually life not completely understood. If you are reading this review, you'll be happy to be seduced by the ineffability of art. This is not a documentary; it is art.",False
15,10,Original and affecting doc of the decade,darianna,n/a,15/08/2025,"It starts with a crime, develops into a friendship and turns into a true bond. Benjamin Ree's documentary is the most searing, fascinating, beautiful, complex docs I have seen in years.
A portrait of trauma, self destruction, that finally finds healing, potential and love. This is an unusual 'love story' of two fragile creatures, an artist and a thief, both aesthetes who escape past abuse in their own ways.A must watch film. Amazing to believe that it was directed by a 30 year old.",False
16,8,Great documentary,rizo-30500,n/a,15/08/2025,Really good and beautifully crafted. Almost like a love story,False
17,8,Absolutely amazing,simaba,n/a,15/08/2025,It really left me just speechless staring at the credits. I don't know what I was expecting but I wasn't expecting this.,False
18,8,A surprising hidden gem,cheer88,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI was intrigued by its title to start watching it. The main storyline is the evolvement of relationship between the victim and perpetrator which probably already has been done several times before. However, this one gave a new perspective with unexpected outcomes.The story started with the victim's two symbolic paintings were stolen. Police followed the video then arrested two perpetrators however those two paintings were never recovered. The victim is a struggling artist with an abused past so as one of the perpetrator. Somehow, they connected each other with profound understanding. The movie told a story of a unlikely relationship flourish between two people world apart. It is not so much to say but to feel. One of two paintings was recovered by the artist herself in the end. She was also repainting the other one throughout the whole movie. To the end, she revealed a painting with the same setting but different people from her original one, she and her perpetrator. It is symbolically abstruse.This documentary is well structured and beautifully told. I will recommend it.",True
19,5,Skeptical How much was staged?,cuvtixo-13,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFrom the beginning, it didn't smell right. Thieves unstaple paintings instead of grabbing them? Especially from an unknown contemporary artist! How she was grinning and wayyy too comfortable upon meeting this criminal. A you-know-what eating grin. The heroin buy and him letting her take it from him. BTW withdrawals prevent normal functioning -its not a matter of just not being able to deal with feelings or cravings. It's about nights of diarrhea, etc. So very unrealistic addict behavior. Also, it looked like her boyfriend was filming, we assume so, anyways, but as the film went on, it was shot as if we are supposed to forget -like when she's calling galleries to get a showing, she does so on speaker phone(!) get a couple of refusals, then breaks into tears, and the camera-person just continues to film. Increasingly, the scenes seem staged. Her eventually finding the painting in a basement from a ""scary mafia guy"", who apparently lets the landlord look through his belongings in storage. Its conveniently found in basement, carefully rolled up. And then she paints herself and the thief as lovers! As if that was acceptable. It just doesn't add up. Would a struggling photorealistic painter stage an elaborate theft and docudrama? Yes, damnit, yes of course edgy ""artists"" would pull that in this day and age. Fake news. If they presented this as a fictional story, I'd be kinda impressed, thus five stars instead of one. I'm waiting for the real story. Maybe they are waiting for the right award ceremony to reveal their fraud. It's just a matter of time, though.",True
20,n/a,Speechless...,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,As an artist I have always known of the many healing powers of art... but this film shows the layers upon layers of healing all while keeping you on the edge of your seat... Absolutely phenomenal.,False
21,10,Two sides of the same coin.,ChristyGuinn,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was beautiful. I LOVED it. They are both so tortured and they're both junkies...doing what they love no matter the cost, as their worlds and the worlds of the ones who love them, deteriorate. Choosing their drug over everything! 2 people destined to meet, at least that's how I feel about it. To me, it was beautiful. And OMG her paintings!! Then OMG his carpentry. I don't know them, of course, but I found myself wanting peace and balance for them and their lives. It moved me to tears more than once. So happy I found it, hope many others find it too.",False
22,9,A raw portrait of the struggles some among us face,plmnys,n/a,15/08/2025,"Raw is good, specially when it's told as masterfully as in this little gem. The 'choice' in snippets of conversations builds up to a contemporary portrait of the one and only truth that if we are to mend our brokenness only another human (and art) will make it happen.",False
23,10,Had I known that this was a documentary..,punapuna-44923,n/a,15/08/2025,I probably would not have watched! It came from a friend's referral so I streamed it and was more than pleasantly surprised. I was totally hooked in 3 minutes. It has opened up my eyes to a whole different genre which I will now explore. The problem is that I don't have a name for this genre! This is magnificent! The art is incredible! The human emotions captured left me emotionally wide opened. BRAVO!,False
24,10,love in crime,teoteoroed,n/a,15/08/2025,"An incredible film that show art, forgiveness, friendship, talent, regret and the power of an individuals past and how it reflects on the future, relationships and passions. Barboras passion for her art and how her past influence how she lives and how she reacts and work is shown in a beautiful way.",False
25,10,A lesson in humility and an example of substantial artistic genius.,TheAlgonquin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Firstly, Barbora Kysilkova is a truly remarkable artist. Her ability is profound, she has skills that Rembrandt would have admired. Her work echoes that by Caravaggio, both in its depiction of light, but also in her forensic exploration of the dark tones of human existence. That she can also construct the stretcher for her canvasses and prime them professionally is pretty rare these days (I am an artist).Her humility and generosity throughout this film should be a lesson to all who profess altruism, empathy, and all the other charitable graces that are unjustifiably flaunted these days by the self-appointed social media personalities.The makers of this film uphold the finest traditions of documentary film making, never intruding, allowing the silences to speak for themselves. Their film is an uplifting rarity in so-called 'art films' where the weirdness of the (so-called!) artists is the theme and not their art. I will not mention Tracy Emin or Damien Hirst.I hope that it gives Barbora Kysilkova the recognition and sales that she deserves, to allow her to continue making images that elevate humanity as a whole. My one criticism is that the paintings themselves should have enjoyed more screen time. Congratulations, and every success to you, Barbora!",False

1,10,"Great video with true facts , a historical rebellion action by HongKongers",laikei-35255,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great video with true facts , a historical rebellion action by HongKongers.It is touching to see every scenes in this video. We never forget, never forgive the evil government and China",False
2,10,Excellent,roberto-gelleni,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is true independent ""grass root"" documentary. They worked at jobs from railroad in Switzerland to Starbucks and bartender in Texas, raised every penny, bought their gear, packed up and went to Honk Kong. They owed money to no one and had complete freedom to tell the story as they saw it.The documentary gives you the feel of being right there with them, although it takes a few minutes to realize how dangerous it was. They run with the protesters, got tear gassed too many times to count, and lived and run the streets.Top notch documentary for an issue that as it will come up again, can and will have repercussions far from the physical boundaries of Honk Kong.If they burn, we burn with them.",False
3,10,"Some people move on, but not us.",rayli-15467,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary make me remember those nightmare...
Why do we have to suffer from this?
Why do the student can not learn knowledge, but fighting techniques in the university?
Some people move on, but some of us stay in 2019, forever.",False
4,10,The facts you can't read in HK's newspaper,Favaaa,n/a,16/08/2025,"It shows wt did HKers faced since 2019. The video shows the truth those young people are not rioters, they did helped the innocent citizen. China and HK government will never let admit and let their people know it.Great shots under thousands of teargas and water cannons, especially the Tsim Sha Tsui part!",False
5,10,A true record of history,w_an_m,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Hongkonger, I'm incredibly touched to see passionate filmmakers coming to HK to document what is happening here: our struggles, blood and tears in our fight for freedom and democracy.In particular, with HK police's ever-increasing hostility towards the Press, both local and overseas, this documentary serves as an important record of the democratic movement. It requires true courage to stand at the frontlines and capture these precious footage.HK government and Chinese Communist Party will surely try their best to censor the truth and silence our voices. But, as the title says, if we burn, you will burn with us.",False
6,10,A great documentary for Hong Kong,ho-64547,n/a,16/08/2025,"This video documents the siege of Poly. University of Hong Kong from the protestors' views, focusing what happened inside the ""warzone"".
***Don't forget the physical as well as psychological damages to the students as the siege continued for many days",False
7,10,"A Documentary telling to the world Hong Kong citizen are flight for the freedom! Using their life to again the CPC, a Dictatorship Government!",cheungkaleung,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Documentary telling to the world Hong Kong citizen are flight for the freedom! Using their life to again the CPC, a Dictatorship Government!",False
8,7,Preserving the memory in the age of white terror,s-15230,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since the protest is ongoing in Hong Kong, the documentary does not give an in-depth review of the event. It reflects things happened during the historic social unrest and the mood of the public. It is still precious especially at the age of white terror.Today is August 10th, I finished watching the documentary on the day that Apple Daily was cracked down by the HK police.",False
9,10,Immersive,fgelleni,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was a refreshing break from the coverage seen from major news media during the protests, which was often distant and disconnected. Instead, the experience given here is quite immersive, allowing the viewer greater access to their own curiosity and compassion for everyone involved- while also not portraying heavy bias for any particular perspective. This is a rare and exciting achievement for a documentary about events in which extremely strong alliances and beliefs are involved.It's thrilling, well edited, honest, and- above all- it remains important viewing for anyone who wishes to be well-informed on the continuously unfolding story of Hong Kong.",False
10,6,Just a partly description of the Hong Kong protest fact,leeshinghei,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary does have a variety of protesters scenes. As a documentary,it should report the whole incident and fact of both camps. If you have watched the entire video, you can easily see that the more about what the protesters had done. Only very little about how the police misuse their weapons and how the treat the arrested protesters. In Hong Kong,the protesters are mainly treated very badly after being arrested. The fact is the riot police especially the raptors hurt people with pepper sprays, batton and guns even after the protesters are being controlled by the police. 2hen the police shoot tear gas to the crowd, why the camera wasn't pointed at the side of the cops? In most situations the shooting time is inappropriate,but the documentary failed to showed this to the audience.
I will not recommend this to people not living in Hong Kong because it can't represent the whole movement. I can just know about what is the term ""sau zuk"" (hands and feet) and the action of the protesters. This is a failure as a documentary. I would rather browse the Wikipedia instead of watching this if I want to know what's going on. Do not recommend this documentary. Of it is aimed at recording this history, years later people will just remember how violent the protesters are. And nobody will know how ridiculous the government and police are.",True
11,6,It could be better as a documentary?,rorce-lam,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot certain what a documentary should or should not do. It looks like a partial record of what had taken place in Hong Kong for Hongkonger fighting the communist. It sort of repeating too much of those protest without explaining why and how it came about. It is a bit much of repetition for an one and half hours of documentary. It is definitely so much shot of the extent of damage made by the protestors to the once beautiful city of Hong Kong. It does not record much of the violence of the police force. It does so on recording the protestor building their tools, however mild one those are. I thought at some point that who made this documentary? Is it made by a propaganda of he communist to show how violent the protesters are, how non-violent of the police force and how much damage the protest has done to the city. If I had not have the background of what happened to Hong Kong, I might have left the documentary with such a thinking. What the communist propagandist would like us to think?I thought this could be better. Or perhaps editing it to come out 30 minutes instead of one and a half hour would make its impact more powerful. Is a documentary had to be totally impartial to the extent that the audience may end up also taking a impartial side? I just don't know.I am looking forward to watching another documentary ""Revolution of Our Times"".",True
12,7,Just showing moments of the movement instead of providing a full picture of why events happened,v612,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell it just showcased clips of Hong Kong's protests without providing much explanation (tried but not enough). Hard to understand if don't have a certain level of understanding about Hong Kong's situation.Missing important events during the period the ""documentary"" is trying to talk about, especially missing the attack on Chinese University while discussing the events leading up to the PolyU Siege? Confusing and not quite understand the focus. People who don't have much knowledge about what happened during early November will probably not understand this documentary.",True

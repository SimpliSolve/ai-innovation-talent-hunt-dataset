1,9,How can it be slander when it's true?,Matti-Man,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first point I want to make is - contrary to the assertions of another reviewer here - this is NOT an ""anti-Trump piece"". Trump's name is NOT called out repeatedly. Yes, he, along with Melania, is pictured in several photos with Epstein. As is Bill Clinton. There are several other luminaries pictured with Epstein throughout the program. So it's not like Trump is singled out. What is more telling is that Trump is pictured at all, and it's not more widely known. It's hard to believe that any of these famous folk had no inkling of Epstein's extra-curricular activities. You'd think famous people would be more cautious about who they associate with and who they're pictured with ... unless they're sure there will be no consequences.More importantly, what stood out for me is how so many young women, from so many different parts of the United States, have all told essentially the same story. Epstein clearly had his tried and tested methods that ""worked"" for him, regardless of the physical and psychological damage caused. But then, we know that abusers lack empathy, like all psychopaths.This is not a comfortable story, and some people - notably Alan Dershowitz and Alex Acosta - don't come out of this very well. But the stories of the abused women are heart-wrenching and deeply affecting. And it's deeply disturbing that a woman - Ghislaine Maxwell - could be so instrumental in facilitating any abuse of this sort, let alone the epic level of abuse seen here.It's also concerning that the authorities appeared so reluctant, initially, to do anything about Epstein. In the scenes where he is being questioned by prosecutors, he seems so sure that he's untouchable. I guess we'll never know why he felt so confident. Just as we'll never know where he got the tools to carry out his suicide, considering how careful prison authorities are to remove all laces, belts and other items they could be used to hang themselves. Not in this case, apparently ...",False

3,1,"Anti-Trump slander piece disguised as a ""documentary""",somethingsillyx,n/a,15/08/2025,"First off, nothing in here that you haven't already seen in countless other documentaries on JE.But what it really is is just anti-Trump crap. A few photos and videos of JE with Trump used over and over, and Trump's name being called out repeatedly. *****ONE***** grainy photo of someone that looks like Bill Clinton, and he's never mentioned by name. Even though he's in the flight records numerous times. Even though there's a least one photo of BC with a victim. Even though there's tons of photos and video of BC and JE together.",False
4,3,Disappointing,kylejay-37763,n/a,15/08/2025,"I rolled into this hoping to learn more about the Epstein saga. I've followed numerous podcasts and other docuseries. I applaud the series allowing the victims to tell their tale. I wish they had touched on more of the Epstein saga.The Trump undertones were horrid. Every few minutes is a Trump pic or video insert. I counted 1 photo of Clinton. Clinton was on his plane, on his island, visited him nonstop. But someone they make it about attacking Trump? Just truly pathetic. So many other involved, criminal power players you could have used. But you chose to attack Trump. Can you at least put your political biases away long enough to do a good documentary?From the opening scenes you make sure to attach Epstein as a neighbor to Trump. Countless cuts to the same pics of Trump and Melania with Jeff and Ghislaine. Where are all the pics of Clinton and Jeff. There's countless ones that can be found in a simple google search.Where are the countless references to Bill's trips to the island, his 27 rides on the plane, the multiple phone numbers for Bill? What about Jeff's connections to Donald and William Barr? You leave out that his firs teaching job was working for William Barr's dad. What about a true history of who Maxwell is and his well known ties to arms dealing? When talking about the case in Florida. You reference Mar-a-Lago multiple times but leave out that Trump kicked him off of there. You leave out the US Attorney publicly stating Epstein belongs to intelligence. So many things you leave out, but at least we get clips of Trump every few minutes.Truly a sad disservice to these women. You had a chance to give their story a bullhorn from a mountain top and instead you wasted time with political opportunities. You probably should have tried to uncover more of what allowed this to happen to them. The failures of the government and Law Enforcement agencies that should have helped and protected them.",False
5,2,Unbelievable,piercesix,n/a,15/08/2025,"I could not even make it through the first episode due to the constant Trump innuendoes. No references to who the real perpetrators or accomplices were. So, I thought how can I believe anything this ""documentary"" says? What a waste of time. I was so disgusted that I came here to post a review for the first time and noticed that I am not the only one who noticed. I'm not sure why producer would even bother to try with this before all the information has been released. It seems to be a very poor attempt at spinning opinion. When, interest is high, you could have at least tried to mask your contempt.",False

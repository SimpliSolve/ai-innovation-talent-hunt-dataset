1,6,"Is it really worth finding out the mystery sometimes, even if it has no merit?",Gates82,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI just watched this film. I've been into stamps all because of one of my top favorite movies, ""Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveler"". After loving this so much when I was younger, this movie had actually gotten me into the hobby of stamp collecting. So, being into stamps I was curious about this film. I found the whole premise of this film to be totally pointless. They keep talking about how he was the son of a con man, and this made it seem like the director had something in mind with the character, but it had nothing to do with it from what I've seen. It was not even important to mention it, really.Basically, the guy thinks that there is more to this stamp collection, and they go about it by making it appear that it may have even belonged to someone who has been killed which was not even at all tied to this person, I don't think.So, after 2 years or so, he decides to try and find the guy who gave him the stamps to look after, but he kept one small binder for himself, I think.... I lost interest and was watching this picture in Picture while multi-tasking as it was just something to give little attention to. I get it, Willy was curious about this guy and the mystery of the stamps, but why keep the one, and clearly the guy wasn't going to come back for them after 2 years after saying he was coming back in 2 weeks and never showing up for them.Pointless documentary , really. He was just as well off to keep the stamps and leaving the mystery behind, as there was nothing good coming out of it even if he had found out the truth, as it could have most likely led him to his own demise. Should've just kept the lot of stamps and forgotten about this story.",True
2,3,"It's a con, and you're the mark.",normivey1,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a stamp collector considering watching because you're curious about the stamps, don't bother. The Penny Black is the only one worth seeing. The other ""valuable"" stamps are extremely common.The film is so full of easily debunked and dubious claims that it should be listed as mystery. The son of a con man has pulled off a con on everyone who watches it.",False

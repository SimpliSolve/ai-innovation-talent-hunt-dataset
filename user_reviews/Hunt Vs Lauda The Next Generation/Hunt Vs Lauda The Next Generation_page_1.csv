1,6,"Interesting, but mainly for the back story",kevdexxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an interesting documentary in as much as the background story of both drivers is of great interest to anyone who grew up watching their fathers. There is some nice archive, especially with Niki Lauda, and it's good to get a sense of what it is like growing up in the shadow of legends. The race element itself is OK, but would have been way better if they had driven their father's cars! One big criticism though is the voice over artist, who has completely the wrong tone of voice and style, he kind of spoils it a bit.Overall though, worth a watch for the archive and to see how much James' son is like he was.",False

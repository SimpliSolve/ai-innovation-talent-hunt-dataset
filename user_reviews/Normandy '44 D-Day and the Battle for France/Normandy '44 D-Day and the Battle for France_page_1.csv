1,3,Lacks Illustrations!,davidphughes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Expertly presented, but often pointing places out on a map which can not be seen, about units which viewers might not recognise.Needs a simple metal board to hold a simplified map showing only the key points, orientated facing north, possibly with a micro map in a corner showing its position in France. Magnetic markers for units could then be easily moved around but need to be easily recognisable (helmets, flags or colour or coloured figures plus arrows). Alternatively, wargames terrain with models which would show the different types and numbers of divisions. Better still a Digital advertising display with touch screen control. At the very least the presenters could point out locations on the ground while icons move on an illustrated map to one side of the frame. There are also plenty of reenactors who would be willing to show their kit and take up various positions. D Hughes retired teacher.",False

1,8,Otto - Normal User,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"For those who speak German: Otto Normalverbraucher - for those who don't get it entirely: well it is a word that describes a person that is ... common. That is like everyone else ... now let's be clear: Otto is not that! It is a joke, though as always I will claim that no pun was intended.If you are German and of a certain age you will know him and most likely cherish him. Times were different ... he was able to make comedy his own. He influenced quite a lot of people - and many of them talk about this. Be it the swearing - well nothing too extreme mind you. But talking sexual too - quite the thing for teenagers to hear and experience as they say in this documentary.Now as you may guess, not everything he did aged in the best way possible. I am not going to play fun police here (or be woke as some might say), but some may feel offended or at least see some things that are cringe. And while the documentary also touches on some darker sides (who hasn't gotten them? Exactly) - don't expect this to go too deep on those things! This is more a celebration of Otto ... but also the people he ... well ""made"" ...",False

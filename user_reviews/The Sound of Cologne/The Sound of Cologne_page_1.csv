1,8,A masterpiece,filmandpassion,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is really an all-round successful film that gives insight into the electronic music scene in Cologne - starting with Stockhausen and ending with the musicians today. What is particularly exciting is how the film is able to depict the network of composers and musicians and the different influences between the generations. But the intertwining of electronic music with Cologne is also great. The images of the city are incredibly well done.In this, it really makes sense to start with Stockhausen, since he founded electronic music. Also, the WDR studio is featured in the film and the film really goes into detail. It explains how sounds are made from radio equipment. The film chooses to follow the influence on pop culture rather than classical music. Cologne club life is portrayed very accurately and political aspects are also addressed here, how difficult it is for artists and DJs to keep finding places to hold their events. It also shows how the band Can works together with a wide variety of musicians. How Irmin Schmidt makes music together with Gregor Schwellenbach. Mouse on Mars are there, Lena Willikens, Niobe, also Kompakt, A-Musik and completely new unknown DJs and composers.I can only warmly recommend this film. The camera is great, the dramaturgy is coherent, the themes flow into each other, the protagonists are great and the music is really so fascinating.",False

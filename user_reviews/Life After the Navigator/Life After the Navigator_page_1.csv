1,8,Insightful and passionate documentary primarily about the ups and downs of childhood actor Joey Kramer,deanbatson-25560,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary follows the directors previous film, Life after the Flash, documentary about Flash Gordon and gives just as an interesting insight into the afterlife's of being an ageing cult movie legend. life after the navigator tells the story of the cast and crew's life's in the later years after filming the 80's classic Flight of the Navigator. As with the movie this documentary focuses primarily on the lead actor Joey Kramer who gives and open and honest account of turning child actor turning to adult bank robber and drug addict. His genuine account makes if difficult to not feel for him despite his serious offending. Yet if uplifting in that there does appear hope as he talks about his reform. This documentary gives a great insight into Joeys life and is an interesting watch for any fan of the movie.",True
2,8,Eye-opening documentary,jadejaysen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love docs of beloved films, so I was very excited to watch this one. I had had no idea about what had happened to Joey Cramer, who had played David in the film, until it was shown in this film. When I found out he'd been arrested for robbing a bank, I sat motionless with eyes wide and jaw to the floor for awhile. While listening to him discuss his experiences, my heart just broke for him. I really commend him for being so vulnerable and open about his pain and struggles. I really hope he continues to do well and heal.The rest of the film was exactly what one expects to see in a documentary about the making of a movie - and I loved it. I would've loved to see Paul Reubens. It's a shame he and Sarah Jessica Parker weren't part of the crew, but I'm still very grateful this documentary was made. I learned so much more than I thought I would.",True
3,6,Longer than the movie!,fostermarkluis,n/a,16/08/2025,"So sad to see this actor go down the path of so many other child actors, leeching from fame to the lowest levels of personal demise. But this attempt by filmmakers to document his spiral and eventual success at reversing his misfortune is really two documentaries smooshed together. The first doc is your typical ""actor on a chair"" reminiscing about the onset decisions and shenanigans from the 1986 production; while the second doc feels and even looks different, which follows the lead around later in his life, often recounting his darkest days and pointing out the many curbs and garbage cans upon which he sat.All in all - It is a bit disjointed, but still a loving tribute to a man who pulled himself from the abyss. I won't look at Navigator the same way again. If only he could time travel ...",False
4,10,Compliance!,mark-timbs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Flight Of The Navigator is a movie I really enjoyed as a 10 year old in 1986. Together with The Goonies, E.T., Back To The Future, Teen Wolf, The Lost Boys, The Last Starfighter, The Never Ending Story, Star Wars, Star Trek, John Hughes movies etc etc, it was a great time to be a kid. The zeitgeist of the 80's is just captivating and as us kids become middle aged, we look back not with nostalgia, but still feeling like we were part of something special and often still feeling like we are part of it. The following generations don't have to search for movies at video rentals, they don't have to save money for one-off trips to the cinema. Everything today within reason is at their fingertips. That's not their fault, but I imagine it's hard to fathom what being a kid in the 80's was actually really like, hence why such nostalgia exists now. The nostalgic factor is from today's kids wanting something they never had. Every Netflix movie or show aimed at teens now has an 80's aesthetic that tries but fails to conjure the real thing. But for us who were there at that point, it's also something we can never let go of, always seeking a way to relive those experiences.As I grew up, I lost a little touch of the movies I loved, however I rediscovered that love through my own children. Introducing my daughter at the age of about two years old to Flight Of The Navigator and many of the others mentioned above struck that thought that we had it good back then. And being able to relive that through our own kids proves we still have it good. When your own daughter reaches 18 years old, still watching this movie on a regular basis, you know that certain films and their themes within have something magical and timeless about them, and with that, those people who made the magic happen to begin with.We all assume Joey Cramer is that same 12 year old kid from 1986. But real life doesn't work that way. We have all heard of child stars being loved and cherished by the movie industry and fans alike only to be spat out and left by the side of the road once they hit puberty. Some forge ahead and make successes big and small. Some fall by the wayside very rarely intentional. Joey fell into that latter category. No doubt a nice kid, trying to make good but befell the pitfalls of being young, having money and no sturdy foundations to fall on to give him support and guidance.The great news and a story which this excellent documentary makes clear is that you can rise up from those pitfalls. You can ask for help and with that arm around the shoulder, the strength to face down whatever demons have held you down, you can make good on what inspired people to love you in the first place.This isn't just a documentary about a great and beloved film. It's a story about overcoming the odds with a fist in the air of the kind Judd Nelson gave us kids back in the 80's in The Breakfast Club.Director Lisa Downs has structured the film in a way that intersperses the making of the movie with Joey's story. Whilst you can guess where it ends, it's the journey that matters, very much like the original movie itself.
It's great to see so many cast and crew together for this and shows that the hardships of making a film can create lasting relationships and fond memories.
More importantly, Lisa Downs captures the heart of this documentary and the heart of what made Flight Of The Navigator what it is and that is it's star, Joey Cramer.
It's about a 12 year old boy trying to get home and against the odds, finally making it. We have all just made it home.",False
5,9,This film really spoke to me,petewestfileld,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this documentary i felt it really explored the world of addiction and how it can change someones life. Yes,, I'm a huge fan of the movie, but what really spoke to me was the journey of someone struggling to overcome their inner demons.I've been there so can relate.This documentary takes you on a really human journey of where life can lead you and ultimately is a tale of redemption. Its filled with great anecdotes and interviews about the movie Flight Of The Navigator. But is so much more. take the time to watch it. You wont be disappointed. The director really cares about the subject matter and if you are not at least quietly crying by the end, you have a heart of stone.",False
6,9,"We're all rooting for you, Joey!",ripplinbuckethead,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a since 1986-long fan of the film Flight of the Navigator, I was shocked, of course, upon hearing that the star of the film, Joey Cramer, had been arrested in an attempted bank robbery several years ago. Certain details came out, but nothing to really explain it. Well, all his fans wondered what happened, but one fan, director Lisa Downs, actually reached out to Joey and they made a film together that explains everything, warts and all.This is an excellent, heartfelt profile of Joey and his life, from early childhood to now, having gone through things most of us will never experience, the good and the bad. He really opens up, and knowing how long it took to film this whole project, we're able to follow his progress from good to better to best. Along the way, most of his co-stars from the movie are interviewed and offer nice insights. (even Sarah Jessica Parker makes a cameo, kinda/sorta!) I was impressed at the organic feel that Downs gave this, with a nice narrative throughout.As with the original movie, you can tell this documentary was a labor of love. I was so excited when I first heard of it and have followed its progress for quite a while. And now having seen it, I'd have to think it could also be viewed as an additional kick in the pants for Joey to stay on the straight and narrow. ;) He's still a youthful, talented, handsome and, thankfully, healthy guy with an ongoing interest in the world of film, so don't be surprised if you see him on the big or little screen again sometime!We're all rooting for you, Joey!",False
7,10,Wonderful look into Flight of the Navigator and Joey Cramer's life,carolynmlewis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lisa Downs did an amazing job of both going behind the scenes of Flight of the Navigator and telling the story of Joey Cramer's life, which is both heartbreaking and inspiring. There are interviews with so many of the cast and crew detailing the work that went into Flight of the Navigator. As a lifelong FOTN fan, I highly recommend it.",False
8,10,An emotional rollercoaster ride through a movie ive always loved,info-27718,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved Life After Flash, Director Lissa Downs earlier film in the same series, so had big expectations for this follow up I wasn't disappointed. This doco is a real deep dive from someone who shows the film and its stars , the respect and care it deserves.Joey Cramer has had a difficult life and the easiest move would have been to do a car crash 'where are they now' expose , but this is far from what the film goes.It's beautiful crafted, carefully constructed and clearly has been put together by someone who cares about its legacy.It's hard to convey unless you've seen it, so my advice is to see it. You won't be disappointed. I am not shamed to say my boyfriend had to pass the tissues at the end of this remarkable story. I cant wait for more in this series.",False
9,n/a,"Amazing, and completely worth your time.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of a Navigator who lost his way.Joe Cramer is a sympathetic and fascinating figure. His tale is sensational, but not sensationalized. His mistakes and choices are earnestly exposed, and I couldn't help but be caught up in his life. The same spark that made Joe so appealing in Flight of the Navigator still shines bright, he comes across as very likeable and easy to listen to.Life After The Navigator explores not only Joe's travails but also the production of Flight of the Navigator. And neither aspect steps on the toes of the other. Lisa Downs weaves between the two with skill, and I look forward very much to her next film, Life After Atreyu. (Speaking of which, Joe reveals a detail about The Neverending Story here that I had never heard before. He actually appears in that film twice, at least one shot of him is definitely not one you'd expect.)The Navigator's journey is not over. I hope Joe finds nothing but success is his endeavors.",False
10,4,Who Cares,FilmMcCool,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did see ""Flight of the Navigator"" when released but I cannot say I ever felt the need to either watch it again or check up on the lives of the actors therin. The movie was a bit of escapism and it was enjoyable. I would have been more interested in Joey had he used that movie to launch an acting career. That he did not and fell into drugs and criminality is sadly a story often told and happens to a lot more actors that those that make it a career, it is a tough profession starting out. This documentary, for that is what this is, is midly interesting if you do not particullary care abour Joey or even remember his name. The doco is well put together but again the subject matter is a matter of taste or interest.PS* I get suspicious of movie reviews when there are 20 pro 9+ reviews in a row, even the best blockbusters do not get reviews like that.",False

A story about a boy who became an actor who couldn't go back to ""normal"" life because of that. He got into a spot of trouble and had a tough time working his way out of it. By the end of this documentary movie, we find that the human spirit can get through ANYTHING whether it be getting bullied or being told vile things by a father or just making bad decisions and having to go through the human ""system"" for paying for those bad decisions.I believe this is a truly uplifting journey and well worth seeing.

I dont want to add any spoilers but its an incredible roller coaster ride.My only criticism is I would loved to have heard from Paul Reubans about voicing Max (HUGE FAN) , and maybe Sarah Jessica Parker, massive fan !! but that is me being picky.WATCH THIS.

14,10,Don't just watch this. OWN it on Blu-Ray!,dpnowell,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're reading this, you're probably already a big fan of the '80s cult classic Flight of the Navigator. And if you're a big fan of the movie, you absolutely must watch this documentary! Even better, buy it on Blu-Ray!Like you, I read the news article on Joey Cramer's arrest a few years back (was absolutely shocked!), and then scrolled through his Wikipedia to find more info. At the time his Wikipedia page was bare bones, and there really wasn't any other source for more info on him or the movie. Cue Life After the Navigator.This documentary amply fills in the blanks on what happened between 1986 and 2016. But more interesting, to me at least, was learning the behind the scenes aspects of the movie. This doc does a great job balancing the troubling life of Joey Cramer with background stories and tidbits from the original cast and crew.If I have one critique it's that it didn't get into as much detail of the bank robbery as I would have liked (was he really wearing a wig? Did he have a gun? How much money did he get? Did he spend it all? What did he spend it on?). To be fair, Joey offers enough disconcerting personal anecdotes, and perhaps the media made this a much bigger story than it actually was (after all, this happened at a small bank in Canada and wasn't a Heat-style bank robbery). That said, kudos for Joey for his candor!A huge question I've always had for the past 5 or 10 years was, ""is the original ship actually atop a soda stand at Disney World?"" No spoiler alerts, but the director does answer that question! (I don't recall if it's in the actual documentary or the bonus features on the Blu-Ray).Fun fact:My favorite quote of the movie:""So until you can tell me something that makes one ounce of sense, then we're all going home, and that's all there is to it.""""Right on, Dad!""Don't ask me why, but I've always laughed and cheered on Bill and Jeff Freeman every time I watch that scene.A more fun fact:To this day I still get freaked out when I watch the scene when Detective Banks brings Joey home and his parents are older. When I was younger, I thought ""if that ever happened to me, I'd hope there was a detective like that to help me out."" That character seemed like the only trustworthy person at that point in the movie and had a calming presence. Anyway, I attended the reunion screening in November 2019 at the Egyptian Theater and while I was outside the doors I saw the same actor, Raymond Forchion, walk past me on the cell phone. Actually, it was dark so I heard his voice first and immediately recognized it! I honestly had no idea he (or anyone else) was going to be there.And if you're still reading:I met Raymond Forchion after the movie and he was so nice! Just like in the movie! He introduced himself to me and we chatted a bit. What a fun night.Anyway, buy this movie!",False
15,9,A heartbreaking tale child stardom!,lauraswright,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very sensitively handled documentary that takes you not only into the heart of the film, but also it's troubled star Joey Cramer.Anyone who is a fan of the film will get so much out of this but the human story behind this and Downs also excellent Life After Flash also in this series , makes it so much more.

The director and producers of this film tracked Joey down to find out what Joey had been upto since he made Navigator. The doc also has interviews from other cast and crew members who talk about working Joey and making of the film. I have to say that this is one of the best docs i have seen and i got quite emotional throughout.

20,10,"Beyond The Navigator, Lies the Story of Joey Cramer",MovieMan-88,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFlight of the Navigator is a film that I grew up with, having received it on VHS as a present for my 5th Birthday. I found myself watching it at least twice a year. I even managed to purchase the out-of-print CD soundtrack to the film as well as an original theatrical 1-sheet poster which sadly got misplaced during a move. But my memories of sheer enjoyment in watching the film never faded nor became tiresome. Even though I grew up, I never stopped watching it, nor did I consider it solely a kids film.In my 30s, I hoped that someday Flight of the Navigator would see a resurgence in popularity thanks to its many online fans by way of either a newly produced bluray featuring remastered picture and sound along with a slew of new bonus features or a potential reunion of its cast and crew. Luckily, the British company Second Sight Films acquired the rights to 'Navigator' and released a fully remastered collector's edition bluray in the Summer of 2019 packed not only with limited edition packaging, poster, and booklet, but newly produced bonus features including interviews with Director Randal Kleiser, Actress Veronica Cartwright, Actor Matt Adler, and the 'Navigator' himself, Joey 'David Freeman' Cramer! It was a moment of pure joy that a childhood fan like myself felt then and there that nothing could be more amazing.Until this.For nearly 30 years, I had wondered whatever happened Joey Cramer, and save for a lone photo taken by a 'Navigator' fan showing Joey back in the late 2000s working as an employee at an athletic sportswear store, nothing else turned up...nothing that is in terms of positive news.Sadly, I had discovered that Joey had fallen into some extremely hard times in his adulthood having gotten involved with drugs and being arrested and sent to jail multiple times. This was all quite a shock to someone who grew up watching this actor year after year in a film I loved. To see a mugshot of Joey bearing the headline 'Flight of the Navigator actor jailed after bank robbery' was never something I thought I would see. I soon found out that I wasn't alone in wanting to find answers to just how this came to happen to Joey.I had learned about a documentary going into production independently from filmmakers Lisa Downs and Ashley Pugh by way of various Flight of the Navigator tags online (Facebook and Instagram primarily) and I was happy to see that gradually, as they were chronicling Joey's life since the film, that it appeared to be heading towards a happy ending. Thus became the documentary project, 'Life After The Navigator'.I had been anticipating the documentary of Life After The Navigator as early as the Summer of 2019 when Second Sight Films' bluray of Flight of the Navigator was being released. I felt like the new interview with Joey Cramer would be a nice 'prologue' as it were to the documentary being produced about his life. Throughout the remainder of 2019, I was thinking about what my reaction to the final product would be, happy, sad, angry? The day I made my contribution to the project's Kickstarter page was one I felt immensely proud of. This was around the Spring of 2020, amidst daily craziness caused by our still ever-present pandemic. Though our country's future seemed like a day by day guessing game, this documentary was one definite thing that appeared very close to completion. I constantly checked newly posted updates thanks to Lisa's Instagram account and Joey's Facebook page which kept my spirits high during my time of quarantine.Eventually, Lisa announced that the documentary would likely be completed by the end of the Summer, 2020 and that the actual product should start shipping out to its backers in November. After the past three weeks of seeing fellow backers post photos of their copies of the bluray of the documentary along with a commemorative 'Crew' patch and thank you letter, I knew that mine would certainly be on its way soon enough! On December 1st, 2020, my wait was finally over. The bluray and the ephemera contained within was inside my mailbox ready for me to enjoy!I invited my wife to watch it with me as she knew of my passion for the film growing up and that I had recorded my own fan-commentary for it which can be heard on my YouTube channel. To sum up, the documentary is given a very good structure interspersed with footage and interviews of its subjects. From the introduction, we are explained that what we are about to see is a true story of one man's journey from being a child actor and taking part in a film that has come to be embraced as a cult classic, to then seeing how he had gone through a prolonged dark period involving drugs, stealing, homelessness, robbery, jail time, and eventual sobriety.Life After The Navigator dedicates its first 25-30 minutes to the actual film Flight of the Navigator; its pre-production, casting of Joey Cramer, the way special effects were done in the mid-80s, how the puppetry and voicing of Max was done, as well as tell of how the film eventually performed in its release.From there, we go on to learn about Joey's childhood, his Mother, Carollyne Leighland is interviewed explaining how before Joey was born she was part of a hippie commune and in a time where free love was all around, came to have Joey by way of a fellow hippie musician named Gary Cramer. Sadly, we come to learn that this relationship was purely out of Joey's Mother wanting to have a son and Gary simply stood up and volunteered to impregnate her, never fully intending to be a proper Father Figure to Joey. We learn later in the documentary in a very blunt, shocking revelation told by Joey that while reaching out for some help and advice during his drug use, Joey was told by Gary that he would be better off killing himself.Moving forward, the documentary reveals even more things I had no idea about, the most revelatory of these being that Joey is a parent himself to a daughter named Celecta he had from a girlfriend he had during his time of being on drugs and homeless. It was comforting to learn that they decided to have the child put into foster care and that subsequently the child was raised in a more positive and healthy environment. We learn that Joey does still get opportunities to see Celecta.We see Joey take us through areas of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada where he would spend his childhood years, as well as his more dark periods whilst under the influence of drugs. There are many surprise moments and Joey's openness to the camera crew is quite candid. We learn that Joey appeared as an extra in the 1984 film The Neverending Story as well as having had the opportunity to hear the band Pearl Jam perform in a local Vancouver venue before they made it big.We also learn from Joey's Mother Carollyne that she had asked him to leave their house over the fact that she would not put up with any more of his stealing money to use for drugs, and in what may be one of the most powerful statements in the documentary, Joey's Mother says that when she told him to leave, that his response was ""I know you're not kicking me out Mom because you don't love me...""We hear how proud Joey is to be getting help to rebuild his life. It is rare to hear someone say how happy they are to have been in jail and say how positive of an experience it has been. We learn how Joey used his jailtime to write music, which he plays on guitar and also sings, how he was able to actively take part again in local theater and acting workshops, his eventual contact with Director Lisa Downs to start working on the documentary, and how after being released, he was able to start attending conventions to meet fans of Flight of the Navigator.Does the documentary end on a positive note? Yes. A happy reunion as it were between Mother and Son. This documentary made me laugh, cry, gasp, and frown, but all of these were expected emotional reactions as I knew watching it would more than likely be a series of mountains and valleys, highs and lows.This documentary unlike some stories depicting true life accounts of destruction and redemption was not structured to be seen as a 'Christ cures all' or 'This is what happens when you do drugs' themed 90-minute PSA, which I am very happy about, rather the documentary stands firm on its tagline which is 'It's all about the journey home', and we see this both figuratively and physically, just as David Freeman gets to his home in 1978 in Flight of the Navigator, so does Joey Cramer make it back home for a happy reunion with his Mother in Gibson, British Columbia, Canada.This documentary is simply beautiful and memorable to watch. It's not the kind of documentary one would ever see done for former child actors like Macaulay Culkin or Drew Barrymore where the bulk of it would be overly concerned with paparazzi and or lurid tales of family dysfunction. It stands on its own, a companion piece really to the original Flight of the Navigator film that people like me grew up with.There are some nice bonus features including additional footage of Joey in and around Vancouver, a short film he starred from 1988, a funny story from Veronica Cartwright which I actually knew about prior to this documentary, a post-production Q & A with Joey, a nice interview with both Joey and Randal Kleiser, an interview with Director Lisa Downs, an interview with Jeff Kleiser on the toughest special effect shot to produce for Flight of the Navigator, an additional bit of interview with Actor Howard Hesseman, and some additional video goodies.A huge kudos to Lisa Downs and Ashley Pugh for producing this film and allowing fans like myself to follow it from inception to completion via online resources and social media, and BIG thank you to Joey Cramer for letting us into his life to see how far he has come.See ya later, Navigator HA-HA!",True
21,9,Great addon to the movie,BudrodaHooligan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I bought this recently on blu-ray.
My expectations weren't let down at all.
This documentary shows some behind the scenes footage, the ins and outs how certain things were made, there are interviews with the cast and crew, but it is mainly about what happened to Joey Cramer before and after Flight of the Navigator.
It is also (co-)produced by Randal Kleiser, the director of the movie.Technically the documentary is put together excellently.
The title sequence looks great and it does a good job of telling the story.If you love the movie then I urge you to find a copy.
The blu-ray offers more than just the documentary. It has bonus features such as an interview with Lisa Downs, the director, some extended scenes and more interviews.Also, there's a small celebrity surprise during the audion process of the movie, but you will see for yourself.I'll give this documentary a 9/10.
The blu-ray gets a 10/10 because of the bonus features.",False
22,10,Life After series just gets better!,thedude-29,n/a,16/08/2025,Great balance between telling Joey Cramer story and the origin of getting the movie started through production and after.

The documentary moves at a steady pace and never gets boring. This is a must for all who like me lived the movies of the 80's and Flight of the Navigator stands as a solid movie of that time and keeps enteraining to this day! Solid second entry in the life after series. Director Lisa Downs is a talent to keep your eye on as this her second feature in the life after series just set the bar to 11.,False
23,10,"A beautifully crafted documentary about Joey Cramer, his tumultuous life and recovery, juxtaposed to the movie and its making.",stewdarl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I purchased the Blu ray of this documentary by Lisa Downs, after discovering her truly excellent ""Life After"" YouTube channel, and becoming a subscriber. I was, like so many people, deeply affected by Flight of the Navigator growing up, a movie that mixes the wonderment of science fiction seamlessly, with the heartwarming story of family. I recall wondering what became of Joey after revisiting this movie as an adult, as his performance for someone so young was so very, very good. To carry the leading role in such a large production, at such a young age, left me wondering where this young man's carrer had gone? He should've been a huge movie star... surely?
Seeing Joeys story on this documentary brought both laugh out loud moments, and absolute tears of utter sorrow, together with the sheer enjoyment at seeing an indepth comprehensive behind the scenes making of ""Flight of the Navigator"".
This is a must buy for any fan Joey and of this movie, to witness the truly inspirational telling of Joeys life story this far, by the man himself, and expertly crafted by Lisa & Ash. I can't sing it's praises high enough, or thank Lisa and Ash for making it so perfectly.
Lisa even included a personal handwritten note with my blu ray copy, and signed it's cover for me.. I shall treasure it.. forever!

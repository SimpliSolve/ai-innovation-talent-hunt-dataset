1,6,Interesting doc but only for a true fan,jhawkted,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this would be a documentary about jack septic eyes life and we did in bits and pieces but overall it's about the tour he did and I didn't even know he did. He even came to LA and I should of went. I bet it's so entertaining live and in person. It looked like a lot of fun based off the audience reactions. But unfortunately for the documentary it's not that much fun. It's not the documentary's fault. It happens with everything that's live like Hamilton or other filmed musicals. Everything is so much better but the best part about this movie has to be when he's in Ireland remembering his whole childhood and how hectic it was. In the end this doc is for the big jacksepticeye fans and I used to be one and watching this was fun but I'll probably forget this by tomorrow, this isn't the Billie ellish doc or something else but it's still good but I would've preferred more about his personal life but what we got was still good.",False

3,10,Inspiring,cvalzz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie not only allows you to see behind the scenes of how one of the biggest YouTubers went from nothing to over 24 million subscribers, but it also gives a great message that is built throughout the whole movie. Has some great comedy and is fun for the whole family to watch!",False
4,10,inspiring and uplifting,wolfie-86435,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly a wonderful film that was inspiring, poignant, captivating and relatable. I recommend wholeheartedly. As a fan of jacksepticeye and his youtube content myself, for many years, I really enjoyed this film, and any person who enjoys his content I would think would agree. It's filled with positivity, uplifting, and optimism. Massive thank you and shout out to the whole crew and to jack. I also appreciate it only being 90 minutes as it does not overstay its welcome, the full narrative being nice and solid. The camera work and voice overs also were done beautifully, I enjoyed the cinematography.Thank you jack! :)",False
5,10,A Feel Good and Inspiring Story,fernijen-18793,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sean's goal, as it seems in the movie, is to inspire everyone to find what they love and do it without placing limits. I enjoyed seeing his roots, and gaining an understanding of how the tour was a turning point in a way for Sean. It is inspiring to see an Irish lad who came from a small start lauching such an incredible channel. He may not be the best at some games (he is quick to admit that on his YouTube channel), but he is willing to have fun and enjoy the process of gaming. Sean shows in this documentary that you don't have to be a professional gamer to be a great YouTuber. You just need to be yourself, and be willing to take the creative chance.",False

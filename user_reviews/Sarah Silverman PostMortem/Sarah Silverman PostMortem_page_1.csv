1,5,A Eulogy or a Moth Talk?,hayley96,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSilverman is an acquired taste. Beloved by Terri Gross and talk show hosts; her self debasing cringe humor delivered in a little girl voice is really quite an act. I had low-medium hopes for this special, dedicated mostly to her deceased parents.When she walked out on stage and there was no guitar in sight, my hopes elevated. Silly me. What transpired over an hour was a eulogy or maybe a Moth talk on death and family, with bits of sex and fart jokes to remind us she's a stand up. It was deeply personal on some level and stories of jerking off her boyfriend on the other. It was occasionally funny.Bottom line. If you like her, you'll probably enjoy swaths of the show. Otherwise, not so much. I'm glad I didn't pay to see her on tour.",True
2,8,A special for those of us who've been through it,cheri_d,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm guessing the low-star reviews are due to people who cannot relate (so I guess ""congratulations"" to them). As someone who sat with my father (and best friend) in his final days and have lost more folks than I care to name, this was funny, heart-warming and hit all those spots that someone who has experienced the loss of parent(s) needs. Maybe this isn't the raw sort of show we've come to expect from Sarah but it is pretty damn impressive that she's ""laughing while orphaned"" a state few people can find in the same situation. In my opinion this was exactly the show I hoped it would be and I definitely shed some happy tears during the final credits.",False
3,1,It just wasn't funny,america1987,n/a,16/08/2025,"I actually like Sarah Silverman as a comic and feel about my reaction to this comedy special, but it's just not good, no matter how hard I try to find a positive.Most of the stand-up is about the late loss of her father, with whom she obviously had a great relationship. That being said, this felt more like a eulogy than a stand-up special and a lot of it was quite sad, which is exactly what I hoped to avoid going into a stand-up.Apart from being sad, there are long build-ups throughout with no punches, and a lot of jokes that feel like ""insider"" jokes that would have meant more for family or close friends. Overall, it just wasn't a good time.The live audience was very generous in its laughs and applause.",False
4,10,A gallows humor wake,MattS-322,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sarah absolutely jerks you from cute family story to heartfelt, sentimental memories, to deep, dark gallows humor, then randomly hits each note like a bop-it. As someone with a fairly comparable age and story of loss, it hit like a brick, then made me cackle in the darkest of ways. A memorable laugh/cry for sure.I'm sure it's a miss for some, but I am just personally an absolute bullseye of a target audience on this one. It is pure catharsis. It will challenge what you find funny and you'll probably think it's weird that a stand up comic is making you cry, be it for sympathy or empathy. Enjoy!!",False
5,1,not funny,majaguara,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is so unfunny and ordinary - I say things like this in casual conversations with friends, and we just smile slightly.This is considered stand-up material?And worth putting on a streaming platform?It's unfunny, bland, weak, bad, boring, bland.There's really nothing more to say, so I'll just copy this again to reach the required character count.This is so unfunny and ordinary - I say things like this in casual conversations with friends, and we just smile slightly.This is considered stand-up material?And worth putting on a streaming platform?It's unfunny, bland, weak, bad, boring, bland.There's really nothing more to say, so I'll just copy this again to reach the required character count.",False
6,10,Relatable and consistent,kalemasters,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sarah Silverman fans will like it. If you have lost a parent you'll like it. Sarah kills it. This special should be 10/10 across the board. She always keeps it real and so naturally funny. Obviously she has a past of being in stand up up comedy, if you're a comedy nerd you know that. She's always been funny and watching her delivery and intellectual delivery she always will be in my top fav comics. I like the ones that will bush boundaries but Also be themselves like through and through. I can't lie I lost touch a bit with the stupid post she put out about the Israel Palestine situation but she fixed it and I low key get her perspective at the the time as a full on American women of Jewish heritage but whatever she makes me cackle and have always loved her comedy and she stays funny,",False
7,4,Could have been therapy,qgwdcktw,n/a,16/08/2025,I really love Sarah's comedy. I've watched everything she's ever done except for the second half of this special. I feel like she made this primarily for herself and would be more appropriate as a conversation with friends and family who knew her parents. Maybe even as therapy. It just wasn't very funny. There were a few laughs obviously but as a whole it was clear that she was working some stuff out. The worst part is that I was really excited to watch the new Sarah Silverman special. I think I'll rewatch one of her older ones tonight. I hope it's not too long before she gets back to the sort of routines that her fans love her for.,False
8,8,It starts slowly,What-a-Punk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Better than expected.It started slowly though, since I get to see it randomly, I didn't really know what to expect.I was not really familiar with Sarah's comedy before.And initially, as I said, I thought it might not be any good.But then as it unfolded, it got really funny.You know, it's rare when jokes actually make you laugh out loud in front of your TV, but that's what happened.It must be hard. Grieving is hard. Yet it can be a bit easier with humour. Yet the humour must be right.And I do believe that this is a wise example, a high quality sample of such a humour, it really got to me.I was surprised when it's ended, I wanted more, it was a bittersweet symphony, I loved it.It's not the best show ever, it's probably not even the best Sarah's show, I guess cause it's mainly about her personally, about her grief and its not a default stand up topic, sure, but it was funny.And ironically, I guess that's how you want to go, that's how you want yourself to be remembered - with laughter of joy, not with plain tears...I never known this woman, so I guess I don't have to care about her personal stuff, but she is cunning and smart, and I can relate to most of the things she said, I respect that.Its a good show. I guess, if you really don't get it at all now, you probably will in time.",False
9,3,very serious matter for a Netflix comedy special,marcovinicio-74921,n/a,16/08/2025,"I generally enjoy Sara Silverman's comedy, i find it smart and creative, she is a great storyteller. This specific piece is very honest and a very well narrated story about her personal journey with her parents, at some points it gets sad and depressing, but she is a mature comic that teaches us that you can always find a silver lining on every situation.Maybe the problem is that this material is the kind you expect to hear on a comedy special, and you start watching thinking about a great time with a witty comic, but after a few minutes you realise that it is quite dense, not very funny. It does not mean it is a bad special, i would just suggest to be aware that this is not the kind of show you want to watch if you want a big laugh.",False
10,2,Massive bomb,evanmccraney,n/a,16/08/2025,"A cringeworthy bomb from a comedian who can and has done SO MUCH better. I was excited to watch it and unfortunately I found myself fast forwarding through most of it. Her pauses to wait for audience applause are painful and terrible ""impressions"" fall incredibly flat. When a comedian has to laugh at their own jokes to get things moving along, you know you're in for a slow ride. Sarah seems to have lost her spark and natural sense of humour. Save yourself an hour and skip this one...instead try checking out The Sarah Silverman Show. This ""special"" may end up being the postmortem for her comedy career.",False
11,1,Barf,minusplus-65696,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sarah Silverman's Postmortem was yet another disappointment, proving that comedy is often overshadowed by privilege and favoritism. The special was less of a stand-up routine and more of a gloomy monologue peppered with awkward, out-of-place sexual jokes. It wasn't funny, insightful, or entertaining-just an uneven and indulgent performance.It's impossible to ignore the recurring pattern: whenever Israel faces global criticism, suddenly a Jewish celebrity like Sarah Silverman, Amy Schumer, or Gal Gadot is given a major platform. Whether it's a lackluster comedy special, a bombed Netflix series, or a high-profile movie role, the spotlight stays fixed on them, often at the expense of more deserving talent. These opportunities feel less about merit and more about maintaining visibility, regardless of the quality of their work. It's frustrating to see the industry repeatedly prop up mediocrity while sidelining real talent.",False
12,n/a,Silverman is the best!!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I watched about half of her show so far due to limitations of my own but so far I love it Silverman is someone who I really didn't think was that funny and I'm talking about you know 30 years ago OK when I go back and look at her stuff even 20 years ago I find that she actually is quite funny quite good at what she does unique in her delivery and reading these negative comments about her Flips me out. Who are you people? I'm glad you don't like Sarah Silverman put your red hats on and go away.So now I write to fulfill a technicality on this site I love Sarah and believe that her humor and delivery are funny and funnier each time her humor is intelligent maybe some of you that so clearly dislike her should just crawl off and away from the rest of us with the lack of females in comedy and late night etc we need her voice now more than ever.,False

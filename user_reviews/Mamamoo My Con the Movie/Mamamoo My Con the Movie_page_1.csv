1,9,Excellent but not perfect,xwsmithx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Only two reviews so far? Okay, I'll add one.I went to the concert in Atlanta, and while it was good, I was way far away from the stage, so they were like little figurines on the stage. So when this movie was announced, I signed up immediately. The movie gives you the experience of the stage show but up close and personal, plus behind the scenes clips as well. My only complaint is that there was so much more that could have been included that wasn't. You don't really get the experience of the girls' personalities (they are very funny), you don't really get the personal interactions between them (they are more like family at this point than co-workers), and you don't get any _information_ ... If you went into this not knowing anything about them, you'd come away not knowing anything about them except that they are phenomenal singers.According to the seating chart I had to use (first time for that), the movie had way more buyers than attenders. So many people who paid for tickets didn't show up for the movie that the theater was almost empty. Not that I minded, but I would have liked to meet more fans.Most of Mamamoo's hits were included, plus a few more B-side songs, and even one I was unfamiliar with, so in that regard, I was pretty satisfied with the selection.",False
2,10,THE GREATEST KPOP VOCALISTS,dahmmmoo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watching this movie made me realize that mamamoo's reputation for being the greatest KPOP vocalists is 100% true they're on a different level from other groups and their stage presence is immaculate , even tho it was in a cinema but you can still feel their power , their charisma on stage
4 vocalists, dancer , rapper all rounder group mamamoo set the bar too high
If you weren't able to attend their concert the movie will give you the best opportunity to witness it with your own eyes (obviously watching a mamamoo concert in real life is a must)
They're just too good
If you didn't watch it you definitely need too.",False
3,10,Mamamoo NEVER disappoints,coldsasylums_b,n/a,15/08/2025,"I atended their concert in my city and went to watch their movie to relive the feeling and hearing Mamamoo's voices coming crystal clear through the speakers felt like an otherworldly experience. Solar's powerful vocals are truly amazing, Wheein's voice is incredibly dreamy, Moonbyul's rap is very energizing, and Hwasa so charismatic in stage. I can't get enough of any of them. Their thoughts on each other and their fans were very touching, I was tearing up every other minute. Hearing of how people in the industry respect the group so much makes me so proud of how far they've come from busking in the streets since their debut to going on an arena tour to see as many of their fans as they can. I would definitely watch a documentary about their growth from trainees to now.",False

1,7,Worth a Watch -- Dancers Draw You In,labcbaker,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not into dance myself, but quickly found myself drawn into the angst of young people pursuing their dreams at Brent School Academy. I particular found myself rooting for the student whose body shape and lack of sexiness runs counter to the stereotype. My greatest takeaway from the inside look was simply how athletic these folks are. I love sports and without question dance is a team sport like basketball where you are part of a team in a routine but can shine as an individual. So why was my grade only a 7? Well, first I found these performers were often performing for the ""documentary"" camera saying things and behaving in ways to help their potential careers. I also felt the show created false dramas following illness and injuries where which the athletes miraculously overcome in order to perform when the curtain goes up. Also the ""Grad"" stuff becomes larger than life at the end as though their futures all hinge on one last dance. It seemed to me the hysteria was no more than any other high school graduation ritual where emotions are all over the place. Only 8 agents will attend so how much career advancement will these kids get? And furthermore, how many career opportunities for dancers really exist. None of this is remotely explored in the show.",False
2,9,This was a revelation!!,amxstphx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show really showed just how hard dance is! As someone who wants to go and do dance professionally in the future I found it very motivating to keep going and to push harder. I loved following the different dancers around and seeing parts of their home lives, yet how we saw all their work behind their productions and showing just how much goes into their shows. Personally Max O was my favourite to watch, he just really gave something different that I hadn't ever seen before on stage or in the studio. I liked how it wasn't scripted or over dramatised like other dance reality tv shows. The best part was realising that it was filmed at Brent street as I've followed them for so long and love their work it was great to see what it was like to go there! The only thing I could ask for more from it was to see the other gradings and follow maybe two more cast members around. I would have love to have seen and learnt more about Brooke and Georgia.",False
3,9,Comes Full Circle,SusanLervold,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a fan of dance, nor am I a dancer myself, but who DOESN'T want to watch a group of beautiful, talented, lithe, outsider-types find something they excel at doing and go on to develop their lifelong passion to perform?The relationships between the students, and the relationships between the students and their teachers seem genuine, without much personal drama, or emotional/competitive manipulation. While perhaps due to good editing (but perhaps the school was portrayed accurately-and I hope it was), I was impressed by the sheer investment all of the teachers and choreographers put into making their young students, both collectively and individually. There was nothing ""groomy"", pervy, or skeevy between the adults and the kids that was caught on film...I hope what the audience saw was how it actually is at that school. It seems like they have found a magical formula!Compelling topic, everyone seemed like they wanted to be there; there wasn't any low key bullying, and there was ZERO abuse (pushing young students too hard, yelling, insulting, cursing at, threats, etc.).Great and interesting documentary-loved it.",False
4,10,Those Aussies sure know how to do things right!!,pilarsings,n/a,16/08/2025,"I totally enjoyed this doc/reality series. So impressed with the school, the instructors, the kids and the camera work. It's not easy filming movement like they had with such intense choreography. And that was some special creative stuff. I was a professional dancer in the 70's, danced in musicals, operas, showcases, ballets, and it has developed to where dancers now have to know gymnastics, a plethora of styles and keep physically and emotionally healthy. I also noticed they weren't so picky with body types, they nurtured anyone who was willing to work really hard and dance well. God bless these kids and I hope they enjoy your time in the spotlight, it goes by really fast!",False
5,10,A Dance Lovers Dream,bree_murphy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Any past or current dancers can relate and appreciate the effort and passion these young dancers have and show during their dance training and performances. Love watching the ups and downs and progress of dancers and this series was a perfect display of this.Would love it even more if the full performances were shown but then I guess these episodes would've gone on for way too long.Hearing from the dancers, dance teachers and parents was a highlight and very well directed.You feel connected to the artists event more so than just watching their dancing.Hopefully more seasons to come, perhaps even a where are they now in the future.",False
6,10,Finally a fantastic reality show with real characters,angelarichardson-44685,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dance Life. A brand new Australian reality /doco style tv show about the intense world of competitive dance. Absolutely incredible! Highly recommend!! All young people should watch this. Really showcases hard work, dedication, commitment, self discovery and self acceptance. Fantastic messages and really genuine characters. My favorites are Emily, Max O and Tiana. Hopefully big careers ahead for these truly talented individuals. Such a refreshing watch in the reality television genre not to see scripted trashy drama. This felt real and raw. And the choreography is some of the best dance I have ever seen. Very impressive Australia.",False
7,10,The best reality dance series I've ever seen!,handavies,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show had me gripped from the first 3 minutes. The dance and the storytelling is dramatic and emotional and above all, real. You follow each character and develop a connection to all of them. You join them on their journey to becoming professional dancers. It shows the work, the highs, the lows and the opportunities the dancers experience and ends in an eye watering, breath-taking final performance, which only left me wanting more! The editing gives you a feel good factor you can't ignore and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a refreshing authentic reality series that shows empathy and non-judgmental observation of young people who are extremely talented but also human beings who are trying to make it into the world as young adults. More please!!!",False
8,10,"Brilliant, character-driven, visually spectacular documentary story-telling!",mickelliott-17030,n/a,16/08/2025,"DANCE LIFE is a masterclass in immersive, observational filmmaking. It follows a group of aspiring young dancers at Sydney's elite 'Brent Street' dance school as they navigate the physical, mental and emotional demands of their graduation year.The dancing is spectacular, but it is the intimate, unguarded moments behind the scenes where as we get to know and care about the students and their teachers.It is raw, startling and gut wrenching at times, but never feels exploitative or manipulative. The filmmakers sensitively peel back the layers on the lives of the main characters, revealing the utter dedication and commitment that they have to achieving their dreams.This is joyous, life-affirming documentary storytelling at its very best.",False
9,10,Phenomenal and thrilling documentary/reality series,antinparis,n/a,16/08/2025,"This beautiful and skillfully-directed docu-series that follows a group of young dancers from one of Australia's premier dance schools is nothing short of exceptional. It is a thrilling and exhilarating insight into the world of these super talented and dedicated young individuals, their hopes, dreams, trials and tribulations. Expertly directed, produced and edited, it makes for exciting and heartfelt viewing. You can't help but fall in love with each of the featured dancers (and one of the main choreographers/teachers, Cassie) in one way or another. I was awe-struck and filled with nothing but admiration and emotion for these gifted people and their perseverance, passion and commitment to their art. Simply breathtaking. Highly recommend.",False
10,10,"Real, raw and surprising - you will fall in love with the cast!",annatdoran,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series was a nice surprise - so much more than than a doco about, or for dancers (I am not a dancer!). The series follows the journey of a group of 18/19 year olds as they chase their dreams, and delves into the myriad of challenges faced by young adults as they find their way in life. It's a rare behind the scenes looks into a world I didn't understand, and you'll fall in love with the cast and find yourself rooting for them all to succeed. I found myself engrossed and binged in one night with my partner and 13 year old daughter, who also both enjoyed. It's raw and real, and a nice deviation form the over the top reality shows on TV today.",False
11,n/a,"Must watch, refreshing storytelling and slick production",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I finished all 5 episodes of Dance Life.Wow !! Refreshing !, right from the opening frames of the first episode I was held captive. The production is so slick and seamless and the story flows effectively and effortlessly and is portrayed with an authentic and raw honesty which took me back to gruelling days of dance school myself. The entire season is like a beautifully choreographed performance in its own right , uplifting and inspiring viewing. What can I say, graceful, humble and memorable story telling at its best , truly enjoyable watching each episode unfolding before my eyes. Not just the story either the whole thing, production, filming everything... amazing !! You really all involved should be most proud of yourselves. Well done man 👍👍. Anything this production team does I'll be tuning into now, past , present and future. .",False
12,5,Dancing was fantastic. The dancers not so much,JayhawkJuJu,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe formula has been established. You can't make these types of documentaries work without focusing on the people so that's what this did. The dancing was fantastic. I don't know anything about dancing but I thought they all looked professional (movie or Broadway ready) and I'd be happy to hire any of them.The problem was that the dancers weren't all that interesting or mature as people, and so I didn't care about them. Very stereotypical: the beautiful one who wants to be seen for more than her looks, the insecure gender-fluid one, the bullied late-bloomer, the brash, straight-forward one, the moody guy(s), the I-want-fame-at-all-costs one, the one with a tough upbringing...I did find Emily more interesting than the others. I wish her luck...The formula needs adjustment as I wanted more. Yes you can be the best dancer in the world, but the viewers need more character development from the dancers. And I didn't see much progression (yes in the dancing but not much in terms of their development into well-rounded people).The interviews didn't exactly portray them in a good light. More like needy--and many times--narcissistic babies. One boy while crying: ""I know I like need to be better and like engage more with like the people around me but I like just don't know how to like do that?"" Or Archer: ""someone like looked at me like funny on the like subway and now I'm like feeling down."" I heard 'Like"" so many times, I almost didn't make it through all 5 episodes. Like OMG, for sure.Cassie was indeed brilliant, but at one point they mentioned she was getting married. Yet she said something like her focus was 100% on her career. Well what happens when her husband starts to resent her international demanding career that requires travel and probably 60-80 hrs a week in town? Yet no one was raising any questions. I wish her luck in her marriage, but I worry about her perspective.There was one girl who talked about using her talent as a vehicle for running some sort of business. I thought she was the smartest one of the bunch, as the reality of professional entertainment and sports careers are brutal:-NFL: The avg QB career is 3 years. The avg WR career is 2 years. The average OL career is 3.5 years.-NBA: avg 5-6 years.-Broadway Dancer: avg wage of $34/hr or $70K/year. Try living on that in NYC.-Hollywood Actor: avg pay of $51K in LA (2021)And these are the top 1/2% of all athletes/actors/dancers because they have a career at all. But the famous Britney Spears choreographer lectured her implying that she wasn't dedicated enough. On the other hand, does the dance company implicitly (or explicitly) applaud Arabella for neglecting her academics; she has a spinal tumor that needs to be fixed, but if she does, it means she won't dance again. What will she do when her body gives out, as I'm sure it will? When she had a stress fracture at one point, she just popped a pain pill. (YIKES!! Was it a narcotic?) It was implied that she had nothing more than a high school diploma...and mediocre grades at that. I felt bad for her being encouraged (by someone-not sure who?) to put her eggs in one basket while knowing that that basket will fail sooner than later.Episode 4 was supposed to feature the dancers yet it was boring as hell, and I fast-forwarded through most of the second half...blah blah blah, they're stressed and nervous. It means everything. Agents will be there. I'm sure I didn't miss anything...I hadn't heard anything revolutionary up to that point anyway.I just felt like it could be much more inspiring but missed the mark.",True
13,10,So emotional,annamidlane,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this show, it gets you right in the gut and that is down to the dancers and Cassie the teacher. All of the students are lovely and special shout out to Max O who is just a phenomenal talent.But fave has to be Emily, inspiring what she has been through and her vulnerability just shone through as well as her incredible talent.All of the dancers show just how much hard work, dedication, commitment and sheer tenacity is needed. Also loved Tiana who was another dancer who went through a traumatic school experience and shone like a star.Loved this show, I sincerely hope there is a follow up show.",False
14,10,Incredibly moving - not JUST 'a show about dance',chelseaovijach,n/a,16/08/2025,"The way that this show highlights the Australian dance landscape and showcases the incredible entertainment industry that we're a part of... proving that our generation has just as much tenacity & grit as any other, and offering a peek behind the curtain into an industry that is often under appreciated and overlooked, is amazing.But, it also goes so much deeper than that. It's not just 'a show about dance'. The overarching story uses dance as a vehicle to address topics that might otherwise be swept under the rug. It gives parents a way to foster real conversations with their little ones about difficult issues, ones that might have previously been avoided or tossed into the 'too hard' basket. It gives hope to people who may be in the midst of a turbulent adolescence or family life, knowing that they aren't alone and that they can make it through to the other side. It even has the power to challenge societal norms, igniting real change through the very real & raw portrayal of these dancers' lived experiences.There are not many shows quite like this. Dance Life stands out by seamlessly delivering humour, lightheartedness and memorable characters while fearlessly spotlighting crucial and sensitive issues like bullying, gender and body dysmorphia, belonging, rejection, sexuality, privilege, and the universal yearning to 'be seen.'I've watched it all the way through about 4 times now and I've recommended it to everybody I know. Absolutely brilliant!",False
15,10,Damn These Dancers Slay,hamanda-58841,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found out about this studio one night when I fell down a YouTube rabbit whole, and damn y'all are such amazing talents. Now, because of this show we get to see how grounded and supportive of one another you all are. It was quite refreshing. This really was a treat to watch, and hopefully the exposer from this show allows these dancers to fulfill all of their wildest dreams, not that they needed it. I hope we get to see more of them performing in America in the future.Goto to YouTube and check out the piece they did called ""Somebody That I Use to Know."" AMAZING! The featured girl dancer Tiana killed it and she did this one flip or jump that I went back and watched a million times. I had to show my mom and my sisters, probably some coworkers. It really was spectacular!",False
16,10,"Amazing, Exciting, Inspiring Real Life Dance Series!",hjhfpvwz,n/a,16/08/2025,Absolutely loved this show. It's great to see Australian Dance back on t.v. A real life documentary series. It has inspired so many dancers out there. Our studio had a workshop with the cast and it was totally inspiring and encouraging! The students thoroughly enjoyed meeting these amazing dancers and it really encouraged them. Some of them have never done a workshop before and they walked out of the studio 10 ft tall. They absolutely had a ball and it really was an absolute highlight to these children. Thank you this amazing show and opportunity to have the workshop. We are all hoping for another series very soon. !! Congratulations to everyone and also a big thank you for bring us all joy!,False
17,10,Amazingggg!!!!,sofiamarciano,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dance life is such an amazing show and really gives you a better perspective at the real life of full time dancing. All the dancers are just incredible and such role models. I absolutely love how it shows all the good, bad and difficult moments that really go on in the dance industry.Not only do you get to find out more about the dancers themselves but the choreographers as well, and what they are looking for in a dancer. All the teachers are just amazing and really know how to put together a routine that will be remembered and admired. They know how to train all the dancers and push them to be the best they can be. I would 100% recommend watching this show!!!!",False
18,10,A Must Watch,rebecca_whitley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where to start ! We've watched this twice now ... We are a house of non dancers who LOVED LOVED LOVED this series.Wow, following the dancers we were struck by the effort, passion and drive these young people delivered, not to mention their SKILLS. We were blown away by the effort and passion they all put into this passion, which puts their bodies on the line and offers no guarantees, or very few, paying commercial opportunities after all the effort!!!!Each of the focus dancers bought great insight into their characters and personalities which was extremely entertaining.I can't wait to see these dancers take the world by storm.An amazing series to watch!!!Highly Recommend !!!",False
19,10,Watched it twice in two days!,dcmpjchh,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a performer, teacher and aspiring choreographer I cannot explain just how inspiring I found this series. There is nowhere near enough focus on dance in mainstream media or enough insight into the reality of our training and dedication and it was so refreshing to see something that isn't focused on dressing room drama or scripted reality and just focuses on dance as an art form. The production team, Brent Street studios and everyone involved/featured should be incredibly proud of what they have created & as for Cassie Bartho - your creations are nothing short of phenomenal and I want to work with you!",False
20,5,It's cute,AK1475,n/a,16/08/2025,"Definitely for teenage audiences. I don't know how does things go in Australia but that's dancing only if u want to be in musicals or concerts. Professional dance needs a pure and solid ballet technique and what they have been showing in this program is definitely not. Most of the youngsters doesn't have it or maybe it's really totally different down under.Sam & Sam are really talented. Probably the reviews is from people who doesn't understand professional dancing and it's ok but if you go the another channel you can see how it's look like in the us. So again, an nice series to enjoy when it's raining outside but definitely not hard core Dace doc.",False
21,10,Just a great show!,alma678,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love dance, this show is for you! This show documents a years cycle of one of Australia's best dance schools. There was great pacing across the episodes, it really didn't feel like there was any filler, just excellent content.Fantastic choice of dancers to profile but the profiles didn't takeover the documentary itself. No one dancer took too much airtime and the show just flowed well throughout.Really left me wanting more! Perhaps the next series could feature some of the dancers as they move beyond the school and into the world of work, shadowing them as they go out on auditions etc.",False
22,10,This needs a season 2!!!,pxnwwhrj,n/a,16/08/2025,"An absolutely amazing show! Left me on the edge of my seat the whole time!Such talented dancers and so well produced! It's incredible to see insight into full time dance, especially at Brent Street.The choreography, music, videography and editing is second to none. I love how all the cast were portrayed and how we got to see into their lives too.It was very inspiring to see young dancers living out their dreams and working so hard for their passion.Congratulations to everyone involved in the making of Dance Life! You are all absolutely incredible!!!Can't wait for the next season!!!!!",False
23,10,Inspiring. A dance series that changes lives.,lisakilleen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you Jade for your vision and your creation.What you have given not only the dance community but the world is nothing short of inspiring.By introducing these talented dancers into our homes, and into our lives, you have sparked a movement that has inspired and influenced countless young dancers to go after their own dreams, their own goals and to push themselves further in their own pursuits of a life in the dance and entertainment industry.Make no mistake, this series has changed lives.You have certainly changed my daughter's life.After meeting these wonderful young adults and the outstanding choreographers in the show, my daughter has found a courage of her own and the ambition to follow her biggest dreams.Words can not describe the joy and pride I have in seeing my daughter finally begin to believe in herself, and it's thanks to you and the wonderful young cast that shared some of their most vulnerable moments in this series.Each episode is REAL and showcases the grit, determination and complete dedication that is needed in excel in this competitive industry.As the dance Mum, I am beyond grateful.",False

I really loved max ostlers abilities and arabellas enthusiasm, conor being so chill at all times and max simmons talent, erin's work ethic, kim was just stunning, archer was gorgeous and incredibly talented, tiana had amazing skills and tom was just so lovely, emily had an amazing story and they all showed how much they wanted what they were amazingly able to achieve. After meeting 4 cast members i was able to learn some amazing skills that all of the talented performers were able to share and could not recommend this show higher.",False
25,10,Best Dance Show to hit Tv in YEARS!!!,donaldsonpoppy,n/a,16/08/2025,This is the show everyone needed!It's got the perfect story line of hard work and dedication mixed with some of the most talented dancers I've ever witnessed!!There needs a season 2 ASAP!!! We are all waiting for it!You couldn't have picked a better cast in season 1 I can't wait to see the cast in season 2.The quality of filming and editing is impeccable and this is a true representation of full time dance at Brent St. The production team have gone above and beyond to showcase a raw yet entertaining year in the life.This show isn't just for dancers anyone who enjoys a great display of hard work and athleticism will love this show.,False

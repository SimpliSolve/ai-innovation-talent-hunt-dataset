1,1,Battling Racism Through Insufferable Bullying,kyra_hemsworth,n/a,16/08/2025,"(Review assumes you know premise - this is a filmed dinner party - or have watched this doc).Saira Rao is a bully. Her aggression is repellent, suffocating and risibly self righteous; yet, she's ostensibly offering important enlightenment for ignorant humanity. Nope.She visibly gets off on hurting and humiliating people. And, apparently, white women are paying to be her target because she promises to *checks notes* ""smash your white fragility""? Seriously?The objectives envisioned by Rao and her co-creator, Regina Jackson, of ""Race2Dinner"" are unattainable, largely due to their being so vague. One objective appears to be to ""talk to people"".... I think...but, Rao detests anyone else talking. She'd prefer, as with a communist re-education camp, to stuff her opinions down your throat and have you parrot them back. No fuss, no muss, here's your script; so, conversion, not conversation.Their utopian vision is used as a cudgel to beat women they obviously, what...hate? Envy? Want to exploit? The zeal to kick these ladies' asses is so palpable, what good is supposed to come of this? Rao just bullies, Regina just complains, everyone else is shut down, disrespected and humiliated. The dinner guests are fire-hosed with blame, but aren't allowed a word of defence. How can this farce help with healing wounds or serious problems like voting rights and police brutality?I guarantee, most of the dinner guests will be ""having conversations"" about how obtuse and repugnant the hosts were, and that's it! I know, I know, the participants aren't allowed any human reaction because it's not about them. But, obliterating their humanity makes this formula so inherently dysfunctional that it's ultimately useless.In one of the most surreal segments, Rao shames the participants for feeling emotion over stories of racial injustice and tells them they can't have such reactions in the future. If I'd been in attendance, that would've been my ""eff you very much, I don't have time for this gong show....um, can I get this to go?"" moment.Rao and Jackson don't want a world where our shared humanity is encouraged and cherished; they want a world of revenge and verbal face punching. They're too angry, censoring and (after reading more on Race2Dinner) avaricious to really want healing change, maybe cha-ching change - are they aiming for a reality show?Of the eight women who participated, only three agreed to a follow up interview. The three who responded just virtue-signalled themselves into a meaningless caricature. What does that tell you? FAIL!If one really wants to change hearts and minds, kindness and respect always win the day. But, Rao and Jackson are getting something out of feeding the fires of hate and anger, and that's on them. Again, their calculation might be the mercenary ""enragement leads to engagement"", or, they're just bullies. Because what they're doing isn't helping and I can't believe they don't know it.I pray their scheme doesn't last. These shallow, self-interested posers can't be forgotten soon enough.",False
2,1,Grifters grifting the stupid,krasskova,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe white women are the problem. After all, way too many of them seem to be ready, willing, and able to fall for this BS obvious grifting, Is it really all about self-abasement and the virtue signal? Jesus Christ. Rao and her friend come off as repellent bullies. While whining and moaning about their oppression (come on. They live better than the majority of middle America. Oh how oppressed they are. *sarcasm*) they are purposely haranguing the women in their dinners who disagree or question.My biggest question is why would women pay to go through this humiliation ritual. They're already mostly democrats. Isn't that humiliation enough?Seriously though, Rao is asking that white women spit on their ancestors. Hell should freeze over first. Regardless of from whence one comes, one should never, ever spit on their ancestors. Maybe they should stop thinking of themselves as ""white"" and start thinking of themselves as of ""English,"" ""German,"" ""Scottish,"" ""Czech,"" etc. Descent.Or, maybe they should get a man to moderate this because women obviously can't handle this on their own. They all came across as a bunch of ...well I can't say that word in a review here. But rhymes with witch.I will say this, I love to see how much grifting this race baiting nonsense has birthed. BLM, etc. You can't blame people for taking advantage of stupid. That's the real lesson here.",False
3,1,Terrifble show that just creates more negativity,nielsenpete,n/a,16/08/2025,Two women that are trying to make things worse. No kindness is given in the way they speak to others. Women are trying to be respectful and understand what they say but instead of listening the two are just creating more trouble.Definitely worth passing on this show. Not helpful at all.Everything with this documentary is wrong. Going the wrong way in using the approach they did in this show.Replace Saira with someone that listens and isn't being a bully or being on the attack so much.This show has nothing positive from it it. Its just more arguing. If you like negative drama then its for you.,False
4,1,Can't even take it seriously,jdthird,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is just more of the same. I get the concept, but the execution was flawed in pretty much every way possible.Start with the premise that the way to win anyone over to your viewpoint is to be a, well, insert your favorite four letter word here for a woman acting poorly.One of the fastest ways to determine the worth of a human being, to me, is to witness their interactions with others. And, of course, in this example, that shows just what you are truly dealing with here.It's funny how so often, people trying to accuse others of something really simply end up showing how THEY themselves are the ones really exemplifying the very thing they're trying to denounce in others.There are SO many better ways to spend your time than watching this...",False
5,8,"If you think it's bad, you might be part of the problem.",alexissanderlin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I checked out some reviews prior to watching this film and due to the ratings, my expectations were fairly low. However, after watching the film, in my opinion, a lot of the negative reviews are fairly similar to the responses of the women at the beginning of the dinner. Defensive, poor me, victim mentality. I do agree that Saira and Regina come off as direct and blunt, but in my opinion that is a key point to the film that adds a sense of urgency and seriousness to the dinner that may otherwise have been missed. Part of deconstructing Karen is to eliminate the need to be ""nice"" and sugar coat statements and hard truths. Which I believe Regina and Saira accomplish successfully. Another point these two are trying to make is that they do not owe it to white women to ""be nice"" while people of color have not been treated ""nicely"" for hundreds of years. To say Saira is a bully for being upfront and direct while communicating with the women at the dinner table (not to mention continuously repeating herself for those choosing not to hear her), sure is an interesting take. Unfortunately I think some of the dinner attendees in this film, along with many of the 1/10 star raters, are proof that this country has a long way to go when it comes to listening and ending white privilege and fragility. If this film has upset you to the point you go out of your way to leave a review telling others not to watch. If all you can think about is how badly this film personally offended you. If you find yourself subconsciously defending the white women at the dinner table. If you have no take-aways other than the blame you have placed on Saira and Regina for somehow making things worse. It may be a great idea for you you to challenge yourself, change your mindset, and watch this film again.",False
6,1,"A spectacle of American, white guilt fetish",santiagokozera,n/a,16/08/2025,"Out of all violent American movies, this is probably the most so. I can see what may have drove people who made it, they are so far invested into their preffered world view that they could not look past the tips of their structurally oppressed noses to save their lives Somehow they have secured funds to produce and retail this piece of hateful fiction, And you know what, more power to them. I think that stuff like this should be made if for no other reason than to brin Critical Race Theroy to the masses.I cannot however understand how could anyone else enjoy, or learn from watching this attrocity. Furthermore, I am 80% sure that most of this picture qualifies as hate speach in most of Europe.0/10 would not recommend to a friend.",False
7,10,"""It's white women's niceness that is killing us all.""",deeannah,n/a,16/08/2025,"Should be required viewing for all white people, not just women. I would love it if the people who gave this movie one star could sit in on one of these dinners and actually listen and participate. It's easy to label something and walk away, but what we all need to do right now as white people is ask ourselves a question featured in this film, and I'm paraphrasing: why is your discomfort with discussing racism more important than the actual lived experiences of the people affected by racism? Sit with those feelings and honestly ask yourself why you are so uncomfortable hearing about racism from two women of color.",False
8,1,This is was filmed and produced with the money appropriated from Canadian Tax payers,macisaac_44,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't believe anyone of value would ever use a service called Race2Dinner. The women they chose to target with they're circular logic; if they bought into it, couldn't be white supremists or uphold it since under white supremacy they would have been euthanized.The cherry picking of viral videos they show are just that cherry picked. You could find endless sheets of videos to supoort any racist stereotype. Sadly no one with the tax payer funding would ever be supported by a modern civilized governemnt, but this is.I hope anyone who watches this and enjoyed it the best. I'm so sorry.*600.",True
9,10,"Difficult, but necessary lessons",graceday-61143,n/a,16/08/2025,"We as white women must continue to learn how we still benefit from and uphold a systemically racist system. This movie, similar to Rao and Jackson's book, filled me with many different emotions. It was hard, and it should be hard.While this movie may ruffle some feathers, I think we need that to happen. I and other white women must contend with the fact that, whether we're aware of it or not, we still uphold racism. We must learn how to deconstruct the racist views, ideas, and beliefs within ourselves before we can begin to do the same within our communities.A must-watch for all white people, but especially white women, who want to continue their learning.",False
10,10,Truth hurts,kayandsteven,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no idea why people don't want to learn or be educated on things they don't understand. This documentary merely points out the white privileged and where so many of us can't comprehend how and what it's like for Black and Brown people to live in their skins.I believe so many people have low ratings because they are threatened and probably never even watched it.I strongly suggest everyone watch it. Yes it's uncomfortable but what have you got to lose? Learning something about our fellow man is going to help everyone in the long run
This is an incredible documentary, she's really put it out there for us to see. The good the bad and the ugly truth.",False
11,10,Educational and thought-provoking. Highly recommend!,maryamskhan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm disappointed but not surprised by some of the negative reviews on this piece. I'm so glad I got to watch this.Regina and Saira use this film not to discuss the history of racism, but focus more so on the understanding of institutional racism, and how the power of white women is currently (for the most part) upholding white supremacy. On the flip side, it also touches on the transformational positive power that white women can hold once they begin to genuinely understand the lived experience of marginalized people. It is fascinating and barely scratches the surface - it's a harsh starting point, but a necessary eye opener.This movie (and quite a few reviews I've come across) is a great example of how society will often prioritize politeness over the reality of oppression. Being cluelessly racist is okay, but calling it out is ""rude"". Policing reactive tones rather than the initial cause. Really interesting, highly recommend!",False
12,10,Being Self Aware,hollybrizendine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie makes you feel compelled to be more self aware and how your actions can negatively impact those around you. It is important that these people do not get marginalized because of conditioning that has been generations in the making. When you think about it white culture tends to bulldoze its way in the culture of others and we twist and warp it until it goes away, shuts up, and assimilates to us to suit our own sensibilities. I think these ladies are just trying to make the world more aware of how their cultures are hurt and disregarded while the dominating race plays victim anytime they speak up. It's cruel and the truth is hard.",False
13,10,much needed,bwjnbxb,n/a,16/08/2025,"If every white women in my life watched this, I bet they would realize a lot of their unconscious biases and understand why BIPOC don't trust white people. As a South Asian, I loved how Saira acknowledged that we are trained to hold biases and racist beliefs against Black people, whether that is due to colourism or texturism, or upholding the ""model minority"" myth. I urge everyone to watch this documentary and realize how deep these systems of oppression go.I also feel that this is such a timely documentary especially with all the hate against marginalized groups right now that continues to grow. As a Muslim, I felt like I was deeply unsupported by my white friends and family members, who rarely checked in during or after the Trump presidency or any instances of hate crimes against Muslims or immigrants. People I work with don't ever stop and think how the news may affect my productivity or ability to meet a deadline, when people like me are being killed or told to ""go back to where you come from"". It is a constant struggle and I wish this documentary was a common piece of media that white woman consumed, especially those who claim to be allies.",False
14,10,Every white women needs to watch this,vivyau,n/a,16/08/2025,"It wasn't surprising to me to see 1 star reviews which I can only assume are from other white women.This is a confronting and challenging watch, and it's one that's most needed. It ticks every sick fantasy i have around discussing racism with white women, but one I'd be way too afraid to do.But firstly, I admire Saira and Regina for putting themselves in dangerous positions in order to educate white women. You see their joy on screen which was so lovely to witness - their whole multi-faceted selves, not just activists but women with real feelings, vulnerability and courage - this sisterhood is probably what I enjoyed watching the most (aside from screaming at the TV from the white women's responses).The comments around colour blindness, love is love etc. From most participants weren't surprising yet disappointing, something I think a lot of women and people of colour will recognise within their own social circles. I would tell poc to move gently with this as it could bring up some familiar feelings.I wish the documentary could've been longer, and I hope to see them continue more Race2Dinner events.",False
15,n/a,Teach me - don't scold me,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was so excited to watch this movie as I am always looking for ways to be less racist, less prejudiced, learn about other cultures and become a better human being. However, I found that the movie didn't so much provide an opportunity for open conversations as it gave a platform for scolding white women for being racist. Yes, white women have a lot to learn, but this movie could have encouraged them to ask more questions and become more aware of their privilege, not simply scolded them for living in the only realities they've ever known. Change happens when people can truly see each other - it doesn't happen by simply telling a whole group of individuals that they are bad.",False
16,10,An honest discussion on anti-racism,hvfxv,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOne of the best statements made in this film from one of the hosts to a white woman is, ""why are your feelings more important than the violence of our lives?"" That line epitomizes white privilege and the essence of anti-racism education. It is the quiet part said out loud. It exposes the nuance of our supremacist culture, which privileges white over everyone else while also demonstrating the anti-blackness embedded in our societal system. This film does an impeccable job of pointing out those nuances, and crystallizing how they are upheld by liberal white women in an attempt to distance themselves from blatantly racist conservative white women. MUST WATCH FOR ALL.",True
17,10,Awesome Documentary,krockkrh,n/a,16/08/2025,"A look into the learn, unknown basis. Awesome truths unveiled and an eye opening awaken of white privilege. Truths starts with uncovering the facts, unearthing the secrets within. This movies examines the basis in day to day situational occurrences that many white women are either turning a blind eye or just unaware. Which validates the documentaries premise! If we uncovered all the truths behind those things that keep up separate it would only bring those with overstanding to a new found respect and situational awareness to living in American and the impossible shift that is inevitable! TRUETH.",False
18,10,Critical viewing for all white women,kate-atkins-89,n/a,16/08/2025,"The reviewers here claiming this is ""abusive"" or ""bullying"" or ""violent"" really REALLY need to get a grip. Try and see what actual violence is and see how vile the comparisons to this really are.This film and the reactions to it are such an example of the dangers of white women, more so often, liberal white women who can't see their own racism.I was one of those women until I was called out and it transformed me. If you are uncomfortable then you're moving in the right direction. And if you just give up and let these incredible, generous women of colour, show you the way, you'll find a new power and a new path.The two women of colour who feature in this doc are so full of grace to extend such a hand to women who are often much more interested in maintaining their delusion than actually WORKING. It's amazing. It's moving and it should be required viewing.",False
19,8,Factual examination of racism in America,kimshropshire,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone who is not a person of color benefits from America's institutions. No one blames you. There is no shame in admitting this. This documentary challenges our willingness to accept that truth and then examine how we can unlearn what we think is true about ""the others."" The privilege that comes with not believing what huge swathes of Americans are telling you is true is astounding. The documentary takes on several issues that could be episodes within themselves - historical race-based trauma, white fragility, the silence of liberals/progressives - which makes it feel rushed. I am thankful that at least the conversation is happening. Kudos to these ladies for taking on this work. It's a heavy lift - threats on their lives notwithstanding.",False
20,10,The one star reviews appear to have missed the point,vanyaipc,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie tells difficult truths through unfiltered, assertive dialogue. I am curious about so many 1 star reviews. Emotions are information. If I feel defensive or offended it is my job to stop and take a look at the what and why of what I am defending. I hope those who gave it one star watch it as many times as necessary to work through their emotional triggers in order to hear what is being said. Are American people so fragile that we can no longer tolerate words? This is a must watch if you consider yourself an ally to racialized people. Watch it and then watch it again. White fragility is another must read.",False
21,10,"Necessary, challenging, and extremely informative",alice_gabb,n/a,16/08/2025,"An honest and constructive breakdown of harmful behaviour from white women, both through discussion of lived experience, and helpful examples from history to help illustrate the depth of these patterns of behaviour.I am a white woman and I found this extremely informative and will be encouraging all my white friends and relatives to watch it. A really deep discussion into white supremacy that challenges my own world view and my own complicity in these power structures.It might not be comfortable viewing for some (reflected in some of these reviews!), but it is very worth a watch! I'm giving it a full 10/10.",False
22,10,"If you are uncomfortable by this movie, you need to REWATCH",src-82831,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is no growth without pain and this documentary brings the whole entire raw truth to the decorated front porches of white women. The upfront approach is meant to be as blunt as the racism felt by the women attempting to educate the women whom they bring to their table. As you could have expected, and as evidenced in some of the reviews you find online, not all white women are ready for this hefty helping of truth. Seems they care more for their reputation than the lives of BIPOC. If you.had a problem with the truth in this documentary, you need to rewatch it, and then read the books written by the women heading this initiative.",False
23,10,Important film,synnevew,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's telling how many of these reviews mistake honesty for aggression. This is an urgent film and topic. Emotional discomfort is different from being in real, physical danger, which is what happens to Black and brown people every single day because of white supremacy. This documentary is well paced, and offers many moments for self reflection.If your feelings are hurt by this, you're centering yourself. We can reevaluate our own behavior and change so that the world is safer for everyone, truly. Real love in action is honest, unflinching, and requires work and sacrifice.Thank you, Saira and Regina!",False
24,10,Very welcome done.,divinem-96488,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a tough conversation to have for many, but it's very much necessary. For those of you calling it bullying, you are part of the problem. Nothing about someone making themselves vulnerable enough and sharing their experiences of racism is easy. The want from white of ""politeness"" ""niceness"" in these conversations, in itself is white supremacy. It should be an easy pill to swallow. People are dying because we're putting more emphasis on the niceness of the delivery, than the message itself. If you watched this and felt bullied, you wouldn't last a day in the life of a POC dealing with racism. And again, you are the problem. Instead of being on the defense, like Saira said, sit with that uncomfortable feeling until it's no longer uncomfortable - because that's where you store that racism. Great job ladies!",False
25,10,It's MADE to make you think!,inariibels,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazingly good and wonderfully thought provoking. If someone is reviewing this with utter hate, then it's someone who dislikes how uncomfortable it made them feel ... take the bad reviews with a grain of salt :DThis was made and filmed specifically to make you think, to force us all to take deeper and harder looks at ourselves. There are many, MANY, people talking about how negative or horrible this is. But before you take those reviews to heart, you have to ask yourselves if perhaps THEY are the Karens. Are they harboring racism in themselves and unable to admit it? Are they upset that this movie called them out? Are they angry that the hosts tell it point blank like it is, and it makes them feel the need to get up and leave the room?This is all about point blank honesty, with all it's raw and very exposed nerves right there at the surface where it's going to hurt. And it's worth watching.",False

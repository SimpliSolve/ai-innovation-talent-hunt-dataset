1,8,Well done documentary,mjanssens26,n/a,17/08/2025,"This Tubi exclusive documentary takes a deeper dive into the brutal crimes of Chris Watts. Though we all know the outcome, the story is still fascinating albeit horrific. I still find it shocking that such an attractive young mom and her lovely children ended up victims of this monster. The documentary rehashes much of what we've seen but also explores the topics of psychopathy and narcissism. Overall, an interesting film.",False
2,8,Monster!,richwithhatred,n/a,17/08/2025,"I found this to be far better than the Netflix documentary on this guy. Far more detailed and investigative. I think if you are a fan of crime documentaries, you will enjoy this.",False
3,9,IT WAS IN HOS EYES ALL ALONG,debejere,n/a,17/08/2025,"There are no words to describe the horror of this show. It makes me just sick to think he will have a pen, paper, tv, and education and the list doesn't stop with what will be afforded to him in prison. Evil in it's pyrest form.",False
4,1,Amateurishly made,toastrco,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have seen the other documentary on this case, but I decided to watch this one as well.Right away, at the start, they reveal it all. It was like a spoiler right at the beginning where they told you exactly what happened and who did it.Most of the ""experts"" in the documentary provide commentary like emotional teens would comment on social media. They are judgmental and jump to conclusions. Now, obviously, they already know the outcome, but they should comment on the case as if they wanted to understand it and find out the truth, rather then as if they are writing a fictional story.The psychotherapy expert labels Chris a narcissist, yet throughout the documentary there is no indication that he was one. In fact, he was described as the complete opposite. He wasn't flashy, he didn't like to be in centre of attention, he wasn't manipulative, he was calm and collected, he avoided confrontation and he didn't like that Shannan filmed him and posted him on social media all the time. Yet, here we have this expert just throw that label on him.The FBI expert provided comments that at times sounded like I was listening to an angry mob posting comments on social media. There was no expertise in any of it.It all sounded like the commentary was done to add drama and to rile the viewer up, because we know that planting negative feelings in someone is a good way to keep them hooked. That's what social media has been doing to get people addicted and that's what advertisers on social media do to get you to comment on their posts.The documentary did not seem credible to me.Another thing I thought was off was that the jump cuts were too quick and at times the pace seemed to be much too fast. You didn't even have a chance to absorb something and they're already jumping to a completely different thing.",False
5,1,Took a deeper dive and landed a belly flop,VanBooter,n/a,17/08/2025,"What you will learn by watching this rehashed and regurgitated story about this horrific crime is absolutely nothing. It's just news clips, photo's, interview snippets which have all been seen many times before.What is new is the injection from unknow wannabe's and hasbeen's retelling the same old facts in-between the same old film clips, this alone is a crime against the memory of Shanann and her two daughters Bella and Celeste.Maybe it's because of the lockdown but this trend of scooping stuff off the internet to create a doc and labelling it as 'New' needs to stop, so budding film makers put the mouse down get off your backsides, and get out there and discover that story.",False
6,4,Chris Watts,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerOn August 13, 1988, a pregnant Shannan Watts disappeared along with her two daughters, four-year-old Bella and three-year-old Celeste. Her husband Christopher Watts went on television to plead for their safe return knowing that he had already murdered his wife and dumped her in a shallow grave and jammed his children into an oil tank in the hopes that he could start a new life with his girlfriend.Written by Vince Sherry, this brings in friends, family, reporters and experts to discuss the case. At this point, if you're watching this, you've probably already seen this story on several shows and watched American Murder: The Family Next Door on Netflix. I know I've seen this before and I just listen to these shows while I work on the site because my wife runs the TV and I just try and think about a world not filled with family annihilators. But that said, if you can't get enough true crime, here is this show for you to watch and learn how a family fell apart, how Shanann kept using social media to present a perfect family and how her husband found a really attractive new girl and took her sand surfing.",True

1,6,Good documentary but interview subjects leave out essential material and insights,intltravlr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt first blush, this is a film about the unusual life of an idealistic peace activist from small town Colorado with some skills in the entertainment field that made him employable but not famous in the West, but which made him a household name and instantly-recognizable face behind the Iron Curtain at the height of the Cold War.There is also a hint of a story of a man and his own outsize ego, which was both the drive behind his ambitions and ultimately his downfall, in terms of his suicide not far from his home in East Berlin. But dig a bit deeper, beyond that which is offered in this documentary, and you'll find the real story.Some of this film's interesting scenes offer contrasting views of his death, with Victor Grossman stating that he never doubted that Dean Reed committed suicide, and Reed's firstborn, his cousin, and his musical collaborator claiming that it was a Stasi/KGB/CIA plot - as if Reed was a threat to the United States, the GDR, and/or the Soviet Union that he warranted a planned spy agency killing.Due possibly/probably to Ramona Reed's involvement in this project, this film paints Reed as the ultimate nice guy - who can forget the scene in which he says with his trademark smile that could melt butter that he aimed to ""remain honest"" - ? In reality - as has been well-documented in books and accounts in the (primarily German) press - he was extremely easily hurt when attention shifted away from him, a serial philanderer who never objected to and instead supported efforts around Central and Eastern Europe to paint him as a prominent Hollywood musician/actor. Pushy in the studio, on the set, and at home, Reed never thought twice about leaving his wife and child for whatever cause caught his attention at that particular moment. A diagnosis has not been mentioned, but it appears that he had quite a few of the traits of a narcissist. This is a possible explanation for his suicide (Narcistic Personality Disorder is associated with a greater risk of suicide death).Not to put too fine a point on it, but Reed's death came on the heels of his interview with Mike Wallace on ""60 Minutes,"" which he had hoped would serve as a re-introduction to the American public - and instead was met with wrath in the form of sacks of air mail letters from the United States that made it clear to Reed that he would not be welcomed back home. (And explains why he committed suicide shortly before his daughter's high school graduation, which he had planned traveling to Los Angeles for.)This film also neglects to mention that Reed's own father committed suicide, a glaring omission in light of other factors.Lastly, various sources in Germany have publicly stated in recent years that the fact that Reed's death was a suicide became public only after the fall of the Berlin Wall was because they did not want to hurt his widow, Renate Blume - one of the GDR's most prominent actresses of the period. Also a logical explanation. And a curious omission from the film, which gives the impression that this film wanted to portray this a story as a shadowy intrigue, which is frankly the lazy way to tell it.One can understand the anguish of Reed's family, who truly cherish the memory of their father/cousin. And it is not uncommon for survivors of such conflicted, controversial individuals to want to think the best of them, in spite of their well-earned notorious reputations. At the same time, they do not at all grasp why many Americans considered Reed a traitor of sorts (as borne out by various recent interviews that Ramona Reed has given). It's 2022 and it's kind of amazing that the Reeds don't recognize what about his behavior and many, many outrageous remarks, incongruous comparisons, and questionable associations throughout the years was indefensible - and that it is so obvious, for so many reasons, that he sadly committed suicide.Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is not about someone's right to free speech. By all means, say whatever you want in public; however, it is also the right of others to have - or lose - respect for you, based on that. And this gets to the heart of every single debate about Reed. It was never about his rights, it was about his choices - and his inability to stand by them to the end. And, it seems that his family does not wish to accept that, all these years later.To really understand this character, it's helpful to read the books out there (""Comrade Rockstar"" is but one) and see the documentaries (""American Rebel,"" 1985) first. ""Red Elvis"" does provide insights into his Stasi file, includes interviews with some people such as Neil Jacobs, and gives insights into the ebb and flow of his career in the GDR - none of which have been covered previously (at least, not in this way). Put them all together and you may have some comprehension of what made Reed tick -- but only some as it takes a pretty special person to defend the actions of East Germany, the USSR, and all of the countries of the region when they engaged in the human rights atrocities that Reed seemingly turned a blind eye to. It is an interesting story, if not a very strange one.Also, was there no other possible title for this film other than ""Red Elvis,"" which was already used as the title of a German documentary (2006)? Strange choice (on top of it, Reed stylistically and in some ways ideologically more resembles John Denver than Elvis Presley).",True
2,7,Interesting Documentary,crumpytv,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had never heard of Dean Reed, so this was all new to me.He really is an example where a social conscious, activism and naivety can lead down a very rocky path to an almost inevitable conclusion.If you end up alienated by both sides in the Cold War, where is there left to go?",False
3,7,Why! Just why.,mogensenf,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat to write about a documentary? Perhaps one should just relate to the film, not so much which feelings it releases in you? Hard to say!This is a documentary about the US-American Dan Reed. He was a singer and actor who got a 7 year contract with Capitol Records, and started releasing singles. The first two flopped, but all were looking forward to his third ""Our Summrt Romance"". But nothing happened, WAIT, it became clear that the single became an enormous hit in Chile.Of course Reed used the opportunity and travelled to South America, where he became really big, hence the film titel. Relatively speaking his voice wasn't even close to the quality of Elvis Presley. In South America he saw that living there was indeed not anything like living in Colorado.He started to talk and sing about the poor people where he now lived, recently being married. He was really popular, but his left leaning opinions wasn't well received amongst all, and soon he was terrorised. This made him travelling to The Sovjet Union.Now behind the Iron Curtain, he saw his new meaning of life, telling the people in the East about the words of Lenin, and again of course singing them. Certainly this made him a popular man in the East od Europe, and other communist lead countries. He soon moved to East Berlin, where his wife gave birth to daughter Ramona, whom he gave the middlename of Guevara!As an American in his new homeland, the secret police here, the Stasi, was interested in him. They talked with him, and found out he was quite ready to be an informer for Stasi. That came handy as he was about to travel to Palestine as a guest off the PLO. He became very, very friendly with PLO, and told Stasi that he wasn't keen to tell on them. This was his first problem in the East, and as a matter of fact, this started his downfall.He got married to the Eastgerman actor Renate Blume (who have ro this date acted in 79 films). It turned out to be an unhappy marriage. He also quit the Stasi.Now his first thoughts of returning to the USA began. Thinking he would really like to be senator of Colorado! He started recording melancholic country and western songs about the Rocky Mountains. He ten appeared in a ""60 Minutes"" program, telling how he certainly preferred Gorbachev to Reagan. All of a sudden, he really wasn't welcome in neither West or East. A few weeks after his body was found in a lake.Now this documentary doesn't really get all the way around Dean Reed. The people interviewed for this are his daughter (who insists calling him Papa), his family and a Russian fan, who has moved to the USA. As a viewer it probably depends on your own take of the subject Dean Reed. There's no doubt that he felt a kinship to the poor and the pursued. Which no really go along with his love of communism. He from time to time gave a clear picture if being a megalomaniac, really loving to be the centre of his audience. That he really believed that he could become the senator of Colorado tells a lot.",True
4,7,The Tale of a Useful Idiot,Erik-Movie-Reviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"According to Webster's Dictionary a Useful Idiot is:
""a naive or credulous person who can be manipulated or exploited to advance a cause or political agenda""
Dean certainly fit the bill and provides a sad real life example of what happens when people of limited talent and ability delude themselves into believing they are destined for greatness. There doesn't appear to be much evidence of a conspiracy or intrigue, only the tragic end for a man at the end of his career and life. Perhaps instead of trying to portray Dean as an Idealist, it would have been a better Documentary if he had be more accurately depicted as a Narcissist who continued to put his quest for fame above his friends, family, and country.",False

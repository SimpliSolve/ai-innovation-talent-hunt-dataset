1,7,Heartfelt and intimate,walterwhite-74074,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first half of the documentary was very strong and we're introduced to people who have compelling stories about the trauma they experienced during Katrina. While it's a relatively short film it unfortunately starts to drag in the second half, while there are some interesting observations about the lasting impact that Katrina had on some of these people, it starts to feel more like a film someone made for an intimate community or family album and less like a comprehensive look at the havoc that Katrina wreaked on the youth of an entire city. There are some mentions about what happened to the youth on a larger scale but overall the film opts for more personal, heartfelt stories. Towards the end we're exposed to a lot of meandering shots of people just staring into the camera or laughing and dancing as if we're watching an ad for Cialis. I'm assuming the film felt an overwhelming need to imbue it's audience with a sense of hope towards the end but it came off more as a manipulative effort to cheer us up rather than a genuine look into the present or future. However I don't think any of these flaws detract from the value of this film because it's intimacy seems very intentional and meaningful and despite its meandering hopefulness, the heartbreak of this film is where the real marrow is found.",False
2,7,The long shadows of Katrina on NOLA's African-American community,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Katrina Babies"" (2022 release; 82 min.) opens, it is ""2005"" and we get aerial footage of New Orleans underwater, and people being rescued and airlifted. In a voice-over writer-director Edward Buckles Jr. Reminisces about getting together with cousins and playing outside in the hood. ""Nobody ever asked the children how they were doing, so I am"", he laments. We go to ""2015"" as Buckles starts gathering testimonials from people who were kids back then...Couple of comments: this is the debut feature length of writer-director Edward Buckles Jr., and what a debut it is. Years in the making, he looks back at the long shadows of Hurricane Katrina, and what devastation it wrecked onto NOLA's African=American community. He reminds us that Katrina caused one of the largest disbursement of African-Americans in this country's history. All of that pales as compared to hearing the heartbreaking testimonials from now adults around 25-30 years old, but just kids back then. While this isn't the first documentary about Katrina (""When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts"" immediately comes to mind), the footage of how Katrina chewed NOLA and spit it out remains shocking to this day.""Katrina Babies"" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival earlier this summer to great positive buzz. There is good reason why this is currently rated 100% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The documentary premiered a few days ago on HBO and is now available on HBO On Demand and HBO Max, where I caught it. If you need a reminder of the long shadows of Katrina on NOLA's African-American community, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,10,Wow.,cpcarpitella,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a gift this movie is to the people of Katrina, as well as those who only know this tragedy the way it was depicted on the news. I haven't been this moved by a movie in a very long time. The one negative is that it is only a movie and not a series. The director touches on so many crucial themes: community, trauma, childhood development, generational patterns, racism, classism, as well as our societies blindness to children's lived experience and emotions. I'm blown away by these stories and the resilience of the New Orleans community. Can't wait to see what this director does next.",False
4,10,This film deserves an oscar,ameliaortega-88030,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm still processing what I just watched but it was so compelling, beautiful, and sad. I hope this filmmaker gets the recognition he deserves and that this documentary continues to build empathy for the people of New Orleans and how Katrina impacted their lives.",False
5,10,10/10,Psychologicalad,n/a,16/08/2025,"How was this not nominated for an Oscar?? I was in the mood for a documentary about a somewhat contemporary topic and decided to give this a shot. I thought the premise was interesting - interview adults who were children during Katrina - but was skeptical about how much different perspective it could really offer to what Ive already absorbed since 2005. I am ashamed at how wrong I was. Exploring themes like childhood trauma, climate migration, violence, resilience this documentary had me in tears. It was done so well! The stylistic choices and the score were top notch. Shame on HBO for having this hidden away for no one to really see.",False
6,10,Amazing Film!!!!,wanderingcameras-86251,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredible film. I saw it through Tribeca where the director Edward Buckles one Best Documentary Director, which he definitely deserved. I don't have much to say besides see this film as quick as you can.",False
7,2,Don't blame this on class and race!!!!,jennifergeorgen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Babies... children of the aftermath with thoughts about their parents, grandparents actions
I can understand their view points and the absolute disregard of the government actions afterwards.Yet what you will keep hearing of these storied was... oh its just another hurricane. We'll be good. This will always be apart on New Orleans... I remember at 21 hearing about this storm a week, maybe 2, prior to it hitting and no one took it seriously.....So let's talk about the culture of the syate over race. Not many people took that storm seriously. Im not discounting the response of the government AT ALL. It was horrible. I'm just saying it was many factors... people, area, normalcy, lack of preparation (on both ends) because it just happens.I'll never forget how lucky I was to have water, diapers, and formula for my baby. I cried so hard for everyone in theor position. I just want to say in RETROFACT.... people and government could have prevented the outcome.Both ends are guilty.",False
8,10,Such a great film!,Alexp-Willson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can barely express what an amazing film this is! This is documentary film making at it's purest, but also it's highest level. I was lucky enough to see this through Tribeca online, and I can't wait to see it again when it gets a wide release.See this as soon as you can!",False
9,10,Must See.,tinajo62-515-257021,n/a,16/08/2025,If 1 child dies in high school we offer counseling. How did we miss this. Thank you for showing us what we should have seen. I am so glad to see so many made it dispite their inner turmoil. I am sorry for the kids who didn't make it because the burden was too great. All of the young people he interviewed conveyed how they felt and feel currently very well. I believe the way the people of New Orleans were treated was so shamefulI. I think if they had to live it while the rest of America looked on then we all can honor them by watching this documentary and acknowledge the pain and suffering that they went through. I look forward to seeing more from this young man.,False
10,10,it hurt to watch,mudbone-42885,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had seen a lot of the images, and there were many harrowing ones, but hearing the words of these young people almost brought me to tears.the stories that were told hurt so badly, it makes you wonder how these people survived and continue to keep moving forward. I guess if there are no other choices, you just, as the cliche goes, put one foot in front of the other and keep it moving. One of the many things that was truly disturbing was that these people were put and trailers and some contracted cancer.who do you sue, and how many more were there?i hope this filmmaker continues his journey with more efforts like this.",True
11,10,Wow speechless,karrinna,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is heartbreaking. And one thing I will say is that people are so resilient. What bothers me is the social and cultural inequalities and disparities in neighborhoods that are predominately black and lower income. Not to make excuses for black people but notice how America has no problem sending other countries millions, even billions of dollars and here in our own country we cannot help our own because we say they're lazy and looking for handouts but the truth is since slavery ended black people were meant to be put in a box and never given a fair chance and that's the truth. We all make our own choices but just look at the facts and inadequacies when it comes to lower income communities. It's just sad that people were stranded for days, they had nowhere to go and most assumed they would be able to ride it through. And they should have been able to because historically hurricane Katrina wasn't even that bad. It was the levees and the fact that social disparities caused no one to care or to notice. And this highlights what is wrong with this country. I am a veteran who fought in the afghan war and we treated them better than our own citizens during their worst times. Think about that.",True

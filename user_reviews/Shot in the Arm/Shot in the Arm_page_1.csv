1,10,Amazing and riveting film - not what you expect.,steve-383-965079,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to see an early screening of a ""not quite finished"" version of this film. Shot In the Arm,"" in Las Vegas in late 2022. I was blown away, immediately knowing at least a dozen friends I'd drag to see it. The film came about in the most unusual and amazing way. In the hands of someone other than Academy Award nominated documentary filmmaker Scott Hamilton Kennedy, I doubt it would have survived. But due to his brilliant ability to pivot, and switch directions when he suddenly found the story rapidly changing in real-time, audiences are going to see something extraordinary. If you've heard stories or suspect you know the truth behind vaccines, you must see this film. It is truly amazing.",False

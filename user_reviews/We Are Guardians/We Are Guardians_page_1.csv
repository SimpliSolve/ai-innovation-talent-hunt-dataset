1,10,Virtuous documentary film about deforestation in the Amazon and the people that try to protect it,carlo-brescia,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is a virtuous documentary film as it documents and shows the livelihoods not only of the people that try to protect the Amazonian forest from deforestation but also shows the point of view of the persons that live from cutting it. Nice photography and soundscapes, excellent characters, really well done. Really gets you into context if you try to understand or get acquainted with what is happening there from the point of view of the people that live this reality. If you care about the environment, climate change and indigenous cultures, this film is a must see. Also, the film shows the importance of the political arena: how decisionsin that sphere affect the realities in the grassroots.",False
2,10,An Amazing Film,EliP-02,n/a,15/08/2025,"A truly remarkable film, capturing the human struggle and devastating toll that rampant deforestation has taken on so many people, animals, and life-sustaining natural spaces around the world. An inspirational effort by several filmmakers, translators, guardians, and real life (and not keyboard) warriors, fighting to save our planet; one patch of (rain)forest at a time. The film has received many international awards, so you do not even have to take my word for it. The movie weaves together current global events, regional political dynamics, and ends on a hopeful message for us as a human family. We are ALL Guardians: of our own backyards, our communities, our local and regional natural spaces, and our shared planet. We are ALL one tribe, one human family. We only have this ONE planet to live on. Thank you to all that were involved, and who are still involved, in this project. They are fighting for a better world for all of us. Thank you.",False
3,1,Biased Perspective,KenF-47,n/a,15/08/2025,"It starts off well and brings attention to the serious issue of deforestation in the Amazon and talks about how large corporations worldwide are supporting this crime. However, it gets political in all the wrong ways. It paints the current administration as being the ""rescuers"" of nature and the indigenous people. It does not acknowledge that it is, by and large, an insanely corrupt government-in every possible way. The film shows the perspective of the loggers as well, which I found poignant and interesting, and it helps us begin to understand what a complex issue that is. However, the film mistakenly and ignorantly paints Brazil's current administration as a friend of the indigenous and of environmental causes-which it is most definitely is not. They would know that if they had done their homework before loudly lauding the corrupt. Completely biased and one-sided on its political commentary. That they blindly did this with no regard to proper investigation as to the behemothian corruption system they are supporting, made me lose all respect. Deforestation is a real problem and it must be addressed, however, this film does a completely biased commentary on Brazilian politics.",False

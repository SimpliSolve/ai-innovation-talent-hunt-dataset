1,1,Don't Bother,mikederbyshire-42427,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tedious and not always accurate vanity project. Twenty minutes in I was ready to give up but persevered to see if it got any better. Spoiler: It didn't. Close-ups of talking heads, ""re-enactments"" which did nothing to illustrate the horror of the crimes, boring soundtrack. I can find nothing of worth in this piece if film-making other than that it is an object lesson in how not to make an informative and entertaining documentary. I am fascinated by these crimes and have seen all the documentaries I can trace on the subject and was both surprised and delighted to find one that I had not heard about before. I wish I hadn't.",False
2,1,Pretty crap,evilmonkeyeveryday,n/a,16/08/2025,"Terrible, man.Obviously made with 10 quid and a bucket load of thrown out costumes.Its basically a reenactment movie, not a normal documentary, which is not what im looking for.Acting is pretty bad and the editing is worse lol.Got about 15 minutes in before turning it off cause it was so bad.Obviously an indie movie make with little funding but that doesnt change that is was bad and disappointing.Hopefully the company can refine their acting and editing skills enough that one day they make something watchable.Until then i wouldn't really bother watching it.Its very hard to get through.",False
3,8,Stylish documentary,lhmcm,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Unsolved Killings of Jack the Ripper is a gripping and stylish documentary about one of the most brutal strings of crimes in world history.The director interviews the author of a book on Jack The Ripper, and he describes the victim's lives and encounters with the killer.There are gritty re-enactments of the crimes and what happened in the streets of white chapel. The re-enactments hide the gore, but that makes them all the more disturbing. Just hearing the interviewee describe the bloody mutilations is enough to creep any viewer out.This is a simplistic film, but it is done with style, and is made in a way that makes it very a fascinating watch. I would recommend it if you have 50 minutes to spare.",False

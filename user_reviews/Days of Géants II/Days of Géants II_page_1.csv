1,10,Movie that inspires gratitude,ivanaspark,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a movie about one of the hardest races in the world, it is about gratitude as an important character strength and life skill. This movie teaches us the value of being aware of and thankful and of taking the time to return kindness. It is a celebration of determination, hard work, courage and persistance. An uplifting story that shows that no matter how difficult the circumstances or challenges, how small or little we feel in life, we can still rise above them and make a difference. Thank you for this motivation and timeless reminder! Ko sme taj moze! Hvala!",False

1,6,Great for grindhouse fans!,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary offers a look back at the films that we love to cover most on this site, the grindhouse and drive-in horrors of the 70s and 80s. It has plenty of the stars lined up and doesn't do anything to get in the way of them telling their stories, along with clips of the films for which they're known best.You'll get to hear from everyone from Brinke Stevens (Slumber Party Massacre), Lynn Lowry (The Crazies, I Drink Your Blood, Shivers), Kevin Van Hentenryck (Basket Case), John Dugan (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Mel Novak (Game of Death), John Russo (the writer of Night of the Living Dead, Midnight and The Majorettes), Carl Crew (Blood Diner), Jonathan Peacy (I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu), Marneen Fields (Hellhole), Camilla Carr (Don't Look in the Basement), Craig Muckler (the producer of Microwave Massacre), John Naulin (special effects for Re-Animator), Frank M. Farel (writer and producer of Spookies) and Craig Reed (who played the one-armed zombie in Re-Animator).The only downside I can think to this movie is that it has such a short running time. I would have loved to hear more stories from everyone involved. If you're a fan of any of these movies, this is something you'll enjoy watching.",True
2,7,Review for Stale Popcorn and Sticky Floors,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,17/08/2025,"This was a documentary that I caught while working. I saw that this looked to feature interviews from both actors and behind the scenes people for grindhouse horror of the 70s and 80s, it seemed like a good one to treat like a podcast while working. I found this streaming on Tubi so that helped as well.Where I'll start is a gripe that was common in other reviews of this doc. There isn't much of a structure to this outside of the filmmaking team were able to get legends like Brinke Stevens, Lynn Lowry, John A. Russo, Kevin Van Hentenryck and Camilla Carr amongst others. It seemed like they picked out a handful of movies, were able to get people from these and just let them tell behind the scene stories. I do love hearing these. It reminds me of when I got the opportunity to help make a feature. Having more cohesiveness or a through line would help tighten this up.I think what makes this shocking there is that this does seem to be well made. There are set ups that felt awkward where the sound was slightly off due to it. It still looks professional. I did appreciate that. Using trailers before shifting to the different movies that the stories were from is something else that was good. Not the best documentary out there. This still has an interesting group of people that have stories to tell and that was something I could appreciate, especially for people who enjoy the movies that are featured.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",False

1,10,Incredibly raw,jaazmegaan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved how raw and honest he was about his struggles with his depression, aniexty and suicidal thoughts... He just showed he's a normal guy with an incredible gift, that has been bullied and in term has had suffered severe depression.People just love to hate him and have billie dhim since he was 15 which is disgusting and everyone owes him an apology. He's so strong and I just would recommend everyone to watch this.I love love love him opening up about his mental health struggles because a lot of people don't realise what he's had to go through and how many things were falsely written about him.",False

1,8,Terrific ... and terrifying,johnpierrepatrick,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary aims to show the current state of technology in mass surveillance, its use in different countries and what it could lead for.It has one flaw, the third tier of the documentary focuses only on the Ouigours situation and may loose some people in another debate. Even if the example perfectly serves as how such systems could be used, I guess that could have been shorter and more balances with the other topics.All in all however this documentary fulfills splendidly its objectives and is terrifying in showing what could be next + the China example (citizen rating?!).
It is also frightening to hear the arguments and answers of the people building such systems or spending public money to define or implement it. You could hear any extremist: you're either for or against safety, there is no alternative (except maybe Middle Age time as suggested by one - Estrosi, mayor of Nice and one of the big shot in French political right landscape...).Please watch it, the more ... the merrier uh maybe not, the better.",False

1,9,Wondrous ladies,AndriiS-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie feels incredibly real and raw. I never thought anyone could capture the emotional reality of people going through such a tough time in their lives with this much sensitivity and skill.It's about women who've rediscovered themselves and carved out new directions in a world that basically writes you off once you hit 50. These are women who refuse to be invisible, who've found their own sense of purpose again.The main character faces what so many women deal with but rarely see on screen - she's torn between two parts of her life that both matter deeply. On one side, there's her family: her daughter and grandson who need her. On the other, there's this passion project that finally makes her feel alive and fulfilled again.It's heartbreaking because there shouldn't have to be a choice, but the film shows how real this dilemma is for so many women. Her situation isn't unique - that's what makes it so powerful.",False

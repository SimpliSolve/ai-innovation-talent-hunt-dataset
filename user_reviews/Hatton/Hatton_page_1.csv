1,6,An Above Average Simple Documentary,alindsayal,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary about famous British Boxer Ricky Hatton has been marketed heavily by Sky and has been released. I sat down today and decided to watch it and here is my review for the documentary. The premise of the documentary looks at the long career of Ricky Hatton as he faces the highs and lows that came out of his career.This documentary should receive praise for the fact that it doesn't really hide back from the dark times that Hatton has gone through and makes it clear that at least in his eyes he kind of sees himself as a bit of a failure despite the fact that he was a World Champion in Boxing. But seeing his drinking and drug abuse issues brings it into the light just how tough being this figure can be.It does a good job in showing the rise of Ricky Hatton from an amateur to being the world champion. We see the relationships he builds up such as with his trainer, his parents and his ex fiance and how they are all affected by things that happen in his life.Though my biggest criticism of this documentary is that it is a bit short, with the adverts it only clocks in at 90 minutes. This means that they try and go through so much but the majority of it just feels a bit undercooked and like we only get the minimal of information from it.Overall, Hatton is a pretty simple and short review because it is an above average documentary that is a quick watch. It deals with some pretty dark stuff and shows how Hatton's life was affected by big events but it needed to be longer or even turned into a 3 or 4 episode series to really give you more depth on certain factors.Rating - 6/10.",False
2,3,"Totally overhyped ""overcame barriers"".... Keeps mentioning Council Estate constanyky",Ricardohx4,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm really disappointed watching this because all it keeps doing is trying to make out he came from a terrible background, has overcome massive obstacles, a rough life - and I'm sorry but as a lad from the north he has had it pretty good if I'm honest!!Yes so he came from a Council Estate... BUT he had a Mum AND a Dad who ran 2 businesses so I'm sorry I don't see the problem...Then it tries to make out he overcame drink and then drugs...But no not really?! He went out in the lash and would put weight on when not in training for a few weeks - Who wouldn't?He got caught snorting a few lines whilst out on the lash and was partying a bit hard.... Wow, how uncommon - typical night out in Manchester.I see no barriers at all and I was expecting a real tale of hardship from the way they've built the PR up around this.That said, I admire his talent and you can't take that away from him - and fair play he suffered depression later on in life.",True

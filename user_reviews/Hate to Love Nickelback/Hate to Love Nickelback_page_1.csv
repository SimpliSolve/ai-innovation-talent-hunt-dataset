1,7,Great look into nickelback,Bmore-Hero,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler*""Hate to Love: Nickelback""* is a surprisingly insightful documentary that delves into the phenomenon surrounding one of the most polarizing bands in modern rock history. While it may not completely change your mind about Nickelback, the film does a commendable job of exploring why the band has been both beloved and reviled, offering a balanced and engaging narrative.The documentary takes a deep dive into Nickelback's rise to fame, examining their commercial success and the backlash that followed. Through interviews with the band members, fans, and critics, *""Hate to Love""* provides a comprehensive look at the band's journey, shedding light on the challenges they faced in navigating their public image. The filmmakers deserve credit for not shying away from tough questions, addressing the memes, jokes, and widespread criticism that have dogged Nickelback throughout their career.What stands out is the film's ability to humanize the band members, giving viewers a glimpse into their lives beyond the music. Chad Kroeger and his bandmates come across as down-to-earth and self-aware, which adds a layer of depth to the narrative. Whether you're a fan of their music or not, it's hard not to appreciate their resilience in the face of such intense scrutiny.The documentary also does a good job of exploring the broader cultural context that fueled Nickelback's controversial reputation. By examining the evolution of rock music, media, and internet culture, the film offers a nuanced perspective on why Nickelback became such an easy target for criticism.However, the documentary sometimes feels like it's preaching to the choir. It might not fully convince those who have already made up their minds about the band, and some segments feel a bit repetitive, covering ground that could have been condensed for a tighter narrative.Overall, *""Hate to Love: Nickelback""* is an entertaining and thought-provoking documentary that gives a fresh perspective on a band many people love to hate. It's a must-watch for fans and a worthwhile experience for those curious about the story behind the band's infamy. **7 out of 10 stars**.",True
2,10,Truly never understood the hate,slpoulin-40281,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think people just enjoyed making a trend out of hating on Nickelback. I've always been a fan. They put on a kickass concert too. This documentary was super informative and uplifting. Highly recommend.It walks through the formation of the band from the very beginning. It was news to me that they came out with their first album back in the 90s. It then goes through the background of each of the band members. They show different scenes from some of the concerts they've performed.If you're a proud (or closeted) fan of Nickelback, you should watch this documentary. I have more of an appreciation for them now after watching this documentary.",False
3,10,I have NEVER understood the hate that went on for Nickleback.,karenmarie-52098,n/a,15/08/2025,"I honestly have just never understood the hate. They are a great band. Great music. If it isn't your particular type of music.. DON'T LISTEN TO THEM! I mean really.. As is the case with anything. Movies, TV, Music, etc. It has always been crazy to me how some people just turned to such hate. WHY???? I was glad to see the documentary because I have just never understood why anyone would want to make someone feel bad for no other reason than they just don't like their music or a band member, whatever. You do have the option NOT TO BUY OR LISTEN TO THEM! Ok, so they aren't for you. Why keep saying hateful, hurtful things??",False
4,10,Amazing!,maestasdana,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a huge fan of Nickelback and I thoroughly enjoyed this behind the scenes view of the band. It tells the story I always wanted to hear, about the highs and lows of a Canadian band full of heart, talent and grit. They've been here for almost 30 years and I hope they keep the awesome music and laughter coming for years to come.This documentary also tells how deeply the world hurt them at the time of their success and how they persevered against that hate to still rock the stage and their fans. I love the band even more and absolutely loved this film, which I hope many more see and enjoy for its heart.",True
5,5,Okay as a doc but not converted,Schism78,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerViewed this with an open mind & although it's watchable, my takeaway was meh.What stuck out for me was Chad is sad you don't like him or his music. Feeling sorry for a guy that churns out McDonald's level country music pop masquerading as edgy, hard rock that is making more money than most of us will ever see in our lifetimes didn't create any pang of sympathy. If the material was more engaging & compelling, perhaps I could understand. Maybe creating something not so 2-D, geared for tailgating playlists and lipsynching TikTok babes might earn my respect & support.If he was an Artist, expressing from a deep place within him & in turn him not giving a rat's ass what anyone thought, I'd find the material more interesting. And in the course of this documentary we are given multiple opportunities to see the more complex aspects of Chad & his band mates. Other than some challenging health issues affecting other members (which I am not minimizing) Chad just isn't that deep. There is emphasis on his bad boy adolescent phase but it seemingly didn't result in any wealth of wisdom or maturity, other than his twice mentioning how good he is at getting out of trouble. (Is that something to be proud of?).And the punch line was Ryan Reynolds coming to their defense, thanks but I'm out.",True
6,10,Don't miss it.,yndwmhfjt,n/a,15/08/2025,"An intriguing documentary of the power of friendship, palpable among themselves and then shared with their audience consistently. The movie highlights the challenges to that bond through the trials of fame, especially after being attacked by so many out of what can only be jealousy on a mass scale. The strength of the personality of the band leader Chad and likeability of the members sets the stage for partying in the best sense, keeping the intent intense but fun. I had been to only one concert but really felt like I would like to reexperience what they offer even though I've left my Woodstock days pretty far behind me.",False
7,10,Loved it!,joeymcpee,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some nerd comic who no one thought was very funny thought he'd start a meme-like commentary pooping on this band. No one still cares about that dummie while Nickelback is still rocking!Nickelback is one of the greatest bands of all time - period. Just like the sun comes up and goes down its a fact.I think one of the more powerful segments of this documentary was when there were a series of clips of online folk slagging the band only to cut whole-heartedly into singing one of their songs. They're Canadian pop culture, American pop culture, small town country life, a bit of country a bit of grunge and a bit of metal. A very human band too, three of which grew up together from the start and the last member's been with them for 18 yrs.Great documentary, I highly enjoyed it and recommend it!",False
8,10,Only IDIOTS would despise these Brilliant Rockers,Cruetime2323,n/a,15/08/2025,"Listen, facts are facts. They have one of the largest fan bases ever, not only in Canada but the World. If I were a wealthy and successful as these guys I would LOVE TO BE HATED!!! I seriously doubt that the haters of Nickelback have ever been to one of their shows. They pack so much energy and stage presence that there are few who could top them. Hit after Hit after Hit...So proud to call them kick ass Alberta boys...well Daniel we will adopt you into this great province!!!",False
9,4,90 minutes of PR... Dont expect a real examination of the reason for the backlash,wisdomwasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can see a lot of comments stating ""I never understood the Nickelback hate"" Well as someone who grew up and witnessed it in real time the backlash was never because they were ""played on radio too much"", it all started with the cringe now and cringe then single ""Figure you out"" - which was misogynistic trash sandwiched between a couple of written for radio ballads, which lyrically read like theyre from another band.If you watch this documentary you just come away with the thought that they're just a bunch of great guys who worked real hard and just got backlash because of social media hate . Might all be true, but even the reason and controversy of them firing their original drummer is completely avoided (look up wikipedia for the truth, it wasnt because 3 doors down just had a better drummer), but in this it's all hugged out and forgiven, which is such a stark gap in the story I had to go google straight away. Also the drummer has horrible facial hair, a pre request for all the Pearl Jam light bands of that era so I guess he completed things.The first 30 minutes is very good, looking at their beginnings in a small town and extra hard hustle to be a success (a good note for anyone actually wanting to be in a successful music act - you have to put in the complete focus of hours and sweat with little return to even have a chance of taking off). But after that anything that's deep and dark with their history is completely skipped over to just continue to pump up the band's image like they dont expect any of us to google.Nickelbacks over the top hate might have been unfair, but it was certainly earned. Maybe this doc will change things, because most people are too lazy to even google on the same phone they're watching the thing. Guess we'll see.And with the interviews with the bottom price lawyer - he's an old man wearing sunnies inside trying to be a cool dude, even that is cringe.",False
10,5,Terrible people always pretend to be victims,mje-67979,n/a,15/08/2025,"Because it appears people have forgotten, Nickelback became hated because they refused to perform at a charity concert at the last minute unless they got paid more. A charity concert.....now they're desperate to come up with other excuses for why people started to hate them.They were very popular when they first came out but then their personalities started to show. That's okay though, it's 2024 and everyone is a victim in the world of avoiding responsibility for your actions.Aside from that they're what Green Day became except Nickelback became pop much quicker once in the limelight. Don't blame others for your bad choices and greedy nature.",False
11,2,Whitewashed Nickelback Propaganda,stevenmortonuk,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't love or hate Nickelback. I liked This is How You Remind me when it came out all those years ago, but I stopped listening to them shortly after.However, I think I like them less after watching this documentary.Here are some of the reasons why:The lyrics to some of their songs deserve the derision they earned the band. Chad claims they are ""risque"" but they're just crude and corny. There was no attempt to justify or explain these lyrics.The attitude of Chad Kroeger (""I'm great at getting out of trouble"")' is.deserving of scorn. This a 50 year old man acting in a cringeworthy manner.The documentary didn't even mention the lawsuits related to the firing of the drummer. Apparently it was over songwriting royalties, which would make Chad Kroeger crude, cringeworthy, and greedy.There was no self reflection as to why people disliked them. It was just dismissed as nasty online trolls, which is only part of the truth.However, there were some parts that made me feel sympathetic towards the rest of the band. Bullying kids because their father is in Nickelback is not acceptable. It's sad that that happened.But apart from that, I came away very unimpressed and unsympathetic. The music is crude, the lead singer is cringe, and they lack self awareness as to why they are disliked.",False
12,2,"Don't expect to actually analyse the hate received by the band, it's just a classic thrashy Netflix documentary, made just to be made!!!",agachemihnea,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary doesn't even try to find out how the hate for the band started. They just simply saying that it was because of the rise of social media during the band's peak time. And even that, is only for 10 minutes or so. The only thing that stood up in those moments was when it was highlighted that band's members kids were bullied at school because of the band's universal hate and that people were shouting insults at Chad Kroeger on the street. That is the only minor moment that makes you to reflect upon the consequences of hating a celebrity just for the sake of hating someone.But how it all started? From whom? The film makers were to lazy to analyse that, to search, maybe to interview some of the people who have started the hate (like Dave Grohl). Was it a jealousy involved, was it the band members behaviour, was it just a stupid spark that blossomed into a huge fire? No answers to these questions. No, just lazy writing and lazy making. Let's just produce something uninspired and cheap, at least to justify the continuum rise in subscriptions fees. And no, I do not have a Netflix account, I have just watched the stupid movie at my sister's house, when I had nothing to do. I barely could make it to the end, because it's just boring, after the first half.Keep going like this, Netflix, you will be ruined soon by another streamer. Especially when you are increasing prices every year and you aren't giving anything in exchange.",False

1,4,Not worth it,creepoligist,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a long time sam and Colby fan and have always enjoyed their content. This movie was completely different from other things I've seen from them. There were so many AI generated images used in the movie it made it feel cheap. The audio was unbalanced and really loud in some parts.I think skinwalkers were mentioned three times. The whole investigation turned into talking to an unnamed Native American shaman.The whole thing was just kinda silly.The ending message was that we're all one or something like that. Idk man, but I want a refund for my tickets. It should've just been put on xplr club as an exclusive video.",True
2,2,"Lackluster, Lazy and Disrespectful",beatrizteruel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly, for context I'm a huge paranormal enthusiast and consume lots of content regarding it.I've been following Sam and Colby and was very excited about this movie, since it touched on so many paranormal topics, plus the location has a vast history and some interesting correlation to other locations.Well, watching the movie I was severely disappointed for a few reasons and I can list them:1) Complete lack of research - They went to the location, didn't know anything about the place, didn't try to get more information (which is so wildly available) and based all their ""findings"" on a few pieces of information that were provided by the current owner.Ex: How Mt. Wilson and Skinwalker Ranch correlate in activity so much so that Robert Bigelow owned both at the same time and conducted studies (along with the government). That would make the movie WAY more enticing and show research.2) Utter disrespect towards Native American culture and beliefs - They were aware of the native's beliefs about talking about skinwalkers and proceeded to do so over and over. Plus, disturbed the land, mimicked native rituals ... while not having ANY Native Americans in the movie providing guidance or information.3) The overall ""movie"" felt like a poorly made Youtube video, with the AI generated imagery, the unfocused camera shots, the bad editing and etc. It felt lazy, repetitive and unprepared.You can argue that they didn't have the ""budget"" for a film, but if you watch their 25x25 series on Youtube that aired 3 years ago, their production and editing level for that was INFINITELY better and way more movie worth it than this. There's just no justification for how poorly made it was.I could go on and on about how this movie wasn't IT.Should just be a Youtube special and definitely still be a bad Youtube video.I'm a Sam and Colby fan but this lazy and disrespectful content is not it and it's not worth a movie ticket.",False
3,1,Save your money,cypherxxcreations,n/a,16/08/2025,"Slowly losing interest in Sam and Colby. I was hoping this movie would change my mind. Low quality for being in theaters. Lack of history. High usage of AI photography which is similar to their Youtube videos. Fine for Youtube but when the creators state this is not be like their normal videos and thats why we should see it in theaters, then come to find out its exactly like their Youtube videos is disappointing. I was hoping to see a more serious side of them and a more in-depth investigation, especially from people who are being deemed ""the top ghost hunters"". It's the same old, same old from Sam and Colby. I wish we saw a little more growth/maturity, which is what i was hoping to see in this ""movie"", but i should have known better. They know their target demographic is most likely teen girls and therefore the content reads a little more immature. It's funny because when i first started watching them, they seemed more mature when they were younger, trying to act older and now that they are older they act much younger. It was disappointing to see the disrespect in the movie. One lady asked for a section of what she was saying not to be in the movie and they kept it in. Not worth seeing in theaters. I'd recommend just watching some of their old content which was in my opinion better.",False
4,1,"I fell asleep, the couple sitting next to me walked out.",kristigates-39799,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why on earth is bad Youtube channel content being shown at the movie theater? Forget my money, I want my wasted time back. I can't believe someone thought showing Youtube channel fodder on the big screen was a good idea. The lady sitting next to me played on her phone and one couple actually left and didn't come back. Only seven people in the theater opening night, so it was obvious what others were doing. Don't waste your time or money. Watch their Youtube channel if you want, but save your money on this one.Very disappointed in Cinemark for even offering this as a movie. They missed the mark on this one.",False
5,10,Sam & Colby make a Paranormal Documentary film,pulpfictionman-17-214768,n/a,16/08/2025,"If one goes to see this film without first being initiated as a fan of Sam & Colby's paranormal YouTube videos, one will get lost and not understand that Sam & Colby take this Paranormal stuff very seriously, despite them often trying to brush off scary moments with humor. And having both been through a lot and come through the other end, dealing with attachments and demonic entities, for their hardcore fans this is a fun 90 minute romp. For the uninitated into Sam & Colby's world, I'd suggest watching their investigation of The Conjuring house to get a taste of what they're doing before seeing their first feature length film, but I believe their fans wiill enjoy or people who find this paranormal stuff engaging, whether they believe it all of it or not, for there are sacred places that have energy.,",False
6,3,not worth it,softlyyourss,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't usually write reviews, but I feel compelled to share my thoughts on this one. As a dedicated fan of Sam & Colby, I had high expectations for this film, but unfortunately, it left me deeply disappointed. I've followed their content for years, and I know they have a reputation for delivering thrilling, authentic paranormal experiences that keep you on the edge of your seat. However, this film fell far short of what I've come to expect from them.First of all, if you're expecting a traditional Sam & Colby experience with spooky encounters, eerie settings, and jaw-dropping paranormal activity, you'll be let down. The movie felt like it was missing the very essence of what makes their content so appealing. One of the main reasons people love Sam & Colby is for the real, raw moments when they face the unknown, and those genuine, spine-chilling encounters with the supernatural. Sadly, this film didn't deliver on that front. There was barely any paranormal activity, and what little there was felt forced and unconvincing. It almost seemed like the paranormal aspect, which is their signature, was an afterthought rather than the focus of the film.One of the biggest issues I had was the use of AI to explain the plot. This choice baffled me. Instead of using their usual storytelling style, which draws viewers into their investigations and personal experiences, they relied on artificial intelligence to fill in narrative gaps. The result was a story that felt disjointed and impersonal. AI, while useful in many ways, can't replicate the emotional depth and connection that real storytelling brings. It lacked the human touch that fans are used to, and as a result, the film felt hollow. The AI explanations were clunky and failed to make the plot engaging or coherent.Additionally, the pacing of the film was off. Everything felt incredibly rushed, almost as if they were trying to get through the story as quickly as possible without giving the necessary time to build suspense or develop any meaningful moments. A big part of Sam & Colby's success comes from their ability to create tension and anticipation, making every small sound or movement in their videos feel significant. In this film, however, there was no time for tension to build. Events happened one after another without any real sense of progression, leaving no space for suspense or emotional investment.Overall, this film simply wasn't worth watching, especially if you're a fan expecting the kind of content Sam & Colby are known for. I wouldn't recommend spending money on it. It feels like they strayed too far from what made their content special in the first place. With the lack of genuine paranormal activity, the over-reliance on AI to drive the plot, and the rushed pacing, this was a major letdown. As a loyal fan, I expected much more, and unfortunately, this just didn't live up to the hype.",True
7,10,Loved it,chyennesmama,n/a,16/08/2025,"Listen I normally don't do these or any reviews for that matter. My family are all fans especially my oldest. We drove 4hrs round trip to see the movie and imo well worth it . Just the seeing the excitement on my oldest face alone was worth it. I feel people are being way to harsh on Sam and Colby I feel they did amazing and the ""AI"" graphics that were thrown in i felt creatively helped tell the story they were conveying . That takes time ,thought and effort so to call it ""lazy"" is just rude . I personally feel the meaning and journey was on a deeper , spiritual level that some just can't grasp .",False
8,3,Felt like a scam,aramoonstaz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a long time Sam and Colby fan and my sis is as well. We both walked out of that theatre disappointed and half asleep. If you're a Sam and Colby fan DO NOT go and see this. Just cherish their old YouTube videos. This movie felt so unorganized. At first I thought it was going to be about skin walkers, then UFOs got thrown in, and then it all mostly ended up being about this preserver Shaman watching the land of skinwalker ranch and trying to communicate with another dimension. There were some funny moments and 1 scary moment but other than that... I was half asleep and my sister fell asleep, I had to wake her up. Several people around us fell asleep. HALF OF THIS MOVIE was filled with repetitive, possibly AI generated, snippets to help describe whatever story they were talking about and they would repeat those same snippets SEVERAL times throughout the movie. If they took out those snippets, it could have been an hour long YouTube video and they could release to premium members and xplr club. I'm so mad...like I wanted to like it, I was hyped for it, and then I was ultimately let down and this kind of pushed me a little bit away from their content. Also the ticket price is $5 more than the average movie ticket. This whole thing felt like a scam. Sam and Colby fans, I know you want to show support, I did to, but please if you want to continue loving them and not be disappointed, don't go see this, just don't. Only getting 3 stars for the funny moments and to show some support.",False
9,10,Just kiss already. 🙄,sharlahampten,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe movie was great overall, but I am convinced the shaman was just really horny the whole movie. I mean, from the begging, if you connect what he says it comes to ""I see intention, love"" and then the dream catchers middle feather goes up and the rest stay down...coincidence? I think not. After that the Shaman leads them into a cave, and then blown wind at them to make Sam sits down, where it then tries to touch Sam! Come on! Sam Literally got up because ""I felt like something was trying to touch me."" And don't even get me started on how. They summon the portal, banging and chanting? MORE LIKE CLAPPING AND MOANING. If you are not convinced by now then I don't know what will. And if you haven't seen the move, watch it and find out.",True
10,7,I loved it but it's not for everyone...,serenabriseno,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been watching Sam and Colby for almost 10 years now, so of course i'm going to love anything they put out. Although they had plenty of hilarious cheesy jokes, this film was leaning more on the serious side than their normal content. It had an overall deeper meaning and was focusing more on the historical aspect of things and sadly I did notice not many people in the theater were as invested as I was due to it mostly being a younger audience. Some people were on their phones, some people were talking the whole time, and there was even someone sleeping next to me. So if you have a short attention span and you're not that into the historical side of the paranormal, maybe this movie isn't for you. I personally enjoyed the movie and felt very moved. I have always viewed Sam and Colby to be very talented and genuine people when it comes to creating content, so I can't wait to see what else they accomplish/create. Great job guys!",False
11,1,disrespectful and disgusting,daylenr-75706,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIve been watching Sam and Colby for a while but then there videos started to become disrespectful and off putting to say the least just 2 white boys disrespecting property, cultures and beliefs and I went into this knowing that it probably wouldn't be the best but surprise it was terrible. The Sam and Colby movie, damn, it was basically a big YouTube video of three white boys disrespecting Native land while claiming, 'we're being respectful.' Then, in the very next scene, they blow up the land and say, 'oops, okay, now we'll be respectful,' only to end with fireworks 😶. All in all, the movie was a waste of time and money-just an hour of three white boys showing off their disgusting, disrespectful behavior.",True
12,1,Skip!,clh-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFull disclosure: I'm not much of a fan of the titular duo. My wife is, though, and I went to the theater with her to see it.First; the overall production values are substandard for a theatrical film. Perhaps they're fine for a YouTube video, but you know what they say about where to go if you can't go big.Second; the narrative structure is lacking. I get that it's supposed to be ""reality"", but they promise this arc up front but just go through the motions.Third; I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of ghosts, spirits, demons, or any other such entities, but their ""investigation"" is insultingly bad pseudoscience. Anyone with even a high school level knowledge of radio and electromagnetic waves would know that ""spirit boxes"" don't work as advertised and an EMF meter sensitive to pick up an otherworldly presence would be effected by a cell phone, or radio, or high power transmission lines. The self-proclaimed ""archaeologist"" (no credentials established) readily dives into folklore and mythology and presents it as fact, which no reputable archaeologist would do.Fourth; the titular duo and their friend's actions are insulting to tribal history and culture. They claim to be attempting to contact the spirit of a ""shaman"" and that they're investigating on traditional tribal grounds, but they never speak any actual tribal historians or spiritual leaders on camera. They claim to be ""recreating"" rituals in sacred places, but they just putz around in a circle of stones and a cave. And, arguably worse, they partake in a ""blood ritual"" that just involves poking their fingers and smearing them on some allegedly sacred stones. At best, it's all nonsense; but it's also terrible cultural insensitivity.It's easy to say that since I'm not a fan, I don't ""get it"" or that I'm inclined to dislike anything like this; but there are standards both in polish and scientific and cultural scrutiny that must be met. And this falls far short.",True
13,2,Waste of time and money,khhhch,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHeavily features ai art, using the same scenes over and over trying to build a sense of wonder when in reality this movie disrespectful down to it's very core and filled with utter nonsense.The moment they talked aboit CIA mind control and I saw the ai art, I knew this movie was going to be bad but man it was worse than I ever thought.There was no investigation here, just ""oh, this will look great"" or ""oh, this will get us views!""The medium they talk to in the movie clearly asks them not to put a part in yet they do it anyways, the spirit the talk to asks them to be respectful and they do the exact opposite. Who the hell thinks being respectful means blowing up someone's home?!I've lost all respect for these two.",True
14,1,I need a refund!!,yfszpsjb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Money is tight... especially lately... and I feel like I need to ask for my money back. I would've spent this money anywhere else! I would've rather have gone to a teeth cleaning appointment... or hung out with my mother in law ... anywhere but stuck in a theater. My son was so excited to see this and the. He left with such a sad disposition. He said that the previews were better than the actual movie!!If anyone is thinking of seeing this movie, think harder.. cause it's awful. The movie itself used the same images and sound effects over and over. They talked in circles.. and promised big things and delivered NONE. Not even one small thing.",False
15,10,Absolutely beautiful,bradleyfspohn,n/a,16/08/2025,I've been a big time Sam and Colby fan for a long time and was so hyped when they announced a movie. I saw bad reviews before coming but I trust Sam and Colby were not going to disappoint. And they did not! The movie was amazing from beginning to end. The goofy Sam and Colby we all love is shown throughout the movie. So much jokes and laughter is shared. As well as a beautiful message being shared at the end. They deserved this movie so much and to see that it was sold out at my theatre was so awesome. Thank gosh I bought my tickets fast online before hand. My final word to you guys reading this is.. FIND A WAY TO WATCH THE MOVIE!!!,False
16,1,I DEMAND A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!,momoflight,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love my kids, a lot. I just beat cancer myself and last Halloween the contouring house recap on YouTube was way better then this entire movie, this was the most pathetic excuse for a ""special event"" I'm embarrassed for these guys. I'm getting my money back one way or the other. I'm running on fumes financially and on the discount day at the movies I still paid twice the discount price for this ""special event"". NO! You don't get to do this to parents. I'm outraged.Literally NOTHING happened on this movie. NOTHING. Do not waste your money, do not allow your kids to make it seem like this is going to be so awesome. This is a YouTube video.",False
17,10,AMAZINGGGGGGG,emilykaitlyn-21514,n/a,16/08/2025,It was honestly soooo good and so deep I'm so proud of them for getting this far having a movie in theaters it's so good the music is adds so much feeling and the depthness of it all just blows my mind what they did truly beautiful I love the history they give behind their adventures to give us more of a understanding and a deeper connection these boys are amazing they really are they do so much for us fans they deserve the world this is truly a master peice right here its worth every minute of it its entertaing but at the same time very infromative ill suport theses boys till the end ita truly amazing.,False
18,1,Absolute joke of a movie,dimitri-65803,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to this movie with my girlfriend because she wanted to do something spooky for the Halloween month. I knew nothing about these guys previous to this, and i truthfully wish I could unsee this movie. The scariest part of the movie is when my card was charged almost $40 to sit in a big room to watch a YouTube video with 8 other people. Within the first 5 minutes I heard the word ""skinwalker"" atleast 50 times and the amount of ""DUNNNNN"" sound affects within a 2 minute span became so obnoxious I still hear it over 24 hours later. These guys talked about being respectful to the land and then proceeded to blow it up, how tone deaf can you be?? The acting was so bad and unless you idolize these guys you wouldn't see it. They decided to put some of their own period blood on a rock for a ""ritual"" and that was probably the part that made me laugh the hardest. I say period blood because these guys would scream at a leaf falling on the ground so they must have... nevermind... The old ""experts"" in this movie are the same guys you can find on the corner downtown living in a tent, could give them 5$ and they'd tell you some way crazier stuff that what these guys said. I give them credit for putting this behind a paywall and convincing people this is the only place they'll ever be able to watch it. AI generated images are all through this ""movie"" and they're laughing all they way to the bank.Overall, do not recommend this movie, I feel like I got scammed. My girlfriend enjoyed it so oh well.",False
19,8,Overhated,mrsbananabob,n/a,16/08/2025,I thought it was similar to all their youtube videos. Most of the 1 star reviews are very over dramatic. Yes there were some ai images and clips but not any more then they put in all their normal videos. Going off the reviews I was expecting to see the ai more than Sam and Colby themselves which obviously was not true. Also some people believed that they were disrespecting the land and native americans which i did not think happened. Yes they did cause that little explosion which is a bit disrespectful but they were trying to get attention and didn't have rude intentions. It wasn't on the scarier side like most of their videos but if you're actually a fan you'll enjoy it.,False
20,1,Disrespectful and culturally insensitive,beckynevada,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie left me feeling gross that I'd even contributed to such ignorance. Complete disrespect for Native Americans, their culture, and lands. Fake artifacts, speculating on their ideas and culture, trying to recreate made up rituals. Just gross. They included a land acknowledgement in credits, but doubt they ever reached out to the tribes.They need to educate themselves and release an apology.The movie was trying to wake the spirit of the native shaman which they elude to as being scary and evil, by blowing up the ""sacred"" land. They pretend as if they are speaking his words. And the other characters in the movie should've stopped it instead of feeding into their stupid entertainment story.",True
21,1,Felt rushed and repetitive,Rubyglooom-03553,n/a,16/08/2025,The movie was so unorganized and they used mostly AI graphics and kept on using the same pictures over and over and over again. I absolutely love sam and colby but the movie felt so repetitive and rushed. Throughout the movie nothing paranormal really happened until the last 20 mins of the movie. I really thought this movie was going to be amazing like the movie from last year but unfortunately it wasn't. It just felt like they were trying to be philosophical rather than showing the paranormal. I think that sam and colby are too focused on trying to make something that was BETTER than the conjuring but instead they should just focus on just making a new video and that's it. Their new videos don't need to be the next BEST or anything as fans we just want to see new video not the NEXT BEST VIDEO.,False
22,1,White boys being white boys,scootmcpoot,n/a,16/08/2025,"These boys are just the same as all white people who want to make Indigenous thought and belief seem like something paranormal. They take our cultures and our history, make it seem like this otherworldly, evil thing when it's just a spiritual practice like church.This whole """"""""film"""""""" felt like the most disrespectful and ignorant thing I could watch as an Indigenous person. Everything they deemed ""mysterious"" or ""creepy"" I was able to identify as everyday practices in my culture. If they had just talked to ONE Indigenous person this could've had some substance.Skinwalkers are our way of talking about mental health. They're not legit physical monsters, it's people who fell to vices. Shamans are our priests, our therapists, our doctors, not magical beings.Don't give this cash grab movie any money. Beyond the cultural appropriation, they shamelessly AI to ""illustrate"" stories. Truly a culmination of how soulless and lazy this whole glorified youtube video felt.Watch real paranormal investigators who cares about the historical and human side of myth like Watcher.",False
23,1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,courtshort-27535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie was so low budget and most of it was just Sam and Colby overreacting to the most meaningless things in a very 2014 Jake Paul kind of way. Obviously meant for kids. The ending message of the movie was that ""we are all one"" with aliens, skinwalkers, and ghosts, which to me seemed like they pulled out of no where. The use of A. I was deplorable and they obviously held no respect for the Navajo tribe as this whole thing seemed like a giant cash grab. They even blew up the land to supposedly get the ghosts to talk to them, which obviously was just an excuse to make the trailers look more interesting with a giant explosion as they ditch that plan as soon as they start it.They have said they want to be filmmakers, and I'm sorry to say but if this is the type of ""films"" they plan to make they should just stick to YouTube. The beginning of the movie with the vibe ""boom"" effect and the deepfrying was funny the first time, and the 7 times after within the first 3 minutes was when I decided I wish I saved my money on a ticket.I feel offended as an audience member if they think we are stupid enough to be impressed by this movie.",True

25,2,Why only in some cinemas in the USA,FallenRosex3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Im gonna be honest with you. I didnt watch the movie that is mostly because im not from america. I find it quite stupid or arrogant that two youtubers who know DAMN well that most fans aren't from america, make a movie that is only shown in a FEW cinemas only in america.What were they thinking with this? They have plenty of money to have made the movie available outside of america and even if they didnt, there are plenty of good reasons to post the movie on their Youtube channel.1. They're known for youtube and vine.2. Not all fans have money to go and see the movie on big screen
3. If you do only put it in cinemas in the USA. Do it in more then the few yall did now.Such a bummer, they could have made ao much more money and could have made many more fans happy then now. Most fans are just mad rn because they only thought of their little bubble called USA.",False

1,6,A game of two halves,CrazyArty,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really liked the first episode. It examines small items and so is focused on biology & biochemistry. We see fantastic images of the tiniest things such as micro insects and living cells and understand the science behind the tools we use to view them.The second episode is focused on large items such as galaxies and is more focused on astronomy. I didn't enjoy that so much, it's not as engaging as Brian Cox shows.Overall, it's extremely educational, but probably too much science for most viewers. This is far more than just pretty images.",False

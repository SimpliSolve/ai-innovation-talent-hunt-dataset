1,10,intimate and revealing,belvie_gt,n/a,15/08/2025,I just watched this documentary on the Belgian / Flemish public broadcaster VRT. Quite amazing how ordinary people find each other and clit together in their aim keeping Ukraine independent and free.Russia (read : aging Putin blinded by successes from the past making him suffer from megalomaniac behavior) made such crazy move by attacking Ukraine while having all the natural resources and space across 11 timezones themselves. Why start this war? Mr Putin enjoyed respect from the Western and Oriental societies but then -unfortunately- made such dramatic decision attacking a sister culture and country. For sure he must regret that decision by now.It's sad (but understandable of course) watching well educated people making hateful statements about their opposing peers that are hiding in their own trench a few kms further. They don't realize that war is in the first place big business where only a few owners of the industrial military complex manage to play games with those in political power and this at the expense of the common (wo)man.,False
2,10,Everything I hoped to see in a modern warfare documentary,univiniti,n/a,15/08/2025,"Raw footage. Real danger. Factual information.This documentary helped me to realize the power of drive and morale.Although war is not something we should glorify and normalize, it is still fascinating to see every-day intelligent people with the most benign lives imaginable weaponizing their capabilities out of self-defense.This doc shows the logistics of Russia's invasion, clearly conveys critical territory, and reveals in-depth offensive and counter-offensive tactics.Just when I thought this documentary couldn't get any more badass it somehow manages to. Godspeed to all the nations supporting Ukraine.",False
3,10,Ukraine must win.,rensdebruijn-10628,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great insight of the full on war that Russia launched on Ukraine, trying to etnically cleanse Ukraine from their native lands. This was has been going on from 2014 and even before and all of the negative reviews have been made by Russian propagandists. Any negative review is complaining about that the Ruzzians could make one themselves, but this tv-show shows a great insight in how and why Ukrainians are winning this war.It gives an insight on who the soldiers are and why they are fighting off the Ruzzians to libirate their country from the evil that is occupiing their lands and are torturing and killing their sevillians.",False
4,1,Anecdotal and without perspective,roxlerookie,n/a,15/08/2025,"I guess it's hard to make a good documentary, and geopolitics are complicated.The footage is from Jun22, which is early on in the war.It was interesting to see the prevalence of drone usage in combat, but there was zero perspective. I'm not even sure we can call this propaganda, in the sense that the same documentary could have been made following russians.The one interesting passage for me was a female ex school teacher now working in intelligence who subsequently joined the military outright: ""I didn't think that I could be so cruel, that i'd be glad about someone's death, but for us they're not human. And when we hear that 20 have been killed, we say ""damn, not enough"""".I'm not going to blame her, i'm safe in another country. But in a way this glorifies war, and war without perspective but with drones and 20min of mortar footage looks a lot like a video game.This documentary brings nothing valuable to make sense of this war.",False
5,1,"Lies, propaganda and BS",pbubalo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Does this trash, pro war hysteria never end?Here, again we see the simple minded narrative of the angelic, ordinary, humble and heroic people who are fearlessly rising up to fight the evil goliath!If you're going to promote propaganda, at least try to be a bit more imaginative and subtle about it.This film is an utter insult to anyone with half a brain cell, no doubt the pro ukrainian bootlckers here will be fawning all over this piece of trash and and hailing it as a cinematic masterpiece!And i'm sure this garbage will also win a plethora of awards, as is the norm nowadays that anything with a Ukraine flag on it instantly wins whatever competition it enters.",False

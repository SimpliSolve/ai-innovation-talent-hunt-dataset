1,8,Confused at low ratings...,fiftycentqueen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this little documentary. Touched on alot of things that she went through in the beginning of her music career. There's one reviewer that said they interviewed Sean Combs because he was around at that time. Umm helllloooo!!, he was her producer! People giving low ratings obviously know nothing about Mary. I was in high school when she blew up and I've loved her ever since. If you love Mary watch it, you won't be disappointed.",False
2,6,Carefully crafted,ronda-51071,n/a,16/08/2025,It was definitely watered down or crafted to reflect on the music and not HER LIFE. I honestly believe she's saving the those critical details of her abusive childhood and relationships for an actual biography. This was not that. It merely presented her feelings and fan reactions about the MY LIFE album.,False
3,6,Love Mary but wanted more,damilolas,n/a,16/08/2025,Unfortunately I didn't grow up with her music but of course know who she is and have heard some of her songs.I was interested to watch this as it would touch on her depression and I'm going through a very tough time myself.While it was inspiring I didn't learn much about Mary at all. It's glossed over every topic and had some unnecessary filler.Still worth a watch though.,False
4,n/a,"Shallow like a 1 inch puddle, a cheap and overly polished PR video not a documentary",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"We all know Mary J Blige as this raw, strong and tough yet kind hearted soft inside woman with a powerful voice, who had her share of trouble and hardships in life.But judging from this documentary you definitely dont feel or sense that. Unlike the EXCELLENT documentary. Supervillian : making of Takashi 69 (i dont like him or music but the docu is first class) where you really get the sense of how his character was built, who he is and what he is about , nothing of that is present in this doc. About Mary J .Except a few passing mentions of life in projects and how tough life is there is absolutely nothing worthwhile said specifically about her struggles, her life, how she saved herself. This film does a huge disservice to her image and the strenght she possessed to stay upright after all that has happened. Of which nothing really is said here.A terrible lame product which mocks the term documentary, more like a product of her PR team and created to be ""appropriate"" for ""ages from 5 to 95"" with no bad words, no portrayals of how bad her life actually got, no truth or what it took for her character to be forged.Pathetic shallow money product to put on shelves for fans of any age to buy while buying a T-shirt and a mug with her name on it.",False
5,7,In the sunshine...,cdoggy99,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis doc felt more like a thank you letter to her fans as opposed to a film giving us an inside look into what was going on during the making of Mary's ""My Life"" album. Now to anyone who doesn't know much about Mary J. And who wants to be more informed about her career during the making of ""My Life"", you will find this film informative. But to anyone who is even a mild fan, all the issues covered is old news. Mary's music mostly deals with life's pain. And this film tells you that time and time again but we know this. Anyone who has listened to any of Mary's albums know this. We know she was raised in the projects and had to deal with all the issues and challenges that come with that. I have always been amazed by how Mary articulates her pain thru her music so vividly and that's what draws me to her and her music. But this doc did nothing to enhance or reduce that experience for me.",True
6,6,positive spin,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. The project began as a way to document the 25th anniversary of Mary J Blige's enormously influential album ""My Way"" and her celebratory live performance to mark the milestone of the album. Vanessa Roth won an Oscar for Best Documentary Short Subject FREEHELD (2007), and as director of this film, she turned it into a profile of the woman behind the music, resulting in surprisingly effective life lessons for those in need.As if to caution viewers that this is more than a concert film, we are five minutes in before director Roth allows us to hear Mary sing. We learn of her childhood in poverty living in the Yonkers projects, and how singing was her escape - a way to feel free. It was Sean ""Diddy"" Combs who discovered her for Uptown Records. Of course, Combs is now a hugely successful producer, musician, and entrepreneur, and he's forthcoming in his recollections of those early years. ""My Life"" was Mary's second album, and she's credited with blending hip-hop and R&B and bringing a new music style to the masses. How successful has she been? Try 31 Grammy nominations (9 wins) and Two Oscar nominations (including one for acting).Actress Taraji P Henson and multi-Grammy winning musician Alicia Keys both provide perspective on Mary's influence, not just in the music world, but also in helping women believe in themselves. Mary J Blige has had emotional struggles, survived an abusive relationship, and overcome addictions to drugs and alcohol. Sharing her story and how she has persisted through the years turns this into a story of feelings, truth, and heart. The music is impressive and provides the platform, however, it's the woman who shines through here.Available exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on June 25, 2021.",False
7,10,HUGE Mary fan since day 1,ylwashington,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerWatched this yesterday and it did not disappoint. We all know her story with that dysfunctional relationship with KaCi from Jodeci but to here it from her vantage points to explain what she was going through.. was heartfelt and very emotional. I cried with her and My Life ALbum has also got me through some tough times. Excellent Doc. I am glad Mary is still here that we can give her her flowers now.,True
8,7,Inside ... revelations,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Do you like her music? Do you want to know what inspired it, how she grew up and what made her the person she is today or the person she was making the songs? There is a lot we learn ... actually a lot she seems to have learned over the years.So this is a close and behind the scenes look if you want to call it that. I really dug it overall, but I reckon you have to be a fan to fully appreciate it. She has done so much for the music industry, that maybe some feel that the documentary should have been more extensive ... I understand that too. Still a really in depth look and depiction of so many things connected to Mary J. Blige.",False
9,10,The Truth,drob0214,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mary J Blige what can I say ? I remember the first time I saw her she was in khaki pants and combat boots and stayed bent over blowing out her lyrics. She brought the truth then and she continues to do so today. Next chapter Mary, your fans are waiting with open arms!",False
10,3,All that hype for nothing,mgitts1977,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was watered down, and not as interesting as I thought it was going to be. Not saying she needs to tell the world ALL of her business, but she was so guarded about so much... If you're going to title a documentary ""My Life""...and don't give us a real glimpse of really who you are... Why bother? A waste of time.The Mike Tyson documentary was so so much better... Now that's a true documentary... Entertaining, Real, and Honest with the good & the bad.",False
11,9,OUR Life,cafria,n/a,16/08/2025,The tears began to roll in the opening minutes and flowed freely throughout the reel. Mary's story is resonant. Deeper than the words spoken. The truth and power is felt in the gut. So many of us remember what the My Life album did for us and this movie is an emotional and triumphant walk down memory lane. The victory is deeply OURS as much as hers. True fans will be moved deeply and emerge inspired for what your own tomorrows hold. You'll be grateful. And just when you didn't think it was possible - you'll love Mary even more than you already did.,False
12,2,Self indulgent puffery,lindaloouk,n/a,16/08/2025,Nothing to see here. Don't taint your view of Mary J's talent by watching this egotistical and self indulgent tripe.,False
13,10,Mary's fans will love it. Others? Who knows...,jankypenny,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was in high school when Mary's first album, ""What's the 411?"" came out and have been a fan ever since. If you also grew up on 90s hip hop and R&B, you'll probably enjoy this for the nostalgia factor alone. The documentary shed some light onto Mary's childhood and early years as an artist. Mary's voice is featured prominently throughout. 10 out 10 for me.",False
14,10,Heart fullfilled,traviswomack,n/a,16/08/2025,In tsars with this one. Answers questions true original Mary j blige fans always desperately wanted to know about the star even if they hâve forgotten.mary love you your a true icôn. Many days with Your music to help me.my heart Is fulfilled. Thank you.,False
15,2,Confused,jasarrubbo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis worst part of the documentary is the added meet and greet clips. It's seems so fake, like she didn't even want to meet the fans, I don't understand why they even put those clips in there. Then there is random scenes with her fans having kind of a therapy session, what? So disappointed in this, I love Mary J Blige.",True
16,10,"""Music Saves You""",hillar-36881,n/a,16/08/2025,"""My Life"" is my favorite album by Mary J. Blige so I enjoyed watching her talk about how it reflected her personal life. As she talks about this album, she even says, ""music saves you."" This is so true. Music is therapy for many people and I don't know what I would do without it.",False
17,3,Not what I was looking for,stevieclassics,n/a,16/08/2025,Seems like they only concentrated on her life with KC when we all know she had many many more issues after him. So what are as the point. She had a career that spanned over 30 years and 11 more albums. Where is the rest of it.,False
18,9,Loved it!,shaheedahdavenport,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHonestly it needed a series, it ended on a weird note. Skipped from my life to marys 50th bday. Overall I enjoyed the documentary.",True
19,8,Great docu about Mary's early career,altur-74696,n/a,16/08/2025,"Im afraid 90% of the audience who leave here 2-3 points for My Life didn't get the main concept of this movie. It's not about all MJB's splendid careers. It's about some most challenging years in her life and it completely shows why she recorded My Life - imho, her best album ever and I agree with Mary, it's so perfect and dark at the same time - but it's very real. The movie was released as part of 25th anniversary of My Life. With several vinyl reissues (and I've got one). I had no clue about Mary's early life so It was very interesting for me. Btw, Mary is another proof there's no such phenomenon as ""systemic racism"", because if that thing was real, poor black talented girl from the project would never be able to sell 2 platinum albums by 20 yo, she would be never allowed to make million and become the US show business queen. Because if there really was that ""systemic racism"", she would be forced to stay in her project forever. But luckily she is a very hardworking, focused and very wise person, and I admire MJB.",False
20,5,Heard it all before,knicolebeagle,n/a,16/08/2025,Not much we have not heard before. I love MJB. But I have heard this before.,False
21,9,Glimpse into Mary's life,tonyareaves,n/a,16/08/2025,The documentary shared some of the hurt Mary endured and how she continuously fought. It was a glimpse into her life. Her music has always expressed her pain and joy.,False
22,4,It was a letdown,nrgigaba,n/a,16/08/2025,"Earlier this year (2021) I watched ""Tina"" which redefined the documentary genre for me especially for survivors of abuse.What disappointed me about this documentary is that Mary has shared a lot of herself through her music. This documentary was the golden opportunity to expand on who she was but several times she held back. I fully understand how survivors never wanna talk about their bad experiences because they do not wanna retraumatize themselves but sadly she gave us a lousy documentary that revealed nothing which I would recommend people to watch it for. I'm being kind giving it a 4 star rating because I love Mary but this documentary shouldn't have been made. It was a waste of time and resources.",False
23,9,Moving and inspires introspection,sclahu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although she does not share intimate details, the entire story is one that so many people can connect to. It's really a story about the humanity of struggle and the personal struggles that people face inside everyday. It's even harder to watch feeling that there is so much that she still holds inside and still hasn't fully healed from. Anybody that is judging this really is missing the point. This is art. It's her story told her way. If you didn't relate or connect it probably just wasn't for you.",False
24,10,She i🎶🎶🎶🎼,croixc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mad love! I needed this! My Life was the best CD! Yass CD! I understand, I understood! Her talent is undeniable, she is fabulous! I think the low ratings have to do with her being a Black Woman! However We love her!",False
25,2,Old News,kenyasstewart,n/a,16/08/2025,Repetitive and boring. Bad concert clips. Mary told us nothing new nor compelling. Waste of time as we knew all this info before. Plus it felt dated as it was made in 2019.,False

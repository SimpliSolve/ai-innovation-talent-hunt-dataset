1,6,An enjoyable documentary...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I stumbled upon the 2021 documentary ""Le Règne Des Super-Héroïnes"" by random chance. And having spent a lot of time in my late teens and early adult years reading comic books, and having just recently returned to the world of comics, of course I opted to sit down and watch this documentary from directors Xavier Fournier and Frédéric Ralière.""Le Règne Des Super-Héroïnes"" does offer a good amount of insight into the world of female-front superhero comic books, so it actually proved to be an entertaining, enjoyable and enlightening documentary. And it is one that I definitely can recommend you watch, especially if you read comic books.This documentary does get around some of the currently major superhero titles that has females in the lead, as well as covering the classic Wonder Woman character, whom helped start the wave of female-fronted comic books with superheroes.While ""Le Règne Des Super-Héroïnes"" is a documentary that uses both French and English language, you shouldn't let that scare you or prevent you from sitting down to watch it.I learned a lot of new stuff as I sat through ""Le Règne Des Super-Héroïnes"", despite the fact I am not reading these particular titles that were covered by the documentary.My rating of ""Le Règne Des Super-Héroïnes"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",False
2,1,A one sided look at Women in comics,lordzedd-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's somewhat informative. But for some reason it only had French writers and cosplayers, it doesn't really show the impact on the women of the world, just women of France and so much needless padding with cosplayers doing nothing but posing. But dubbing or subtitling the narrator makes more sense than having the original narrator speak while the English narrator speaking at the same time. Plus, if I didn't know this was directed by a man, I swear it was some WOKE version of women in comic books as the negative history of the males in comic books is hammered pretty hard. The sexism, the misogyny but nothing on how male creators help elevate women in comics. Lastly, and I pretty much blame HBO Max for this. Why was it rated TV-MA? Because heaven forbid they show LGBTQ community in a positive light or that they mention gay comic book heroes at all? Either way, this is amazingly one sided for a man directing, bad audio and needless padding.",True

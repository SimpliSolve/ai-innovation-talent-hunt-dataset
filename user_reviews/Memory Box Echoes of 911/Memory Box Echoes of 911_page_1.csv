1,9,"Greatly Unique and much Needed ""take on,"" insight to, and perspective...",sarah-4321,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is very much a needed and a unique perspective and way of revealing the impacts and effects of the airplane attacks in September 2001. .... It was and is an excellent idea to build a soundproof ""box"" (little room) for people to share their thoughts, stories, and traumas with a camera that they themselves use a remote to control. .... Persons directly affected in all three sites in NY, DC, and PA tell their stories. Some of them were *in* the buildings that were struck in the case of NY and DC plane attacks. ... There are no ""interviews."" Each person just sits there and talks to the camera. ... It is heart-wrenching, poignant, and exceedingly 'difficult' so to speak. Actually, there aren't adequate verbs for this.... // It is very much worth watching, even if you think you've seen and heard ""enough"" about September 2001. ... As another reviewer said, the editing is excellent. The documentary captures the heart, soul, and pain of what happened person by person by person. ... Each is a very personal story, and some are just a couple minutes long, as that was the extent to which some humans were able to talk about it, even in the ""isolation chamber box"" at the time this project was done. Personally, i truly and fully recommend watching it, brothers and sisters of the world. *Thank* you to the entire team that developed this project; there are other aftermaths for which this process would apply, such as a year or so after the January 6, 2021 mob attacks on the u.s. Capitol and its peoples.",False
2,10,MUST WATCH!!!!,tb-90424,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heartwarming details from the people that went through a devastating part of our history, and what life has brought them twenty years later!!!",False
3,10,Astonishing,Michael Fargo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Filmmakers David Belton and Bj√∏rn Johnson state they wanted to find a ""new way"" of dealing with what happened to the World on September 11, 2001. And seemingly, the material has been gone over endlessly, yet while we know--intimately--the details of that day, what is captured here is the impact it had on those who were either witnesses or survivors both then and now. And indeed it is a new way of looking both at the historical narrative as well as the personal impact of a seminal event in World History. The value of what's collected and expertly edited into this astonishing film will be just one more step in integrating what is both good and bad in ourselves and our lives, and how some certainly arose from the flames, the dust and the ashes of that day.",False
4,10,The Best One I Saw,Hitchcoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"People step into a big wooden box and reveal their thoughts shortly after the attack on the Twin Towers. They later come back after twenty years. It is poignant and gentle and respectfully done. If you want to get at the human side of this horrible event, don't miss this presentation.",False
5,6,Terrible Editing,beewee85,n/a,16/08/2025,"The stories were quite interesting to hear.But the editing was so annoying, the teasing type of editing. Trying to keep you waiting. They didn't even play the full video of the planes. They just stopped the film for some extra effect. A ridiculous way to edit such a profound subject. Ugh disgusting.",False

1,8,A true pioneer,darren-153-890810,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI admit, I didn't know much about Genesis P-Orridge beyond her work with Throbbing Gristle (a cheeky nod to ""northern slang for erection"") and Psychic TV. She was always someone I wanted to learn more about.Recently, I was lucky enough to attend a screening of a remarkable documentary on her life, followed by a Q&A with the director and two members of Psychic TV.Genesis was so much more than a musician, artist, philosopher, cult figure, and performer. She was a devoted parent who relentlessly challenged societal norms and exposed the ways media manipulates us. Through her art, she pushed against accepted ideas of ""normal,"" which led to backlash, ridicule in the press, and even threats from Scotland Yard.This documentary captures an extraordinary journey of a true pioneer-someone who not only helped invent a new genre of music, industrial, but whose search for ultimate love left her vulnerable and, in some ways, unhealed.A must-see for the curious.",True

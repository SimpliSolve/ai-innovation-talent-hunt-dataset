1,7,Michael is insufferable,ktfoodstylist,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guy is a drama queen from the word go, he's ridiculous and performative and annoying and nearly makes this series unwatchable. He can't just answer a question, he has to twist his stupid face around and gesture wildly like a bad vaudeville hack. He's clearly a liar. The story is compelling but this guy is the WORST. He's oddly effeminate and cartoon-level expressive and tries to drive the narrative, and he's really kind of gross. How did the producers let him have so much leeway? If he's asked a question he doesn't want to answer he either cries like a toddler or rages out and storms off. He dresses like a 9th grader. Poor Natalia, and I feel for those other kids (the biological boys).",False
2,6,Baffled and saddened and thoroughly entertained.,amychase-43235,n/a,16/08/2025,"How is it that scientists can determine the age of ancient humans from over 200,000 years ago, but no medical doctor could determine this poor girl's age.Also, 90% of the people interviewed in this doc are despicable, foolish and/or ignorant people.This Michael Barnett is an especially dubious character. I want to compare him to a used car salesman, but that would be insulting to the salesmen. He sure is one slimy, narcissistic, manipulative piece of garbage.I am giving this a rating of 6 though because it's very entertaining. I'm losing time and brain cells watching it, but I can't seem to turn away.",False
3,6,Potentially Amazing Docuseries Botched by Terrible Choices by the Crew,cranium889,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTHE CURIOUS CASE OF NATALIA GRACE
should be called
THE CURIOUS CASE OF A DOCUMENTARY CREW ALLOWING A PERFORMATIVE SCUMBAG TO HIJACK THE SHOOT AND GET HIS OWN SERIES PRETENDING HE DIDN'T NEGLECT & ABUSE A CHILD WITH A DISABILITYSeriously, this is an astonishingly heartbreaking story that's totally botched by the production desperately trying to turn it into a mystery and going all in on this annoying, bad actor.What's worse is that by allowing Michael Barnett this platform, they don't just gloss over how a child prodigy is probably forever ruined by the trauma he suffered as a child, but forces him to relive it, despite repeatedly begging not to discuss it.So watch a shocking story about how a life was ruined and witness an overlooked victim get exploited.",True
4,6,This was so deeply heartbreaking.,adiadolan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA lot of the reviews are talking about how the documentary was confusing, and while the material itself is confusing, I was able to follow the directors main drive. That's where I am deeply saddened and disturbed. When you think about the facts of this case, when you lay it all out there you can clearly see that Natalie WAS a child and suffered extreme abuse. It is so so clear, and I think you can come to that conclusion even before hearing from the dad. She was constantly in distress, in bad hygiene, hungry, and confused! She had no understanding of social cues and displayed distressing behavior. But she was 9 years old abandoned and suffering. I wanted to write this in case the directors of this documentary just happen to be reading comments. How could you! How could you make this documentary with such a vivid image that Natalie was a child, and solely focus on her abuser? The documentary continued to paint the narrative that she is creepy, she is something to be fear, it has three episodes that just blast her for being a social inadequate neighbor. But not bringing it back around to say ""hey, you know why people might have thought she was weird? Because they thought she was 26 when in reality she was A CHILD""!!!!My heart breaks for her. I really hope if there is anything more to be documented on this, that they take time to make right what this documentary got so so grossly wrong! This was neglect. It was complete neglect of someone who was the most vulnerable you can be. A child with a disability! I hope she is loved, I hope she is cared for and I hope she finds peace! And I hope everyone who made this documentary takes a moment to recognize the storyline they've chosen to follow is grossly unjust!I loved the lady narrator, I believe she was an attorney, who lad out the facts for us, or else this documentary would have had nothing sustainable. Also she was hot.ANYWAYS!!! This was terrible and heartbreaking. It should have been about justice for this poor girl. Thanks.",True
5,n/a,"Terrible production, no moral and no empathy",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTo the producers: Another one of those speculative and tasteless documentaries, with the sole purpose to get attention and make money. I don't understand how it can be legal to expose a child this way. This is a child with disabilities, and she has been through trauma after trauma. You use neighbours as character witnesses, neighbours who believe she is an adult, who don't understand she is a traumatised child. How can you interview the adoptive couple's son? He is clearly under the control, and manipulated, by a deeply disturbed and narcissistic father. And you market this documentary in comparison to the horror movie the Orphan??? Shame on you!Just saw season two. And now the poor girl is exploited again, and in the hands of new predators. Jesus, somebody help her!",True
6,6,Exploitive film making,lucabrazisleeps,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCertainly the case is odd, but at its heart, the twists and turns, is the question of whether Natalia is manipulative and evil or whether her adoptive family is at fault. This is a false premise. Natalia was an orphan who got bounced around from family to family - hence attachment issues. Natalia may have threatened her adoptive family with harm - who wouldn't? Natalia was inappropriate in her apartment complex - that's because she was 8 and not 24. She is overly friendly with neighbors - attachment issues again. She plays with kids - never had a chance to. She says sexually appropriate things - since she was raped at least once (probably more) by the age of 8, she may not be able to assess what is appropriate and inappropriate. Within a two year period, she lives with an (allegedly) abuse mother and histrionic father - is she expected to know social decorum? Eats from people's fridges - she's hungry. She claims to be 24 - she was physically abused and manipulated to say these things. The postscript bolsters the case that she's somehow evil.Bottom line - she was 8 when these things were done to her by adults. A reputable child psychologist would have been an informative interviewee, rather than random people. But somehow the film makers prefer to demonize her.Meanwhile, the film crew keeps recording when the son fails to turn off his mic. Shouldn't they have turned off his mic? When a vulnerable interviewee says they want to stop the interview, it's grossly unethical to keep recording.Yes it's compelling like a train wreck. Yes we care about Natalia. Yes it's ""gone viral"". But a lot of this has to do with how the film makers choose how to tell the story - in a salacious and emotionally manipulative way.",True
7,8,It changed my opinion,colormeunimpressed,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm giving this documentary a high rating solely because I went in believing that this could have been a case of an adult posing as a child and I came out thinking the exact opposite.Michael Barnett was not believable in the least and did himself no favors with the show. I disliked him immediately. I feel bad for their prodigy son who really seems to have suffered some trauma but mostly I feel bad for Natalia. It's quite obvious, if you pay any amount of attention, that she was not an adult but in fact, a child. She was left to fend for herself by an uncaring and highly materialistic family. There was a lot of abuse. That was evident. How much more though? Because I have a feeling she suffered even more than we know.",False
8,7,Don't review documentaries based on outcome,jandifollowill,n/a,16/08/2025,"This story is CRAZY!! I don't understand people giving the series a low rating bc they don't like the events that transpired. What's the point of you watching true crime?! Of course it's all heinous, and it's nothing you would thumbs up if you were reviewing the acts themselves, but you aren't. It does what most do, provides you with one side and then the other and you end you not knowing how you feel about it (""I love you, Now die"" was the same way).It's creepy, it's insane to imagine these things happened for real (bc I have seen ""the orphan"" movies), and yes the dad is a horrible actor, performing what he thinks is necessary to emote his storyline, but the series is still very interesting!If you binged it so hard bc you had to hear the rest of the story, and then gave it a low rating bc you didn't like the outcome, you shouldn't be rating tv or film.",False
9,8,These People Are Idiots!,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHalfway through watching this and these people are idiots.First thing that catches my attention is their reaction, and this is in their own words, as to how they reacted to the child's physical sexual maturity.Instead of taking the child to a doctor or endocrinologist or to a pediatric specialist, they go on a Google search.Any parent with half a brain cell and I'm assuming if he has earned his income legitimately with all the big houses and everything that he has some level of intelligence. And that in this day and age, the mother should know that children are entering puberty younger and younger.So instead of questioning this child, why not take her to a medical professional to see what's going on with her? Of course a child her age will try to hide that she's menstruating. It is not an indication of any sinister motive of the child.At the age of 14 or 15 years old I was embarrassed to tell my mother I had gotten my period. So imagine the alarm of a 6-year-old?If you wanted to be supportive and accepting then, you don't make her feel like a criminal for maturing early. You take her to a medical professional to see what's going on with any pituitary issues, which obviously she has, having dwarfism, and also the doctor by examining her teeth and through x-rays, can give you an idea of the actual age of this child that is your concern.No way does she look like an adult and if you want to stretch it, it could have been possible that she was as old as 10 or even 12, but no why is she an adult.",True
10,7,An accurate depiction of the failures of our systems and the impact of abuse,sam_hare,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSome of y'all in these reviews have never experienced trauma or abuse and it shows. If you come away from S1 with anything other than a solid understanding that Natalia is a child and her adoptive parents are BOTH monsters, I implore you to check your privilege and educate yourselves beyond your lived experiences.Michael repeatedly attempts to victimize himself while simultaneously offering up the most disingenuous performance to try and cover up his complicity in Natalia's abuse.Don't let the over dramatization from the production value detract from the real story here about a young immigrant disabled girl who is emotionally and physically abused by people she is supposed to be able to trust while adults everywhere turn a blind eye and let it happen.S2 was important so Natalia could feel heard, but I do imagine she was likely coached to try and garner sympathy from those that believed Michael's over the top performance in S1. This makes sense because her frustration and anger alone, though completely justified and genuine, likely would not gain her the sympathy from the privileged crowd.Beth Karas provides a balanced perspective and brings legitimacy to this doc, while Michael has the rich white male audacity to come back in S2 with only excuses, gaslighting, and 0 real accountability.The system has failed Natalia Grace and I hope she is successful in any and all further legal actions against Michael and Kristine to get a sliver of justice.",True
11,3,biased sensationalist trash,frogcilfruit,n/a,16/08/2025,"What we get here are 6 episodes of Michael Barnett overacting all sorts of scenarii, the focus always on him instead of the main subject which is Natalia.The filmmakers wallow in all the trashiest sensationalist aspects of the story and, especially Barnett's character, instead of giving a serious account of facts (no doctor is interviewed to give a scientific opinion on her age, no psychiatrist on her mental state). She is not even given the chance to express herself at any point.We're only given Michael Barnett's version which is ridiculous most of the time, so fake it's cringeworthy.This curious story deserved a serious approach, and I feel really bad for the people who were used to make this pseudo-documentary : Natalia and the hell she endured, and also the boys, Jake mostly, who is obviously traumatised by what happened in this house.This is trash, and Michael Barnett is unsufferable.",False
12,10,What a Rollercoaster of a Story,tdwillis-26273,n/a,16/08/2025,Many reviewers upset because they feel like there were no answers by the end. Perhaps they need to re watch and take notes. I gained a lot of factual information.Natalia was failed....time and time again. Even the legal system failed her. The adoptive father was histrionic and unlikeable to me. I do think it's quite probable that the adoptive mother was the main abuser and manipulator. All of the adoptive parents in Natalia's case were weak selfish sick and morally bankrupt individuals.What a F'ed up story all around. It seems as if the truly most innocent that gets the crappiest end of the deal.,False
13,7,OMG! Dad is a horrible Drama Queen!!,Pollard209,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou have to work real hard to get past the over acting by the father.. OMG, he is the worst!But you have to make it to the end!OMG, an adoption horror story. Ukrainian people trafficking children? Forging documents?Murderous adult psycho posing as a child
Then the horror begins, the crazy nightmare behavior, knives, poison, pubic hair.BUT THEN.... You have the stories of all the neighbors. Seriously ,What the heck, this is crazy! What is going on?I'm thinking it's a real crazy Chucky situation , this is really happening.No, it's a horrible adoptive mother that decided she no longer wants this kid?? Why was she so horrible? WTF?! Buyers regret ....
Obviously there's some mental issues that should be addressed. The mom IS a master manipulator. She worked the system and got all of those people to do exactly what she needed to do to dump that child. Dad isn't much better!No balls!Now, I feel so bad for Natalia !What a nightmare! Natalia was wronged, coached , mistreated and abandoned . And because of so many officials in the child protective services, and in the court system failed they're having to cover it up by dismissing all charges on both parties!WOW!! A total injustice.",True
14,5,Wrong title,dannonmcelroy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI feel like this should really be titled ""The Overacting of Michael Barnett."" In many ways it reminded me of The Staircase because Barnett was dictating his side of the story (which frequently changed) and it seemed like he genuinely likes to hear his own voice. He seems so fake and calculated. It is sickening.The son that was interviewed was obviously heavily manipulated by his parents and coached on what to say for the interviews. This is less of a reality based documentary and more a scripted show to tell a he said/she said story in a marriage.Whether she was a child or adult, the Barnetts wronged this girl and so did the documentary for making this less about her and more about the parents.",True
15,6,Entertaining but imho heavily scripted and planned,doriangray-34752,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI will just comment on the Mans family. That seem very shady and typical of people adopting kids just to get state funding and make money while - as another reviewer put it - hiding behind Jesus
I feel they're pushing so hard in the direction of the civil lawsuits and the compensation that will come with it. We see it clear as day in that weird bishop dictating to the poor child how angry she should be when she meets Micheal, what attacks she should do, what words to use, what to accept and what not to accept, reinforcing certain ideas in her mind, and then trying to antagonize Michael to get him to lose his temper on camera. The saddest thing is that everyone in this child's life was and is taking advantage of her.",True
16,6,Interesting But Not Inspirational,writetonight-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI just watched the 2nd season on ID, which deals with Natalia's life after she is adopted by Cynthia & Antwon Mans. It was 90% commercials and could have been much shorter. They stretched it out to three episodes, but it could have been one.As any reasonable person would suspect after watching the first season, Mr. & Mrs. Mans were exploiting Natalia and stealing her money, and they used Christianity as a cover for their wrong-doing. Any time someone calls Cynthia Mans out on the fact that she has being using Natalia, Cynthia says, ""I rebuke you in the name of Jesus"" or she calls the person a demon.With the producers' encouragement, Natalia reaches out to the DePauls, an adult couple who, like Natalia, have Dwarfism. They had tried to adopt Natalia when she was a child, but the adoption did not work out. They have one daughter who is younger than Natalia, and who is a college student. Mrs. DePaul can see how far behind Natalia's education and emotional growth is.Natalia is so oppressed by her adoptive parents that she has to go through her boyfriend to get in touch with Mrs. DePaul. (The boyfriend is in the U. K. and Natalia has never met him in person.) Natalia tells Mrs. DePaul that life with the Mans family is like being held prisoner.Mrs. DePaul goes to Tennessee to get Natalia, and brings her back to her home in upstate New York. Natalia is finally in a non-abusive home where she has a chance to heal, but it takes a long time for her to break free from her anbusive adoptive parents; Natalia seems to really believe that Antwon Mans has faith-healing powers.In the end, Natalia is shown going for an interview and photoshoot with People Magazine. Natalia recites a bunch of platitudes like, ""You can do anything you set your mind to."" This annoyed me, because Natalia accomplished nothing on her own. If anyone on the show should be held up as a figure for what one can accomplish with determination, it should be Mrs. DePaul and her family, who sacrificed their peaceful family life to help a very traumatized young woman. Natalia remained emotionally attached to her abusive adopted parents, and continued to let them collect her SSI benefits and earnings from personal appearances, even when Natalia was no longer living with them and needed her money for her own living and medical expenses. The DePauls effectively (although not legally) adopted Natalia. Although they tried to treat Natalia as an adult, Natalia was not capable of doing things on her own, and she clearly needed Mrs. DePaul's guidance.It finally sinks in that her adoptive parents were stealing from her, but Natalia needs Mrs. DePaul's help to get a lawyer and fight back. Natalia accomplishes nothing on her own. So, while Natalia's life story may be so full of plot twists that it's entertaining to watch, Natalia herself is not yet an inspirational figure. She still has a lot of healing and catching up to do.",True
17,7,"Engaging, but everyone was terrible",tessamsf,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched the whole thing in a few days. This is a documentary where you root for absolutely no one, except a few (not even all) of the neighbors. The family is despicable (note: the mom capitalized on her son's autism by writing a book when he was a child that made her a TON of money and TED talks, etc).The adopted girl/person is clearly a liar and frankly, I don't trust anything she said, the family is ridiculously unlikable, and the main interviewee, the father Michael, is awful to the point of wanting to turn it off. He's obnoxious, dishonest, hyperactive, and histrionic.Altogether, I hope they all lose - and while that may sound unbelievably cruel if you believe one of the two narratives provided in the doc, I really believe something in the middle, and root for none of them.",False
18,8,Everyone's A Liar,rundmc1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm giving this series an 8 not because it's actually that good from a storytelling or filming POV but b/c it's ""can't look away"" tv. It's like a slightly more cerebral Jerry Springer show that goes on and on but is endlessly fascinating. Literally, almost NO ONE in this story is sympathetic and it seems clear that almost EVERYONE is lying or just a fantabulist.To those who think Natalia is an abused, disabled person - I do believe she was abused. She is clearly disabled. But, so sorry - abused disabled people can still be liars and sociopaths. Virtually everyone who encountered her either wanted nothing to do with her after a short period of time and/or seems to be making up stories about how sweet she is (and that's only a few people) for the cameras or (like the Mans family) because they are possibly looking for a payday through civil suits down the way. The way she denies doing/saying things that numerous people have claimed (including many people with no reason to lie), then when confronted with other witnesses starts fake crying and deflecting was super suspect. And, yes - fake crying. She makes the motions of crying throughout this series but there are no tears. It's just weird.Then, the Mans' as her new adoptive family - who claim she's the sweetest kid - but seem to get flustered when it's pointed out that they tried to dump her at a hospital too when she attacked their other kids. ""No; I never said that; someone (like her former adoptive mom who had no reason to even know she was in a hospital until contacted) must have made that up."" Hmmmm.The Mans family is just odd. I'm really hoping they aren't con artists but there is something just off about them. And, no - it's not because they have a bunch of other adoptive children. It's mostly because they seem to be dissembling every step of the way. (Also, I have no problem with people who are deeply religious but chasing someone down the street saying they need to find God is an immediate ""weirdo alert"" in my book).I won't repeat everything other posters have to say about Michael Barnett except to wholeheartedly agree that he's a histrionic buffoon. He seems completely unreliable about virtually every single thing he says. ""Nuff said.The so-called ""legal expert"" in the show was almost as insufferable as Michael. For one thing, I'm a lawyer but I don't know what a ""legal expert"" is. Is she a lawyer? Is she an LLM? A professor? I've never heard of someone who's a ""legal expert"" who isn't a lawyer. But, the one thing I do know is that she's trying to style herself as some kind of non-lawyer expert on the law and she gets an awful lot wrong about it but is also clearly an advocate for Natalia. That's all fine but don't try to say you're some unbiased ""expert."" Just say you're an advocate for disabled kids/adults. Whatever she was, she had FAR too much screen time and added nothing to the overall story.The only people I could stand in this series were Michael Barnett's attorney who seemed super competent and had his head on straight and Jacob, the Barnett's son, who seemed to be as truly abused in his household as Natalia claimed to be.Of course, the wild card is Christine Barnett. Wisely, she decided to steer clear of this train wreck which says something for her judgment. There is clear and documented evidence of questionable behavior on her part in the past but since we don't know her side of the story from her own lips, I reserve judgment on her.I'm sure there'll be more to this story which is clear just from the very last scene alone. Despite the tabloid aspect of it, I'll still be watching.",True
19,6,The producers of the documentary didn't do a good job morally and ethically,simonavoicescu,n/a,16/08/2025,"My stars review come only for the DePaul family and Natalia's life story, in any way for the quality of the documentary.Absolutely heartbreaking - a young woman with complex trauma presented as a villan. The documentary was much longer than it needed to be, a whole season for that buffoon of a man?? Seriously? The producers of the documentary didn't do a good job morally and ethically. The story is that of a child adopted into the US from Ukraine that went from bad to worst, she was sold by the first sdopting family, tortured and abandoned by the second, beatean and taken advantage by the 3rd and there are no legal consequeances for all this monsters living and continuing to deceive and steal and torture others. It's mind blowing! Ther's absolutly no justice in all 3 seasons. It's impossible for me to understand how this is even happening? Nobody in jail? Nobody?She was not socilised, she had no documentsm, she was not registred to any kind of education institution, she was kep for the most part of her life as a human punching bag and credit card.The only decent people in this entire story are the DePaul family and I'm happy she got to meet them again and they had the patience, understanding and so much love to try to make it work.She'll have to deal with her trauma for the rest of her life and I really hope that there is a functional justice system somewhere and I'll get to read the news at some point that all this families are being held legally liable.",False
20,1,See Life Through the Eyes of a Hystrionic Criminal!,deglispiriti,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""documentary,"" which leans heavily on the narration of a bona fide fool, drags viewers through the case of heinous mistreatment of a disabled child on an international scale. The film is six (6) hours of vile, sensationalist hyperbole from a decompensating, hystrionic criminal. Mr. Barnett is a certified buffoon, and the documentarians treat him as a protagonist starring in his own delusion. They actually burn hours of coverage of a liar with no redeeming qualities. The truth of his negligence, abuse, abandonment, and open disdain for the adopted daughter he treated like an animal is obscured by two Indiana judges. And adding exponentially to the flagrant injustice, the film's entire sensationalist approach to the disabled girl in its first two episodes is unforgivable. Do not waste your time on this trash.

I am just so grossed out that these people, these monsters got away with what they did to this child.

However, some of the biggest questions were NOT answered.1. How were the parents able to change her age so easily? This seems to be a more serious SYSTEMIC issue because this allows sexual predators to potentially abuse the system.2. Why the court is allowed to disregard the girl's real biological age? Seems like it's a play to cover their own grave mistake.3. Recall after Natalia started living by herself on her own in the first neighborhood, neighbors didn't particularly like her.

Michael Barnett is a walking clown, and we even turned him crying into a drinking game. Unfortunately we had to stop or we'd risk alcohol poisoning. Even that didn't make this story any better.

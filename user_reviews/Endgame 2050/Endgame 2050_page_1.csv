1,6,Worth a watch,jaycop,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm confused why the narrator is a ""physician"" who can talks like someone who just learned to speak English for a documentary filmed in English...",False
2,2,Borders on propaganda,koodosgrub,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narrator and ""presentation"" style give it a cheap high school instructional video vibe. It has tidbits of scientific facts that address things like climate change and overpopulation; but their message is lost with Moby's pessimistic, and at times hostile, commentary. All of which are completely unnecessary. When did Moby suddenly become a scientist? Any credibility for the entire ""documentary"" is completely voided when they went from being objective, to clearly pushing what could be called propaganda, an ""agenda"", or pushing a very specific narrative. Don't waste your time with this one.",False
3,8,Specific recommendations on how to save the planet...,ulisses_phoenix,n/a,16/08/2025,"When 'An Inconvenient Truth' came out, it covered the scientific evidence (at the time) for climate change, however, it spent very little time providing specific advise on what individuals could do about it. 'Endgame 2050' picks up where 'An Inconvenient Truth' left off, providing recommendations for individual action, as well as many other reasons why taking those actions can help.This documentary uses a series of scripted live vignettes interwoven with traditional documentary style content (voice-over and monologue to the camera). The acting is not too good in these vignettes depicting the future, but it's meant to be demonstrative rather than performatory or entertaining. It just conveys the information that the producers want to convey. This is no subtle presentation that tries to trick you into changing your mind (like many Hollywood films do), rather it's a straight sales job that says, ""Here's what we think you should do, now you decide.""It's refreshing to see that kind of honesty in persuasive material. Moby became a vegan three decades ago for animal rights reasons and he tells you that right in the film -- no hidden agenda here. But he and Sofia Pineda Ochoa simply explain that there are many other reasons why they believe it's good for animals, people and the planet.Some of the scenes are pretty graphic, showing various animals that have been wounded by anthropogenic causes, but the producers spared the viewers from the most graphic slaughterhouse scenes, cutting away before the dismemberment happens.One issue I had with the film was the stereotypical treatment of people with mental illness, which was frankly disrespectful. I'm sure that wasn't intended and was due to ignorance on the part of the produces. Well, now they know...Also, they make the mistake of using text-only presentation of salient information toward the end of the film -- many people will not get those messages because many people can't or don't read textual content in film either because of illiteracy, dyslexia or simple laziness.Another gapping hole in the content was specific advise on how to cut down on gasoline consumption (the greatest direct source of greenhouse gas) -- like hitchhiking, driving slower, or buying an electric car.I recommend this film for those who would like to know what they can actually do to help mitigate climate change and to help relieve the suffering of animals, too.Triggers: stereotypical treatment of mental illness, graphic depictions of the mistreatment of animals, textual content at up to 200 wpm.",False
4,1,The sky is falling! Again!,Mikeyh0,n/a,16/08/2025,"And this time it's FOR REAL! /s. This is probably the sequel to the great documentary ""Endgame 2000"". They just can't seem to get the year of our total demise quite right. Why is that? I thought the science was settled. I was looking forward to having beach front property here in Tucson by now. Darn it.",False
5,10,The narrator lady literally gave me a headache,prutzmanalexis,n/a,16/08/2025,Why did they pick the narrator who has a hard time speaking english in a documentary that is SO serious? Very frustrating. The tone of her voice is broken and she cannot speak English as a first language. Other than that this documentary deserves ten stars. Not sure why people have a hard time discussing population control....it's real. Grow up and stop being offending by everything in the world. TAKE ACTION,False
6,1,Bait and switch,mrgoss-84177,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIt's basically a dramatic vegan infomercial. The plastics part is interesting and the slaughterhouse scenes are sad.,True
7,10,Changes would be effective.,wolverton7,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a MUST WATCH documentary.
Dr. Sophia Pineda Ochoa, who produced, directed and wrote this documentary is due our gratitude.
In simple words, she and her team describe how we are destroying our planet.
We can't continue to live in denial. There are simple changes we can make to save our planet.",False
8,1,Corporate GREED ...,scriptdoctor-34633,n/a,16/08/2025,"... shaped the culture of endless consumption and production thruh exploitation, media thruh commercials and marketing proppeled the brainwashing of the consumer that all this is good, Moby himself made money of that culture.Now here we have recently a bunch of mockumentaries that now blame it all on the consumer and conclude we should drastically reduce the amount of consumers. Funny when rich people make this kind of suggestions while still continue their pursuit of corporate GREED.Scarcity makes resources valuable, thats the new greedy exploitation scam run by corporations from 2020 on. DONT LET THEM!!!",False
9,1,Vegan Propaganda,StarOpus,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was expecting to see a documentary about sustainability and even self-sufficiency. In the end it just summed up the worlds problems in the idea that there are too many people in the world, how immoral it is to eat meat and that eating meat and fish is killing us and giving us all cancer! Other than the fact that it ignored that we have been eating meat with pleasure for millions of years, it offered no solutions such as lab grown meat and completely ignored self-sufficiency. It was nothing but a vehicle to shove vegan propaganda down the viewers throat. The writer of this documentary said she surgically sterilized herself to make the world a better place (she really is that crazy), that's the only good she will ever do! One of the worst pieces of propaganda I've seen in a while.",False
10,10,Must watch,larsniklasson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is clearly not a high-budget documentary, and the acting and narrating is not that good. But the content is of utmost importance. Watching this is not going to be comfortable or funny. But it may change your life. Everyone should see this.",False
11,1,Propaganda Documentary,mov13junk13,n/a,16/08/2025,"We do have a serious problem on earth, but this documentary doesnt come even
close to the real cause and hence is deceiving as Michael Moores recent documentary is. I will save my energy and not write pages of rant about it but probably do a YT-video that deals with certain agendas currently put in motion, how pseudo-documentarys spread a false narrative and how those who benefited the most during the last decades for instigating all the mess on earth are now the same that impose a new wave of deception on the population of this planet and are framing it as the solution for ""the greater good"".",False
12,9,Convinced me to go vegan,richnvel,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm a 78 year old man eating poorly all my life. The slaughterhouse scenes caused me to rethink meat. The remaining dialogue convinced me to go vegan.,False
13,n/a,Some Truth In It,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was expecting more about the dangers of AI , social engineering and so on.
Global warmings have been happening before and independently of man.
This show reduced nearly all our problems to just eating meat.",False
14,4,Basically a vegetarian promotion,andyonmob,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some interesting points made in the film but it is too much built on the promotion of vegetarianism, which means the main message will be ignored. Instead of promoting sensible change as is happening with lab grown meat products, they simply promote total vegetarianism. Plastics should be banned of course and population growth needs to be addressed. Renewable energy is coming along rapidly but there is only one real message in this film and it should be labelled as such.",False
15,10,If you're a human you kinda have no choice but to watch this,nataliearlt,n/a,16/08/2025,I gave this a 10 not because it's a great high budget movie with great acting but because it is so incredibly important. It has different kind of proffessionals talking about different kind of subjects all related to how humans are destroying the only planet we have. We all have a responsibility for this planet and watching this movie will give you a better idea on what you yourself can do. Just watch it.,False
16,2,Junk Science. PH UNIT,jeffolskey,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is so sad people are so ignorant of science.
First, the oceans are becoming acidic faster than predicted, a quote ovens will drop 4 pH units. SIMPLE SHOULD WENT TO CLASS. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A pH unit.
Second, it is okay to eat meat, it has been proven sustainable by the market. Farm raised do not have strange parasites that there wild cousins have no immunity. Why would the fishery allow parasites into there ponds? Ludicrous?. So the captive fish are not going to escape. Whew. Any fishery is there to above all else make a profit.
Phytoplankton, do in fact make 50% of the available O2 in Earth's atmosphere, basic ecosystem, CO2 rises buffers kick in, phytoplankton will reproduce more. And tell that stupid woman methane does not freeze on earth. Methane equals decomposition. Sky is falling. She says, global temps have risen dramatically. Simply not true.
Can one give a rating to fear mongering.",True
17,1,WOKE fear mongers,mafiawarsaddict,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another BS movie, WOKE movement, End of times. Seriously every decade (yr) some idiot tries to push this. Guess what it has not happened and it wont. Eat meat it is good for you. Morons.",False
18,10,Addresses the two biggest drivers of the environmental crisis,veraxbradass,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am an environmental documentary junkie, and I have encountered no other documentary that is honest about what the two biggest drivers of the environmental crisis are (this arguably makes it the best documentary ever).Anyone who denies the major points of this documentaay is scientifically ignorant or in denial. But you don't have to take my word for it, nor the naysayers'; feel free to see what the science says for yourself:""We now have 15,000 scientists from 175 countries as members of the Alliance of World Scientists.

19,1,BLAH BLAH ............ AND MORE BLAH,reellycynical,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please. Anyone who thinks that the human race is going to ""decimate the Planet Earth"" is smoking crack. This planet is 4.5 BILLION YEARS OLD.You think Humans are going to be around in another 5,000 years? 10,000 years? 100,000 years?STOP FEAR MONGERING.GARBAGE MOVIE.",False
20,10,***********MUST WATCH************,chris-laughren,n/a,16/08/2025,"We, as individuals and as a species, are only a little smarter than chimps. Our behaviour relative the earth, mimic a virus. The good news for the planet is, human activity will eventually increase the PH level in our oceans and this will make life for phytoplankton impossible, which, in turn, will make life for humans impossible. Phytoplankton is responsible for 50% of the oxygen your lungs just breathed in. Earth will respond and rebound after the 6th extinction. It's a shame no one will be around to marvel in its wonder.",False
21,1,eco crap movie,gfarrell0,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poor quality, misleading, want to be inconvenient truth. USA is 4% of world population unless you can effect the 3 largest populations in the world you have very little effect on the climate of the world.",False
22,10,MUST WATCH,heikki-toikander,n/a,16/08/2025,Please watch this. I don't know what to write here. This document contains everything you should know.,False
23,4,"Good Info, but over the top and Moby being Moby",dcmackdon,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc has good info, BUT they never really answer the over population issue. They talk about eating plant based, but they also talked about a shortage of agriculture areas, huh. There is a short film, it was high school level. One doctor calls everyone morons, while I do agree, but he literally did not answer the question at hand. Some of the 'over population' answers were gender equality, equal pay, equal education and 'think' about smaller families and adopt? Adoption happens a lot because of large families or situation, it won't stop it. Dr Ochoa admits to sterilizing herself, okay? We know what will fix over population and one person touch on the many programs that had been used in other countries and we know if it came to it, those programs would come into affect. Dr Ochoa's heavy accent makes it feel over the top and graphic video of animals. AND FINALLY, MOBY BEING MOBY, basically Moby just saying all humans are horrible, you are not a good person even if you treat people nice, you are a piece of trash just because you are human. Stop killing animals and fish! ""Look at me, I went vegan and became a star."" Look the planet is dying we know this, sad but true and yes there are small things we can do to conserve what we can, but there are some things that will NOT change and can't.",False
24,1,WHY IS THIS B.S. YOU ASK??,beauleaumail,n/a,16/08/2025,"The question is asked before the film, how can I make you see that Global Warming is very dangerous and is right at our doorstep? Well Moby, I am not sure why that is such a mystery. 99.9% of everything we hear is all lies. Your telling us that this is the 1 tenth of 1% truth. Very unlikely, The first Clue is that we were all told this very same bit of garbage in 2006 with ""An Inconvenient truth"" We were all told That in just 5 to 10 years we would all be under melted ice and/or dead from Global Warming. Well, Its almost 2023 and nothing has changed. We still have record hi and low temps and still getting the same Global Doom from you guys. I watch trends and in 2009 all the Scientists were scared because they said that there was a Global warming pause that has lasted for 13 years. Then in a few short months, with no new information added, they all said that the global temp was doubling. They all just ""adjusted"" the numbers so that they could keep saying the Doom speech. Then you insinuate that everyone that does not believe in the warming just deny it for no good reason. Some of us actually go outside and check things out. I usually believe me, So when your story about patriots thinking that the fact the Oceans are out of fish is a Conspiracy, I would just go out on a boat and see what I find myself. Depth finders, fishing pole, stuff like that. If I got no fish, saw no fish, then I would start to think they may not be any fish. If any math ever would actually show something that would come to pass I may put some stock in it. But nothing ever does. Don't get global warming confused with cretin end time prophecy. I think that's why it looks to you like the globe is warming but the math shows different. I mean math with truth, not the numbers that get added, others removed to show an agenda story. Its far more important we stop making plastic, and stop making EV batteries. Production of 1 EV battery is far more harmful than any gas car ever made. BELIEVE THAT. You people only care about the agenda, not actually fixing anything. Volcano's and earthquakes are getting worse and nothing anyone does will change that. If you open your mind to more than just the 2 stories, warming and not warming, maybe you would see a 3rd truth that a lot of us already see.",False

1,8,Heartbreaking and emotional portrait of war through the eyes of Ukrainians,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the DOC NYC 2023 Film Festival. It was pretty tough to watch but also very good.It's an interesting documentary that shows the harsh realities of war, families and children of Ukraine dealing with the situations, and how trauma can have an affect the people based on war. The direction and emotional core was well-executed as the documentary does a pretty job on handling the subject matter with interesting discussions from the people and the direction from the filmmaker. Throughout, the movie takes place inside of a vehicle but even with the small setting, the emotional direction, feel, and the subject makes it more heartbreaking and tense to see because of the context.Many of the people having to leave the country due to war, trauma experiences, and so forth is pretty heartbreaking to see. War really can create problems and destroy humanity and morality amongst others. Overall, it's a good documentary.",False

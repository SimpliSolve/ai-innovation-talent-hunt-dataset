1,8,Embarrassing,Analog_Devotee,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very detailed and in depth look at January 6th, 2021, the day a bunch of radicals stormed the Capitol building. It is very well-structured and informative, told in a timeline-style many documentary viewers will recognize. Personally, it's one of my favorite styles for these types of stories -- it feels more engaging when it's told this way.To say the least, this will be a day most Americans (the civilized ones, at least, no matter what political side of the aisle they are on) will look back on as truly embarrassing. These people should be ashamed of themselves.",False
2,9,Should be required viewing,Katz5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every American should have access to this documentary. Yet it is nicely tucked away on Hulu and cannot be accessed unless one has a Hulu account. I guess the material is too hot for ABC to touch - can't upset the corporate and special interest backers who control the programming on ABC. The mystical ""liberal media"" strikes again. So a star docked because this documentary is so hard to find for most Americans.What happened on 1/6 is absolutely horrific and will find a place in the American Hall of Shame along with the McCarthyism, the JFK, MLK, and RFK assassinations, the Vietnam, Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and 9/11. The footage, mostly shot with phone cameras from eyewitnesses (including some eyewitnesses on the airline flights bringing the violent insurrectionists to DC), is shocking. The extremely light police presence in the crowds that day, compared to the heavy police presence during other protests in DC in summer 2020, is a focal point as well.The fact that this documentary has an average ""6"" rating is proof. Sadly, the brainwashing in this country has reached the point of no return.",False
3,1,If I could give it a zero I would!,emtwoody,n/a,16/08/2025,If you are looking to be mislead and or manipulated this is for you! There was no attempt to even give a somewhat objective interpretation. Over an hour of at best half truths but mostly outright lies. History will not be kind to those who sought to further the divine among Americans with the misinformation contained within. Shame on MSM. You once again have shown to be the true enemy of the people.,False

1,9,The Many Levels of Teslas's Medicine,sjstein-02073,n/a,16/08/2025,"What Bob Connolly manages to accomplish of major significance: He brings Tesla to life, into the viewer's consciousness. He blends Tesla's being with yours, as if his presence were actually there with you.We get a much better understanding of what he was thinking, his goals and objectives for healing and communication.I the eighth grade I learned about Tesla coils ans spark coils ans the energy could be freely transmitted around the globe.

2,9,Timely Revelation,MichaelD-76,n/a,16/08/2025,"The genius and compassionate nature of Nikola Tesla have been long buried, for one brutally honest reason, so it is wonderful to see that he finally gets the recognition he deserves.His work with ultraviolet and infrared light, fused quartz, and EMFs were so far ahead of the times, as was his advice to focus on frequencies, vibration and energy.Robert Connolly presents what might otherwise be a highly technical and har to follow subject in a way that the average person can understand and appreciate.A most professional, insightful and highly informative work that the public deserves to know, and will find fascinating.",False
3,1,Don't believe a word - Propaganda,niamhnab,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAround 05:15 the claim that Elon Musk and his company, Tesla Motors, helped Nikola Tesla with his Long Island Lab work is absolute BS. The people behind this documentary - namely Robert W Connolly (shameful that a person with an Irish name is guilty of spinning such manipulative rubbish) and his team have deliberately created pro-Musk propaganda based on nothing but fiction.Proof:Nikola Tesla Died in 1943.Elon Musk was Born in 1971.Elon Musk used Tesla's name for his own company, which began as Tesla Motors in 2003. That's 60 years after Nikola Tesla died.Ergo, there is no way in hell this claim could possibly be true. There is no way Elon Musk could ever have even met Nikola Tesla as they weren't even alive at the same time.People are being fed bull and Prime should take this crap down and ban the producer for misinformation.",True
4,10,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen,marilynnbiggers-58796,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It was such a synchronistic time for me to find this when I am not feeling well and neither is my family. I watched it before I fell asleep, watched it the next morning, and told my loved ones about it. We all love Tesla. I have seen so many Tesla documentaries, but I'm giving it up to Tesla's Medicine as being the best one ever made. It is so well done. I was like ""How long have I not known about this?!"" and was surprised it was just released this year. Bob shares with a type of investigative journalism that can feel so hard to come by these days...what a gift. Learning about his story and journey through what he shared in the documentary and what I've seen online, I feel very inspired.",False

This film has a lot of good information and technology showcases that are extremely relevant to the world's health problems. Most of the problems we face today are electrical, chemical, and biological which all mesh together to form a nasty cocktail. From my personal experience, Bob Connoly is a great guy to talk with and is worth contacting to find out more information on purchasing and applying the technology in the film. Any poor reviews on this film are highly suspicious in my opinion. The technology in this film showcase is tried and true and has been in use for a long time.",False

8,10,Very Informative,jasonbourclc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very informative documentary. Tesla was ahead of his time in this research, and even today the medical community much prefers to medicate, operate, or both, yet there are some components from Tesla's work the is used in medicine as long as the medical industry can keep it for themselves.Do not just watch the movie. Think about how today the medical industry now wants to start from the extreme and more costly procedures and then work down. Think about how the medical industry has gotten more people addicted to drug then dealers has. Think about how many FDA approved drugs that has been pulled from the market later due to the dangers of the drug.Watch it, think about, and watch it again.",False

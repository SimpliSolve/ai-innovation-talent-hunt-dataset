1,8,The kids are not alright...,DukeEman,n/a,15/08/2025,"At first it seemed to be a glorified documentary about the new sensation in music, the usual story from rags to riches and other cliches. But then it takes an interesting turn, delving deeper into the very young artist, Kid Laroi, who attempts to make sense of his rapid success as the world spins frantically around his creative orbit of life.Kid Laroi's family are on this journey, and wished the documentary spent more time with the parents who seemed to be interesting enough. It barely touches on the father/mother and son relationship, which could have explained a lot about Laroi's current state of being. Maybe the documentary makers lacked the depth and knowledge of weaving this aspect into the story without taking too much away from Laroi.What I had to keep reminding myself was that this is a very young person who will mature and have many changes in life - if he allows it to, and hopefully the record company and the fans will also allow and accept those change, both in Kid Laroi's music and life itself. The documentary does succeed in revealing the changes in Laroi's life from a young teenager (great archival footage) to early adulthood. But the real test is now, as this stellar star will continue to shine into the next phase of adulthood, not in his profession, but in life itself.",False
2,10,This was AMAZING,zachlaroi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Laroi if you're reading this I just wanna say how amazing this documentary was, coming from a boy from Sydney WITH A DREAM and now being one of the biggest artists in the world you've changed Australia and THE WORLD.It's a Really interesting documentary with a heartwarming story.This documentary is on Prime Video and is not boring the documentary has cartoon scenes which I think is really cool and is produced my OBB and Amazon.I may like laroi as one of my fav singers but I get bored from documentary and I did not get bored.OBB and Amazon put a lot of effort and even put merch out to the public on Amazon.Overall this is a Amazing documentary.",False
3,10,A new approach to nurturing creativity,laramgale,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's so beautiful to see artists being promoted with love for their brilliant creative expression and the joy they foster. I'm one of those class of '99 Millenials from the burbs who absorbed the abuse of Britney and turned our ears and eyes to Norah Jones, Sarah Bareilles, KT Tunstall - anyone who was showing us art for art's sake. Anyway, my point is that this film gives me hope that there are corners of expression that have permanently escaped commodification. I hope this is indication that your industry is figuring out how to manage its vast wealth more wisely, for the sake of the artists themselves, for kids these days, and for civilization.",False

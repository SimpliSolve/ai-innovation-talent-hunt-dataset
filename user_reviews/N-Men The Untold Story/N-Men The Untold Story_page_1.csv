2,10,Absolutely nailed it,mikerafter-03416,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an amazing way for me to learn about the history of skating in my town. I was so hyped to learn more about the legends I only heard tall tales about as a young skater.Much respect to the early pioneers and the filmmakers for taking the time to gather the story of their never ending timeline.Really well done.Skaters can be the most picky and hard to please viewers. I can say with confidence that there is a story here for any viewer. There's excitement, tragedy and hope to be found within this great movie.These are the folks who set the standard for Sacto Skaters. The rest of us rode their coat tails.Much love! - Rafter.",False
3,10,True Story,mistylachance,n/a,15/08/2025,"A bit of skateboarding history you would never know otherwise. Even when you know all the pros, skate with them, compete, live & breathe the sport & lifestyle, you may not know that the history of skating pools was just the same in nor cal as so cal. Just a different group doing the same things at the same time. Just starts with a few friends. That's what they did. A story about starting a movement & keeping it going. Anyone with a passion can appreciate this beautiful documentary. I may be biased since I knew about 5 of these guys, but I'm just as impressed as anyone. A piece of history to carry on, and always be remembered. I watched it twice & enjoyed it both times. I'll likely watch it again.",False
4,10,Skateboarding in Sacramento is the real deal,lea-10267,n/a,15/08/2025,"So much happened in a short time. The Urethane wheel reestablished skateboarding in California in the mid 1970's. I started Skateboard City along with Cliff Savage and Ron Buckels in the summer of 1975 at a 100 sq ft store on Auburn Blvd in Sacramento's north area. What a trip. We had a lines out of the store leading up to Christmas that first year. We were joined by other Skate Shops, Skateboard Etc, Cal Skate and Cal Pro about the same time. Kids then couldn't get enough of it. They poured through every edition of Skateboarder Magazine to read about the So Cal guys and what they were doing and also to get the low down on the Skateboard Decks, Wheels and Trucks. Back then we assembled everything in the store. We didn't sell cookie cutter decks, wheels and trucks from one manufacturer. It was a great time for innovation and there was a huge market to support it. A year or so later pay to ride skateparks started popping up all over California including the Sierra Wave at Reuter Rd and Folsom Blvd in Rancho Cordova. Many of the highlights in the movie were somehow captured and saved from those days. Unfortunately the profit from those endeavors wasn't sufficient enough to justify keeping the park open. Not long after most skateparks in the state were bull dozed to make way for more profitable use of the land. Including Sierra Wave which turned into a Condominium Complex. The N Men were well known back in those days. Their ranks grew and who knew that they stayed true to the heart of skateboarding and have lasted to this day. Randy Karen was really Nor Carl's preeminent skater. He ripped the half pipe at Sierra Wave. More power to them. This documentary is a true piece and part of history both for skateboarding and Sacramento.",False
5,10,Not just for skateboarders,kristia_smith,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a movie with something for everyone. A story not just about the Northern California skate scene but about family, friends, finding your tribe but also about the scenes happening all around that were just never given the ""voice"" - this speaks to/for them too, something for everyone. You'll laugh (and cry). A must see AWARD WINNING documentary. It tells such a layered story about skateboarding and multiple generations of men and women carrying the torch in Northern California. The film really makes it so you ""get it"" - what skateboarding is all about, heart and soul, artistry, and LIVING!",False
6,10,Awesome movie!,elgreggo-47434,n/a,15/08/2025,"I came from this era in Sactown, skated with a lot of these guys in and around the downtown area. This movie brought back some great memories of finally finding my tribe. One day in the mid 70's, I picked up a crappy clay wheeled board, and it changed my world. I started skating with some neighborhood kids, bombing Wilson Blvd, skating Mather ditch, hitting up K St mall to name just a few places. Riding Sam Cunningham's ramp, a few other ramps in town, Sierra Wave, Rainbow Skatepark, Skateboard Palace, even the unfinished Diamondhead Skatepark, and any pool we could find. These are some of the best memories that I've had in 63 years on this rock, thank you for bringing it all back to me! N4life!",False
7,10,They must see documentary for all human beings.,martelldavid-83461,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is very moving. Yes, of course a history of the Northern California skater movement. But it's really a story about life. It's a story of all our childhoods, whether we stepped on a skateboard, or not. It's a story of coming of age, and the choices of our forks in the road that we all take on a daily basis. This moving documentary had me recalling my own childhood memories. It really made me think about the choices I made when I was younger. More importantly, it may be think about forks in the road I'm taking right now. This documentary should be a template for documentarians everywhere. Really an incredible piece of work. Congrats to the director, and all involved on this accomplishment.",False
8,10,A masterpiece skateboard documentary,jamessweigert,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a great film. My wife, who doesn't even understand the skateboarding world, loved the film. Incredible stories within stories and an unexpected ending, I learned a lot. I love discovery documentaries, that teach you about a subject you may not otherwise be familiar with. The characters are interesting, it's dark, yet uplifting, and it left me thinking about life, tribe, family, and love. It is a raw film about life's challenges and victories. The name is a little misleading because it's not all about men. In fact, one of the girls from the poster turns out to be a world champion skateboarder, and ends up in the skateboarding Hall of Fame. It's beautiful yet heartbreaking.",False

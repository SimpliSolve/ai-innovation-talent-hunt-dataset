1,10,Humanizing a complex subject,nolitareves,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary brings a remarkably accessible and human perspective to the otherwise opaque and complex workings of the gig economy. This is perhaps the most pressing labor issue of our time, and yet it is not given the attention it deserves because people (myself included) struggle to understand the complexity and scope of the issue. This documentary serves as a really important and interesting overview, with very moving and compelling subjects. Many of the characters in this doc would merit films dedicated entirely to them, but the effectiveness of this film is in how it shows a solidarity of experience across stories. It's fluid and fun to watch, and I learned a great deal from it.",False
2,10,The Complex Gig Economy,brendalburton,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Documentary was both fun to watch and challenging to my understanding of this complex issue. The characters brought to light the necessity to take another look at the perils of these low paid workers. The struggle of the food delivery men and woman on bikes was ridiculously dangerous to say the least
Fasted paced, fun to watch and quite eye opening!",False
3,10,"Captivating story, stunning documentary",planetem-35198,n/a,16/08/2025,"Awesome, on every level.The movie tells a complex story - the gig economy most of which is usually hidden, especially to the end users, and illustrates its tortuous ramifications around the globe through a set of brilliant and touching « characters ».Unobtrusive camera and documentarist, the images, the music, even the credits bring both a poetry and a human face to the story.Enjoyable and educational.",False

1,6,Decent,rorymcnair-975-298151,n/a,16/08/2025,"Consortium of video clips, with a heavy focus on Jan. 6th. Some exclusive, most easy-to-find.If you're hoping to find Alex in his secret place of the most high, continue your search.",False
2,2,"Hagiography, not a 'documentary'",sifr-06682,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a long winded, repetitive, in the end just very boring hagiography. It's only Jones talking about Jones, explaining his rants in a soft spoken voice to make him appear more thoughtful. But he is left to just self-stylize his persona, there are no moments where anything of the real human Alex Jones would shine through. Moreover some of hit outright lies throughout the film are just left without any contextualization to a degree which makes the whole piece seem like everything else thank neutral, actually taking sides with Jones. The whole movie -- how it's cut down to the usage of music etc. -- is set to glorify Jones as some kind of knight savior type. This movie might really only satisfy the most self-deceiving hardcore fans of Jones.",False
3,8,Pretty good,StarOpus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could have been a bit more engaging, the pace dragged a little at times and it was a little disjointed, but better than I was expecting, the production values were reasonable. Also, it could have been a little bit more in depth on the man himself and the life and working of Infowars. But overall it was at least fairly balanced and quite an accurate portrayal of him from his mistakes to some of his amazing predictions which came true. Worth a watch for anyone interested in truth and reality.",False
4,7,Alex Uncensored,sjwestbrooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alex Jones. You may like him or you may hate him, but you can't deny that he's influenced, for better or for worse, millions of people over the years. Do you wish to see him when he's NOT on air? Do you wish to see what REALLY happened on January 6? If so, then this is the movie you need to see.Alex's War is not the first documentary about InfoWars, but it is the first documentary to do what every documentary should do: simply interview Alex and several of his friends, and trust the audience to make their own opinions about them.The documentary is built on two storylines that frequently overlap each other: Alex's life, and his activities during the winter of 2020-21. For two hours, it slowly builds up the intrigue, telling us of Alex's connections and his ability to uncannily predict world events like the Oklahoma City bombings, 9/11, and the Covid plandemic. Finally, we get to an intense climax as the film covers Sandy Hook, and, near the very end, January 6.Whatever your opinions of Sandy Hook are, this film will at least cause you to ask questions and give you information from both sides. The film also shows exclusive footage of January 6, and Alex's real actions on that strange day.Alex's War does have a few flaws in its production value. Ten or so minutes of the film could've been cut out, and some InfoWars/Alex Jones Show logos are shown too many times.Regardless, I am proud to announce that Alex's War is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. That the filmmakers were able to make such an intriguing movie about a person they don't even agree with is amazing to me. If you love Alex Jones, this film will show that he's as fallible as you and me. If you hate Alex Jones, it'll show that he's as human as you and me. And if you're like me, and can't quite make up your mind about him yet, then this is the documentary for you.CONTENT WARNING: about 20 f-words spoken.",False
5,2,It is just a puff piece,geonosianindustries,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know too much about Jones so I decided to watch this film since he is in the news. You don't really get a lot out of this movie. I think it is meant to be a greatest hits kind of story but it doesn't work for me. We just jump from semi-connected event to semi-connected event.Also I don't get a sense of the world of Jones, like does he have any friends or fellow conspiracy people? The film seems to be him, a cameraman, and his sidekick owen. I feel like there should be more people in this movie.Also the music is way over the top and too on the nose for basically every scene.It feels like the filmmaker didn't feel like doing too much legwork and just went with the easy blocks from Jones' Wikipedia page.I skimmed the Wikipedia page for the man for about five minutes after the film and feel like I got more out of it than I did from this film.",False
6,9,I only rated this a 9 because . . .,jeff-2051,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of all the 1-reviews of people not having watched the film. It will not change the minds of anyone on either extreme of the current political spectrum; those on the far right and left already ""know"" the truth. This is just a doc comprised of ACTUAL clips of Alex failing (Sandy Hook), and succeeding in the time leading up to 9-11. It's just clips of the man being a human. There is no perfection to be found.",False
7,1,Alex is garbage and so is this movie,americandodgeball,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bad documentary. It is NOT ""fair"" or ""balanced,"" because it serves ONLY to defend Alex. It doesn't investigate, just amplifies Jones's own (dubious) account of things that supposedly happened in his life. Doesn't push back on anything Alex says, which is a big mistake considering Alex's record as a massive liar.Moments in the film, especially one or two ""behind the scenes"" moments involving Info Wars staff discussing ""news"" during a commercial break, appear to have been staged, as there is overwhelming evidence to suggest that Alex just makes up most of the ""news"" he ""reports"" on his show.The editing is amateurish, especially the use of music. The music cuts are all maudlin and manipulative (and often distracting), designed to give grandeur to what is actually a farce.The timing of the film's release is suspicious, too, seemingly intended to sway public opinion during Alex's Sandy Hook court case.Skip this trash, watch an actual documentary about an actual human being instead.",False
8,10,Perfect Timing; worth the money,rjcicijr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPerfect timing. The National media is gloating, but they are also creating a martyr. The movie follows his 25 yr career with never before seen footage. The best unexpected part for me was the Bohemian Grove footage. Kudos to Alex Lee Moyers for a great job !! The buildup to the climax which everyone knew would be J6 was riveting, very sobering. Watching history. I also enjoyed the footage inside the Georgia statehouse. The on the street inside the crowd footage was very moving. I actually clapped at the end of the movie sitting alone in my room.",True
9,1,Puff puff Pass....Not a Documentary,SOCOMBrae,n/a,16/08/2025,Nothing deep here just something alex Jones probably paid for to make him look good. Very boring and nothing interesting or new. Don't bother wasting your time on this one. I'm not a conspiracy theorist and this is meant just for his fans to watch no one else.,False
10,1,One sided,apriljdavenport,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film purposely cuts clips, and avoids showing the truth behind many parts of Alex's career. It fails to mention him claiming that the Boston bombing, Parkland shooting, and pretty much every other disaster caused by guns was a false flag. This is the opposite of what impartial is.",False
11,8,Pretty Astounding,aaron-trees,n/a,16/08/2025,"Encapsulating this guy into one movie is a huge feat, this film accomplished it. It meanders a bit in the middle and probably could have been 20 minutes shorter or 20 minutes longer, but it never left me bored or feeling left in the dark. The story is among the most American tales ever told- a man builds a media empire himself based on patriotism and often unhinged devotion to questioning and conspiracy. His evolution takes a toll and he clearly has physically and mentally been through a journey. I enthusiastically recommend it.",False
12,1,Lots of Information from his show not explored,lectrix-27325,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was a bit surprised at the inconsistencies in this documentary and his radio show. For example, he left Dallas because he was getting into fights? On his show he says he left because of uncovering a drug dealing ring in the police who then threatened his life if he didn't leave. He's also talked about his dad being the most intelligent person in Texas (proven according to him) so much so that the 'globalists' revealed their plans to him at 18 to try to recruit him. I wonder why he wouldn't tell these stories?All in all it is a complete puff piece where nothing is explored or corroborated and the sole source for the history of Alex is Alex himself. If you listen to his show it'll have far different details than you've heard before and if you've never listened to his show and do after this, you'll find inconsistencies about 5 mins in.",False
13,10,Constitutionalist versus globalists,take2docs,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt wasn't long after the events of September 11, 2001 that conspiracy researcher and shortwave broadcaster Milton William Cooper was shot and killed in what was believed by some of his followers to have been an alleged government-orchestrated assassination, on account of Cooper's speaking out against the corrupt system of which he felt was intent on destroying constitutional freedoms from within.It was around this time that another alt-media figure began to emerge onto the scene, as if to take over the reins from William Cooper (whose own story is wonderfully captured in the excellent documentary film, ""The Hour Of Our Time""). His name was Alex Jones, a rising upstart out of Austin, Texas, whose media image and fanbase would eventually grow to dwarf that of his arguable mentor and predecessor, Bill -- patriot and New World Order opposer -- Cooper.Like MWC, AJ (as Alex Jones is affectionately called by his admirers), as is shown in this, had the uncanny ability to intuit months before 9/11 that something terrible and momentous was about to happen on American soil, an attack of some sort, involving the name of Osama bin Laden and the World Trade Center, in what in hindsight appears to be a startling example of predictive programming.Fittingly, the film includes a quote from a book by Gary Allen that to paraphrase says that when it comes to high-profile politics and major world events, that pretty much nothing happens that isn't planned by those at the top -- the system controllers pulling the strings. Alex understands this basic conspiracy theory '101' concept, as do most who have traveled down the proverbial rabbit hole, and because of it a person can at least respect Alex Jones for what he does and stands for even if one doesn't particularly care for his occasional in-your-face style and bullhorn approach that he's so famous for.In the case of Jones, within the United States the political (far) left and national news media derive endless pleasure in poking fun at him, in trying to make him out to be a loud-mouthed and obnoxious clown. I think some of the blame for this can be placed on Jones himself, who seems to relish playing the part of a charismatic personality. That is to say, I think Jones's public image is in large part put-on, a shtick meant to be in part entertaining, which sadly makes him into an easy target of ridicule and derision by those unable to see past the theatrical messenger, in which behind the often over-the-top self-caricature lies a man of genuine, soft-spoken substance with an important message to convey -- one that's pro-American, anti-globalist, and non-partisan, if you haven't figured that out already.Frankly, why anyone not a fan of Alex Jones would want to watch this film is beyond me, but alas there will be the highly critical reviewers who see in AJ not a courageous David fighting against an informational Goliath but rather a perceived political threat and enemy deserving of crucifixion, so to speak.Hence, the title of this powerful documentary: ALEX'S WAR, a seeming reference to the personal battle scars that have been inflicted on Jones, by those who seek to maliciously destroy him, whether via character assassination or by means of other mentally stressful and truly psychologically painful, devilish tactics.Suffice to say, the film will not be to everyone's liking and opens with a disclaimer, as if to pacify any snowflakes who may be peeking in on it from beneath their bedcovers. As for those of us who side with AJ, the film is an absolute delight and which is why I'd be remiss if I did not give it a full-star rating.Although I'm not a follower of ""Infowars"" myself, I nevertheless wish Alex all the best in his ongoing trials and tribulations, and as he resiliently carries on in his exposing the dangerous New World Order. Yes, the system is rigged and sometimes battles are lost but in the end with pride and with dignity can thorny crowns be worn when placed atop the ultimate spiritual victor.",True
14,1,I have watched the film,cmgilliford,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have known Alex for literally decades and I know his lies well. It disappoints me that young people will watch this and believe it.He lies in this to the point of ridiculousness. Anyone who's heard his back story knows. He has told so many stories even he can't remember which lies he's told when. This film will now be used to normalise someone who shouldn't be normalised. This is pure propaganda if the producer knows him, naive in the extreme if she doesn't. She can't have done any homework on him beforehand.Don't bother. This isn't who the real Alex is in any way. It's such a disappointment. If she'd bothered to do her research she could have done a great expose. What a wasted opportunity.",False

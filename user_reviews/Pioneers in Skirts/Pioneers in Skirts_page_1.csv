2,10,Be a part of the movement!!,michelleproctor-04628,n/a,16/08/2025,Ashley Maria and Le-Ann are the real deal! We have had them out to SAS to speak three times and I've partnered with them on several opportunities to show the film to people across the globe. They are taking a topic that is seemingly provocative and typically off limits to talk about - especially in the workplace - and completely making it safe to talk about. Engage with them. Become a Pioneer and an ally (we need you now more than ever)! What they are doing is starting a movement where the ripple effect will be change. A change where my daughter won't have to fight the same battles that I have over my career. I'm forever grateful for the work they are doing.,False

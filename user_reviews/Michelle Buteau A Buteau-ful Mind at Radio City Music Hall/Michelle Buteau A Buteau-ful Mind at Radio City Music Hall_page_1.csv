1,5,Not that great,KazzaDazza,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a fan of Michelle Buteau - I love her stand-up and I love her acting, but I wasn't a fan of this special. It just wasn't that funny. But honestly, it was her bit on Dave Chapelle that really left a bad taste in my mouth. Yes, he can be offensive, but I'm sorry - nothing he says isn't what a lot of people are thinking. It's why he always still attracts large audiences. He's one of the best at what he does, and as funny as Michelle can be, she's nowhere near him in her material and status; her criticism of hom reeked of desperation and it was not a good look. You're not going to get more fans by crapping on other people. It was unprofessional. And I'm not saying this as a diehard Chappelle fan - i just really think it was uncool and out of place. Anyway, I still like Michelle and I will still watch her stand up and TV show and movies, but this special wasn't great.",False
2,4,Color Me Dis A Point Ed.,clivejamesrd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have laughed loads at past routines of Ms. MB, but have not seen her in a while, so going in, I had expectations on this one.In a nutshell, the funniest thing I got out of it, 21 minutes and two laughs in, was how not funny it was. It was 20 mins of amusing, with a strong undertone of showboating. The material itself was not the issue. But it dragged in places where the delivery should have been popping. She was reaching for droll and droll does not suit her. So, I color me dis a point ed,
Yeah, I said it and the ratings seem to land in my support.You can do funny much better than this outing. Ms. Buteau.",False
3,2,Disappointing,koralrosecancion,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWas so excited to see she had a new special out as her last one was fantastic.This one wasn't funny. She spent way too long throwing shade on Chapelle for his view on Trans. However, if she actually watched his stuff, she would see that years ago, he actually apologized. In truth, the trans jokes he did do were not as offensive as people made them out to be ... unless I have missed a show. . They were one person's observations and opinions during an era when it wasn't so PC. Less offensive than all the negative things Bill Burr says about women. (Where are the transwomen when it comea to actually defending other women?)I consider myself fairly ""woke."" I believe people love who they love and as someone who used to perform, had male friends who loved dressing as women and some who were trans. (Let's be honest. Who WOULDN'T want to dress as a woman. I helped my straight brother dress in a gown for the prom. He went as his buddy's date. We had so much more fun than stupid suits and he looked gorgeous (although, we sucked at covering up his shadow. Now he's married with a kid.) We live in a society that demands we label and classify and sometimes, you cannot and absolutely should not put people in boxes. I would quickly just quit watching Chapelle if that is what he was doing. Maybe it was in his earlier years, in which case, the world was different and hadn't been woken up to how wrong it was.As a professional, it is unprofessional to call out your peers. It wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, there was no deep meaning behind it beyond her wanting to throw shade and make herself look better.Left this show with a bitter taste in my mouth and lost so much respect for her. For her sake, I hope this doesn't come back to bite her.",True
4,10,Don't believe the trolls - this was hilarious,Zeeba617,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't usually write reviews, but seeing as all the negative reviews here are just people (who probably haven't even watched the whole special) complaining about Michelle critiquing Dave Chappell for his anti trans jokes, I wanted to set the record straight. This special was HILARIOUS. At first, I just put it on in the background while I was cleaning, but by the end, I was fully seated, laughing so hard it hurt. I was laughing so hard, someone came to check on me. Michelle has such a warm delivery, you feel like you're spending an hour with your funniest friend ever, like you're all in on the joke. I turn off a lot off comedy specials after a few minutes, but this one had me rolling.",False
5,1,NOT funny at all.,dapope-70106,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can't figure out how she got two specials? Seriously, just not funny at all. It's like being sober at a party and having to listen to an drunk unfunny person, that THINKS they are funny, telling bad jokes with their group of drunk unfunny friends laughing at their idiotic ramblings. This is her ""Special"". I don't know about special...but it IS especially terrible. There isn't ANY humor at all. Just spouting nonsense. She shares personal stories that are not at all relatable. She makes feeble attempts at political activism through her act but it just doesn't land. I really tried to give this a fair shot, after hearing her criticisms of Dave Chappelle. But after watching this ""comedy"" special, it really seems that she just doesn't UNDERSTAND comedy? 0 stars if I could.",False
6,1,Pure Cringe,chrisdaustin,n/a,16/08/2025,"It sounds like she has made a ""comedy"" special with a laugh track added due to the genuine lack of audience laughter.We get it, you're a big boned chick that likes getting railed (she put it a lot less eloquently) ... but there we have it... saved you watching the special.There is a reason that everyone is mocking her on social media - she believes that she polices what is funny and what is not... while stating that a comedy god is not funny and she is now the benchmark.I genuinely thought that Hannah Gadsby would hold the trophy for most cringe-inducing special on the planet... but here we go... we have a new contender.You would likely derive more enjoyment from hugging a cactus than watching this special.",False
7,4,More a Sermon than stand up comedy,imdbfan-8748393781,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rare weak punchlines her worst special so far, a women friendly Bert kreisher style of comedy ...you can clearly see that 3/4 jokes bombed hard , one of the worst special I've seen this year along with the Jamie foxx's one (wich was another sermon about god and how lucky he is)... it felt more like "" your mom venting to her friends "".... and don't come at one of the GOATS Dave Chapelle if you're not even worthy to stand in his shadow....btw even without the dig at Dave this comedy special is pretty weak , and I am a fan I've watched the other specials she made ( I know her since the eric andre show 10+ yrs ago)",False
8,1,Does Netflix Even Care?,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Never heard of this person in my life, but I love solid standup, so decided to give her a try.Dear sweet Jesus- I couldn't make it past the 10 minute mark, and even that was a struggle. Netflix has been all too happy to jack up rates, produce/purchase quality content, and has sunken to depths one couldn't imagine previously.The streaming services need to reevaluate their business practices, and perhaps firing all executives would be a grand place to start, because I and many like me have finally been pushed to our limits. Money is tight, and when 'cutting the cord' first joined the lexicon, it was due to cable conglomerates becoming ridiculously greedy, and far too big for their britches. Going to streaming was a much more affordable and higher quality option- until every single network decided to join in. But instead of competition bringing pricing down, they've decided to go all-in with pricing structures and abysmal content offerings, thinking they've got us.Newsflash- many of us will pay a dollar more here and there to keep average services, but with SOOO many options now available, we certainly aren't sticking around.Let me know when the mass exodus of executives finally happens and pricing gets reasonable. For now, this giant camel was what broke my back.",False

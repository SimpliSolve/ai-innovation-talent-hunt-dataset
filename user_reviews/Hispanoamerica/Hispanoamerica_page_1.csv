1,9,I like the neutrality of it,qualx,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really gald the neutrality of this film,i actually thought it would be more on the side of spain but i was wrong,it explores the contact between Spain and America not ""The americas"", presenting it without bias or romanticizing either side. The film carefully balances the complex and often difficult history while highlighting the beautiful cultural exchange that took place. It shows how this encounter, despite its dark moments, gave birth to our vibrant Hispanic world we know today. The beauty of the language, traditions, and shared heritage that emerged from this fusion is something to admire, and the film's approach allows us to appreciate it fully.",False
2,10,Must-see!,imdb-42797,n/a,15/08/2025,"A movie about that might correct the view of things again.In a time of change, there were peoples who respected one another and did not.History tells us whether occupiers were good or bad.To summarize to a point, the grandnephew Geronimo is a highlight in the documentary.Everyone should approach things and reflect for themselves.Whether the construction of a ""new culture"" was worse than the extermination of almost all the indigenous peoples of North America. Please ask all those who are affected and not those who have written this story as winners!This documentary Film is Great to have a new view of Kur Last 400 hundred years.",False
3,10,SPLENDID!,donaldoduran,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie Hispanoamérica is a true marvel that every Spanish-speaking person must see. It is not only visually stunning but also offers an honest and profound review of the true origins and development of Spanish America. This film unveils historical facts that many are unaware of or have not fully understood, revealing the truth about our identity and heritage.What makes Hispanoamérica stand out is the participation of outstanding historians and renowned experts on the subject. The interviews with these specialists, many of them from the Americas, provide a detailed and enriching perspective on over 300 years of shared history, from colonization to the present day. Their well-grounded studies and knowledge bring us closer to the reality of the cultural and patrimonial splendor that we can still admire today.Filmed in Ecuador, Spain, Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, and the United States, the movie takes the viewer on a journey through time. The visuals capture the architectural, pictorial, sculptural, and musical grandeur of the era-a living testament to the cultural legacy that remains alive. Every frame seems carefully designed to highlight the importance and beauty of this vast heritage, making the viewer not only learn but feel pride in their ancestry.In summary, Hispanoamérica is splendid. It's an essential work for anyone who wants to understand the true history of our land, its people, and its culture. With a powerful narrative and breathtaking visuals, this movie becomes an educational and emotional experience that not only informs but inspires.",False
4,1,R esurrects old dangerous and negative tropes about Indigenous civilizations,SolMarYLuna,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film resurrects old dangerous and negative tropes about Indigenous civilizations prior to contact with the Spanish in order to reframe and dilute the Western ambition of colonization and conquest. The first half of the film includes a series of interviews from Spanish scholars who collectively provide an incredibly biased account of Indigenous cultures 500 years ago through today and consistently seeks to justify actions of individuals such as Cortes implying that the Indigenous of the Americas desired and longed for the destruction of their own civilizations, cultures, economies, languages, and sovereignties due to their own ""barbarity"" and lack of civilization from a Western perspective. Its viewpoint seems to seek a paternal ownership over the regions of the Americas by taking several minutes of the film specifically rename and reclaim them as ""HispanoAmerica"" - not Latin America. Imagine a film from England creating such a film with this ownership about the United States culture.I wanted to enjoy this film; the cinematography is lovely. The synopsis states this film is about the synchronism of cultures and music but the more than half of it was solely focused on the reframing of Spanish colonization as positive and necessary and that the Spanish crown provided a power structure which included a humane means of economy and judicial system; and as outcome, this film becomes a puffery piece. This is a missed opportunity as the music of the Americas and the syncretism of traditions throughout the past 500 years is vastly unexplored and a fascinating area, but at every possible turn this film seeks to proselytize the viewer into their romanticized and skewed slant.Instead, this film spends too much time on their reframe of history, glosses over the major atrocities, and takes accountability away from the role of the Spanish crown over any negative outcomes from the last 500 years. ""Experts"" from this literally state that the Spanish did not ""conquer"" or ""colonize"" the Americas and use the comparison of the United States version of ""colonies"" as their evidence. The film is contradictory in its interpretation of ""invasion"" when it goes into detail about how the Spanish resisted the Moors in their attempted invasion of Spain. The Western bias toward the descendants of the Americas is rampant throughout this film. One person even goes in detail about how Indigenous didn't ""wear pants"" or other (Western) clothing - this biased conclusion about Indigenous culture is highly offensive as its patronizing implication is that Spanish provided them everything they needed and so much more. In another interview the person went on about how Indigenous peoples or their descendants did not desire to participate in Revolutions for Independence- a very simplistic and problematic statement to make which insinuates that Indigenous peoples of the Americas or their descendants were merely passive participants in their role of the complicated history of the Americas.Many Indigenous musical rhythms and forms have survived throughout centuries and combined with European styles but it is ignored in this film concluding that certain religious music of the Americas to be solely Baroque. There are too many problematic statements and claims included throughout this documentary to name and counter. It seems the main audience for this film would be for people of Spain and not the majority of peoples of the Americas because of its patronizing views of cultures and music born of the Americas. The overall focus on the reframing the Spanish role in history undermines the synopsis and makes one wonder the true intentions in the production of this film.",False
5,1,"A masterpiece of fantasy and romanticism, barely based on true stories",charcoargento,n/a,15/08/2025,"A cheap piece of propaganda, supported with EU funds. The good manners of the spanish empire covered by a canvas of historical revisionism, full of positivity. A partial view that creates a whole new dimension of the so called colonial legend. Highly recommended if you are spaniard and wanna feel well about the colonial past of the country, it's a family-friendly piece. If you are latino, you'll be disgusted and will be asking to yourself ""What about the slaughter, genocide, atrocities and pillage?""
The contests shown in this movie were all been thought and developed thinking on a child-aged audience.The sequel to this decadent movie should be something like: ""The friendly side of the fuhrer, not as bad as we thought.""",False

1,5,Barely scratched the surface,heywood_jablomey,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was an opportunity for American TV to have an introspection into empire, 9/11 and more importantly how ""one of their boys"" decided to go to Afghanistan and forensically understand his pathology and motives. None of that was done! This documentary just told us what we already know, instead the documentary thinks it's clever to keep repeating ""why"". Don't ask us, the audience, ""why"" give us answers.",False
2,6,Interesting but failed documentary,petertdoheny-25661,n/a,15/08/2025,"Never gives us anything at all about him other than the actual footage at his time of capture and lots of typical American outrage, which is tempered by the numerous legal failures after his capture.If you're old enough to remember post 9/11 you will also no doubt conveniently forget how all the rules went out of the window as the Cheney / Rumsfeld circus ramped up. Bush was really a puppet in all that, but the fact that neither of those two have ever since been tried for war crimes tells us everything.Lastly, the inclusion of so much of Spahn's daughter is just wasted footage. Her opinions are no more relevant to the Lindh story than mine are to giving birth...",False

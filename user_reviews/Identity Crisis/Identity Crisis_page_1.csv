1,10,Fantastic!,IanJ-278,n/a,15/08/2025,"Identity Crisis is a powerful and deeply moving documentary that takes a critical and much-needed look at the modern conversation around gender identity, particularly how it's playing out in the lives of young people and their families. In a cultural climate where questioning the prevailing narrative is often met with hostility or censorship, this film stands out as bold, honest, and necessary.Rather than relying on sensationalism or political rhetoric, Identity Crisis presents raw, personal, and often heartbreaking stories from people whose lives have been profoundly affected by the rapid rise of gender-affirming ideology-especially as it relates to children and teenagers. These aren't cherry-picked anecdotes or abstract debates. These are the lived experiences of real individuals and families who are grappling with the long-term impacts of what they were told was the ""only acceptable path.""What sets this documentary apart is its focus on the human cost of affirm-only approaches to gender dysphoria. It dives into how institutions-including schools, medical professionals, and even legal systems-are increasingly operating under rigid ideological frameworks that leave little room for nuance, caution, or dissent. Parents describe feeling sidelined or even silenced, professionals speak to the fear of being ""cancelled"" for raising concerns, and detransitioners-those who once medically transitioned but later regretted it-offer firsthand insight into the physical and psychological consequences of irreversible medical interventions made too hastily.The film never mocks or dehumanizes anyone. On the contrary, it treats all subjects with compassion, even while challenging the systems and ideologies that have led to such pain. It does not deny that gender dysphoria exists, nor does it attempt to villainize trans people. Rather, it questions whether the current mainstream approach-affirmation at all costs-is truly helping those it claims to serve.For those who have felt alienated by the dominant cultural narrative on gender identity, Identity Crisis will feel like a breath of fresh air. It provides a space for alternative perspectives that are usually suppressed or dismissed. In doing so, it reintroduces critical thinking into a discussion that has become increasingly polarized and emotionally charged.Yes, the film will likely be labeled as controversial, but controversy is not inherently a bad thing-especially when it comes from speaking truth to power. What's truly controversial is the idea that exploring multiple viewpoints and protecting children from potentially irreversible harm should ever be seen as taboo.Ultimately, Identity Crisis is a wake-up call. It asks us to slow down, ask hard questions, and-most importantly-listen to the voices that are too often silenced in the name of progress. Whether you agree with every point made or not, this documentary is essential viewing for anyone who genuinely cares about the well-being of children and the future of open, thoughtful dialogue in our society.",False
2,10,A superb look into the consequences of gender ideology.,steviewayne,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI would caution many of you with Children to view the film yourself to make sure that the content is appropriate for them; I warn you of this because of a scene where we see what is called top surgery. The film delves into the dangers of our culture as it pertains to children, it shows the shortcomings of the current approach to ""gender"" and showcases one man's journey to try to get back into his son's life because his son was taken away because he and his ex-wife had differing views on the subject, fair warning parts of the film are disturbing, but necessary for context. Many right leaning activists are featured and their stories are mentioned in part as it pertains to the overarching theme. This film may shock you, it may horrify you, but it certainly will make you ask the question of ""What in the world are we doing?"" Superb, 10/10.",True
3,10,Fantastic movie,onlinescoop,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie is riveting and very informative. The viewer learns all about the transgender industry and ideology. There are many testimonies from de-transitioners who tell their sad, painful journeys. There are also parents who tell their sad accounts of how they were alienated from their children by former spouses because they object to transitioning their children at the age of 2. There are testimonies from school administrators, medical industry professionals, therapists and community advocates. This documentary is more horrific than any dystopian or horror movie ever made.The suffering and damage caused by the transition ideology is huge.",False
4,9,Modern pre teen transsexuality,burtofprey-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"An excellent and must see documentary which reveals the dark side of modern society, that pushes children displaying opposite-sex behavior toward hormone treatments and surgeries. These interventions, however, have profound, often irreversible consequences. Graphic footage of surgeries and failures is presented. The ideology behind this approach is ruthless. Children are separated from their parents by schools, therapists, and doctors. Grownup transsexuals who want to return to their original gender are completely abandoned by the treating teams, resulting in them living a life of deformity, despite the decisions being made by doctors who know that minors are incapable of deciding their gender.",False

1,n/a,"Awarded as the most boring, useless, ""documentary"" I've ever seen.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The heading says it all. *Not* a documentary, just self-pity and whines. You can learn nothing from this video, and it has literally zero entertainment value.",False
2,1,JFC...why??,ChristyGuinn,n/a,16/08/2025,Stupid. Awful. Boring. And did I say stupid?? The worst thing I've seen in a long time. These Whiny people gross me out.,False
3,2,An unnecessary and poorly executed documentary,gagosto-23091,n/a,16/08/2025,"I honestly found no value watching this documentary. In the beginning, there was a heartbreaking segment of a 17 year old grappling with her recently diagnosed mental issues while simultaneously coping with quarantine and the pandemic overall. That segment did not continue and all others fell short significantly as well. There was a scene of this lady's mother as a caregiver to an elderly woman and documents the poor conditions of the home that I will not go into specifics and it's truly despicable how she tries to embarrass that elderly disabled woman on camera for the dramatization of the film. She then in condescension asks her if she's watching the news and paying attention to the situation. That is someone's grandmother, mother, sister, aunt...etc. Where is the human decency? That family was the worst thing about this documentary. There were other snippets of recorded segments that were so incomplete. It's the most disorganized documentary I've ever seen. The execution could've been better over a very real and difficult time in this country and globally.",False
4,1,Is this a mockumentary?,cmburton-29875,n/a,16/08/2025,"When the power of crap gets aired on tv ? And to think, I don't have a show and they do? Yikes",False
5,7,interesting documentary on people who were particularly vulnerable do Covid,guisreis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting documentary composed by segments directed by different young fimmakers, which show people who were particularly vulnerable to Covid pandemic, as they could not protect themselves due their jobs or economic situation. There are a delivery boy and his janitor grandmother, a mailman, a worker in public transport, cleaning workers, a bus driver, a maid, and unemployed people due the close of restaurants. People who needed to work in several places and to use daily crowded public transport. Outcomes vary in the issues they put in evidence. The first one was my favourite by far. Another great moment waswhen the bus driver answered to her daughter that his job was more important than his survival, as he had to pay the bills and the rental, and at least he was not unemployed.",False
6,2,Unwatchable...,mutumariusg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Should not be a documentary ... """"A documentary film is a non-fictional motion-picture intended to ""document reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical record"". It is by no means educational or instructive and as for historical record I would say not but that can be debated...",False
7,9,Captures the the beginning of covid confusion and fear,bethanyjeanltd,n/a,16/08/2025,"To those writing scathing reviews- these vignettes do capture a moment in time during the beginning of pandemic when information was not so clear of how the virus was spreading- it was not declared airborne for awhile and it was all about not touching your face, disinfecting everything touched. At first even wearing masks didn't seem to make sense because they don't seal onto your face, we had to learn that it was more about having to stop the airborn droplets from normal breathing from accumulating in concentration...anyway...
If you are a New Yorker, you were in the epicenter of the pandemic in the beginning trying to grasp what to do as everything shutdown around . Not everything shutdown however! Care workers , transportation workers, food deliverers, grocery workers- all were at risk. Wealthy people fled. People who had somewhere else they could go to left. This was filmed while these things were happening, not in retrospect/re-enactments. I think this was well done by young people capturing an emothional distopic landscape of that moment- raw and truthful. It's fine for what it is.",False
8,9,"Real look at the scary, confusing, and overwhelming early days of the pandemic.",bbgvgjwrt,n/a,16/08/2025,"The pandemic affected every American in one way or another. Unfortunately, as it has always been and always will be, those with minimal resources bore the brunt of the pandemic horrors. If it wasn't already clear the pandemic showed where the divisions stood. We all fell into 2 camps, you either hunkered down and ordered everything on-line, or you were the one delivering it.Although the documentary is raw, and the filmmakers are young, you still get a clear understanding of how scary, confusing, and overwhelming at times it was for those living at the epicenter during those early days.",False
9,10,Listen To Their Stories Told,Fallenhazel,n/a,16/08/2025,"They could tell us a million stories. They could paint their lives across the screen, and they could open the door for us to come inside. But we hesitate, debating if we should. Maybe, it's because we are too comfortable between our own walls, living our lives, and battling our wars, trying to survive, trying to decipher truth from fiction because we are bombarded with non-stop information. And we want the truth. We want to survive. We just forget that we are not alone. Maybe, we should hear their stories, see their lives outside our walls, and remember that what we need right now is for us not to be divided or be selfish. We just have to listen.",False

1,10,Highly Recommended Viewing!,tmaida550,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want a great overview of autism, this highly sensitive portrayal of the various ways it impacts people is highly recommended. I spent many years working with individuals with autism as a Director of Special Education and this wonderful program is something I would have all staff watch to better understand autism and it's many levels of functioning. The history it provides was terrific. Following the life of Donald Triplett was so captivating and informative and very sensitive to how his life has been blessed by the people of his hometown. Weaving in Mickey throughout brought to life how a parent's life is so impacted by their personal love of their child and how their dedication and love is so meaningful to that person in overcoming the many obstacles faced in their development. Caren Zucker did a masterful job of capturing her son's life accomplishments through the lens of Donald Triplett successes while simultaneously giving us a better understanding of the marked differences of those on the spectrum. Beautifully done! A must watch for anyone who wants to better understand the importance of living in an accepting society of human differences.",False

1,8,How To Live,anthonydapiii,n/a,17/08/2025,"I've been thinking a lot about this concept of dying in order to learn how to live. Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom taught me plenty on that topic. I'm learning each day to learn ""how to die"", so I can live life with boundless love and joy daily.Chris Norton is another that l'll go to in teaching me a lesson this topic. What an incredible human. His support group is beautiful: friends, family, and wife.God shined bright in Chris's life. It's amazing seeing him and his wife spread that in others lives.",False
2,9,Wow,c-johnson0912,n/a,17/08/2025,"This hit close to home for me. When I was in high school I took a hit to my back that caused a herniated disc and pinched my spinal chord. I lose feeling in both legs for an hour and collapsed a few days later. I regained full function within a week after periodic loss of feeling and control. It ended my 9 year football career and put an end to my dream of playing in college as a walk on. I went into a dark period of drinking and depression but came out of it. This movie was a solid reminder to me that I am fortunate and that anything is possible. I found myself holding back tears the entire time. I thought about his feelings of losing something that meant the world to him but setting a new goal to become passionate about. Chris was not a victim but a strong survivor in every sense of the word. What an inspiration, and what a story.",False

4,10,A True Inspiration!,jon-916-27289,n/a,17/08/2025,"As the film director... I am so thankful for Chris, Emily and everyone who was part of his story. This is truly a story about how with the power of faith, family & friends, you can overcome any challenge. They both have inspired me so much during the making of this film and even afterwards with their growing family!!",False
5,10,Unreal,adamcjoseph,n/a,17/08/2025,"I made an account just so I could comment on the documentary. This man and his beautiful bride... wow, if you're not a true believer, you will have a tough time not searching after you watch this. I've never seen faith like this in my life. God has his hand directly on Chris and his family. I will pray for these people that I do not know for the rest of my life. STOP WHAT YOIRE DOING AND GO WATCH GOD WORK!!!!!!!",False
6,7,Edited for Inspiration,dansview,n/a,17/08/2025,"They captured the spirit of Division 3 football in small town America perfectly in the opening scene. These guys are not prepping for a pro career and millions of dollars. This is it. Perhaps the greatest time of their life. To be young, vital, and a part of a team.Juxtapose that with the ending of at least that aspect of life for one young man, almost as soon as it began. That contrast really shook me.I'm not sure if some scenes are re-enacted, or if someone had a camera on from game day to hospital, long before realizing that a documentary would be made. Either way, having so much film beyond talking heads was crucial.I don't recall hearing what his parents do for a living, what that town is about or much about his sisters. Should I assume that he went to a college in his own home town or just near? Were they Lutherans? What was his major? Did he have a high school girlfriend prior?I know that he went online, but how did he happen to meet a girl whose life mission is to help people? Was it a site for people in his situation? Or did he mention his condition and she was drawn? People may find that interesting.How do young people just decide to get married and move? Don't they need a source of income? This may not be relevant to the core theme, but it would be interesting for people who are trying to grasp how to get things like this done.I would assume that both Chris and the film makers acknowledge that even with faith and determination, not everyone can regain movement in these situations. I think they are saying that you can always make the best of your situation.Don't expect any grim reality or moments of doubt. I would assume that there must have been all of this in real life. There is some mention of arguments, depression, etc., but we don't see it.I guess they wanted to keep that private, or market this as an inspirational mildly Christian film. Personally I would have gotten even more out of it, if I had seen the dark times too, thereby truly comprehending what he had to overcome.",False

What I love about this film is it is so much more than the remarkable story of a man who defies all odds to walk again. Not only does it beautifully capture Chris Norton's grit to walk, but it's also a story of family bonds, being there for a teammate and friend, finding true love, serving others, and caring for our most vulnerable.

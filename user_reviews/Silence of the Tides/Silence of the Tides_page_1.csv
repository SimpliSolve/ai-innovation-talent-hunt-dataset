1,7,"Beauty, amazament and cruelty in random order",Wordsmith,n/a,16/08/2025,"For me this movie gave a great peek into a part of the world to which I live close by, 'de Wadden'. I used to come to the Zeedijk (Sea Front) quite often when I was young, but never knew there was so much going on behind the Dykes.Like I said, this movies gives us an intimate peek into the tides of the Wadden Sea and what the changing of the tides brings. Great time lapses I have never seen before and animals both below and above sea level were brought to us visually and audibly as never before in all their beauty. Nevertheless, I did not completely understand the *silence* in the movies title, as there were quite some upsetting images among most of the beauty and amazement the movie had to offer us.Personally I could do without the cruelty that was shown and had expected more of a connection between one image and another, like a thread weaving all the separate images together if you will. It seemed to me more a summary of all that goes on and can be observed in this region, not much more.Somehow I hoped for more of a connecting element or something, which is why I only give it 7 out of 10 stars.",False
2,8,Stunningly beautiful,jelmerkok,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautiful shots of many aspects of life inside and around the Wadden sea, a unique tidal area. Stunning cinematic vistas and a varied glimpse into the rural culture of the people living there.Sometimes an almost meditative experience accompanied by droning organ music, highly recommended to see on the big screen.",False
3,8,The central word in this film is rythm.,frankde-jong,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Silence of the tides"" is a documentary about the Wadden region. The Wadden region is a unique wedland, one of the biggest in the World. It consists of a Dutch, German and Danish part. I was well acquinted with the Dutch part because of many holidays spent in this region. It was nice to get to know the German and Danish part a little better.The central word in this documetary is rythm. Rythm between ebb and flow. Rhytm between the seasons of the year. Rhytm between birth and death. With respect to the last we see the birth and slaughter of a lamb, but also a baptism and a funeral in a Church on a German Wadden island. This illustrates another aspect of the documentary, the balanced mix between nature, animals and humans.So far I called the film a documentary. That would certainly have aggrieved the director. He tried his best to avoid characteristic documentary elements.There is no voice over. The problem with a voice over is that different spectators have a different levels of knowledge about the subject. Also a voice over easiy becomes pedantic.The cameraposition is static, there is no camera movement. Cameramovements, such as zooming in, focus attention on a specific area of the image. With a static camera it is up to the spectator on which area of the image to focus his / her attention. There are however beautiful time lapse montages to stress the difference between ebb and flow.The horizon is placed in the upper part of the frame. The emphasis is on the capricious plains of the Wadden Sea. In his documentary ""Dutch light"" (2003), about (among other things) Dutch painters from the 17th century, director Pieter Rim de Kroon placed the horizon low in the frame to put emphasis on the sky.Initially the film would also be without filmmusic, only natural sounds. Filmmusic would manipulate the emotions of the spectators too much. It is in this respect that de Kroon made some compromises. During the making of the film he met Birgit Wildeman, an organist from one of the German Wadden Islands. Eventually she made some music to capture the mood of the sea and the islands.The film has no storyline, but with Birgit Wildeman it does have an anchorwoman. The other two anchormen are Johann Petersen as postman Hanni and Jan van Rees as the Dutch vessel traffic operator. Postman Hanni almost makes you believe you are watching a Bela Tarr movie.",False
4,10,Absolutely amazing,stinnemans,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a world we live in! One big visual trip it is. Perfect for leaving our busy lives and stepping into the real world. No need for drugs, just sit down and relax.",False
5,8,Beautiful image of nature,kwolfik,n/a,16/08/2025,The most beautiful image of 2020. Nature as the main character in all its splendor and a bit of a human along with his/her everyday life.,False
6,5,"Beautiful images, but repetitive and artificially sounding",Bertje-Bertje,n/a,16/08/2025,"A somewhat long documentary to watch. Therefore it starts to annoy that there are quite a few repeating scenes. Like the tide of the title, that little train, and that woman in a vague way behind the organ.Beautiful images, yes. Sometimes cleverly recorded, like bird beaks under water. Although one wonders how real that was.Also nice are the contrasts between the quiet nature and the busy people. Although those are sometimes somewhat sought after, such as Haanstra's brass band.Disturbing are the largely artificially sounds. I understand that telephoto shots could use some sound. But underwater noises? And to top it off, a slurping butterfly?!So mixed feelings.",False
7,2,"Repetitive, random, focussed to much on human activity",mick_peerdeman,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a documentary called silence of the tides, most of the film is full of sounds of load human activity... Sounds in natural scenes are artificially added and unrealistic in alot cases. Some scenes (mostly under water) were nice but i am almost certain that alot of them are filmed in aquaria and not in the wild. The shots of the tides are relaxing but they are very random, and mixed/placed in between what is mostly very loud human activity as previously mentioned. Speaking of shots, there is no real timeline or story. Knowing most of the places shown we randomly jump between Texel (Western island) to Germany... Some images are very random since they lack any explanation or clear reason of why we humans act like this (for example: cows are guided over mud flats, but why? Where to?).All in all some nice shots, but mostly mediocre and repetitive. I was expecting a documentary but what i got was a video that showed mostly human activity in and around the Wadden Sea, with clear negative effects to it but with no given explanations.All in all, if you like documentaries and nature i suggest watching 'WAD' from Ruben smit, instead of this movie.",False

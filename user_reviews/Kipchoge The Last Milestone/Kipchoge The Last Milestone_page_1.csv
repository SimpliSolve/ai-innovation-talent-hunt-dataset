1,7,Dramatic and Inspirational,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was expecting another running documentary. I've watched a lot of them. This is a different beast though. It's very stylised in places, beautifully shot sequences flexing the Â£4.5 mil budget. Maybe not a huge surprise with Ridley Scott's son Jake at the helm. It doesn't lose its focus though. This is Eliud Kipchoge's attempt to be the first human to run a marathon in under 2 hours. There was a lot of hype around this when it took place in Vienna in October 2019, so there's no real surprises. How many people know that much about Kipchoge though, aside the world records and that he makes distance running look ridiculously easy. Here we get stories from trainers, coaches, pacemakers, physios, Eliud himself. Not just about the attempt, that's just the current goal, but the bedrock of running and being a runner. He's clearly gifted, built to run fast, trains hard, but there's lots of athletes like that. It's the mental strength that's the focus. That's the engine. That's not unique either, but Kipchoge seems to have everything in perfect balance. We know he's the best. The greatest marathon runner of all time, he must know it too, but it doesn't seem to effect him, he's the definition of humble. A genuinely nice person. Just seeing himself as part of the machine striving for something historical. There's lots of detail. How high altitude training works. Genetics. Culture. Colonial politics. Pain threshold. Failed attempts and BELIEF. I've heard a lot about the use of pacemakers, lights measuring the perfect line and of course shoes. How all this stuff delegitimises this record. Utter bollocks. It might help focus the mind, but it would probably implode a few too. The fact is, running at that pace for 2 hours would destroy 99.99% humans on the planet. The fact that Kipchoge embraces it is what makes him special. Dave Beresford features quite a lot as the logistics man around the attempt in Vienna with his ""marginal gains"". The course choice, fuelling, formation, the tech, the team. This is where the science comes in... and the machine of a branding exercise. Visually for a period it becomes the INEOS challenge rather than Kipchoge. He's merely a vessel. I suspect though that he doesn't mind that, it takes the pressure off... if indeed he ever feels any. What I love about running is the simplicity of it. Grab shoes. Go (probably shorts too). It seems a bit ludicrous the amount of fuss and staging for this, but then the challenge is ludicrous. 26.1 miles in under 2 hours, how is that possible? Driving music, slomo shots, Kipchoge in white on his own surrounded by the pacemakers in black, it's built for drama. The target is an average of 13mph, the numbers are staggering. The teamwork though is absolutely beautiful. The entire goal, to make it as easy for Kipchoge as possible. A remarkable sacrifice from everyone that ran that day, but also the opportunity to be part of something truly unique, truly inspiring. It's not easy, it's fraught with things that can go wrong, but at the core Kipchoge is calm, focussed, fast. That's the takeaway. This attempt is not about headlines, technology, controversy. It's one bloke. Running. Like no one has ever done before. ""No human is limited"".",False
2,10,Wow! Beautiful (ignore the negatives),kferguson-15968,n/a,16/08/2025,"Haha...
I just read the negative reviews. Let's take this at it's core.1. Kipchoge is the first and only person in the world who has ever done this. He has been training since he was a child. He grew up in poverty with a single mom. He is a very, very special person from a country that is almost always forgotten on the world stage -- except for safaris and runners.2. 120,000 live people, plus many many millions around the world, and an entire team of people from various countries all think it's a beautiful moment in human history. It's never been done before, like reaching the moon.3. You can barely click your finger to watch this amazing spectacle take place in your living room. One man's REAL LIFE victory over his own mind, body, and massive difficulties of life.4. It was beautiful!See, dudes, most of us didn't go to film school, and don't believe we have an artists eye (or want one) for documentaries. We want a beautiful story, about a dedicated man who has overcome the odds and done it with humility and community.I've run a bunch of marathons. I've spent my life running. Watch this if you enjoy the craft and you're not a video snob with a entitled, 1st world perspective. Just enjoy it!",False
3,10,No Human Is Limited,cslates-59205,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautiful film. Moreover, what a beautiful person. Eliud Kipchoge successfully inspired millions of people through his extraordinary mindset. Perhaps the best part of this movie was the fact that Eliud wasn't the one telling us about himself or what he did. It was the people around him, all of whom you can see are permanently changed by interacting with him. The cinematography was fantastic and the narrative progressed in a fantastic way. Prepare to be inspired :)",False
4,1,"a movie about no record, lasers, corny montages and how far you can get while being untalented and ridley scotts son",darabuka72-24-376770,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerRarely i have seen such amateurish montages like where a sea o Africans on the street are supposed to be reacting all impressed to fake reporter voice overs, and the scifi sport effort is again pathetically underlined by a lady using a computer mouse, yes a computer mouse, and yes she clicks on it, with again more montages and hyping music like in a 2nd class razor blades advertisement. That alone was simply pathetic in one word.Somehow the audience is to be interested in a marathon that is no marathon recognized by any organization with more than good reason, and which is technically so enhanced that the very thing it tries to achieve is disproven by all the effort undertaken to achieve the record. If runners taking wind resistance ahead and lasers improving the trajectory are needed to run in under a time that has not been achieved by runners without all this ridiculous help, then obviously nothing has been achieved or proven. Its as interesting as showing someone beating the sleeping record after being taken into an artificial coma by an Anesthesiologist.Seeing the universal logo on the beginning of such an untalented effort can only be explained by the last name of the director and all the nepotism that must have been applied to this bad excuse of a documentary.Also and not at least the documentary has no charm soul and can, if even, only be liked by marathon runners which i highly doubt. I also would have maybe , only maybe , have included in a documentary how fricking long a Marathon is!!! God beware us from more work from whoever scott junior.How many talented scripts producers and directors has Universal waved off to give priority to this annoying piece of nothingness or kind of pay back-a favour-event to ridley scott?",True
5,3,Annoying and dumb,donlouis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Isn't it strange, that in the 21st century some people still praise 19th century style, egoistic and narcissistic ""records"". Which are completely pointless, serve the ego only, and do good for nobody. They even compare the 2 hour marathon to the landing on the Moon, which is just disrespectful.The rest is a bunch of ""everything is possible"" cliches, so I can't wait to see when he""ll run the marathon in 1:50.Ha ha ha.",False
6,1,Distasteful and disrespectful to the real sport!,zustroy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerKipchoge is a marketing tool to sell Nike and other products of companies that sponsor him. This ""record"" was broken in a multi million dollar project and completed in highly controlled environment. Every single component was there for him to complete the task he was sponsored for.He could've taken some banned substances as well.This is not a marathon time, this might be a marathon distance served to him on perfectly flat surface with runners protecting him along the way.This is shameful!",True

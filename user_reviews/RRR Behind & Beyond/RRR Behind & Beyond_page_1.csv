1,9,A bible for future action film makers!,devulapallic,n/a,16/08/2025,"A) RRR: Behind and Beyond (2024) is a good reference manual and a clear-eyed primer for filming action sequences. A bible for future action film makers!B) This documentary film provides a revealing look, a more three-dimensional view of the artistry behind RRR (2022). It accomplishes this thro':
i) immersive on-the-ground footage (archival footage),
ii) revelatory first-hand accounts, and
iii) plenty of nostalgia leading upto the historic night of the Oscars.C) It's good storytelling, mostly personal viewpoints by RRR's cast and crew told with a matter-of-fact honesty - creatively structured, and the film makes a good impression on first viewing itself.D) It is nice to see this film accomodating multiple perspectives when talking about a particular sequence.E) The documentary does an excellent job of breaking it down in simpler terms for viewers who are not savvy about modern filmmaking methods.F) The documentary film is edited with razor-sharp precision and it delivers the best possible experience. Enjoyable!G) It does take a talented production team to make a movie like RRR (2022) and this crew pulls it off, creating a piece of art that is affecting, educational, and inspiring.H) Rajamouli Garu clearly rubs off good vibes and positive energy on to his cast and crew. People seem to be vibrating with the same energy, trying to give more than they can, and wanting to create something of their own. Definitely, he's an inspirational figure!I) This documentary also makes room to honor the crew who are not into speaking English fluently. It's a nice gesture telling them that they are not forgotten or left behind.J) i am sure there are still some well-kept secrets in the making of RRR, but at some point it will have to come from the horse's mouth alone!",False

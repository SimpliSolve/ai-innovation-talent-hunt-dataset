2,1,Just bad,Michelle-7822,n/a,16/08/2025,"First I LOVE Billie. I have seen her in concert, think she is supremely talented. But this is probably the worst documentary I have ever seen. I am a bit angry that I paid for it. It is just a lady narrating while cheesy generic music plays in the background. It is just awkward and low budget. There are some clips, but they are just excerpts from interviews or videos pulled from elsewhere that we have already seen. It is clear that Billie had nothing to do with this. There were no new interviews or any new tidbits of information. It's bad...just bad. Don't waste your money. You could get similar content by just watching random youtube videos.",False

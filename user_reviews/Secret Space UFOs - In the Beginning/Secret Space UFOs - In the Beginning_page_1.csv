1,5,Amateurishly done but interesting,kkpreston,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm never sure how much is fabricated and how much is legitimate in these types of shows. It was still interesting nonetheless. I always keep an open mind. I referred to it only as ""ameteurishly done"" because they spelled ""a lot"" as ""alot"". There is no such word as ""alot"", & a well done show would never make that mistake, which makes me wonder how much truth there is. And no, the error wasn't in the closed caption.I would still recommend it, but certainly not automatically assume everything is the truth.",False
2,1,Incorrect information,thejamesclemons,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI could only watched about 10 minutes. This is the worst documentary on UFOs and extraterrestrials I've ever seen. Some of the facts and statements were flat out wrong and easily provable. I'm not for sure if the director's intent was the spread information on UFOs but we do a disservice when we spread information that's factually inaccurate. I'm considered an expert in the field. I've studied this phenomenon for years. This documentary is so bad and full of misinformation it would not surprise me if our own government was behind this ridiculous documentary. To anyone that may have watched this, I apologize there are a lot of good documentaries and information out there. Please do your homework before you make a judgment.",True
3,3,It's UFO/UAP Documentaries that give the Subject,CodeCarter,n/a,16/08/2025,"This type of Documentary doesn't do the UFO/UAP topic any favours and It's why people call anyone of claims to believe in Alien craft Fools.Some of the topics brought up in this documentary may or may not be real, however, its there vocabulary and how they try to explain It that muddies the whole UFO/UAP topic.If you want real up-to date information then wait for Avi Loeb of Harvard University and the initial testing of the new sensor suit being developed for the Galileo-Project,... Initial testing according to Avi Loeb should hopefully be completed around the end of August.",False

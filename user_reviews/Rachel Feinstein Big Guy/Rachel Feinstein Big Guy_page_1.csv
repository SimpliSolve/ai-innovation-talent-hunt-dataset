1,4,"Love the comedy, but the post production laugh track is distracting.",mitchandcary,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI love Rachel Feinstein. I loved her work in Crashing, Life of Beth, Inside Amy Schumer, et. Al.I was looking forward to enjoying this new stand-up special, but the post-production engineering, and what sounds like an added laugh track is very distracting.I don't know if this is the latest attempt by Netflix to make EVERYTHING sound hysterical, but it's pervasive and cumbersome in their new releases.I'd like to hear actual audience response rather than have my ears assaulted by wave after wave of uproarious laughter over jokes.I really hope to see this again with the actual audio. If I'm wrong on this, ""my bad"", but you can judge for yourself. The front few rows of the audience are smiling during jokes, but it sounds like canned laughter happening.",True

1,7,Saucy!: Secrets of the British Sex Comedy,jboothmillard,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIn the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, the British sex comedy was one of the most prominent and successful genres at the cinemas, and I was most interested to see this documentary exploring them. It was the sexual revolution in 1960s London that started to change attitudes in Great Britain towards sex, and although pornography was illegal, it did not stop British filmmakers from introducing this popular trend of films. Adult entertainment in films was mostly controlled by the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification), with film censor John Trevelyan at the helm, ""protecting the public"" (mostly the conservative and upper class) from depravity and corruption. Any films containing high amounts of sex or nudity were considered exploitation films, often given the X certificate (16 or over). There was a farce comedy play that mocked the ""attitudes"" of the time titled No Sex Please We're British. It was the Carry On films that for years entertained cinemagoers with its seaside postcard innuendo style comedy. The first mainstream film to feature nudism was the George Harrison Marks documentary Naked As Nature Intended (1961). The first exploitation film ever made for mainstream audiences was School for Sex (1969), with the ""cool version"" released for those easily offended, and the ""hot version"" released for those looking for more adult content. The term ""the man in the mac"" was coined throughout the period, used to describe cinemagoers (especially businessmen) who entered screenings of films containing adult content, whilst wearing mackintosh coats so that they could (presumably) do things under their coats. Soon, several independent studios were started in Wardour Street, Soho to produce more sex comedies. In 1970, the BBFC added the AA certificate (not suitable for children under 14), while the X certificate was increased to 18. The British sex comedies produced often contained female stereotypes and cliches and very few gay characters. There were some critics that loathed these films, and activist Mary Whitehouse certainly criticised them for being pornographic, but audience numbers soared and made them financial successes, with Come Play with Me (1973) playing for 4 years in the same venue. The sex comedy that is the one that really started the trend and became a major success, with its high amount of nudity, sex scenes and smutty style, was Confessions of a Window Cleaner (1974). It was the combination of British comedy stars of the time, beautiful and buxom ladies taking their clothes off and becoming icons, and silly sauciness in the slapstick scenes and written in the script that made these high grossing box office hits. Eventually though the films concentrated more on the sex and nudity than jokes and actually trying to make audiences laugh as well; the later Carry On films are examples of films like these becoming unfunny and depraved. It is fair to say that this genre of films would not be made in the modern woke times we live in, but for the time they were adored and can be admired to an extent. The documentary also detailed the increase in adult magazines, the career and tragic death of sex comedy and adult star Mary Millington, the VHS tapes/home video market ruining the cinema industry, and questions if we should feel guilty about watching these films now? The sex comedies discussed, mentioned (including in text), and pictured in the two-part programme included (in alphabetical order): Adventures of a Taxi Driver (1976), Adventures of a Private Eye (1977), Adventures of a Plumber's Mate (1978), The Amorous Milkman (1975), Au Pair Girls (1972), Can You Keep It Up for a Week?

2,10,I'm First?,dcarroll74,n/a,15/08/2025,"Can't believe I'm the first to review this 2 parter, never mind reviewing anything as a first responder.Being Irish, what this series showed, was not known in Ireland at the time. It took many years for the Carry On films to be shown therefore, it gives a good idea of how consertive we were at the time (1970's).This was a very informative documentary series, some things I did know about over time. Other things I didn't know about and, in some cases, made me angry, especially the way Mary Millington was treated, when all she wanted to do was, make sex, normal. The Metropolitian Police have a lot to answer for, along with the British Government of the day. And neither will be brought to account for coercive suicide, which is disgusting.I abhor the exploitation of women, in any means; I'm delighted that some of the actresses interviewed, made a stand, and stuck by their principles. They have my utmost respect.I also respect that the actresses who willingly partook in the sex movies, did so with free will. They were the lucky ones, did it with free will, and never felt intimidated. Unlike at the moment.....",False
3,10,Confessions and adventures galore,ShadeGrenade,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis two-part Channel 4 documentary came as an unexpected surprise. Over the past few years, we have suffered dozens of inane, poorly researched programmes in which D-list celebrities have blathered on endlessly. The writer and producer - Simon Sheridan - is the author of a marvellous book called 'Keeping The British End Up' which is worth a read even if you don't like the genre. It was fascinating to see Gay Soper, Christopher Neil, Oliver Tobias, Francoise Pascal and Robin Askwith and hear what they had to say about their time before the cameras. I take exception, though, with the comment that the key audience for these films consisted mainly of old men in grubby macs. When I visited the cinema, I saw only teenagers keen to have a good laugh. They pretended to be older than they were.Courting couples also enjoyed these films. Yes, Mary Millington should not have been hounded by the police. The Tories hated the so-called permissive society with a vengeance, and vowed to destroy it if elected in 1979.Nobody went to see these films expecting Fellini. I was glad to see 'Eskimo Nell' being praised; it really is a marvellous film, much funnier than the 'Confessions' and 'Adventures' series in my view. The documentary was not a sneerfest, but a fascinating look at a much-maligned genre. Well done, Simon!",True
4,10,A riveting documentary from Simon Sheridan.,brucemartin-92210,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA hugely entertaining & informative documentary covering the 'rise' of the sexploitation film during the 1970s. The public's appetite for this new genre along with the helpful changes to the BBFC ratings in 1970 allowed for sexual liberties to be taken that couldn't have been dreamt of in previous decades.There are insights from successful filmmakers Pete Walker & Stanley Long and Robin Askwith from the 'Confessions' movies is a particularly engaging interviewee. Also good to hear from Fran√ßoise Pascal & Diane Keen along with Prudence Drage (whom Stanley Kubrick wanted to keep on the set of 'A Clockwork Orange' for the ""entertainment value"").On the whole, most of the actresses are pragmatic about appearing in this type of film and have few regrets, except when explicit scenes were occasionally added without their knowledge to cater for the European market!Oliver Tobias talks about 'The Stud' which helped invigorate the career of Joan Collins in 1978 and erstwhile friends & colleagues of the legendary Mary Millington discuss her career and tragic demise.Simon Sheridan is a filmmaker of quality and I look forward to future offerings as well as exploring his back catalogue!",True

1,8,A great insight into UK skateboarding,simon_dm,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone from the UK who used to skate, it's really refreshing to see a doc about what it's like to skate over here. Using the olympics as the basis of the doc and showing the struggles of the skaters that are working toward competing gives a really compelling insight into the uk skate scene, and how poorly skaters are treated by the industry.Really great doc, I'll definitely be rewatching.",False

1,9,Hard to stop watching,vreka-31474,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wonderful documentary which makes you feel humble and grateful.It is engaging to watch doctors, nurses and paramedics do their incredible jobs and try to combine it with their family lifes. Some very emotional moments and some terrifying insights (nr. 1 cause of death for juveniles? Gun related incidents!!!).The makers of this documentary have the gift to connect the visitor with all people in it, which makes it gripping and hard to resist.Some events brings you to the edge of your seat. The main characters are nothing less than heroes working in the background most of their lives
Filming them means putting them in a well deserved spotlight.Well done and very much worth watching...",False
2,9,Heartfelt,mrrobot787,n/a,16/08/2025,"To me, this is really more about the healthcare workers than only the patients. Some of the reviews complained that this isn't an accurate picture of healthcare overall, and I'd say that it depends. This is very New York centric, so of course you're getting the best, but there are good and less good doctors everywhere. These doctors do honestly seem to be doing a great job handling really high caseloads and it isn't always possible to spend awhile with everyone. Maybe this show is more of a goal than the current reality.I think that this would be a very different show, for example, if it were filmed in rural North Dakota.",False
3,9,This is the best of us at our very best!,dfloro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watch a lot of documentaries, and given their subject matter is often the grimmest ills of our society, wanton criminality and the most base of human motivations, I was frankly overjoyed to see this series highlighting first responders and other expert healthcare professionals struggling to help anybody and everybody in need in NYC, while dealing with their own real-life moments. You get to see continually overworked (& often underappreciated) doctors, nurses, specialists, and even ""flight-for-life"" helicopter pilots and ground ambulance transport personnel. Can you Imagine your chopper-pilot nurse who happens to be 6-7 months pregnant herself (and needing to be manually induced soon), or the trauma nurse traveling with your gravely ill child has had a kid of his own desperately needing that neo-natal ICU? What about a guy donating a kidney to a friend and former coworker that he's known well for ~20 years, but wanting to keep it a secret from the recipient ""so he'll think a kind, random stranger wanted to help save his life."" I have seen some reviewers pointing out that this show paints an unrealistically rosey picture of Western medicine in general, and healthcare in America in particular, and there may be some truth to that. But frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn! These dedicated human beings represent the best of our species trying their level best to provide psychological comfort and physiological care to other humans who need it the very most. And I am both fascinated and moved by it all. I rate it a strong 9/10, and recommend it for all.",True
4,10,Real Heroes,lornak-18008,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched it all in one night. It was nothing short of incredible to watch these medical teams not only save lives, but also the life flight crews and EMT's. Not only do we see some of the doctors and nurses personal lives but they also follow two medical team members that are pregnant and due soon. This was filmed during what I think was the tail end of the pandemic. So yes, it's mentioned some but not anywhere near as much as a year before would have been. A real twist was when one of their own has an injury that could kill someone. Gun violence is also highlighted, as many people are brought to the ER with gunshot wounds. I don't agree that the series was politicized because this is mentioned and that's because these were all true stories. It's not scripted. We are right in the middle of the action in the ER and in the operating rooms for this series. I thought the whole thing was very well done. It gets a 10 from me.",False
5,10,Humanity,keihuynh,n/a,16/08/2025,"With what have been and is happening in the world, it's easy to feel depressed. The series display the humanity in a raw way, between life and death, strangers and families, good days and bad days.The show made me appreciate life, what I currently have and my belief that people are generally good. Feel so grateful, humble, and I have not cried so quickly into a documentary like this one.Thank you to the producers and everyone that made this series happened, and especially thank you to all of you EMT medics, nurses, surgeons, doctors, specialists, and all hospital workers. You truly are the heroes.",False
6,10,Amazing and emotional watch.,jennferg-08449,n/a,16/08/2025,It's so nice to watch a medical show that is 100% real and that focuses on many different members of the team - not just the doctors. Paramedics often don't get enough credit or exposure but they are a big part of this show.As an Operating Room nurse myself I really could sympathize with the healthcare workers as you follow them along in their jobs. They are all so kind and you can tell they truly want to help others. I cried at points in every episode. It's such a good show. I hope a lot of people watch and understand a bit of what it's like to work in healthcare - a system that is so strained but everyone working in it is leaving their own family and loved ones to take care of strangers.,False
7,8,Everyone here is a True Hero,rbrb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a masterful series about hospital and related workers including ambulance medics, doctors, nurses and everyone else taking care of emergency patients in New York.These are the real celebrities who should be lauded not ignorant overpaid footballers or drugged up so called movie stars etc.The series gives an intense look into the lives and work of personnel in the front line of saving our lives.I was engrossed by the first 4 or 5 episodes and i only skimmed over the remaining parts as I try to avoid hospitals and recently had some emergency treatment, so I do not like being reminded of what it is like being a patient!The highlight is the birth of children especially the one involving Caesarian delivery. Will bring people to tears of joy!Those not in the USA like myself may be puzzled though due to the fact for years we have heard stories about the high cost of medical care in the States; so how is all this work paid for and by whom?No answers given anywhere...Despite that a high rating is deserved=8/10.",False
8,8,"Binged it, and binge cried the whole time",HorrorDonLeash,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't realize when I started this show that I would be finishing it the same day. I couldn't stop watching, it was fascinating and full of heart. I also figured it'd be sad but I wasn't aware that I'd be reaching for the tissues the whole time. Look, I know not every hospital is perfect and watching this might only show the best side of EMS and hospital frontliners. But I truly believe this docuseries does a great job at unveiling the heart and passion of why these frontline medical workers chose this career path. And the patients and patients' families are as real as it gets. Great show. Highly recommend, especially l if you want to spend a full day crying.",False
9,10,This Is Good,Maxax777,n/a,16/08/2025,Okay - this is GOOD!!! Once you start watching - you can't stop! Every episode has something special - and they all have heart! It's really very good. I was surprised! And after that - I don't know what else to add - but it's a great series - big thumbs up! Again - I think the best part is there is just something rich and amazing in each and every episode - something will touch you. So now again - Okay - this is GOOD!!! Once you start watching - you can't stop! Every episode has something special - and they all have heart! It's really very good. I was surprised! And after that - I don't know what else to add - but it's a great series - big thumbs up! Again - I think the best part is there is just something rich and amazing in each episode.,False
10,7,"AMAZING, but...",vgqjwpwndx,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerReally didn't like how many patient-stories they picked up without letting us know how they ended (properly). Also the hard mix of several stories throughout multiple episodes was sometimes a bit confusing.Beside of that, as an European, where everybody can just walk into a hospital when not feeling well, I know this is not the case in US - which makes me terribly sad and it's even more sad that US-politics can get a proper health care done - so under the line I was constantly thinking of how many patients CAN'T go and get a treatment :(Even though some see it as propaganda: I loved the message about fighting against guns, especially when kids die.",True
11,10,I LOVE this show!,jax_lady2002,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this show as many others have also said. I love seeing / learning about all the staff and the patients. I sure hope there will be a season 2. I get invested in the staff's lives and love the 2 main doctors, the neurosurgeons. It's amazing the miracles they can perform that save people's life. And you see what kind of things / accidents happen to people every day. It really drives me nuts that IMBD review HAVE to be 500 characters. I just wanted to comment how much I like this show and wanted to recommend it for others who like reality shows and medical shows. It's the best of both worlds.",False
12,7,Good medical show apart from the propaganda.,destiny_west,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a fan of real life documentaries that show the true heroes that are involved in our medical fields, especially those in emergency response situations.Not being from America, it was definitely interesting watching events happening in NYC, and getting to know the healthcare workers involved in saving people's lives.They see such tragedy, and put their own lives at risk to help others, what they do is beyond heroic, they deserve so much acknowledgement and respect.The only thing that turned me off Emergency NYC, was the blatant political propaganda that seemed to become more ingrained in the series the more it went on.Also, it was difficult to watch knowing what expenses these patients were up against just to save their lives.Apart from that, again it was really interesting, and I have the utmost respect for these and all healthcare workers out there on the front line.",False
13,5,"Compelling show, too much propaganda destroyed it.",awwwyeahhhbaby,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like others have said, this series had a lot of great info, some very interesting aspects of care and surgery as well as a great flow between several hospitals showing the problems medical staff endure to take care of their fellow human being.In between all of that greatness is nonstop propaganda for gun control, plugs about gun violence, equity and almost a weird reverence toward Covid and it's impact on some people.Some of the doctors are more hippy and shaman inspired than I expected, they did prayer circles and crystal healing bowls...yeah, toss in some alchemy while we're at it.m right before neurosurgery.",False
14,10,Great show,michyc-62056,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show was great! I love the raw truth of it and the compassion of the staff that shows through! I enjoyed seeing the areas it is filmed in as it brings me back to the feeling of being at home because I spent most of my life in nyc area. This is def a great watch and I hope they make more episodes
Northwelll is a great hospital. I am invested in Thai show and I am truly
Hoping they decide to make more episodes, I feel this shows the truth and compassion and hard work if the front line workers in health care that are working to help the people of nyc and they need to be acknowledged for all they do

15,8,It's a good show but...,linuspmarketing,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a good documentary series, but the title is very misleading.Without spoiling the series itself, i can say that it doesn't follow nearly as much emergencies as you would think. It's a follow up to the Lenox hill series on Netflix, with most doctors present here too. It has some emergency scenes but it mostly shows pre planed surgeries and the patients.Don't get me wrong the series is absolutely great, although it does try to shove a bit of gun propaganda down your throat, but i can look past that. It shows a very tiny bit of reality for these people, mostly the best parts, and its incredible to watch and the fact that you get to experience just a small bit of their life is worth it alone. I recommend this series, but, it's not what the title suggests.",False
16,10,Phenomenal show!,hutto_2000,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a RN of almost 30 years, now permanently disabled and more patient than nurse, it's important to have perspective when watching. Yes, our healthcare system is broken in this country. Yes, access to services, staff-patient ratios, mounds of bureaucratic red tape with insurances are almost insurmountable ongoing challenges everywhere... is it an overall realistic picture of our healthcare system in this country? Not really, but that's not the show's intent either. It is look inside one particular hospital in New York City, giving us a glimpse, -literally snapshots in eight episodes- of a variety of emergency cases featuring patients, families and staff perspectives- also recognizing the societal issues of homelessness, gun violence, drug abuse, mental illness, the impact of COVID, access to healthcare for all- and how these issues impact the care health professionals offer as well as the barriers to care these issues cause.I especially appreciate that. It also gives a glimpse into the camaraderie and teamwork necessary to coordinate good patient care. The doctors and nurses featured are extraordinary in their human Ness, their vulnerability, their willingness to share the challenges they face without the overarching ""God-complexes"" or big egos we (as professionals) are so accustomed to seeing particularly in these highly specialized areas, like neurosurgery, pediatric surgery, transplant surgery, Etc. Rest assured, they chose truly the cream of the crop to interview and follow for these eight episodes. Again, we are getting a glimpse, and of course their best sides are forward, but one gets the feeling watching this that it's a pretty authentic representation of who these particular physicians and nurses are, and not merely ""playing good people"" for the journalistic effect.It is refreshing to see doctors connect with patients and family in such a kind and meaningful way. It is why I went into healthcare many years ago, was to connect to patients, to make a difference, to help and maybe even heal if I was lucky, and to be part of a team that focused on individual centered care. Recognizing each person as a holistic entity, no different from ourselves, these physicians, nurses, EMTs seem to exhibit all of those wonderful qualities in their dedication and loyalty to their code of ethics and upholding a high level of professionalism.There are still plenty of physicians, nurses, and staff around the country who are equally as good and dedicated. But we can only go by our own experience unless, of course, we see a documentary like this to gain a different perspectiveUnfortunately, no, as someone in the healthcare system as a patient almost daily the last six years since a major car accident changed my life, it has been a shocking and devastating realization as a patient just how many healthcare professionals are burned out, exhausted, overwhelmed with work requirements, and insurance bureaucracy that they are disconnected from what brought them to medicine in the first place. I know what it's like to be dismissed, disrespected, not heard, ignored, untreated, mistreated, by all the healthcare systems, I have been involved with in one way or another since the accident in 2018. But I have also had some amazing doctors, nurses, medical assists, nursing assistants, therapists who in many ways helped to save my life. But it wasn't the majority as we wish it would be.... And I'm not sure how we get back to that. This documentary gave me great hope and reminded me of why my passion is still in healthcare, even though I can no longer physically do the work.It is still exciting for me to see things. I never got to see, such as brain, surgery, pediatric surgery, and the workings of transplantation. It was emotional for me to watch the stories of those with glioblastoma, as I lost a very dear friend to Gio a couple years ago in his 40s. The same excitement and tears as I watched the C-sections and nervous parents going through childbirth, as I started my career in nursing many years ago as an OB nurse. This show touched on, so many interesting and fascinating aspects of emergency/ surgical healthcare- I was especially touched by the emergency situation with the surgeon. As someone who is now disabled, and unable to return to nursing, a career, I loved, I felt in the pit of my gut, the intense impending doom which he expressed never being able to do what he loved again. One of the main themes of the show, incredibly incredibly fragile life truly is. And it takes a team of people working together to hold on that tiny, fragile thread of hope that life will continue, and health may be restored to the best of their ability, and that of the individual. It also speaks to the importance of having community around you when there is suffering, whether you are staff or patient. We need community, we need connection. We also need to recognize the struggle of those who do not have community who may be without a home, family, Friends, who are struggling and ways to find a place and a purpose in this world. It is so important to recognize the veil is almost invisible between us as healthcare professionals and our patients. This show clearly gives us an example of just how transparent that veil is that we can go from robust, healthy, working, dedicated professionals to suddenly broken, suffering, patients on a table in an instant. And so often we as professionals, take that for granted, I can tell you as someone who can no longer do what I love to do for so long, there is such an intense, deep, pervasive grief and loss. Over this alone..The show makes me so proud to still be a nurse, even though I can no longer work in my profession. It reminds me of so many moments in my career, where I felt connected, useful, helpful, driven, and respected it reminds me of the joy of being part of a team, also the frustration of being part of a team and trying to do all we can do within the confines of corporate healthcare, which was constantly difficult to navigate. I am reminded of the excellent leaders I worked with, who had just the right combination of compassion, empathy, vulnerability Listening skills, creativity, as well as intensely upholding, professional, ethics and values, bridging, the gap, representing the employees to corporate entities as an advocate, while also guiding and nurturing us to be better as professionals and to grow.I can't say enough about this show, and I truly hope there is another season. As a patient who has gotten so jaded over the last several years and disheartened by my own experience in the very broken system, it's programs like these that remind me of the miracles- Truly the miracles of the human body, the human resolve, human resiliency and the God-given talents and hearts of compassion that still resides in professionals and staff in every hospital in every corner of this great nation. There are healthcare professionals who go above and beyond every day. There are healthcare professionals, who continue to ""fight the good fight"" amongst all of the incredibly stressful challenges, they must face- aside from a nationwide traumatic pandemic in which we were not prepared, but we continue to fight and do the best we could do.My one suggestion as someone who record and researched the impact of secondary trauma, caregiver, burn out, and the increasing rates of suicide, among healthcare professionals, to dedicate a period of time in a show where you focus on just that. As always most of these shows mention these issues briefly, but we never really get a full picture of the impact. It's always a few sentences about how we just ""need to compartmentalize and get through it"", when the truth of the matter is is, that's partially why we got here with nursing shortages, other shortages, because people are leaving the profession. Burnout is real, secondary trauma is real, moral injury is Raul, PTSD is very real, we need to talk about it. We need to shine a light on it a very bright light, we need to stop ""compartmentalizing"" and talk about the really hard painful stuff that we are exposed to and see day after day, even what we go through as employees in corporate healthcare is traumatic. I like the scene very much where they decompress after losing a patient, but there needs to be so much more of this on a regular basis, as part of the responsibility of a corporate employer to listen to employees and nurture them through these issues by providing services, resources, and making mental healthcare part and parcel of the package. They offer to every employee, beyond just an outside therapy resource. It needs to be part of the culture everywhere they need to have specialized staff -trauma informed staff - to connect with employees, work with employees, check in with employees, and find ways to decompress, discuss, reflect, and to work through the trauma bite-size pieces to hopefully avoid total shut down and breakdown of the human psyche to where someone leaves the profession. There is healthy compartmentalization, but often we adopt unhealthy compartmentalization, which means we just stuff it, and never deal with it, which then has accumulating effects. We carry on a daily basis hour after our shift after shift, also impacts our body, so we need to do what we encourage patients to do, take our own advice, which is hardest for us, and take care of ourselves, body mind and soul. And corporate healthcare needs to take an active part in that as well. To take care of their employees Beyond just salary and insurance.Thank you too all who were involved in creating this amazing documentary series, I hope very much a second season will be done. It has been so helpful and uplifting to me in so many ways, right now over the holidays it means so much for me to watch this, and to feel some hope again. I'm very sad. I've watched all eight episodes. I may rewatch them again. :)Good healthcare still DOES EXIST . 💙",True
17,3,Mostly propaganda,Xavier_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"If anyone has been to an actual hospital you'll find this series misleading at best. Here we have attentive nurses and doctors willing to talk to the patient and even console and hug them. Everything is fast paced and there seems to be about 3 incidents per episode. The actual time spent would be 10-15 hours so of course it's going to show all the important parts, and not the endless waiting and waiting. You might get one minute with the doctor to chat.I think doctors and nurses do a good job for the most part. There are tons of problems with hospitals and the way that they work, and this is reflected on the fact that medical errors are so prevalent and are a leading cause of death.To portray the hospital services as some efficient and highly tuned machine is misleading and most people will be shocked once they actually need their services.",False
18,3,Could be better,julegruve,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really liked the raw stories and the surgeries were very interesting. Surgeons all have a God complex but these guys weren't as bad as most.Got sick of the slants against weapons. It's New York. A historically violent city. The guys with the guns don't own them legally. They don't blame the cars or the poor health choices. Doubt I'll continue to watch as they seem so ignorant of the perpetrators in their own city. Hint: it's not the inanimate object. It's the people running these cities who don't create a safe city for their citizens.The ENT's were the best part. No nonsense and down to business to save lives. Also the support staff of nurses, techs and maintenance. It's mainly just the rich docs who don't live in the Real parts of the cities who were annoying and arrogant.",False

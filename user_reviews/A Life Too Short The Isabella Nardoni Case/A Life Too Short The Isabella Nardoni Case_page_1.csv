1,6,Mixed feelings,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such a tragic story but my review is for the film, the Engish version. Netflix normally uses more quality voice-over actors but the ones here were just reading lines as if translated by an online app that didn't know how to transfer to American words and phrases rather than simply repeat the exact translation into English. That made it hard to feel an emotional connection. I should have switched to the native language and just read subtitles to hear the emotion. Since I'm not familiar with this story - maybe because I don't watch any news - I would have liked to know more about Isabella and her life prior to this horrible tragedy. There was very little introduction or focus on her, there were no crime scene photos and negligible reinactments of what they believe happened. There was too much chit chat that was just describing how people were acting and not any forencic information except a lengthy statement from the defense saying that forensic scientist don't know anything for sure. I disagree because it is a science that has become very precise in determining all factors. As a clairvoyent, I had distinct impressions that the step mother killed Isabella - or thought she did - in a fit of jealousy and the husband tried to covered it up by tossing the body out the window. Both are guilty. It's actually more common than we realize that a step parent harms or kills the step child. There are real horror stories of the in court records. But perhaps the greatest tragedy is the first witness calling the apartment manager instead of the ambulance or police. That's the craziest thing I've ever heard! In the U. S. each citizen has a duty by law to administer immediate aide when someone needs medical attention, which usually means calling an ambulance, at the very least. Here, if an able adult called the apt mgr before summoning aide, he would likely be held accountable in some way for delaying urgent assistance. We expect that from children but not from adults. I'm so glad the mother was able to find joy again and has 2 beautiful children who will always remember their sister. That's amazing strength, to go on living and to be able to say she's not over protective. This will be one of those cases talked about in law schools and remembered as one of the many where step parents kill and the spouse protects their crime. Rest in peace little Isabelle.",False
2,3,Tragic story poorly portrayed.,amyp85,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel like this documentary has all of the necessary elements to explain what happened to the poor Isabella but the way it is presented is very confusing.The English subtitles lack in clarity and people are shown on screen with their Spanish title but not often with the English equivalent so you're not sure who they are or what their relevance is.The flow of the information darts about quite a lot and I feel that there is a lot of unnecessary filler. It seems there is a lot of focus on the outside 'circus' which does need to be covered, but I feel this is more the sole focus and therefore takes away from the main premise of the documentary.I feel that this needed to be more clear cut to really tell the little girls story.",False
3,1,This is NOT a documentary,clauengelke,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary must bring all versions of the parts, and ALL EVIDENCE found by the expert. That's not what we see here. They bring partial information, opinions of those who weren't even involved in the case. Those who followed the case identified such failures because they felt a lack of precious evidence information, brought during the trial of the case, which made clear the reasons for the conviction of the defendants. It is not what we see here. I was left wondering who this ""documentary"" came to serve... because it wasn't the truth about the case. What a waste of opportunity! This is NOT a documentary, unfortunately.",False
4,10,An important revisit to a tragedy,Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler15 years after the infamous murder of 5-year-old Isabella Nardoni on the hands of her father Alexandra Nardoni and her stepmother Anna
Carolina Jatobá comes this documentary by Netflix that shines a light in all of the darkest corners of the investigation of the case, the trials and the
people who were close to the events that happened on March 2008.Unlike previous typical TV specials, this one is very sober, effective and dares to go a step
beyond in inviting audiences to the possibilitity of doubt about the defendants culpability even though the case was very cut-and-dry and basically everyone's
mind is formed by now (specially for those who followed the case ever since its origins). And plus: it covers with great detail all the possible aspects of the
case without missing any information and without overdoing it with excessive lenghts or chapter divisions.This brought back many memories from the extensive media coverage of the case, a whole mediatic circus at many times trying to rush things on their
search for information and all, and the crowd followed along every step of the way. No other case impacted society in such a close matter before, and it almost
became a new basis on how media would cover such cases (for bad or good); From the details before the crime, who were the girl's parents, then
moving to the night of the murder when she was hit and then thrown away from her apartment some stores below; and later on the forensic analysis right after
the event and almost a month later during the re-enactment of events with the media following from afar filming the doll representing Isabella on the window
as the experts analysed positions, marks, everything (it was all over the news on a sunday afternoon, if I recall exactly). It's all covered here.A curious part of those re-examinations were the Nardoni apartment recreation on a set and two experts telling the events and what was found at the crime
scene. The devel of detail was amazing. And there's also the defense lawyers, the prosecutor who became a celebrity during the case, Isabella's mother and
grandmother sharing the most emotional bits since for a period they honestly believed that it was just an accident that happens with kids now and again.So, we all know what happened with the perpetrators (and there are so many unknown details about the trial that it was all fascinating to see and hear)
and that case was really like the popular saying says that the crime is in the details, doesn't matter about the possibility of a third party as at one time
Alexandre tried to use as an excuse of a burglar who entered their apartment. But the movie gives some interesting room for doubt when it relates to Anna and
her involvement that it'll spin your head for a long while.Obvious that the case might get other specials or some revelations in time since the killers mantain their innocence, but until those this very
documentary can be considered a definitive material on the matter. Efficient and thrilling all the way, investigative journalism at its best. 10/10.",True
5,3,It's a difficult case.,gurumaggie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI felt there was more to be discovered here, the uproar and the hate did not help, in any way to tell us what actually happened, I think proper forensics and mayhaps investigating the father of the child would have been useful.The mother trusted this young new wife, does that imply she didn't trust the dad? I could understand a young woman with post natal depression and three children under six being the burden that made her snap, but cutting the net requires pre meditation.Sadly none of this brings back an enchanting and much loved child, I hope it brings solace to the family, it was a difficult watch that I couldn't repeat. R. I. P. Isabella.",True
6,9,Listen to what they say,glizze1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI thought this was a well done documentary, and I also watched the interviews that were shown in the documentary in full. Not saying they did or did not, but I always notice linguistics. Just in the middle of this documentary, the reporter asks the mother how she's dealing with it. As a mother, I don't think I'd be able to deal with it, and I certainly wouldn't be talking about myself. In my opinion, that's how you can always tell when people that are accused of crimes like this tend to talk about how it's affecting them rather than the death of their loved one which I noticed was mussing throughout this entire documentary. And again, I'm only speaking from this version of documentary there was very little talk about Isabella herself. I never heard the parents mention her name, I saw No remorse from the parents who also never mentioned her or her name. That's a giant red flag.",True

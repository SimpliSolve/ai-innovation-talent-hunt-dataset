1,8,America according to Jane Fonda.,ulicknormanowen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting documentary about multifaced Jane Fonda,a career which spans decades sometimes mirroring the contradictions and the troubles of the era .Made in France,where she was adored by the leftists and hated by the right-wing , the doc includes her French career which is now very good ( René Clément 's ""les félins"" where her sexy felinity is Alain Delon's doom ) now disastrous (her then husband Roger Vadim 's flicks , ""la curée "" in which he botched Zola ,""spirits of the dead"" in which he butchered Poe°)After ""Barbarella"" ,she made a volte-face and went back to making great films :""they shoot horses ,don't they? "" (my personal favorite of her filmography) and ""Klute"".In the same way, Jane fonda the activist had
appeared : the doc does not explain enough her behavior (it's not as easy to understand as with a personality such as Joan Baez) ; pictures of her satirical revue with her friend and co-star in ""Klute"" Donald Sutherland FTA are included ,along her much debated visit to North Vietnam and her FBI file.Then appeared the champion of aerobics which showed women that they can still be young after 40; the business woman and the reappearance in recent movies where she remains attractive.The most moving moment is the AA her father eventually won for ""on golden pond"" ; why he had to wait for an Ok movie whereas superior performances (""you only live once"" , ""grapes of wrath""or ""twelve angry men"",to name but three ) should have been rewarded by an oscar well before.remains a mystery . Jane brought the statuette to the hospital just before his death.Though inevitably too short , the doc nevertheless succeeds in revealing the different faces of a fascinating actress .",False

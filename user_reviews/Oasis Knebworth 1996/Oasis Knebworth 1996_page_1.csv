1,9,This is HISTORY!,dtnmusic,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incredible moment in time becomes even more incredible in hindsight. No phones, no cameras, no internet.... just the good old days. A huge band captured at their greatest height as they deliver a rock solid performance just before the money, fame, and drugs took one last gargantuan bite and never returned Oasis the same. Excellent cinematography and sound accompany the festivities, but I do believe the true star of this is the crowd. All 125,000 per night, singing, dancing, bouncing to every note. Such a beautiful thing to watch for anyone with a heartbeat!",False
2,9,A true blast from the past!,tanya-duffy,n/a,16/08/2025,"To start I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS 25 YEARS AGO!!My husband and and I were/are true Oasis fans and have continued to follow the brothers separate journeys since the spilt.We were lucky enough to see Oasis 3 times (Earls Court, Finsbury Park & Hammersmith Apollo) and missed them twice in Paris due to brotherly bust ups causing cancellations but never managed to get tickets for Knebworth, so it was great to hear tales from fans who had actually made it!This is an amazing time capsule piece as it really reflects on how much things have changed. This gig was Pre social media, mobile phones and internet, as we know today, it reminded us of the buzz just trying to get the tickets in the first place.Had a little tear as they talked about the Prodigy supporting, it was a nice touch with some great shots of the amazing Keith Flint RIP.It's brilliant that Liam & Noel were actively involved in the project, although I suspect they were never in the same room at the same time! LOLOnly downside 'Some Might Say' it was a little pricey to see it in the cinema... a hefty £15.95 each with no discount if you are a monthly paying customer, that's amost as much as the original gig of £22:50!Oh how times have changed 'D'you Know What I Mean?' So just 'Roll With It' pay 'Whatever' and 'I Hope, I Think, I Know' you'll enjoy it!",False
3,9,ITS BIBLICAL!,jlwhit24,n/a,16/08/2025,"I sat, along with thirty other people, in theaters last night singing and enjoying the amazing tunes of Oasis' Knebworth 1996 performance. How is that this music/concert event still resonates after 25 years? Answer, it's biblical!",False
4,10,Era defining is right.,garyprosser1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is what people who don't like Oasis will never understand. Sure, there are technically better bands and there are more competent lyricists, stronger vocalists, better singers and more proficient musicians but what that band MEANT to people, well, that can't be bought or taught.Oasis were a band of the people, for the people. For two nights to still resonate so strongly 25 years later that a film is made about them says it all. It wasn't about gimmicks, pyrotechnic light shows, 360 degree revolving stages, pyramids, dancers and 40 costume changes. It was about 250,000 people forgetting their troubles, forgetting themselves and singing along to every word as five lads from a council estate lived the dreams of every single member of the audience and millions more around the world.My fear is that such a musical moment may never happen again. The world has changed; the optimism of the 90's has given way to fear, mistrust and falsehoods. Films like this are a welcome reminder that society used to be so much more cohesive and maybe, just maybe, we can get back there.",False
5,10,Left me teary eyed,fortheboys-65955,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not being a big oasis fan before I saw this, the film really shows you how much the band meant and still means to people. I left the theatre believing that oasis truly were the real deal.",False
6,10,Sunsheeeeiiiinnnneeee....,ozkev,n/a,16/08/2025,"Probably a bit biased as a lifelong fan, but had to say my piece.Just finished watching the first showing of O-LAK and it was epic. Supersonic gave us the story of the band and Knebworth puts us right in the mix.This is Oasis at their peak, the very top of their game. You can feel the atmosphere and energy... '96 was an epic year in the UK and this film captures it well.I tried to get tickets but wasn't one of the chosen ones, so this has to do.... and do it does!Its loud, proud and raw. And its good.Do yourself a favour... go see this on the big screen.",False
7,10,Take me back !!!,neilhogg-39701,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was 16 in 1996 and obsessed with oasis , I didn't go to Knebworth but I lived through it I know about the hype , the sheer size of it ,the difficulty in getting tickets . I saw oasis 11 times and know about the euphoria the buzz the magic of being down the front so I was well prepared for this film .. or so I thought . I was almost in tears seeing them again at the peak of their powers and listing to the fans stories just took me back to that time . This is how concerts should be fans and band as one in the moment . Well documented, brilliantly edited a fantastic snapshot of a fantastic timeGo see it.",False
8,7,Mega,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't at Knebworth in '96. I didn't have the money back then. I've more than made up for it since, but still haven't bothered to stump up for Liam Gallagher tickets on the same hallowed ground next year. My point is, do you need to be a fan to enjoy this? No, absolutely not. I mean it helps if you like the music, but there's plenty to get your teeth into. It's as much about the mid-90s and the staging of an audacious event as anything else. A time of ceefax, bucket hats and Tony Blair as a genuine political hero. It's easy to forget just what a huge cultural phenomenon Oasis were. Not musical, cultural! They were bigger than the Beatles... briefly. A cheek considering how much they ripped them off. It's a little strange to talk of Oasis as a past entity. Both Liam & Noel still very much part of the present day UK scene, but the release of this film does feel to underline the passing of Oasis and the steadfast resolve for them not to return. I for one am happy about this. Never go back, it's never as good. Watching a film about the past though, that can be quite enjoyable. Made up of archive (there's a bit of recreation) and narration from the fan perspective. It feels honest and exciting. There's obviously plenty from the band too (well Noel and Bonehead anyway... and about 5 seconds from Liam), talking about the enormity of what's happening and of course loads from the performances themselves. For this you do need to be a fan, although the footage does look lovely and will entertain any cinephile. Plus it helps that this is Oasis at their peak. They sound great and the edit is lovely and especially frenetic on songs like Walrus. It's the stories from the fans that make this tick though. Travelling from around the country in clapped out cars, getting excited as the sun goes down, drinking flat warm lager, for half an hour it's brilliant, a truly great documentary. That's not to say that the performance isn't great, the footage great, Liam's classic sneering and silly white clobber. It's a spectacle, but it halts the stories as the music takes over and becomes a bit more typical. Thankfully the sound-bite narration does pepper the set and the songs aren't played out in full. It's not a concert film, but does enough to scratch that itch if that's what you're after. Despite the tickets being like rocking horse shit, there's no sense of exclusivity. It's a peace and love vibe. There for anyone who loved the music. A tribal mass. If Oasis heaven forbid did reform, you'd be looking at a ton a ticket. Back in '96 though you got The Charlatans, Manic Street Preachers, Chemical Brothers, The Prodigy (and some others)... AND Oasis! For £22.50. This is a celebration of music, not a band. What music can do, how it can bring people together, make them feel something, feel part of something. Give them a perspective beyond their own experience. 125,000 (x2) people sharing a moment. Not a phone in sight. ""You we're there because you wanted to sing those words, not because you wanted to post it on Twitter"". I'm guessing that anyone at Knebworth that weekend will adore this film, but even if you weren't or don't even like Oasis, it's not a barrier.",False
9,10,"Beautiful, heartfelt film",alikssepia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jake Scott and Struan Clay, if you're reading this, THANK you for this beautifully conceived and made film. So much respect towards the fans and the film audience who can relive or just feel the atmosphere thanks to your hard work.",False
10,7,Great snapshot into the 90's music scene,malcolmjohnston,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this remembering being in the crowd filled me with sort of joy and sorrow of how good Oasis were in the beginning and how much the 2 brothers leading the band messed it all up
Great documentary on a fantastic time to have been alive , going to gigs with Cool Britannia in full swingI just wished Liam and Noel called it quits after Knebworth '96 as it was all down hill ever since.",False
11,10,It's up to us to make...,vinchenzo19,n/a,16/08/2025,The best of all the things that come our way.Heartfelt and honest as they always were. A wonderful document of a momentous occasion. I've lived in Stevenage since I was two and Knebworth has always been a part of my life and it was cemented in 1996 with Oasis. A very special place.,False
12,5,Great footage but too much fan input,jimcuk,n/a,16/08/2025,There's some great footage of the gig with decent insight from some members of the band (Noel & Bonehead) however most of the content is testimonies from random fans who attended. I think it would've been much more interesting with more input from people who were directly involved in the performances rather than hearing what time Dave from Luton had to get up to catch his coach to the gig.,False
13,10,Live Forever,CMartU2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at a movie theater in Dayton, Ohio and it was fantastic!!! I remember having these shows on bootleg CD's in the late 90's but actually seeing the concerts and unseen footage was unreal. Oasis has meant a lot to me since 1994 and this movie just blew me away. Liam and Noel what can you say, there are no others like them. They were hilarious during both nights and Liam, what a voice. Who could've better sung Noel's perfectly penned lyrics?Fantastic set and the commentary from the fans that actually went to the shows was a special touch. This movie made me realize how great concerts really were before cell phones wherein you lived in the minute and enjoyed every moment of the show. This movie brought me back to 1996 when I was 21.So glad to see how much Oasis means to millions of other people just like me. Mad fer it!!!!",False
14,10,Time Flies...,simonjg78,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fantastic snap shot of a time of great music, football and being part of something that still feels special to this day. The connection between oasis and fans is clear to see, in a thoughtful film that delivers on multiple levels. Good times came flooding back and hearing Liam at his peak cannot be beat. Thank you.",False
15,10,Mesmerizing,godlike-99067,n/a,16/08/2025,"The last great gathering of the pre-internet age. Just a band and its fans, one on one. What a movie. It takes you back in memory lane to a probably lost era where music was the center of it all.As an Oasis fan who was too young when these concerts took place and could not attend them, I feel like we relived the moment. The music, the vibe, the culture, the atmosphere it is all there, truly epic film for both Oasis fans and music lovers. A milestone to remember and one to be proud of, you will walk out of this movie and bombast the good Oasis tunes all the way back home. Live forever!",False
16,10,Once in a lifetime,surfingnaked1,n/a,16/08/2025,This concert could not happen today. This was a once in a lifetime concert . Everything was completely pure and innocent. Even the brothers got along back then.,False
17,10,"A Fantastic Love Letter to Knebworth, Oasis & the 90's",cjc52292,n/a,16/08/2025,"After only becoming a big fan from the U. S. Five-years-ago, learning so much about Oasis during that time & now seeing this - It was a fantastic experience.From being completely behind the scenes, up close to the fans and then the incredible footage of five of them; It was truly one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.Well done to everyone involved. ✌🏼🇺🇸 🇬🇧",False
18,10,Wow.,garrettgeeslin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely incredible. I've never gone to a movie by myself but this was an exception. The editing was so on point and it captured just how huge this concert was, I was blown away. I cannot wait until it's released so I can force all of my friends to watch it. One of the greatest bands to ever do it. Live forever!",False
19,3,Someone talks all over the show,jimirvaughan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Terrible idea to present this. Begins with 20 minutes of listening to how people had to wait on a phone, then wait on a bus, then wait in a field, waiting for the loos.Like a bit of waiting nostalgia will make us feel good. Definitely want to hear some total strangers from 25 years ago talking about how they were waiting for stuff because things weren't so fast in the 90s.Then you finally get to the performance after listening to all these random peeps and you're thinking, thank god they'll shut up and I can enjoy the show now.Then they keep talking over it, or they cut the intro and outro so that some other random can give a bit more babble.Imagine you've got someone sitting with you to watch, and they won't shut up during the whole movie, that's the experience the editors/director decided to go for in this.",False
20,10,The closest thing to seeing oasis live,danieladgzf,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a too young Oasis fan, I never got a chance to see them live. Jake Scott and Struan Clay did a great job. If you were at the gig or were a fan of Oasis at the time, the movie will bring back that youth and those memories. But if you're like me, well it's the closest you have. I really enjoy the photography, the style, also the recreations with the off voices of the fans are really nice like the girls who got tickets on the day of the gig in 10 minutes, or the girl with her brother. That gig changed the people who were there and made them reborn; You can see the fans and the band and know much more about Knebworth. If you get a chance, watch it in the cinema to really feel the energy, when I was in my seat I wanted to go mad, scream and cry. I did not want it to end, I hope that in another life I was there. Oasis Knebworth 1996 is more than you can expect, it makes you feel like you were there, that you are going to live forever, it makes you feel SUPERSONIC.",False
21,10,Biblical,kusin-jean,n/a,16/08/2025,Doesnt matter if you like the band or not. This is a movie you need to see. I doesnt just capture Oasis at their best but it captured what a concert of this size meant to so many.Only negative part was that it wasnt longer.,False
22,10,Incredible,smcgazz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust back from seeing Knebworth 1996. Wow, what can I say? Incredible!! A band who went from playing pubs, to playing for 250,000 fans over 2 nights within 2 years. The last great gathering of fans before the Internet and smartphones took over. The support bands, The Prodigy, Cast, The Charlatans, Manic Street Preachers, The Chemical Brothers etc. Liam and Noel untouchable!! I've seen Oasis 4 times and they were amazing each time, but I'd have given up all of that to be at Knebworth. Genuine goosebumps moments watching the best band of all time at their absolute peak!! First film I've been to that's had a standing ovation at the end! Unreal!!",True
23,10,Brilliant documentary...,steveisaac-65791,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an era this was for music in the UK... Brit pop was at its peak with dozens of top bands producing great music, and this was probably the defining gig.Great quality film and sound,this really takes you back with band members telling their experiences of the weekend, but also the fans story also of how they got tickets, got there and the whole experience of being there.Makes me feel worse every time I remember turning down a ticket to go to it 😂😂",False
24,10,"This is HISTORY! Right here, Right now!",scottowens-70462,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a time to be alive! Great documentary! If I could score it an 11 I would! 1996, the music scene was at its peak, and it's never been the same. The last of the Rock n Roll Stars! Long live OASIS.",False
25,10,96 all over again,timashworth,n/a,16/08/2025,"At first I wasn't sure about much of the documentary being narrated by people who were at the gig (and even less so some of the recreations of buying tickets etc) but, in the end, this just blew me away. The mix of comments by the fans and the band, coupled with some amazing footage (so good in HD) just took me right back there. I was there on the Saturday and it was the first time of six that I'd see Oasis.This documentary feels like it was put out more by Noel than Liam (the latter barely makes any comment at all) but, ironically, the film places almost like a love letter to Liam Gallagher. His iconic poses and incredible singing are captured brilliantly throughout.I can't believe they sat on this footage for 25 years.",False

1,8,What's there in a name?,P-O-V,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSHAHID: Directed by Narges Kalhor.For TL;DR
A lot of themes are brilliantly juxtapositioned by experimenting various cinematic techniques to tell a simple story of a filmmaker who wants to get away with her surname ""Shahid""for some personal/political reason. If you can read and connect how the filmmaker uses the medium of cinema, it will be a treat to watch. Else you might get confused with intermittent form transitions from Poems, Dance, Filmmaking, Theatre, documentary etc.My P. O. V:
Shakespeare asks: What's there in a name? Well, the filmmaker Nargis SHAHID Kalhor says EVERYTHING.She just does not say that, but makes a beautiful personal film around it.I don't know the exact reason, but the way the Iranian filmmakers use film as a medium to tell stories, the control they have in their craft and the experimentation they do with the narrative structure of the film is just outstanding. They are really taking what auteurs like Abbas Kairostami did to the next level.I started last year IFFK(2023) by watching Four Daughters and felt the same thing today when I watched Shahid and both films have few things in common like the conflicts between actors and Real people whom they are enacting.You need a notebook of two hundred pages to write down all the themes the filmmaker discusses in this movie. It includes politics of Identity crisis, Migration, Glorification of past, Existentialism, unheard Woman Voices, Personal movie, Misinterpreted History....and it goes on.And do ask the shopkeeper if there is a buy one get one offer for that notebook. Because you need another one to write down all the cinematic techniques she uses in this film. When filmmakers struggle to have control of a movie with just one theme and one technique, it seems like Nargis and her team were on some kind of high, so they decided to use all the Cinematic techniques they knew in one film. And Voila it works. There is a movie within a movie, there is documentary style, music, dancing, Surrealism , old footage, VFX, Slow motion, Super imposing of images, narration by the director, ultra realism, poems, theatre, behind the scenes and again goes on and on.The movie starts with a woman surrounded by Ghosts of her ancestors persuading her to remember about the past, her lineage and not to forget her history. While she wants to let these burdens go away and hence wants to remove the surname Shahid from her name. Because she thinks Shahid is a person who is already dead and she is alive. The movie is documentation of the filmmakers thoughts confusions, grief and the reasons why she took this extreme decision. When the movie ends we see another set of people (society) circling around her judging her about her privileges, her craziness and the technical difficulties of the process.The film is inherently funny and at the same time very political. We see the lady actress who plays the filmmaker commenting about her and her filmmaking. In another emotional scene where the lady is crying, suddenly the boom operator brings the mic into the frame to wipe away the tears with the boom mic. If you can connect with the themes and the different techniques the filmmaker uses to visualise these themes, it will be a great watch. The filmmaker brilliantly uses the plot twist to bring the women's perspective and there is a role reversal. The whole perspective changes and the great old grandfather who foight wars will ask to the woman: What will happen to my part reminding us that Empires, Family History, names will all fade away one day. Then those we believed as heros will become villain and vice versa. So what remains: depicted in a scene where the real person ( filmmaker) and the actor who enacts her hug to each other and their compassion transcend into the viewer's heart.",True

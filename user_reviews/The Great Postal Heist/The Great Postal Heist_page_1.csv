1,10,not a technically advanced...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documentary production, but its message in it weighs far more stars from me than anything else.its a film about USPS being dismantled as every other federal and governmental organ in the usa, and the sore stories of victimized USPS employees tells their stories of wrongful treatment, being sakced for treading a yard too long or breathing a bit to calm on their carrier route.I might sound like an old sosialist, but some institutions of democracy must be there for a nation to work, even in the digitalized era were living in, they bind us together anywhere and anyhow and USPS is one of them, and that is the main message of this feature lenght USPS biographical called'' the great postal heist''.The same heist also happened here in norway in the 1990's, done by the conservatives, so all the offices are gone and are now filled with crappy food stuff oand nothing more , its post in boutique, usually a food mall, but they shift so often that its a detective job to find the right one. The postbank of norway where i got my first housing loan from has also been dissolved, and getting mail delivered in the mail box 4 times a week is maximum at most. Its not that i miss it so much but im old and grumpy and had my deposit stamp book with the most glorious coloured stamps when put aside a 5 crowner(they where blue), that book really oozed fear and respect. So if you have a good relation to your mail carrier do for heaven sake watch this memorabilia over sore feet and worn out swampsmelling black suede shoes, and hope and pray that USPS care for their lot a few more years.",False

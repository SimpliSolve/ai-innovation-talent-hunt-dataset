1,7,old sport,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. I've lost track of the number of times I've read F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel ""The Great Gatsby."" In an effortless manner, it sweeps the reader into a magical world through prose that brings the parties and characters to life. Nick, Jay, Daisy, Tom, and Jordan become people we know ... some we may like, others not so much. We precisely envision Gatsby's estate, Nick's bungalow, and that speeding yellow car. There have been multiple movie versions, with the most famous being 1949 with Alan Ladd, 1974 with Robert Redford, and 2014 with Leonardo DiCaprio.In 2013, Robert Steven Williams and Richard Webb began a project documenting the five months in 1920 that Scott and Zelda spent in Westport, Connecticut. A 1996 article in ""The New Yorker"" magazine by renowned writer Barbara Probst Solomon gave credence to the idea that much of Fitzgerald's inspiration for ""The Great Gatsby"" (and West Egg) came from those few months spent in Westport, Connecticut. Now you might think, 'yeah, that's kinda interesting', but in the literary and academic worlds, it caused quite an uproar and backlash. See, foremost Fitzgerald expert and biographer Matthew Bruccoli was adamant that Great Neck, Long Island was Fitzgerald's only inspiration for the classic novel ... and Bruccoli staked his career and reputation on it. He scoffed and refuted any such notion that Westport played a role.Filmmakers Williams and Webb proceed to systematically examine evidence, even though many literary scholars were, at a minimum, quite skeptical. Some background on Westport is provided, including noting its two most famous residents, Paul Newman and Joann Woodward, the 1956 movie THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT, Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone"" episode based there, and an entire season of ""I Love Lucy"" where Ricky and Lucy were living in the town. Numerous writers spent time in Westport, though few of the town's current residents are aware of Scott's and Zelda's summer of 1920.We see the cottage they lived in. She was only 19 years old, and the couple had been married only a short while. What's most compelling is that during that summer, an eccentric and private millionaire named F.E. Lewis resided in the massive estate adjacent to the Fitzgerald house. Lewis was a mysterious man who threw lavish parties at his mansion overlooking the water. Sound familiar? Was Lewis the inspiration for Jay Gatsby?An academic conspiracy doesn't gather much interest outside the ivy walls, but Williams and Webb make a very compelling case that deserves consideration. It has always been presumed that Long Island was the basis for the novel, but even Scott's and Zelda's granddaughter, Bobbie Lanahan, believes it's obvious that a writers experiences can be blended into a composite for fiction. Further evidence is offered by the previously unknown McKaig Diary, which details much of what occurred that summer.Williams enlists the help of actor Sam Waterston (who played Nick Carraway in the 1974 film version) and narrator actor Keir Dullea (Dave in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY) to guide us through the journey. Clips from the movies and an analysis of Scott's other writings, as well as Zelda's novel ""Save Me the Waltz"", lend credence to the thought that those 5 months in Westport made quite an impact on 'America's first pop stars.' Most of us simply prefer to enjoy a good book, but for those who must know the background and what influenced the writer, the documentary makes a very good case for the important role of Westport, Connecticut for Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"".",False
2,7,A great addition for Gatsby and Fitzgerald lovers,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"Found this documentary on a lazy day and punching the right button on Prime.It's mostly well-done and certainly thoroughly researched - blowing the old ""expert"" off the shelves. (Broccoli or similar... I didn't like the sound of him, so...)The one major problem I had was with the voice-over actor who voiced F. Scott Fitzgerald. When he spoke quickly, he had a lisp that was very distracting - to me. (I'm one of ""those"" people with incredibly sensitive hearing. It's blessing when meeting people and picking up where they are really from, and a curse when watching some projects, like this one.)A bonus was the granddaughter of Scott and Zelda was interviewed and was included a lot in this project. She seems to have a realistic opinion of her grandparents. And is incredibly open minded about them and getting new information.This is a must see for any F. Scott Fitzgerald Fan.",False
3,10,Interesting Perspective,laurie-75303,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film moves at a good pace and is every bit as entertaining as it is informative. The delightful soundtrack brings the time period to life and gets the toes tapping. Overall, this movie Gatsby in Connecticut: The Untold Story is a great piece of detective work exploring the premise that famed author F. Scott Fitzgerald's inspiration for his book, The Great Gatsby, came from his experience of living in the town of Westport, Connecticut as opposed to taking place in Great Neck, New York as he describes it in the book and as several scholars believed it to be. While many have written about Fitzgerald and the origins of where the Great Gatsby was based upon, this film pinpoints many convincing reasons to believe that in fact, it could indeed have been based on Westport, right down to the green flashing light at the end of the doc that Fitzgerald writes about in his book. The consistency of facts, events and places that match those in Westport, makes for a convincing case but the movie is more than that. For me, just as interesting and entertaining was learning about this peak time in the author's life during the 1920s that he spent with Zelda, his then new bride, in Westport and to know more about their relationship. The movie includes several clips from the 1974 movie, The Great Gatsby. Seeing the lifestyle of this elite class during a boom time in American history after the war with all the good and bad that can come with an excessive lifestyle was interesting to watch and contrast against today's time period.",False

5,10,"Fun, interesting, fresh - even for a Fitzgerald novice!",malcolmcs-44830,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was much more entertaining than I might've thought! I'm not big into Fitzgerald, but that didn't matter - it's more about the kind of detective work and research these guys did to piece together their theory. It lays it all out in a fast-paced and interesting way. It's also a kind of an underdog story, with Westport being the underdog to New York, and then coming up the winner, so it has that kind of vibe too. Kudos for the hard work to uncover all the little connections and similarities, to weave them into a whole that really tells a neat story.Well done, and I'd recommend to anyone, not just fans of Fitzgerald. Although, having seen this, I may indeed check more into his books (and the movies!).",False
6,3,Editing ruined an interesting subject,sdetlef,n/a,16/08/2025,"The motion (panning, zooming, shakey camera, ect) they used both on photographs and interviews left me sick to my stomach. There is constant movement. You can not take in the imagery because it's in continuous movement that flashes only for a second or two. To be clear, the speed and incessant frequency the images move (FLY) that is distracting and causes a sort of motion sickness.This Clockwork Orange style of documentary making is visual chaos and leaves me feeling anxious and nauseous. Remember when The Blair Witch project made people physically ill with it's shakey camera work. This documentary had a worse effect on me because The unnecessary movement was near constant.From what little I could take in, there seemed to be interesting information about Westport, CT and the Fitzgeralds. The presentation shouldn't ruin the information. Documentaries aren't adrenaline action films.",False

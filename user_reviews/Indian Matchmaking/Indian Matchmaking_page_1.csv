1,5,Narcissism rules on this show.,mae-912-80561,n/a,15/08/2025,"While it is fun to watch, most of the women are flakes; incredibly full of themselves. Nadia is all about Nadia and she sends conflicting signals and flirts with everyone. She prattles on about men and finding a husband like she's 13, and quite a number of them do that. It's not attractive to see a grown woman acting like she's 13 and just discovered boys. Pathetic really, very emotionally immature.Aparna is another one; rude and lacking in social skills. Also, very self absorbed. She couldn't even be polite to the real estate agent. Yikes.These women have put themselves so high up on their own pedestals, no one can reach them. It's no wonder they cannot sustain a relationship.There are some genuinely nice women, but overall the women are single for a reason. No, I'm not being sexist, as I'm a modern, self reliant and independent woman, but they don't need husbands - they have themselves and no one can compete with that.",False
2,7,Come on stop hating you guys!,Nand2Tetris,n/a,15/08/2025,"You will love the effervescent Nadia. And then you'll love the humble lawyer Sekhar. And then you'll love the gentle giant Vyasar. And then the cute vet Rashi. You will not like the stubborn Aparna at first. But over the season, you'll start to warm up to her and actually root for her to find love. You'll roll your eyes at the hard-to-please Pradyumna and then you'll feel the warm fuzzies when the gorgeous Rushali tames him with just one smile. And Sima. She's your typical matchmaker auntie and if you're a woke liberal, she'll have you fuming in 5 minutes and you'll label her and the show pregressive. But by the end of the season, you'll be admiring her for the job she manages to do with the slick finesse of Winston Wolfe. Like her or not, she's the real MVP. Agree that some of the show may be scripted, but these are real people and real stories and the reality of how thousands of Indians are approaching marriages even today. If you're not able to appreciate it, clearly you're missing the forest for the trees and you're busy being offended because you think you are some kind of flag bearer of Indian culture done right. But you aren't. So stop hating and give this show a chance.",False
3,5,Aparna is so annoying!,hellgt8,n/a,15/08/2025,"I fast forward whenever Apanra came to the screen. I can't even see her. I feel sorry for whoever is going to marry this annoying piece of ðŸ’©.#StayAwayFromAparna
#AparnaWillRuinYourLife.",False
4,7,Represents arranged marriage process with some problems,Newyorking,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like this show. I went through an arranged marriage process 20 years ago and would never ever put my kids through it or recommend it. I relate to this show a lot but it has a lot of issues. First, I like the host, she is no-drama and tells it like it is without mincing words. She is correct in the way families think, and obviously most families choosing to go this route are traditional. A modern family would probably not encourage arranged marriages. Being completely honest, a lot of the people wanting to get married aren't your typical good looking ones, they are pretty average, but sure if that is why they need a matchmaker to help find someone.There are lots of likable characters, and the overbearing MIL make me fume because I could relate to it, and it is so representative of Indian MILs and mama's boys. I had a real issue with the host's not recognizing and respecting independent women. Aparna was so off-putting and arrogant. Pradyuman was also so arrogant, feeling like he deserved the best. All the arrogant ones wanted to marry up. Entitlement in the man and his family is so common, where the woman is expected to adjust more. I was fuming at Geeta's ""women need to adjust more"". Obviously given the largely traditional families' preferring arranged marriage, she wouldn't be able to get a good proposal for the independent constantly advice me to do the same. Then when the woman told Sima how Geeta hadn't been fully honest, Sima sent her to a life coach, for what? Just because she wasn't pleased that Geeta didn't tell her the guy was a divorce from the get-go? This is not something you hide. For most Indian families that is a deal-breaker and you have to be honest about it before the meeting is arranged else it wastes everybody's time. Sima completely wrote that off and sent her to a life coach as if it was her fault and because she isn't ""photogenic"" she wouldn't get a match. I have SO many issues with this show because it keeps the bad part of tradition alive, and the matchmaker's job depends on the patriarchal society, but it is truly representative of the culture. Truly representative. Which is the sad part. I would not recommend the arranged marriage process for anybody, the family pressure is awful and does not a marriage make, in fact too much involvement from the family breaks the marriage and causes a lot of pain for the son and his wife.Sima also doesn't take accountability for her matches. While it is her job to match them and let them deal with everything like adults, she should have done something about holding the guy accountable who stood up the girl twice. Instead when the girl told her about it, Sima kept putting pressure on her to call him and find out what happened and also kept saying ""give me good news"". What good news? The guy stood her up and embarrassed her in front of her friends, please don't ask her to give you good news, the guy doesn't care about her and she will never be happy. So Sima just wanted to have a number of matches or a % of success in matchmaking and took no accountability. She can be very dismissive. At least she is not like Patty in Millionaire Matchmaker!!",False
5,6,No endings,lauraeguy,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerThe season ended and we didn't see any one couple married. And some singles in the beginning were dropped off. Whatever happens to Nadia and Aparna?,True
6,7,Refreshing and enjoyable,melodyso,n/a,15/08/2025,I came into this with some bias against arranged marriage. But this show changed my perspective. Arranged dating and committing does sound refreshing and rare in this casual dating era. The people all seem quite reasonable (except that picky guy really irritated me). The stories are light hearted but watchable. Some stories are really sweet and fill you with hope. I do wish that there's more follow up with each character instead of just jumping from new person to new person.,False
7,4,"the Indian society & being slim, trim",valfrae,n/a,15/08/2025,"S1: Preeti Jakhete is the kind of mother-in-law you never want. Sexist and incapable of having compassion for her own gender. She wants her daughter-in-law to go through all the trauma and hardships she went through - cause rULeS & tRaDiTiOnS. Akshay Jakhete is the kind of husband you never want. He's a 25yr old man-baby, every aspect of his life is controlled by his mom. I wonder if his mom buys him his underwear as well. Prolly does, considering the fact that he's incapable of making a single decision for himself. He says ""If she's(Radhika) gonna work, who'll take care of the kids?"" Oh my god, this delusional, overprivileged, inconsiderate, sexist, diaper-wearing manbaby. ""My mom is literally what I want to be looking at in a wife"" - this made me nauseous. What is this Oedipus complex? His mom needs to cut the umbilical cord.I really liked Vyasar and Nadia. They seemed cool. Let's not even talk about Aparna and Pradhyuman, two of the most least-self-aware people on the show. Geeta can just go eff herself.S2: Do not like Nadia anymore. She deserved what happened to her. Karma, you know? Less masala this season. Was kinda bland. Pradhyuman & Aparna storyline was boring & unnecessary I feel like since it wasn't matchmaking for them anymore.Wish we saw more of Vyasar tho :(",False
8,9,When is Season 2,pianoplayr18,n/a,15/08/2025,"So entertaining. I have changed my mind about matchmaking. I laughed so many times watching this show, mainly because of the unrealistic expectations of what they're looking for in a spouse. I love Sima the matchmaker.",False
9,7,A mixed bag,rfadam,n/a,15/08/2025,"Disclaimer: I am not Indian. Found this show via an Instagram account I follow. Some of the characters I found very real, complex and charismatic. Other story lines I turned out. Overall, glad I watched this. It was entertaining, funny at times, poignant.",False
10,4,Decent show ruined by one person,mcoats-71101,n/a,15/08/2025,"An old auntie goes around trying to get couples to marry in India and further afield. I'd have liked to see the show stay in India as the people abroad that Sima (the matchmaker) tries to set up are so annoying.There's one called Aparna who is single purely because of her own mental health issues, I'm amazed they didn't edit her sections down as she's so insecure and full of self loathing that she tries to bring everyone else down to her level and even blames the matchmaker for her situation. It's uncomfortable viewing and the producers clearly use her footage to mock her (""I rarely leave Manhattan these days"" she says just a few weeks after moving to the city from Houston, or ""he thought we were on a date, ew"" about the only man stupid enough to want to spend time with her) - a truly awful person.Apart from that the show is quite entertaining but gets a bit samey after a while.",False
11,10,Reality,sounakg,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is quite real and is in fact a reality documentary show. Yet it is interesting, surprising and controversial and touches on the aspects of the Indian society that was so far untold.",False
12,6,Decently entertaining show. Could have been better,jkt2006,n/a,15/08/2025,I enjoyed the entertainment quotient of the show. Just that the last episode ended too abruptly after taking us through the lives of so many bachelors. If there is another season(that will be nice!) it will be great to bring in a different matchmaker than Sima to bring in a different flavour.,False
13,3,WOW,roodlemania,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThat was the most horrible ending of any show I have ever seen. They made us get invested in these individuals and their matches or lack thereof, and in the end just abandoned every storyline that we were ever following for anyone. No resolution, no cohesive ending. Dumb made no sense. Disappointed.",True
14,n/a,It's OK!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,Surely they realise Pradhyuman is gay! OMG everything about him screams gay. the lady lawyer is clearly not looking for a partner she needs a dog. She is completely intractable and despite being smart cannot see what her character flaws are. Admire her ambition but she will end up alone. Interesting concept for a westerner but this is not really match making anymore as people can do more or what they like.,False
15,6,It would be great to see these characters again next year,caroleeheynen,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is interesting to watch UNTIL you realize that there isn't going to be any resolution. We don't get to see (at least not yet) what happens to these people. Do any of them get married? It would be great to see at least one marriage, including the ceremony. Instead, the stories are engaging and the characters are likeable but it's like reading only the first couple chapters of several books.",True
16,6,Mixed feelings,media-15602,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had a lot of mixed feelings, but still managed to enjoy the show. It seems to me that the participants (or maybe the producers) go to extraordinary lengths to prove to the world just how Western India/Indians are, which I found a shame. I could also understand if a lot of viewers found this series a tad bit racist - most of the participants are white-looking, despite the fact that half of the Indian population is dark to very dark-brown in complexion. I also found the lifestyle being showcased decadent at times and hope this is NOT representative for most Indians.Another surprising take-away for me while watching this series is that a lot of the male participants are 100% without-a-doubt gay. Given Sima's vast experience as a match-maker and her various psychic and face/palm-reading experts, I was extremely surprised that no one figured out that the real reason so many of the male participants are still unmarried after hundreds of dates, is because they're not interested in buying what Sima's selling. The only reason they go on dates with women is to satisfy the expectations of their parents and society. Is this a thing in India? Maybe a promising spin-off for Netflix...",False
17,7,"Cringe-worthy, debatable, and hopeful",kcrew98,n/a,15/08/2025,"Set against the backdrop of ditching dating apps, finding a partner, and ultimately marriage, the Netflix docu-series, Indian Matchmaking, instantly draws the viewer into the lives of a matchmaker and her clients.Each episode is strongly multidimensional, contrasting several flawed elements and leaving the viewer with provoking thought. In the end, one is left rooting for a happy ending, however it arises.The path of marriage challenges itself: traditional vs. modern, East vs. West, parents vs. kids, career vs. yourself. Dating isn't easy, especially in a culture where arranged marriages have been the norm for centuries. If there is any critique, it's not that of arranged marriages, but of the unspoken biases, the pressure of marriage, and cringeworthy laundry list of preferences that constantly perpetuate. Outside of that critique, I think each viewer can draw something from it for their own personal growth. And that part of the story remains largely intact despite the branding or portrayal of ""villainous"" characters that serve to entertain and spark controversy. It's an element of any reality based show that I'm not always a fan of, but shouldn't prevent a viewer from enjoying the central themes. In fact, these elements strengthen the discussion; that not everything is quite ""black or white.""",False
18,3,Season 2 is not a reality show. Scripted and certainly does not reflect Indian Culture.,ashdxbash,n/a,15/08/2025,"Imagine watching a TV show where the script writers suddenly decide to add drama by reincarnating the dead, phone suddenly dies at a crucial time, an accident takes place just before an important event...now visualize Season 2 of Indian Matchmaking.They removed the 'Real' from reality.Why did they show focus on US Indians and called it Indian Matchmaking? Show focuses on snobs, spoilt Indian (wannabe English) rich kids of West India, people with self-developed personality disorders...the list is endless.",False
19,9,Haters missed the point - the journey,ritu-16553,n/a,15/08/2025,"Haters prove that we spend so much energy hating that we lose faith. We find wrongs and We lose sight of how can we let something be good and useful / beneficial to us.This show is about various people from very different backgrounds, most of whom, having tried other paths to a stable companionship or having waited some, are putting their faith in the Indian matchmaking process with openness to see what happens.Be aware that they don't show endings and the season finishes with a beginning rather than an ending - makes it very clear that the endings are not the point. The varied journeys, emotions, tough life, dealing processes - that's the point. If you want clear endings, don't watch.So here's my honest review :1. It's REALISTIC - in that it doesn't force the people in the show to mince words. Doesn't force characters to necessarily present themsleves in an absolute good light - not even the matchmaker herself... if you don't hate the show from get-go because of pre concieved notions, you'll find the matchmaker vulnerable and not-right at various points. But everyone is as realistic as a show like this could present. It also openly portrays what a majority of individuals wouldn't even admit (even to themselves) they do look for in life partners. That's the best part about the show.2. It shows various people's JOURNEYS and the journey IS the story. The point is NOT whether the matchmaker was good or not, what was right or wrong, wether the matches happened or not,... The point is each individual's story. Matchmaker's story included.
With so many varied characters, you are bound to associate with one or the other in the show or with different aspects in multiple characters. So with at least one of the stories, you may learn something about yourself too, no matter what stage you are in your life.
(And face it - regarding finding love/companionship/marriage there is no absolute right or wrong. Rights and wrongs are completely contextual concepts)3. The STORY TELLING STYLE of the director is off putting sometimes because of the incessant breaks in each story like tiny crumbs of each story spread thin for the viewer - hence the minus one star. But hey, it's just 8 episodes. By the way, a second season exploring even more diverse stories will be great too in my opinion !4. The show even cleverly crafts-in the EVOLUTION of Indian matchmaking too - by showing the old couples' short interviews. Shows very succinctly how the process has adapted to modern times while staying within the diverse traditional contexts of a country as unbelievably diverse as India. From marrying after just one-time 20 minute conversations to a long and tough 7 dates / 100 meetings process.5. The show keeps a POSITIVE undertone, which is important, especially because it is being seen by non indian people around the world too who have enough lopsided exposure to everything that's wrong/bad/dirty in this country. Ref : slumdog millionaire, world's strictest parents series, or just watch Karolina Goswami's videos on how much negative media the West consumes about India daily.All in all, i liked it very much. And I liked all the characters - all of them. Even learnt something from Preeti ji - even though a similar situation of misplaced expectations from my mother in law broke my own love marriage!I suppose this show is drawing a lot of flak and hate because too many people have those baggages the show mentions, those feelings of residual angst from past experiences which causes them to have many issues with the show.These are individual lives and this is a very realistic context, it is how matchmaking has happened, happens and will probably continue to evolve.My suggestion : relax and watch each story as separate from your own existing notions and not with angst from your own experiences, your past or your expectations from your own future.",False
20,7,What happened to the Texas Teacher? (Was it Texas???),thejdrage,n/a,15/08/2025,"First off - Proud First generation American here from Canada/Scotland, so not Indian. I watched this for the entertainment value.Some of the candidates were sadly fascinating in their solipsism. And then got VERY tired of the one candidate who took it to heights that made me want to gag. In fact, if she's in Season 3, I'll skip all her stupidness. Others just sad as they were caught up in the wake of parents (mother's) blaming them for their high blood pressure.I asked a Pakistani friend of mine what happens to gay Indians. Well. It just doesn't happen, does it?Interestingly, this group was as shallow as most westerners - thin, beautiful, rich. White. BAM! Marriage material.Seriously - what happened to the teacher? I really want to know.",False
21,4,Left me hanging; no closure,bkm-7,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMake me care about gentle Vyasar and the vet, then leave me hanging without finishing their story? Seriously? How did she take the news about his father? Did he get cut because he didn't disclose his dad's imprisonment to the matchmaker? If so, then why use his story to begin with? Season two saw some clients return to finish their story, why not Vyasar's? So disappointing!",True
22,8,The Reality of Indian Elite,indifferentlyinsouciant,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show is well done. It pulls the curtain off and shows India's elite for what they are.In fact, it is a very white washed show and the warts are all hidden. There is no talk of dowry, honour killings, inter-caste marital trouble and a lot else.In a way, Indian Matchmaking was needed to show Netflix woke peeps just how medieval our thinking is. All the affectations notwithstanding, marriage boils down to your partner being from a ""good family"" (Code for caste) or ""fair-skinned"" or ""not from a small town"" even if we serve ""Miso Paneer"" or have been to the ""Bolivian salt flats"". It might seem weird initially, but it's actually just so telling how so many millenials and NRIs, many who carry a chip on their shoulders, are the worst perpetrators of some of these crazy values.The fact that so many people cringed watching it only proves how real those people felt to us. How familiar the settings, the relations, the pandits were. And how real an aunty Sima Aunty was. The appeal lies in the fact that whether you laugh or scream it's difficult to deny that the whole thing has a wallop of truth to it.It shows you that those people are not a small segment of society. This is still Us in 2020.",False
23,7,Indian match breaking,jhansivasantha-01217,n/a,15/08/2025,"I liked it. And Sima is absolutely right in saying a particular girl (?) negative and over ambitious.

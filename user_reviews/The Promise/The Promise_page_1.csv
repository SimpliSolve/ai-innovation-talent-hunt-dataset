1,10,Men on a mission,JohnH-96,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very impressed with Jye and Craig and the work they are doing with this video.I seen this movie at Dungog cinema at a free community screening. The boys are travelling around Australia taking this movie to communities that need the most this is more than a movie. This is a movement, a mission as Jye said during the Q&A a call to action.Very impressed with the picture, the camera operator done an incredible job at making this very pretty, I don't feel as if I've seen another Australian documentary that looks so great. It really helped tell the story and kept me engaged.I feel as if this film should be played in every small country town across Australia as the farmers are doing it very tough and the suicide rates in Australia are way too high. I take my hat off to these men for doing what they have done and making a movie that will save many lives.Thank you!",False
2,9,"Bold, important, needed!",Jillian-292,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's documentaries like this that can actually make a difference. Yes, it's important to draw attention to social issues across the world but how often are solution presented with them?I love the messaging in this documentary and the call to action at the end. Very well executed and a very bold move in tackling such a complex issue.I would only recommend watching this film if you're ready to sit down and face the truth about the mental health crisis Australia is facing.",False
3,10,Must Watch! must needed film.,HenryW-37,n/a,16/08/2025,I really love that this film was made. Craig's story is great and moving but it's nothing without a film like this.I hope all Australians take the time to watch this and spread the message.I really felt connected to Joe Williams. His a great speaker and is a great sportsmen. To open up about what he went through could be a movie on its own but the really hero's in this film are the 4 people at the end who shared their stories about losing their loved one. Wow that must be hard to do. I can't whine how difficult it would be to make something like this.Well done to all involved and hats off to everyone who was brave enough to share their story.Must watch!,False
4,10,I needed this documentary!,Johnwendy-0,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tonight I attended The Promise screening at Orange. I travelled 40 minute to be there and I needed it. I'm a big movie fan but not much gets me out of the house. I live out in a property and very often feel isolated. I have just overcame my own battles and mental health challenges. I still feel very alone but after tonight I feel connected. I feel more connected to Australia knowning how many other people feel as I do and I feel more connected to my community here in Orange. Tonight has motivated me to push forward and be the best I can be.Thank you for making an honest movie and I encourage every Australian to take the time to watch this, especially the next generation!",False
5,9,Make The Promise!,SamS-119,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is more than a movie. I encourage everyone to watch this and make The Promise with a loved one.I feel nowadays a lot of movies and documentaries highlight issues but don't give an option moving forward. The message in The Promise is really clear and might not be the answer but it's something to move forward with.For a movie on such a heavy topic it was actually quite beautiful. The pictures were stunning, at times I laughed and forgot I was watching a documentary. The people featured in this movie add depth and ground the story in a complete kind of way. It's a complex issue but I feel this was done really well and told in a mature way.",False
6,10,Powerful and Heavy! A must-watch doco!,kitty-66324,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just watched The Promise on Stan and honestly, for a doco, I was blown away by the cinematography. Some of the shots were so beautiful, I thought I was watching a proper feature film. The music and visuals just pulled me in completely.The way they handled the topic of suicide was done so well. It's a tough thing to talk about, but the message came through really clear. When Craig went to the small town, I thought that was really cool, it showed how much he cares about sharing his story and connecting with people. Felt really genuine.The 4 personal stories at the end hit me hard. Those people are so brave for opening up like that. That's what this film is about, showing the truth of such a hard topic. I can't even imagine how hard this would've been to make for the crew. Huge respect to everyone involved, they did an amazing job.Also, gotta say, Justin was so good. He really stood out to me, I could watch him in anything!This is a must watch. Share it with your friends and check in with your loved ones, seriously! You never know who's struggling. The Promise is one of those films that really makes you think and feel.",False
7,10,Raw and Real. Such an important issue.,MattU-07,n/a,16/08/2025,"The way this film is structured, it delivers an often silenced topic with the weight and urgency it deserves. Tackling the struggles of mental health is not an easy task, but it is done in a powerful and unique way.Hearing the voice of public figures next to regular people shows just how indiscriminate poor mental health can be, combined with the wide reaching effects within family and friends impacted is so powerful.There is no sugar coating in this film. It hits the issues head on, in a respectful but sometimes confronting way, explained as absolutely necessary throughout the film. Well done to Jye and Craig. This is an important film, highly recommended.",False
8,9,BEST Australian Doc,FrankG-222,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a massive fan of documentaries, and love a good Aussie one. Unfortunately finding a good Aussie one is quite a challenge. It's not very often we see an original Australian documentary and this has absolutely just hit the mark.Yes, it is a suicide prevention Film. Yes, it is a very big topic but wow did the filmmakers. Do a great job. Hats of to the Director Jye Currie for taking on such a film. I think the story structure was really strong! The message in the end was very powerful and the music was next to none.DP done well in marking this feel like a proper international film (most Australian films feel Aussie).Justin was an incredible speaker, I could really listen to him all day, his outlook and way with his words was captivating. But the people who spoke about their lost ones were the real asset.",False
9,9,Australian Documentary,JamieL-43,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this documentary, I can honestly say without a doubt I would recommend this to anyone.It tackles mental illness and suicide ideations head on. It's not sugarcoated, it's honest. The filmmaking of this documentary is spectacular, it seamlessly goes from story to story and even at times genre to genre. I laughed, cried and most importantly grew a deeper understanding of this topic.I must say for a documentary that I just stumble across on Stan, I'm surprised I didn't hear it before. Some of the Australian profiles in this film are HUGE and yet I hadn't even heard about the documentary. Wayne Bennett, Jessica Rowe, Tim Tszyu and such an important topic, why aren't we hearing about this?Spread the word, recommend this to a friend, this is a must watch.",False
10,8,Exceptional documentary,Sandra-0167,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's very rarely that I'll watch a documentary. I stumbled across this after watching the director's first feature film. For a young man I find it quite fascinating how he's drawn to such complex social issues but I give it to him that he tackles him head on.This documentary is not a fun watch, but it is a very necessary watch. My heart goes out to anyone who has struggled with mental health and even more so now after watching this. I have a deeper understanding of mental health and suicidal tendencies, so yes I think this documentary has done its job.Very impressed with the quality of this documentary. The picture and sound is just phenomenal. I felt like I was watching a Hollywood film at times.",False
11,10,Film for change,JazP-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every Australian should watch this film. This is a film that will create change. We will look back at this movie in 20 years from now and talk about how it changed the dialogue in the mental health space in Australia.It is beautifully shot. The camera work in this feels like I'm watching an actual movie not a documentary. The music drives it and the story just continues to unfold.It's very very inspiring listening to people share their story in such a vulnerable way. I don't know how these people had the courage to speak in the way they did but because of this it will help many Australians. Real, raw, honest, and truthful.I can see this going into schools & and even a sequel being made.I haven't heard of the director Jye Currie before or seen any of his previous work, but I know he has a big career ahead of him.",False
12,9,Special Screening,DylanS-25,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the privilege of attending a Q&A night with Craig and Jye. It's been four days now and I haven't stopped thinking about this movie.There's really a lot to unpack here, there are a lot of layers and a lot of emotions, on the night of the screening I found a quite challenging to hear some of the stories in the documentary but I know how important stories like this are.I can see this film becoming the next ""rabbit proof fence"" which they teach in schools.If you are going through any mental health challenges I suggest watching this with a friend. If you have someone in your life you can decode this film with after that would be quite the experience.",False
13,9,"Australian Men, get behind this!",AlexW-53,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Promise is a straightforward and honest documentary. It follows Craig Hamilton's story and gives a real look into what it's like to live with mental illness. There's no drama added, just the truth.It's important because it talks about something a lot of people in Australia go through but don't speak about. The film shows how serious the mental health crisis is, especially for men, and why conversations like this need to happen.This film is important for men because it breaks the silence around something many struggle with but rarely talk about. In Australia, a lot of men grow up being told to toughen up, to stay quiet about their feelings. The Promise shows that opening up doesn't make you weak.Too many men think they have to deal with everything on their own. That showing emotion or asking for help means they've failed somehow. The Promise challanges that idea and I encourage every man to watch it. It ain't weak tk speak!!",False
14,10,A needed documentary.,SarahC-799,n/a,16/08/2025,"Australia needs this documentary. And honestly I needed it too. I have had my own battles with mental health and for a long time thought something was wrong with me. After watching this I finally feel heard. I have since made the promise with my best friend and it wasn't until now I found out they were struggling too. This is a real issue we have in the world and to the people who made this I thank you!To the people who shared their story in this movie, thank you! You are brave and have given me the courage to make a change in my life.Much love! Highly recommend this documentary, it's a hard watch (from the content) but beautiful.",False
15,9,Review for The Promise,Zfkands,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am genuinely inspired by Jye Currie's documentary The Promise. This is a profoundly important and beautifully crafted film that approaches the topic of suicide prevention with honesty, care, and deep humanity.What stands out most is Jye's ability to tell personal, raw stories while maintaining respect and sensitivity a balance that many filmmakers struggle to achieve. The film never feels heavy-handed or exploitative; instead, it offers space for reflection, understanding, and, most importantly, hope.The Promise carries a vital message that needs to be shared widely across Australia. In a time when mental health challenges touch so many lives, this documentary has the power not only to raise awareness but to genuinely save lives. It is the kind of work I would recommend not only to my students but to colleagues, community leaders, and policymakers alike.Currie has proven himself to be a filmmaker unafraid to take on urgent social issues and with The Promise, he has made something truly impactful.",False
16,9,Calling this Australia's Best Documentary,KezDov,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yep, I'm calling this Australia's best documentary and for a number of reasons.Firstly, the importance of documenting the mental health landscape in Australia at this time in history is truly important and for such a large, complex topic taking on a story like this is extremely bold. The Promise couldn't have tackled this topic any better and I think it's in the way it's been created.For such a heavy topic I can't believe there were times I actually laughed. The pacing and balance of lighthearted moments to the serious and heart moving bits was perfect. I felt like I was taken on a journey and was guided with love the entire time.The work that Craig Hamilton has done is trailblazing. He has paved the way for many Australians and now telling his story on screen really speaks to his dedication and loyalty for rewriting the narrative around the Australian health crisisI'm so happy this documentary was made.",False

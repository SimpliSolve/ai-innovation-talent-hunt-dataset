1,10,Follow The Science & The $,samanthajeansteven,n/a,17/08/2025,"If you follow the actual science, you'll find:PCR process is not a diagnostic test for viruses. It magnifies genetic material. That's why Coca Cola and papayas and bananas can be Covid Positive. Who said it's not a diagnostic test? The INVENTOR of the test himself, Kary Mullis.Graphene oxide in the vaccines has nothing to do with virus immunization. Learn what it is.Everyone is following orders because of financial incentives and fear of ostracization or loss of job/reputation/medical license.Stop following regurgitators and listen to BANNED voices who risked everything to speak TRUTH and INTEGRITY.",False
2,10,An introduction To What Is Actually Happening,gcvwhnzz,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's a good introduction into what is actually happening in the world. As what is being shown is proven time and time again with absolute accuracy. But bought and paid ""experts"" try to deny all of these facts, as expected. The other documentary Monopoly goes more into detail about this. Also a highly recommended watch.As expected you will see negative reviews under different user names with the same copy and paste text. Which should make any critical thinker wonder why someone would put so much effort into trying to convince people who are curious about the documentary not to watch it.I will let you think of why for yourself.Highly recommended.",False
3,1,Debunked Conspiracies,lorenzo-ita,n/a,17/08/2025,"The Big Reset is a Kickstarter project started by publicist Jorge Roca Victorero under the name W.Most of the theories of the documentary have been debunked again and again by the scientific community and reputable journalists.The whole underlying theory is the prototype of conspiracy thinking: They (who?) against us, mind control, anti-vaxx rethorics, all while using a bunch of experts the live at the sides of the scientific community and cite each others to give the impression there is some consensus about what they say: but it's all an illusion.Roca, as an expert publicit, make it feel and look as something important is happening, but the truth he is skilled in audiovisual communicatinos, but not in information literacy, and that's a dangerous combination.",False
4,n/a,Using Belarus as a Covid example (self-explanatory),n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"The credits are misleading for one.The arguments and reasoning are there but it is not convincing as the time passes.The authoritarian countries are so keen to promote information propelling doubt quickly, they sometimes forgot to hide their own ego in my opinion.---

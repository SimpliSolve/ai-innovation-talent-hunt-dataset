1,8,I was entertained and satisfied,peterson-magnus,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this last night and I loved it! At first it seemed like a made up story and some very funny dudes making a ""mockumentary"". However, it quickly becomes clear that this is a true story and the boys are just doing true crime their own way. This was actually a very fresh breath in the genre. As for endings and conclusions, I'm not left wanting anything, maybe GPR in the lake, if that's possible? All in all, we'll worth the watch and my hat to the boys, very well done!",True
2,9,Quirky and Fun Who Dunnit,Curt_Brenner,n/a,16/08/2025,"This takes the form of a true crime but with an honest and human view. You may expect a comedic take on a mystery but it comes across as neither serious nor laugh out loud funny. The two amateur detectives are lovable in a self deprecating way and the story is intriguing way. It's not American Vandal because For Heaven's Sake is true, but it's not Making A Murderer because these guys have no idea what they are getting themselves into. It's fun and worth the time.",False
3,n/a,Waste of Time,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe amateur investigators are awkward to watch at times. And you get to the end...
They don't find anything. It's a waste of time to watch.",True
4,9,This was such a good little series!,Ksemperfi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't know what to expect, seeing this series described as a documentary, true crime, AND comedy. I am so glad I watched it! It was original, personal, and the Canadian family, as well as the town members were so cute! I envy being part of such a big, kind hearted family! The boys did a good job, although I do wish they hadn't given up. I wish they had asked the old man (the one they plied heavily with water ðŸ¤£) who was a little boy who the person was that visited his father that day, the one Harold ran from. I also cringed when they buried the wooden box with all the documents inside the bump without any weather protection! That old wooden box in Canada won't last long, nor the documents, without a water proof barrier. I think they did a good job of trying to provide closure, even though I wished they would have continued. I loved their innocent and honest humor and the compassion they showed. I would love to see other things these guys create in the future. Maybe try solving someone else's cold cases? I wish them success in their future endeavors.",True
5,10,So awesome,hazelsthumb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was such a beautiful documentary about Harold. During this series we the people learned so much about Harold. The people in the town, the town, the members or Harold's then family and now. I knew they weren't going to solve this case or find his remains.But they did such an amazing job trying to solve this case and bring Harold home. My heart goes out to this family who have been without Harold for the better half of 90 yrs. With all the stories it really is hard to say what happened to Harold. Maybe one day of they dredge a lake or something. I wish there were more mystery docs like this one. I have only witnessed a couple. The boys did an amazing job. Thanks for sharing your story with us. I love to hear about these silent cases. The stuff that isn't big in the news and easily forgotten. I won't forget this story!!",False
6,5,"Feels like a ""mockumentary"" that builds to nothing",imdb-04964,n/a,16/08/2025,"Compelling, until it wasn't. The film has a Christopher Guest vibe without the humor. Exceptionally disappointing ending.",False
7,4,Not Horrible But Nowhere Near Great,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey're trying so desperately to be hilarious, but missing the mark so often- with a case this cold and so many people who rely on familial bonds to live, no one is ever going to give up anything worthwhile.In small towns, no matter the location, everything is closed off, and no one gives up a thing. This is nothing different.You get two somewhat funny guys, trying to be detectives, comedians, and.not doing a decent job at either, with a storyline that goes absolutely nowhere resembling a conclusion.",True
8,2,I hope there is a pay off.,starjosie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am about 3/4 through this series Season 1. The fact that it has a numbered Season is giving me pause, because I am not a fan of the Oak Island never ending genre - it is fun but dissatisfying. So far in For Heaven's Sake I like the mystery, the camera work, the editing. The family and other participants are interesting. Interview skills are giving me some pain. And I am finding myself muting the juvenile documentarians as the ""Bruh, it's gotta be a body under there"" is quite wearisome, and I'm not loving the somewhat disrespectful, smug Us vs. Them mentality toward what seem to be very accommodating witnesses. Their rambling musings are ridiculous and border on slanderous at times. Their dismissal of the theory that had by far the biggest probability was disheartening. I get that they are young, inexperienced, fairly harmless and excited, but to each their own. I don't find it appealing. So I guess in general, so far so good mystery-wise, but I am skeptical due to their complete lack of skill and reasoning.",False
9,3,JUST ANOTHER.......,jreeders518,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerGiraldo's safe!!!! Like it was just done to create a financial opportunity for two guys. Waste of time.,True
10,5,Great until it wasn't,rhansen-01078,n/a,16/08/2025,Would have ranked much higher but I wanted a better conclusion.,False
11,1,not funny,yangwynden,n/a,16/08/2025,"The humor didn't land at all, the two leads suck honestly. The main mystery isn't compelling, I'm glad I didn't watch this all the way through.The documentary angle of it felt forced and super staged.",False

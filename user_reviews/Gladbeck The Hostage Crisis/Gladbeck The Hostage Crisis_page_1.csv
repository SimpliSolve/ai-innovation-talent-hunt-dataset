1,8,Horrendous realism,svssw,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is without a doubt one of the most painfully disturbing documentaries I've ever seen and believe me when I say I've watched a lot over the years.The filmmakers have done a stellar job of pulling all the key events together, and making a 1hr 30min movie from what must of been over 50+ hours of footage.If you've ever had an axe to grind with how morally bankrupt the news media is and how inept the police can be this drama is only going to solidify your position further.I came away from this film in pain for the innocent people involved and pretty wrung out from the intensity of the situation. It has stayed with me and I've thought on it long and hard. One can only imagine how the key news men and women and police must have felt afterwards. I'm surprised if they could ever look themselves in the mirror again without feeling pangs of guilt.The poor victims of such pointless rage makes the heart bleed. My only gripe is that you don't feel anyone was really taken to task over their poor handling of a very traumatic situation. I think I'll need to do some extra reading to find out what happened to key figures after the dust settled.This is well worth a watch but beware of the gruelling intensity and the days of analysing you'll undoubtedly feel after viewing!!",False
2,8,Unreal!,mf2812,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly, the police in this situation were terrible! This should be shown to every police force in the world on how not to manage a hostage situation. Unbelievable!",False
3,8,Sad doc about incompetence,petercarlsson-92297,n/a,16/08/2025,"The doc show a terrible hostage situation, with media out for blood and just terrible police incompetence.What's even more sad is that it's not better today. Just look at the police in Uvalde, Texas, that stood in the corridor waiting for an hour while kids were slaughtered.",False
4,8,Intense and disturbing,TiCor78,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a very compelling and intense watch!Mainly because this documentary was made with only authentic news fragments, press footage and police communication without any narration.The disgusting behavior of the press and the public and the amateurish way the police handled this situation made my blood boil.Those interactions with the hostage takers and hostages were so bizarre to see...
You learn to know the hostages, feel for them and hope for a good outcome. Even though you know it won't end well for everyone involved.It all felt a bit too real (?)... :s Very disturbing!This one will stick with me for a while...
definitely worth watching!",False
5,9,Gladbeck Syndrome,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Actually I wouldn't say there was a syndrome. It was just the first thing that came to my mind (it does sound catchy and yes the pun with Stockholm is obviously intended). It did have repercussions though. The way it was handled and what was allowed to be done since then.Because it was quite crazy. Now there were no cell phones back then, when this happened, but rich people had car phones. But let's not get too ahead - I just said this to give you an insight what time it was and what was possible technically speaking.This documentary tells you right from the start that it is edited from the raw material that was shot back then. Mostly video footage but also some photographs too. So you will also get original audio from back then - no commentary or anything to explain or give you an opinion on what is happening.Of course you can argue the way it is edited is already a commentary itself. Still the happenings speak for themselves. And they tell a bizarre story to say the least. The way the police and the press handled the whole hostage/kidnap situation was ... bad to say the least. Add to that a lot of individuals who were just there to gawk ... to get excited about a horrible situation. It is by the way beyond parody to hear some of those gawkers speak to reporters (who are mostly not better as I already said): they seem unable to see the ignorance when they say no one should be there. One even admits he shouldn't be there either ... gawking and just adding pressure to a situation that was ready to explode any moment anyway. But of course he was still there ... and stayed there.There seems to be limited series about this too. I may watch this if I get the chance too. But for now, this was more than enough madness - there is only so much a human can take - no pun intended.",False
6,7,Parasitic media,benntune,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a bizarre and enthralling watch. I recommend it. But what it confirmed to me is how the media are parasitic scum and only getting worse. Yes it is their job to report on something like this, but not get involved in it and not place themselves right in the middle of it hindering any attempt the police would have of controlling the situation. Disgraceful, and we've seemed to have learnt very little as the media are still doing this crap to this day. Becoming the story not just reporting on it. Journalism is dead. Has been for a while now.",False
7,8,Unbelivable,yannik_kng,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is just unbelivable. We are watching footage of a press without morals and decency, only the pictures and they speak for themselves. The bad police work, what the victims must have felt... just an unbelivable event.",False
8,7,brings back (bad) memories,Radu_A,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to school in Bremen before departing for the United States later that year; this happened shortly after summer break. The Italian boy who was shot at the service area was a year younger and from a different district, but many people in my class were badly shaken. Some pupils came up with the idea of a vigil, a novelty at the time, and only then the school realized they had to discuss what happened. We asked the teachers why the police apprehended the criminal's girlfriend without thinking how they might react, and of course they had no answer.Of course, the media's behavior was the most shocking aspect. Peter Meyer, the AP photographer who asked Rösner for an interview and offered the hostage takers to use his phone, is shown here criticizing the police for not addressing the criminals' demands. Udo Röbel, who guided the criminals out of Cologne later became chief editor of Bild, Germany's largest daily. And Frank Plasberg (not shown), who conducted an interview which was not aired, became one of Germany's main talk show hosts.Given that dozens of journalists surrounded the criminals in Bremen and Cologne, they had many opportunities to overwhelm or disarm them, but chose to click away instead. And to be fair to the police, what could they do in a situation when the journalists were acting like a human shield? There was an ethics inquest, as a result of which interviews in a live hostage situation were forbidden, but no one expressed remorse at the time. Bremen's Senator of the Interior (responsible for the police) resigned, that was it. In the film, one journalist asks Degowski (who had not slept for three days) to press his gun against Silke Bischoff's neck, the striking 18yo who died during the botched rescue attempt. There were no criminal charges, and the resulting photo is still being used.So yes, this is painful to watch and a testament to the degradation of news media, which was only beginning. However, the lack of commentary comes across as cheap. Why did they not ask the journalists for comment given how well-known they became through this event?",False
9,9,The frightened eyes of beauty an innocence you will never forget,marco_belletti,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shocking and devastating. I 'm still cannot believe this really happened. In a masterclass editing of one hour and half from 50 hour of real footage you will follow the compelling events of this tragedy and farse. It is so emotional involving that sometimes you want to scream with pain this is impossible and unacceptable. The frightened eyes of Silke Bischoff reflecting the beauty and innocence of youth and good brutalized and at the mercy of the evilness of the criminals and of the cinism and opportunism of mass media,politics and police are impossible to forget and will remain with you.",False
10,7,This movie is a new type of documentary making,Erik_Surewaard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never would have expected that a movie / documentary created by only using news snip-its, could be so good.It is the first time that I see this type of documentary, and the story just captures you. I never before heard of the events so I was really at the edge of my seat, watching how the situation would develop.",False
11,9,Vile,rghathway,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe disgusting habits of the press and the lack of any plan by the police (perhaps it's a trick by the editors) to rescue the hostages early on are in full view. The fact that one of the bad guys was able to walk around freely and give interviews is appalling. The end result is that 2 teenagers were killed by the gunmen while they got off with relatively light punishment.,True
12,7,"Chaotic. Intense. Gripping. Also, upsetting! [+70%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many questions regarding judicial failure, media exploitation, and hostage-trading arise when you watch this true-crime documentary unfold. It's only 90 minutes long but what keeps it going is how the hostage-takers forge an unlikely connection with journalists covering the story - the latter going as far as being unsanctioned mediators. The 54-hour-long hostage situation is tense, and the interviews given by the perpetrators while they're committing the crime make your jaw drop. All three deaths could have been averted, if the right set of people had made timely decisions. The events are thoroughly gripping, even when they border on distressing.",False
13,5,You will hate yourself,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once you turn this on, you will not be able to turn it off, no matter how morbidly voyeuristic and disturbing. You will be disgusted with the media and yourself.You've been warned.One can't help but wonder if the media involvement only made this situation worse.",False
14,9,i remember this,SpaceCowboy89,n/a,16/08/2025,"When i was a little kid living in Germany this event took place i didnt understand it all back in the day, crazy to come back after the years and see it as a adult , its all real Footage and its straight forward , r.i.p to the innocent people who lost thier lives on that day. But maybe something Positive at the end , so much changed since then in term of Police/Special units what is a good thing,this Documentary shows.a early failure in german Police work in how not to deal with gangsters type of guys, Tragic but from there they learn , this Documentary was very good, but no happy ending and a tragic event.",False
15,8,Chilling German hostage crisis documentary,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Gladbeck: The Hostage Crisis"" (2022 release from Germany; 91 min) opens, it is August 15, 1988"" and we are in Gladbeck, Germany. Two deranged criminals have just robbed a small branch of Deutsche Bank, and decide to take the 2 bank employees as hostages. They demand 300,000 Deutsche Mark and a BMW as getaway car. It marks the beginning of a couple of shocking days...Couple of comments: this is directed by veteran and well-respected German documentarian Volker Heise. As the film notes at the very beginning, the entire movie consists of actual footage and audio from 1988. No talking heads looking back and commenting. This is all happening in real life. And some of it is absolutely surreal. How 2 kidnappers were to in effect hold an entire country hostage, with plenty of help from the media's actions AND the police's inaction it must be said. As we watch these events unfold, I, and I suspect many other viewers, had absolutely no idea how it would all unfold, and that makes this such a compelling documentary. Afterwards both the media and the police were heavily criticized for their roles in the hostage drama.""Gladbeck: The Hostage Crisis"" premiered on Netflix two weeks ago, and I just caught up on it. If you have any interest in true crime documentaries, or in a late 80s time capsule of what West Germany was like at that time (one year before the reunification), I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
16,6,Wtf,juan_moran,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe most useless police I've ever seen, they could easily be stopped, a joke, chatting without a gun in hand, those in charge deserve the death penalty.",True
17,9,Affecting,chopperDavo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is not happy viewing.But it is very compelling viewing. And very, very real.Once I started watching, I couldn't stop.Very well put together. I really liked the lack of a narrator, or commentator. You're left to make your own conclusions about all of what transpired.I couldn't believe the way ordinary people gathered around a couple of guys with guns. Loaded guns, with no safety on. What morons. And no one stepped in to save the beautiful young woman who was forced to go through so much. They just stood there and chatted with some monster as he held a gun to her throat.People can be so good, but they can also act terribly, especially in mob-like situations. Everyone else is chatting with this guy who is saying he's going to kill people, so I can too!I'm glad these sorts of situations are handled so much better now. They wouldn't have been let out of the bank. At the very worst the 2 hostages there could have been killed. But by providing them with a car and whatnot, it actually led to more deaths.",True
18,7,Because we watched crime shows on tv.,debejere,n/a,16/08/2025,They did this because they saw a crime show on tv and wanted to do it. Bizarre. If our demands are not meet. Bang Bang. Here again in this show it wasn't the guns it was the mental health of the hostage takers and watching crimes shows on tv. Mimicking the shows. This show is beyond comprehension. And in 1988.,False
19,9,The tragedy of human nature / a paradox...,raw808,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was a kid in germany when this happened and I heard about it back then. Just now as an adult I grasp the whole tragedy of it all and the consequences it had fpr the media.First I was shocked by the media and the voyeurism of bystanders. Then I realized I'm just as voyeuristic watching this... a paradox...
Unfortunately and in this case tragically curiosity is human nature.I am glad though that this led to media laws being tightened here in germany.Then I was baffled by the authorities. Early on the criminals tell that they have nothing to loose and don't care about their lives. Also they didn't wear masks which is an indicator that they didn't plan to get out alive.So I thought they could have ended it earlier by engaging and probably killing the criminals in the process.But then there is this small scene later in cologne where an old man says that the criminals need to be put into the ground. A cop answers that we have laws and even the authorities need to obey the law.And yes, in germany a cop isn't allowed to just kill criminals.So many people here think that the police was incompetent, but that's just one side of the story.. they need to act within our own laws which sometimes means to not do what one might want to do at first.Don't get me wrong, the authorities didn't do a very good job here.. but this was a very unique situation.At least in germany it is quite unique, we don't have too many hostage situations or other gun driven crimes here, partly because the gun laws are very tight.So I get why in such extreme situations some cops might be overwhelmed, they are humans after all.In the end I cried for the people who were emotionally hurt for the rest of their lives and especially the 2 young victims and their families.",True
20,6,"Interesting, but painfully slow",johnbaggs,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this documentary interesting and infuriating, but it was painfully slow.Media narcissism and police incompetence was amok. Crazy how reporters were allowed to interview these criminals while they were committing the crime. Sadly our media has become worse. Hopefully this story will serve as a warning, but unfortunately, people are more stupid than before.",False
21,9,Shocking and gripping whilst also very real,livin_the_weekend,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary that is uniquely shown to us by real life camera footage recorded at the time of the incident, in August 1988.Being over 30 years ago, the majority of people watching this will find it extremely hard to relate as to how something like this was allowed to happen. If it was these days things would've gone very differently, but at the time (more so specifically this incident), the Police and SWAT didn't really seem to have much of a clue.Shocking and well put together, definitely worth the watch!",False
22,5,Despicable media! Horrible police! Unjust judicial system!,koking1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA well done documentary but very disturbing, I would give it more stars but it just feels wrong. The media then and now are just out for blood. They just want a story they don't care about right or wrong. You will definitely feel angry with the way the police handled this entire situation. A documentary hasn't made me so sad and angry in a very long time.",True
23,9,Incompetence,mennaawad,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary itself is put together really well and does a good job of telling the story.The cops, though? And the media? Incompetent. Clumsy. Inept. So mind-numbingly inadequate. Cops don't care about their jobs at all, and reporters care too much for the wrong reasons. It was a circus, and everybody had their fun except the hostages and the criminals.I'm horrified.",False
24,9,A failure for humanity,vntwvn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was left appalled by the end of this doc. This is the most bizarre and jarring film I have ever watched. All along there were many points at which this ""crisis"" could have been resolved. My jaw was on the floor when one of the perpetrators held an interview. The whole thing felt like a circus. At no point were we shown the media or even the public attempt to dissuade the hostage takers. It was painful to watch as a man, when grown adults (men) were more concerned by taking pictures while a young girl was being held at gun point. At the end the police end up protecting the suspects and innocent lives end up being lost. The media were certainly accomplices in this crime and I wonder if anyone else was charged. The lack of agency showed by the public (police, media and citizens) in general has stuck with me and remains poignant reminder of how cruel we can be.",True
25,9,Great documentary,sedlacek-74566,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn unique documentary without any comments made entirely from original news reports and original footage. It portrays the grim incompetence of the German police and its special forces (not unsimilar to the failed rescue attempt at 1972 Munich Olympics), following the long journey of the kidnappers and their hostages and at the end even showing helicopter shots of the outcome and arrogance of the district attorney. Few lines of text before the end credits reveal the information of development, the destiny of the criminals, their hostages and the outcome for German journalism, which was ultimately blamed for the situation instead of the incompetence of the police. Great documentary.",True

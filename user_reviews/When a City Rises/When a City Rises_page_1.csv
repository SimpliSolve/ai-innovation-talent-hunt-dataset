1,10,I feel like I have made some new friends,WhyBadMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a movie explaining what happened in 2019 of Hong Kong, nor a debate of pro-china vs pro-democracy.Through the characters, I have a glimpse of how local people's lives are like during the long-lasting protest in the most wealthy and safest city in the world.Some people are mature and brave; some people are naive and restrained; some people are thoughtful but lack of action. They are all dreamers, too idealistic with no clue if what they are doing actually works. But that's how all revolutions are like, eggs hitting the high wall, one day the Berlin Wall would fall.",False

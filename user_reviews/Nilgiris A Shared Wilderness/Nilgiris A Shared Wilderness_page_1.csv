1,10,Nilgiris : A Shared Wilderness - Delivers its Promise,Aditya_Shankar,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I watched this film's trailer, I was confident that the film had some beautiful camera shots and an ambient soothing soundtrack. But after watching, I came to truly appreciate it.Nilgiris doesn't try to be something it isn't, and delivers exactly what it promised : A memorable theatrical experience of a documentary film with a lesson for humanity.Through the film I came to know about different animals that exist in that region, that the narrator claims many people didn't know they exist!In this era of reels and binge scrolling, some audience may find it ""slow"", but I honestly found it comfortably paced. It strikes that perfect balance between short runtime and doing justice to a detailed content.The visuals are a charm and the narrator's soothing voice is good for the theme of this film, and a theatrical experience is actually worth it when compared to TV screen due to surround sound experience making it feel like we were in the jungles and hills of Nilgiris as the scenes unfold.All in all, it's complete and an enriching film. I hope this film gets the audience it deserves, because it's not just a film or a story, but reflection of what's happening around us.",False
2,10,A Journey Through The Wild - A Captivating Wildlife Documentary.,PurnaG-31,n/a,16/08/2025,"The wildlife documentary offers an awe-inspiring window into the hidden corners of the natural world, blending breathtaking cinematography with compelling storytelling. From the dense rainforests and expansive savannahs to the icy poles and deep oceans, each scene captures the raw beauty and complexity of nature in stunning detail.What truly elevates this documentary is its ability to balance visual grandeur with emotional depth. The intimate portrayal of animal behavior-be it the tender care of a mother leopard or the fierce survival instincts of a animals reminds us of the interconnectedness of all life.The narration, both informative and poetic, enhances the viewing experience without overshadowing the visuals. Coupled with a powerful musical score, it evokes a profound sense of wonder and urgency, especially when addressing the impacts of climate change and habitat loss.Overall, this wildlife documentary is not just a visual feast-it is a call to action. It educates, inspires, and encourages us to become stewards of the planet. A must-watch for nature lovers, students, and anyone who seeks to reconnect with the wild.",False
3,10,Brilliant film!!,RadhakrishnaU-7,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAmazing!! Loved and didn't know the time when the interval happened. I especially enjoyed the last part where monsoon comes. The life-cycle of _Rhacophorus malabaricus_, the underwater shots of the dragonfly larvae and the hunting, the night shots of the sky inside the treehole, and the story of the Dhol and hornbills were a delight. Enjoyed listening to the frog calls, star-eyed frog, especially the Malabar gliding frog, which is one of my favourites. The tadpole dropping into the water and the ventral side shot of the tadpoles was a pleasure for the eyeüòçNicely shot, and narration was really good and kept the attention throughout the film. üôåüèº",True
4,8,A deeply impactful wildlife documentary that deserves to be seen on the big screen,Vijay_Herle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since childhood, I was fascinated by wildlife and dreamt of pursuing a career in that field. However, I wasn't able to realise those dreams - I was nudged (read: forced) into the dreaded Engineering path. While life took me elsewhere professionally, my love for wildlife has never faded. It is this passion that made watching Nilgiris: A Shared Wilderness such a moving and meaningful experience for me.Not very often does a wildlife documentary get a theatrical release in India. This one did and I watched it on the big screen - and what a treat it was! Even better, I got to meet the man behind it all - Sandesh Kadur himself, whom I remember for his conservation efforts on Clouded Leopards on NatGeo from my childhood!Nilgiris: A Shared Wilderness is a visually stunning celebration of one of India's most biodiverse ecosystems. The cinematography is nothing short of breathtaking - the 'blue-hued' Nilgiri mountains have never looked more majestic on film. The film shows mist-covered sholas, roaring waterfalls, sweeping grasslands, and endless mountains. It is a thoughtful narrative on coexistence - between humans and wildlife, conservation and development. This is the kind of film made for a theatrical experience, and I truly hope more wildlife documentaries get similar big-screen love.We get to witness some classic heavy-hitters like Tigers, Leopards, Elephants, Gaur - but what sets this film apart is its beautiful focus on lesser-known and endemic species. Seeing the elusive Nilgiri Marten, Nilgiri Tahr, Horsfield's lizard, Nilgiri Langurs, and a Dhole family was an absolute highlight. The melanistic leopard (especially the cubs) and the soaring Great Hornbills were stunning. This film gave me legit goosebumps so many times.The narration does a great job guiding us through the seasonal shifts of the Nilgiris and how life adapts to those changes. I was especially fascinated by some of the insights (like how most wild herbivores don't actually eat tea leaves! - who knew?!). The film also powerfully explores how wildlife and people are constantly learning to share this landscape - a recurring and timely message about coexistence and conservation.I loved the bit on the symbiotic relationship between fig trees and wasps. The film asks the question: If two creatures of such mammoth differences can coexist and prosper, why can't humans do the same with all the creatures that share this amazing wilderness?Editing-wise, the montages of the 'shared wilderness' of Ooty were a standout. Pacing did falter a bit in the middle, and the forced theatre intermission (in a 75-minute film??) killed the immersion briefly (not the film's fault). One letdown for me - no footage of the elusive Horseshoe Pitviper, which I was most excited to see based on some social media posts by the filmmakers. A missed opportunity, especially given the Nilgiris' rich snake diversity. Though I'm just nitpicking here.This is a deeply impactful documentary that deserves to be seen on the big screen and discussed. A must-watch for wildlife lovers. Films like this are the need of the hour - powerful, immersive stories that reconnect us with nature and remind us of our responsibility toward it. We need more such films raising environmental awareness to get the spotlight they deserve.This was the first time I was actually glad to see parents with kids in a theatre. That's some good parenting!",False
5,10,A must watch natural history!,MadhukarB-35,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must watch for everyone, not only children, even the grown ups. The painstakingly made nature documentary is a great tribute to the mother nature.The director Sandesh Kadur and his team unravel the mysteries of various flora and fauna of the Nilgiri Biosphere trying to explain why it is important to protect these forests, that houses some of the endemic species in the world, with many more yet to be discovered!An intellectual piece of work laced with some scenes that bring smile and laughter from the audience, making everyone relate and get closer to nature.I would say if we can watch movies like this more than once, it would encourage many more talented teams to produce nature documentaries and reach out millions of people, bringing awareness about our environment. Movies like this are the need of the hour, especially during the current times of fast paced internet world of rat race!",False
6,10,Ome of the best wildlife documentary ever,ikermessi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every shot, every second of this masterpiece was so special. Not only it had connected people to the flora and fauna of Nilgiris but it will have many positive impacts on tourism, conservation and local economy. There was so much to learn from this documentary as a photographer and conservationist.Special thanks to the makers and production team.Saurabh, Ranthambhore.",False
7,10,A must watch,RajeshwariR-83,n/a,16/08/2025,"My 8 year old son enjoyed it a lotüòä He was excited to identify the birds he knew. The life of great Indian Hornbill was beautifully captured. Seeing just the eye of the peacock in such a big screen was an awesome moment. It was a magical experience seeing the wonderful plants, insects, animals and birds. Very informative, entertaining and a visually stunning movie. Thanks a lot Sandesh Sir.",False
8,10,In admiration of shared wilderness!,Incertius_001,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic documentary by Sandesh! This was my second viewing of the film. Each time I settle down to watch a wildlife documentary (and I do so without any grand expectation), I walk away with something new, and this time was no different. The sleek, elusive, and wholly unfamiliar (to me) Niligiri Marten, and the Horsfield's lizard, were creatures I had never heard of before. It's incredible what the forest hides, just beyond the reach of our roads. What I also deeply admire is the craftsmanship in making the film - writing, filming, narration, background score, etc. Was top notch. I hope this goes international very soon. Highly recommend it watching on the big screen.",False
9,10,Why Nilgiris Worked - A Rare Success for a Documentary Feature Film,prayaghs,n/a,16/08/2025,"I booked the tickets again to watch it from beginningWhy Nilgiris Worked - A Rare Success for a Documentary Feature FilmIn a world dominated by commercial cinema, where action, romance, and spectacle often steal the limelight, a quiet, soul-stirring documentary like Nilgiris managing to stay in theatres - and win hearts - is nothing short of remarkable. So what made it click? Here's a deep dive into why Nilgiris worked:1. Authenticity Over GimmicksAt the heart of Nilgiris is an honest, heartfelt effort. There's no manufactured drama, no over-glamourised narration - just real people, real forests, and real challenges. Audiences today, especially the younger generation, crave authentic storytelling. Nilgiris offered them exactly that - truth over technique.2. Emotional & Visual ConnectThe film captured the breathtaking beauty of the Nilgiri Biosphere while simultaneously exposing the fragile threads that hold its ecosystem together. It struck a balance between visual poetry and emotional depth, moving viewers to tears and reflection. People came out of the theatres not just entertained, but transformed.3. Word of Mouth PowerDespite minimal mainstream marketing, Nilgiris thrived due to strong word of mouth. Audiences who watched it - especially conservationists, students, nature lovers, and families - wholeheartedly recommended it to others. Reviews poured in not from PR firms, but from people's hearts. Social media, WhatsApp forwards, and community screenings gave it wings.4. A Growing Concern for the PlanetIn a time of climate anxiety and ecological crises, people are increasingly waking up to the need for conservation. Nilgiris tapped into this collective consciousness - without preaching. It reminded audiences what's at stake, especially in India's precious biodiversity zones. The message felt urgent, but hopeful.5. Grassroots & Community SupportThe film wasn't just about the Nilgiris - it was of the Nilgiris. Local voices, tribal narratives, forest guards, and researchers were integral to its storytelling. This gave the film a grounded, lived-in feel, and the community around the Nilgiris rallied behind it. It became a movement, not just a movie.6. Backed by Passion, Not ProfitAudiences sensed that Nilgiris was made not for box office glory, but for a larger cause. The humility and passion of the team - visible in every Q&A session, every social media post, and every personal thank-you message - made viewers feel emotionally invested. People supported it like it was their own.7. The Right TimingAt a time when OTT platforms and theatres are crowded with synthetic content, Nilgiris came as a breath of fresh air. A cinematic detox, if you will. Its calm pace, soothing visuals, and strong message stood out as refreshing and necessary.Conclusion:Nilgiris is proof that if the intent is pure, the impact is powerful. It succeeded not through celebrity endorsements or viral gimmicks, but through a collective emotional response. It showed us that Indian audiences are ready - and eager - for cinema that cares.Let's hope its journey inspires many more stories from our forests, rivers, and skies. Because sometimes, the most powerful revolutions begin in silence - like the mist rolling down the Nilgiris.",False
10,n/a,One Time Watch for the Effort,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me start from the beginning, the movie or documentary, don't know what to call it doesn't live upto the expectations post the intro.

11,6,no story or message,kapil2984,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though the crew probably got exclusive permission from TN forest department, the black panther footage was very basic(taken from far, effect of mirage is obvious) when it comes to the adult male, only head was visible and nothing like the poster used for advertisement.The background score doesn't have an impact.Repeated use of same sentences by narrator and lack of story is frustrating.Could have shown far better clips of karadi tiger, did not look professional.Lot of times framing was off.Dhole scene was good, hornbill scene was goodWildkarnataka has upped the benchmark by miles.",False
12,10,Perfect blend of cinema with wilderness,Souard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNilgiris: Shared Wilderness is a breathtaking, immersive documentary that masterfully showcases the untouched beauty and ecological richness of the Nilgiri Hills, drawing viewers deep into the heart of this biodiverse paradise through its spectacular visuals, extraordinary sound design, and thoughtful narrative, where every shot is crafted with precision and love for nature, every animal captured in its purest, most majestic form, and every sound - from the rustle of leaves to the haunting calls of distant wildlife - layered with intention to bring alive the raw, unfiltered pulse of the forest, while also shedding light on the deep interconnection between the indigenous communities, flora, and fauna that coexist in this delicate environment, reminding us of the quiet strength and cultural wisdom that shapes the symbiotic relationship between people and wilderness, and as the camera pans across mist-covered canopies, sunlit valleys, elusive leopards, and silently watching elephants, we begin to understand that this documentary is not just a visual treat but a powerful message urging conservation, respect, and awareness for the natural world, for this land that's shared by tigers and tribes, hornbills and honey-hunters, is not merely a backdrop for cinematic storytelling but a living, breathing entity that holds centuries of balance and resilience, and with each passing frame, whether it's a close-up of an insect, a time-lapse of a thunderstorm rolling over the mountains, or a glimpse of a local elder recalling ancestral stories, we are pulled deeper into an experience that transcends passive watching - it feels like walking through the wilderness yourself, guided by the lens of those who understand and revere it, and what makes it all the more moving is the unspoken urgency, the gentle reminder that these forests, rivers, and skies are not permanent unless protected, and as the credits roll with birdsong in the background and golden light fading through the trees, you're left not just awestruck by nature's grandeur but also humbled, inspired, and even a little responsible - because if anything, Nilgiris: Shared Wilderness is more than a documentary; it's an emotional, cinematic, and deeply human tribute to the planet we share, a poetic call to preserve what still remains wild, sacred, and spectacularly alive.",True
13,10,Excellent Movie!,dpaknayak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nilgiris - A Shared Wilderness is a cinematic ode to India's very first UNESCO biosphere reserve.

The visuals are absolutely breathtaking, it really makes you feel like you're right there in the middle of the forest. But more than just the scenery, the movie does a great job of showing why it's so important to protect nature. It gently reminds us that we're not separate from the wild but we're part of it. Living in harmony with the natural world isn't just a nice idea, it's something we all need to embrace. Definitely worth a watch if you love nature or just want to feel a little more connected to the world around you.",False

1,9,Must watch for people that like to follow these artists!,ellliotobreen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have to be honest: Normally, I dislike biography type of artist movies, but man oh man what was this a great movie. I enjoyed the visuals, the background emotions and is makes you curious about where their journey will take them.If you are looking for a movie to watch together with your partner and makes you get to know this insta-worthy couple better beide the scenes, it is just the thing for you. I can recommend watching it very much!I even shed a tear when their biggest (ZD) dream came through. You just spot and feel the emotions after their performance till they end up at home. Amazing storytelling!",False

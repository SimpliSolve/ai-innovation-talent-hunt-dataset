1,5,Not even close to 10/10,jaylemieux-23237,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love it when you read reviews and they all sound the same. No one who wrote a review had it less than 10/10. I don't think so.Tell you what, I'll review this as someone who doesn't work for the company that made the movie.For the most part, it was pretty good. It started out as most Amityville movies do, with the background of what happened and such which most people probably know already.Once it got rolling, the EVP work and all that was decent and there were a lot of places where you thought, ""Hey, that's pretty slick"", and so forth.I'm not sure I buy on the idea that the voices coming through could ""sound"" like the actual dead people. That was a bit of a stretch, but it made for interesting filming and I guess the idea that John DeFeo was talking to them directly was cool, but again, not convinced you can listen to a dead person in the voice they had IRL.I did learn that the village is populated with rich snobs and they don't like strangers. I can see that as being true!Listen, it was decent, and as someone who will watch just about anything with respect to that house, I give it a solid 5 stars. But not even close to 10.",True
2,10,Great Documentary!!!,spookystephtx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm so happy to see a new documentary that has good fresh information on the subject, finally. I knew George ""Lee"" Lutz before he died and I do have to say that the voice that they captured stopped me. I actually dropped my phone. I'm not shocked that someone would capture him on audio because he was always vocal about his experiences in Amityville. But I thought ""Why on earth would he be THERE of all places, though?"" He was always very protective as a friend, especially when it came to being anywhere around there...maybe he was there to protect them? And to continue his mission of letting the world know that his family's experiences there were indeed real. He once said in an interview that the forces there were very intelligent and powerful. I'm not saying yes it was absolutely 100% George Lee Lutz, but I'm saying as somebody that heard his voice other than just in interviews, yeah it sure sounded a lot like him to me, too. Lots of interesting information wss presented here and I will definitely be re-watching this come morning. My mind is still digesting everything. Great job Sean and team!!!",False

7,10,Riveting documentary full of validating evidence,leadiluca,n/a,16/08/2025,"I literally just sat and watched that entire documentary from start to finish. It was one of the best ones I've seen on Amityville ever.. You seriously have gotten some of the best evidence of any Paranormal Investigator anywhere. The session with you and Ralph in the car was amazing with the gunshot, and when you are in the cemetery with John's voice coming in. This was a really validating documentary.

10,10,AMAZING -NEW AUTHENTIC AMITYVILLE EVIDENCE,ryan-j-birge,n/a,16/08/2025,"Awesome, awesome watch with well-known powerhouse paranormal experts (Ralph Sarchie, Sean Austin, more) teamed up with one of the best up and coming horror doc directors, Billy Lewis. Whole new and recent (!) take on the most famous paranormal story of all time. Their evidence -mostly taken outside the actual Amityville home- is jaw dropping and emotional. You'll be thinking about this one for days after....",False
11,10,Great Documentary,angelblossom-32963,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love every documentary that Billy and Sean have done together. This is by far one of my favorites. A must watch. I love that Ralph Sarchie is in this with Sean. I love hearing his view's about this story. This documentary will not disappoint you. I honestly don't know of one, with a paranormal researchers experiences, that also documents real evidence. I also learned things about this story, that blew me away. This is truly an informative documentary filled with evidence and things I didn't expect. Again, a must see.",False
12,10,Amazing Documentary!,rondapigeon,n/a,16/08/2025,"This house like many others has always intrigued me. This was amazing information, and evidence about the demons. My only wish was that there was footage in the home, regardless though absolutely well done!",False

17,10,AMAZING Paranormal Evidence at one of the Most Haunted Houses in the World,GhostInTheWind12,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is entertaining from start to finish. If you have an open mind about the paranormal and spirits then this will really keep you on the edge of your seat. ScareNetwork is really putting out some solid documentaries and this is probably the best one they've produced so far. Can't wait to see what the future holds but I highly recommend watching #Amityville - The Resurgence!!!! 10 out of 10 for me!!!,False
18,10,I'm shook!,Feather1228,n/a,16/08/2025,I was so anxious watching this documentary. I didn't know a lot about Amityville prior to watching this and now I'm so intrigued. Sean caught some of the most substantial evidence and I literally caught myself holding my breath in suspense. It's the perfect documentary for anyone into the paranormal or Amityville history.,False
19,10,Outstanding evidence!,emspittel,n/a,16/08/2025,It is an excellent documentary. The evidence is outstanding! It really stands out from other documentaries. It's shows the real and raw evidence that unfortunately many other documentaries exaggerate and enhance just for the film.,False
20,10,"Sean Austin, what more is there to say?",tab9268,n/a,16/08/2025,"Normally I try not to watch paranormal anything on tv, but to me this brought a fresh perspective to the story we've all probably seen over the years. It answered a lot for me about what happened with the DeFeos and the Lutz's experience. Most are quick to judge it as fake but with the Warren's, Ralph Sarchie and Sean Austin? That was the draw for me, Awesome job! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ",False
21,10,This will definitely give you CHILLS!,elizaweber,n/a,16/08/2025,This Documentary was one of the BEST paranormal docs i have ever seen!

22,10,"Compelling, Interesting and at times Frightening!!",thebrahmabull-99435,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched this documentary, and I have to say it was very well done. The evidence caught on camera, was very compelling, and the voice audios were chilling. Having been impacted by this case/story as a young child in the 70's, it has always been a part of my life growing up. I've watched, read, and researched so much of the history, case, opinions, lore and debates through out these past four decades, and sadly even to this day, I'm still not satisfied with understanding it yet explaining it. The Amityville Murders and Horror will forever be fascinating, intriguing, sad, scary and unfortunately a lightning rod for opinions and criticism. This documentary was interesting, compelling, and at times frightening. As a follower of this case, I can say this was one of the best done on the subject.",False
23,10,Truly amazing,ugrant-96774,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIt is great to have a new look at the Amityville Haunting. This documentary was both informative and scary! To hear the similarities in the voices of George and Ronald was bone chilling. This is definitely worth a watch and I recommend it for all Amityville believers. Sean's describing his dreams and experiences gave me the chills.,True
24,10,Amazing Documentary,nancy-18871,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was on the edge of my chair watching this documentary. As someone who grew up on Long Island and remember this all too well when it all took place, this brought me back to that time. Simply the best documentary that brings the viewer into the mindset of what Sean experienced along with Ralph. I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in the paranormal.",False
25,10,THE BEST AMITYVILLE DOCUMENTARY EVER!!!,mattstephenkerby,n/a,16/08/2025,After watching Amityville Resurgence I have to say that this is definitely the best of the best Amityville documentary and have been waiting a very long time for. From the narration and interviews and EVP and Spirit Box footage and spirit orb floating in the car which had an intelligence as insects do not move like that was great evidence. What made me happy was that John Defeo is now free from being stuck at the Amityville house and reunited with his family. I would like to see a second documentary with more EVP and spirit box recordings from the house and cemetery and grave. Maybe a Blu Ray release and a 2022 revisit with EVP and Spirit Box sessions with extended footage for a Blu Ray release which the fans would love. Thank you Sean Austin and all who were involved.

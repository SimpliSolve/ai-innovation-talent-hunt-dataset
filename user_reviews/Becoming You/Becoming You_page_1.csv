3,10,Simply Amazing Documentary- MUST SEE,henripichal,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is extraordinary. Narrated by one of the most endearing actresses of our time, this 6 part documentary series hits the mark on all counts. It is a must see for any adult who wishes to understand child development outside the textbooks. T should be required viewing for anyone with children or who work with children. The cinematography is stunning, the families and children are endearing, and you come away from each episode a little enlightened and amazed. Don't miss this series, and tell your friends/colleagues about it. You won't be disappointed!Other similarly amazing docs: My Octopus Teacher, Microcosmos, Sound & Fury.",False
4,n/a,Amazing. Stupendous. Beautiful.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know how anyone can give it less than 10 stars!Beautiful cinematography, amazingly interesting, Overall incredibly worth it. I'm not usually into documentaries but thought I would check this out on Apple TV+ since there are so few things to watch on there (why I am sure we get a free 1 yr subscription). I'm so glad I did!I'd say anyone over the age of 13 would be very interested in this documentary, and especially anyone who works with children or related field like psychology",False

1,9,Heart breaking,t-yanagimoto,n/a,15/08/2025,A well done documentary that unfortunately will taint my view of US Gymnastics forever. Such amazing courage was put on display against the back drop of sexual AND coaching abuse of gymnasts.,False
2,8,I thought it was quite good.,LukeCustomer2,n/a,15/08/2025,"For a while now I never really heard what happened with the Nassar case because they didn't want to go on to graphic details in the mainstream media. This documentary has some graphic details but not overly so and I now I know what happened via video footage of Nassar being interrogated and other information contained here.As a child I was involved in another professional sport and feel like the genius of this documentary is to point out how such professional sports can grow to be very toxic organizations who come to care little about the people the organization is living their lives off of. The leaders of USA Gymnastics clearly didn't care but only wanted to live their lives off the wholesome image of the sport.I would give a lot of the kudos to Rachael Denhollander who came off as a clear headed, believable ""accuser"". Without her steady firm recalling of events I am sure it might not have gone further. This story really points out to me and makes me sad, how little women and girls are believed. Now of course, some women have lied before and that continues to be the reason allegations are met with skepticism. But it remains distressing that in general I feel no one would have tried something like this with men.Ultimately though I hope that parents who do watch this ""get"" that if they take their kids to sports they don't allow their kids out of their sight. My parents were sometimes accused of being weird but they didn't tolerate anything at all where they could not be present at all times. I don't blame the parents here because as you can see USA Gymnastics wanted to have complete control of their kids -- or their kids would suffer. So they had little choice. But going forward any organization like that has to be rejected immediately because this is exactly the type of thing that can (and probably will) happen.",False
3,9,How long and how many does it take to bring down one person?,mmaaddllyy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great documentary.
I liked how they recounted the editorial strategy of the newspaper. I wish they had spent a bit of time on the 1997 report to Michigan State University.
Left in tears at the end because of the sheer number of girls assaulted over the years. It just indicates how much crime still goes completely unpunished.",False
4,10,A true life Horror Story that needed to be told,GomezAddams666,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWatching this documentary was horrifying, but Netflix time and again has these documentaries that the powerful do not want us to see, like the story of Gabriel Hernandez a few months back. These stories need to be told, as uncomfortable as they are, so they don't happen again.I remember when this story made headlines because of Larry Nassar going to trial, and all the victims that courageously gave public statements before the sentencing. And even back then it was evident that Nassar was an inhuman monster, an animal even; but there were forces behind the curtains that allowed this animal to prey upon these young women for as long as he did.If anyone ever questions why these girls ""never spoke before"", well they did, but they faced a large Corporation called USA Gymnastics, to whom preserving their image was much more important than preserving the innocence of hundreds of young girls.And even know, two years after Nassar was convicted, this evil conglomerate is still covering its tracks, claiming innocence. That is what powerful conglomerates like USA Gymnastics and the Catholic Church do, they sacrifice young people in their altars of perversion and make their best effort to cover it up, because humanity is meaningless to them.I am glad Nassar will never be free, but is abundantly clear that there are people that need to share his jail cell.",True
5,10,The shocking truth,makaylagan,n/a,15/08/2025,I cannot believe how corrupt the US Gymnastics is after watching the documentary. The pain the victims have suffered is heartbreaking for me. I really admire those women who stood out and wish them all the best.,False
6,7,As if just becoming a gymnast wasn't hard enough,brucehiddenjr-46431,n/a,15/08/2025,"These women were ignored, destroyed, ignored again and they still came back and got justice and peace unfortunately it took hundreds of victims to get there",False
7,9,"Well made doc, heartbreaking story",Calicodreamin,n/a,15/08/2025,"First off this is a well made documentary, the tone is hopeful and the survivors are treated respectfully. The timeline is well established and the interviews relevant to telling the story. The subject matter is heartbreaking, but now that this is out in the open, hopefully the survivors can heal and the investigations continue.",False
8,7,Difficult to watch,rjcicijr,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDifficult to watch
watching all these old clips of gymnastics on the Olympics and then listening to the ladies discuss their experiences,; has changed my perspective . I'll probably never ever watch another Olympics game at all the rest of my life; gymnastics especially",True
9,8,Very good . At heart of gold a little more in depth.,mpboylanjr-54038,n/a,15/08/2025,"No matter what you watch about the subject you will be effected by it. The young women who finally came out as older women are true heroes and have got guts. I've watched a couple of different documentaries on this monster Larry Nasser and the horrible abuse and rape that countless women were subject to throughout his long career of working with these athletes. I will say that the HBO doc was a bit more in depth but nonetheless very powerful. This is a subject that is difficult to hear but very important for all to see. The women who came forward at the trial of this predator are true rock stars , and should be celebrated.",False
10,7,A Good Grim Documentary,alindsayal,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary hit Netflix today and I had the chance to watch Athlete A and here is my review for it. The premise of the film documents the real story of Dr Larry Nassar and how he molested young gymnastics for 30 years and how US Athletics covered it up.Now this film deals with a really intense and disturbing subject matter and it does it really well. As you learn more and more you realise just how disgusting and horrific the actions by Nassar was and just how badly run the US Gymnastics was and how they aided this pedophile which is just truly horrifying.The thing that makes this really awful, is that by all accounts Nassar seemed like a nice guy and the nicest guy at US Athletics. But he used this to break all the trust issues that there was and let him commit these horrible acts and it is so satisfying seeing him get taken down.But this film did have some negatives and it is mostly due to it's pacing. I felt like there was some background information that was presented here that didn't add that much to the story. It would have been fine for a mini series but this is only a 1 hour 45 film so it dawdles at times when it shouldn't be. Also if feels like it skips over the really interesting parts involved in this whole case.Also, obviously seeing all these gymnasts revealing their stories are highly emotional I just wish they could of got Simone Biles to take part. She revealed to the court that she was a victim and with her being the most famous gymnast in the world it would have added more star power here.Overall, this is a good documentary with a disturbing subject matter. But it has some pacing issues which hurts it and would have maybe been better as a mini series.Rating - 7/10.",False
11,9,How can 500+ underage girls keep the same secret from adults?,nahumthebest,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a good documentary but I feel it was done in a very basic way. It is hard to describe.It is horrible what happened. The corruption is unimaginable. What transpired over 29 years - it is impossible to fathom how that was possible.The story is absolutely unbelievable, unimaginable, and impossible to make up.Conclusion: definitely worth watching and recommending.9/10 - good documentary; recommend it.",False
12,7,Cover up,Quirk47,n/a,15/08/2025,One of the greatest scandals in sports. Larry took the advantage of an organisation and he lost his mind. There were hundreds of complaints against him about sexual abuse. He is like never ending. Maggie is the first survivor who raised her voice at organisation. But Rachel is the woman who accused Larry publicly. Sad to see Maggie is not selected by committee when she stands sixth in list. When I saw Larry was the main Candidate in the list ..I didn't expect that Ex-president would Tamper the evidence against him. I was like wtf ..!,False
13,5,HBO Made A Far Superior Documentary on the Same Subject,chas437,n/a,15/08/2025,"As is typical of almost all Netflix documentaries, this is a second or third rate product. HBO produced a superb documentary called ""At the Heart of Gold"" which deals with the same subject matter. Its better in every way possible than ""Athlete A"". You can currently watch it on YouTube.For example, the HBO doc has a lot ofriveting courtroom scenes that are very telling about the Nassar case, None of this is in the Netflix product. The HBO doc had me in tears, the Netflix doc left. me underwhelmed.",False
14,8,"Terribly hard to watch, but an important and effective story",blott2319-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's tough to know how to evaluate Athlete A. I tend to be someone who rates/ranks movies based on my enjoyment of a film, but there is nothing to ""enjoy"" here. Athlete A is the kind of film that made me sob in tears and want to put my fist through someone's face. It gave me chills of horror and fits of anger (amplified by the fact that some of the vile events discussed in it took place mere minutes from where I live.) None of these are pleasant emotions, but the fact that I felt them so intensely is a sign that the filmmakers did their job. I have nothing but appreciation for the skill that went into presenting the story of the awful things that went on behind the scenes of US Olympic Gymnastics for decades.Athlete A is a movie that needed to be made, about a story that people need to know, but it is also a sensitive topic that will be hard (perhaps impossible) for some viewers to watch. I will say, while the details of what went on are discussed without holding back, there is some tact in the way it is presented. It's a tough balance, but I think they did a great job. The film tackles the subject from 2 different angles. One side is presenting the way the story was broken by a newspaper, and how that led to countless victims coming forward to form the case against this predatory ""doctor."" The other aspect of the film is a series of one-on-one interviews with some of the victims and their families as they discuss what happened.You have to applaud all these young women who came forward and were willing to relive devastating moments in their lives. They display such strength and maturity that it is truly inspiring. Of course, the more you admire these women, the more angry you get at those who victimized them, those who played a part in allowing it to happen, and those involved in covering up the truth. This is a blight on USA gymnastics, and makes me sick when I recall watching Olympic events and seeing those faces on the sidelines. There's no doubt that Athlete A tells the truth in a powerful way, and I'm grateful that some filmmakers were skilled enough to do this story justice. They share the ugly truth in Athlete A so that others can learn from what happened to these girls, and hopefully we can avoid situations like this in the future.",False
15,10,"Insightful, Bold and Impressive",donewithitokay,n/a,15/08/2025,Athlete A deals with a major issue that has been kept under the carpet for decades. A bold attempt that emphasises on turning away from not supporting the victims equals committing the crime itself. Netflix nailed it.,False
16,7,An important film that's one of the better documentaries I've watched on Netflix this year,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're looking for a documentary that has an amazing sense of style or unique presentation, you may be disappointed, as from a filmmaking standpoint it's decent but maybe unremarkable. It looks like 95% of all the other documentaries produced for Netflix, and I still swear that all these Netflix documentaries have the exact same composer, or maybe the same library of stock music because they all sound exactly the same. This wouldn't be a problem if they didn't all rely on having a constant musical score so much.HOWEVER: for what this documentary exposes, and for how it makes you understand and feel for the survivors, and for explaining how abuse can get buried within large institutions that have a power imbalance, it's fantastic. It's similar to another documentary from 2012 called The Invisible War in that regard (which I'd highly recommend to anyone who liked this one).It takes a little while to get going, but thankfully it ends strong, and I love that it gives a sense of hope and catharsis to the survivors that you don't always get in all thematically heavy and emotionally draining documentaries like this.(The only other thing I can comment on is that it felt like some of the scenes with the journalists discussing how to report the main case in question felt like they might have been dramatised? I can't prove it of course, but their conversations felt slightly stilted, and given that the documentary doesn't focus on the journalists, I find it hard to believe that the camera crew happened to capture this exact conversation when it spontaneously happened. It's such a small point, and it might well just be me who thought that, but I had to get it out regardless.)",False

18,7,"Good but not as great as ""At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal""",tgeorgiu,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is an engrossing story and well made.It has the scope of the investigative journalism team that broke the story initially, after the extremely brave stance of the first gymnast that came forward, revealing her name !A good documentary on the matter but not as great as ""At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal"" by Erin Lee Carr and HBO. Especially for the various details that have not made it into this one, and the court scene with the face off between a gymnast that used to hold Larry Nassar dear to her heart, and the ex doctor turned molester and abuser. Make sure to watch that one too.",True
19,10,Watch it NOW!,maureenfarrow,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an amazing film. Must see for any parent with a child in sports; better yet anyone in charge of protecting children, teaching children, raising children. These children were failed by every adult involved in their training. Lack of protection equals neglect. Power and intimidation allowed famous trainers to turn their heads on crime in exchange for medals and fame. Mandatory reporting is dismissed and trivialized. Business is business and money is money at the expense of children...KUDOS to these brave young athletes and their families. Entrusting our kids to other adults does NOT guarantee safety...#speakup",False
20,n/a,Life Competing For A Spot,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMaggie Nichols was introduced by her mother to gymnastics at a young age as the mother herself loved gymnastics as a child. She had sons and Maggie was the last child and it was finally a girl.We see videos of Larry Nassar performing examinations while explaining. The girls lie down and it makes me uncomfortable to see them in a vulnerable position. He touches and feels up their body way too much. He took videos to try to give validation to his actions under the guise that he was really just performing medically.I HATE when things are brushed aside as normal. If the person is uncomfortable, there should be steps taken.We see videos of middle-aged women today who were in gymnastics in their childhood and teenage years. It is interesting to see clips of the Olympics from the past. The women they are today look like ordinary women I would see out.The parents of Maggie Nichols assumed that USA Gymnastics being an authentic organization that they were to be trusted. The father had no idea Larry Nassar would abuse females.This documentary gives insight on why victims don't speak up. We see how the first victim to speak up was insulted with negative comments - if she likes it, was it sexual assault, and other horrible comments.Larry Nassar had fingered vaginas and anuses. When confronted and questioned in a police room he was very friendly and funny. He tried to explain that the fingering was part of the examination but it was not. There is absolutely no need for anybody to finger to complete a physical or do any sort of ""check"" on an athlete's body. He is asked if he was ever aroused and he says that males get an erection out of the blue. The questioner however is firm and states that arousal is what causes the erection.Training at the gym with USA Gymnastics was difficult. One of the athletes says that none of the adults were nice and only Larry Nassar gave any kindness to the girls. He gave them food, candy, slipped things under their pillows. Adults have more control the younger the girl is as they are more naive and innocent.The girls trained at a ranch where the adults had no access to them and there was no signal. They trusted that their daughters would be taken care of well.These girls are brainwashed and trained to work with the strict adults by being obedient. Many of these girls are not happy and we see one girl who is known to rarely smile. There is a line that is blurred as they get older on what is just part of the work needed to be done and sexual assault.Even when they do report assaults, Mr. Penny, the USA Gymnastics President brushes them off. The assaults are filed and stored away. Those owners who own the ranch look so mean. The female knew the girls were assaulted as Mr. Penny told her. She should have called the police but she did not. These people are the ones who choose who gets a spot for the Olympics so the girls are compliant.This documentary was very interesting to watch as I did not know how athletes were chosen for the Olympics. It also gave me further insight on why victims did not speak up right away.",True
21,6,Very compelling documentary,richardpgriffith,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary was well done but I have two concerns.
1. The use of the word Survivor. I believe the word should be used when surviving a life and death situation and not interjected where ""victim"" is more accurate. These girls lives were never at risk. As tragic as their experiences, it needs to be in the proper context of a pervert and a perverted system taking advantage of young girls.
2. How come the women involved in the coverup have not been prosecuted? There was ample evidence of several coaches that could have gone to the Police to protect these young girls. Aren't they as culpable as Mr. Penny and the Karolyi's?",False
22,9,This is a Maggie Nichols tribute!,zxsing-12220,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm glad that Maggie Nichols' story was told here as she was unfairly denied of a place in the Rio games women's team due to the powers that be.
Unlike the HBO one, which a memento for the victims, this is truly a documentary of the various going-ons after the story exploded. It also provided introductions of the persons who came into power at USAG, which was run like a company. The most shocking part was how the story ""died"" when it went up to the FBI, because Steve Penny (then CEO of USAG) wanted to offer the FBI investigating agent a job in USAG.",False
23,7,Good but a little disappointing.,junior_vaps,n/a,15/08/2025,Great production and story telling. My only disappointment is that they left out the part of Rachael's testimony when she speaks about the gospel and forgiveness. In today's cancel culture there is only room for self-righteousness and no room for forgiveness. I wish they would have shown that side of her.,False
24,5,Racist view over the gymnastics problem,daniela_de_gamfiuc,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie view on the gymnatics problems is rather racist. And it is a dangerous perspective presented that way.It describes Romanian abusive coucher as main starter of the problem. And that USA was ""just copying"" the reciepe for succes...No. Comunist or Capitalism-they have no problems in accepting abuse for succes.I even have read comments here ""they continued with their Romanian abusive style..""
No, it's not Romanian. The real issue is that the abuse is everywhere accepted for the same purpose.",False
25,9,Strong women,evelyne_baetens,n/a,15/08/2025,"This story is absolutely heartbreaking. For years these young women and girls were manipulated and abused and those who could have stopped it didn't, because they are corrupted by money and power. I have nothing but respect for the survivors and truly hope they can find peace.",False

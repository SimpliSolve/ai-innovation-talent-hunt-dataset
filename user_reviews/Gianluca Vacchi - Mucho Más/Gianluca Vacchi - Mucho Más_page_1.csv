1,1,"Dumb, but look at him we know it already",glencoe-96237,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolute rubbish, the two reviews giving this dross a 10 and 8 are clearly this dude himself.I just cant get past the ""well known international face"" that no one outside his country, has seen.Vapid, dumb and narcissistic, this doco fits in well with the insta generation.I am forced to give it 1 ho hum.",False
2,1,Does a selfish multimillionaire really need a documentary about himself?,luigimannoni,n/a,16/08/2025,"If this abomination takes the place as the worst series on imdb I won't be surprised at all.An absolute desperate attempt to frame Vacchi as a normal human but everyone knows he's a self centered man which the only skill he had is to have inherited a fortune from his family.This ""movie"" will make you sick, question yourself how you'll get an hour back of your life and literally cry at the electric energy spent watching it.Lets put in this way, if you fall in the M category of the BDSM and you enjoy inflicting yourself some internal pain then this is for you.But either way you're better off to spend one hour shoving yourself some crayons up your nostrils which is a better much enjoyable and memorable experience than watching this steaming pile of BS.",False
3,1,A Clown on the loose,silverfoxcaribe,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Mucho mas"" garbage we don't really need. Its not hate or envy its just not and interesting life style, we are and we should aspire to be more than a social media Clown. A real men should aspire to make a difference in this world. Maybe ist me but I don't feel any respect for this character and I dont mind rich people or billionaires.",False
4,n/a,Embarrassing,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this a few days ago. My take from this is here we have is a tattooed mid-aged man in a midst of a mid-age crisis trying to be young by any means possible. Unable to dance to save his life, but thinking he is a dance sensation. I have this to say you Gianluca, just because you think what you are doing is fun to you, it does not mean others think it is. The look on your servants faces when they are trying to dance with you is far from happy. They do it because they have to or feel they have to.",False
5,6,Allow yourself no to hate it,preamados,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you watch it as an entertainment, it is fun! Of course he is vain, self-centered, without any modesty, but without a doubt, he is a lot of fun!! He has a dream life, and I admire his courage to completely change it at a certain age and to show himself off the way he does. Be a guest to his party and allow yourself to enjoy it!",False
6,8,I actually really enjoyed it,raerae-62681,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed getting a peek into Gianluca's crazy world. It was riveting to be honest. It made me think about all the things I didn't do because I wasn't motivated enough or simply scared of trying something new. The lesson I took away from this was to go out into the world, meet people, create memories, and live life to the fullest.",False
7,8,To all the negative reviews,crazysunta,n/a,16/08/2025,"If I was like that at 50yrs old, I'd be f proud of myself, not bitter, how some of those commenters are. Yes he is not perfect. But it's quite impressive of what he's achieved and his iron willpower and discipline. I think instead of crisiticing , maybe learn something from this man. There is a reason why we have a life that we have.On behalf of the show. I quite liked having a peak into his crazy lifestyle, not my cup of tea, but I do admire people without limits and people that work hard and smart. Very entertaining to watch.",False
8,10,Love it,carolinasg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love Sharon personality and seems to be such a king woman. Love GV, his eccentricities & ease way to live enjoying life . Their baby is adorable. Waiting for more!",False
9,10,Haters gonna hate,jimxenop,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unique person, and living proof that you can always re invent yourself.One word describes him throughout the show.Perseverance.Good job great documentary.",False
10,10,Honestly eye opening,fscitldavid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Life really is not easy and I think money can't buy all of that he definitely worked hard to build all he has now and I wish him a peaceful rest of his life taking care of his family.How many rich people there are out there that wish to have his life, obviously is not a film for everyone but certainly well made.David.",False
11,10,Simply Adorable !,parasharprachi,n/a,16/08/2025,"You are an inspiration to many Mr Vacchi and as people say , ""Haters gonna hate"" .I saw his videos on tiktok during Covid when Sharon conceived Blu J.I am a fan of u and ur family, since then.Its a dream life of many what he is living.I dont know him personally but I still feel so proud.Go on with the great work coz there are millions n billions who adore you and who get motivated by u.Lotsa luck n love from India.",False

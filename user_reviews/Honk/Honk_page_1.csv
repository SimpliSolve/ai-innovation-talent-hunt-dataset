1,10,Love Like Honk,bcjacobe,n/a,16/08/2025,"I first heard about Cheryl and Honk's story when I bought the Honk book for my granddaughter. During the pandemic she was asked to tell about her favorite book. She said it was Honk the Goose and then she told the story. Cheryl posted the video on Honk's Instagram page. This was the beginning of a friendship and I am so proud that my granddaughter's photo was used in the film. It is a beautiful story about love, hope and friendship which is so needed in our world! In this film you will discover how they met and all about their unusual friendship. I highly recommend this feel good beautiful film!",False
2,10,Moving & Informative Documentary,gregorygallen,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a beautiful film about friendship between an animal & a human...yet it is so much more. Filmmaker Cheryl Allison came upon this goose in the park when she used walks as her way to cope during the shutdown portion of the pandemic. What blossomed was an incredible relationship that one usually thinks of with a dog or cat. This film enlightens viewers on domestic fowl while sharing a wonderful story of how we help animals and animals help us. Directing a documentary that you also happen to be part of the subject is a tricky matter. Cheryl has navigated this so smartly...making sure the attention stays on Honk (though we still get to see what a kind & caring person she is with what she did for this goose during the pandemic). This film is perfect for audiences of all ages. You won't be disappointed for spending your time with Honk & Cheryl in this engaging and moving documentary.,False
3,10,Everyone will fall in love with Honk,saracs-01577,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have followed Honk on Instagram through most of his story. He and Cheryl's bond was amazing. It was adorable seeing him with her, honking as she spoke to him. The film is a short and, in my mind, was too short. I could watch these two and all the birds at Roger's as well, for hours and hours. I hope it brings awareness to people so they don't dump a domestic bird who has possibly bonded with a human. Watching the film I can tell how loved Honk was by Cheryl and his fans worldwide. He truly made me and many people smile.I am glad to own the DVD and highly recommend watching the film.Thank you Honk for blessing us!!",False

1,10,Samurai Genre is Used to Exposively Indict Japanese Politics and Culture,noralee,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC's Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by ""The Count of Monte Cristo,"" Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks' Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.The film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of ""The 47 Ronin."" The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.Very gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.It is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan's armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.The psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like ""Downfall (Der Untergang),"" it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.The repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.The over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.",False
2,10,Disharmony of Sword and Pen,Galina_movie_fan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've said it once about another movie, incidentally by the other great Japanese director as well and I want to repeat my words in regard to ""Harakiri"": ""There are good, very good, and even great movies. But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!""The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business.""At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.",False
3,9,A powerful movie (opinion of a novice.),Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story of a Samurai, who requests to commit harakiri.I have read many of the reviews with a great deal of respect, many have such an understanding of the culture, and a very deep understanding of the content of the film, for my ignorance I come here as a novice, with no understanding, so from my viewpoint, I'm watching a film I've been told I'd love. I've seen one samurai film prior to this.First off, I had to check it was actually made in 1962, it felt way more advanced than that, the concepts and production.I thoroughly engaged with it, the story was fascinating, and where I expected it to tell a general story, the focus was pretty much on one single character, Hanshiro Tsugumo.Some of the pacing me be hard for some, the long drawn out scenes, I find very purposeful. The music is engaging, the acting terrific.I wasn't surprised to learn that the swords and multitude of blades used in this movie were real, and that I think is one of the film's most successfully aspects, its authentic, a story presented in a very real fashion.It's a powerful story, 9/10.",False
4,n/a,Great movie,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I first saw this movie, I did not know much about it. I saw it for a class so I was given a little background of the time period. In fact I was pretty much just told this:This movie takes place during the time where many Samurai were left ronins, or masterless. These samurai were unable to find work and thereby were left in poverty. Eventually many would go up to clans and ask to commit seppuku.It was dishonorable to refuse such a ""noble"" request, but most clans did not want samurai to kill themselves on their property so they would just pay the samurai to go elsewhere.So I watched the movie and well... I loved it. During the class discussion the next day I found most people hated the movie. Not because it was a bad movie, but because of how it made people feel about themselves. And that's exactly why this movie is genius. If you're interested in watching this movie, do not read the summary in detail - reading the summary in detail will deprive you of what one of the key things that made the movie great IMO.",False
5,10,200 Proof,Duree,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is the purest distillation of the spirit of Greek tragedy ever put on celluloid.  Yes, this is a review of Seppuku, a Japanese film released in 1962.  Perhaps it took a non-Westerner, free of all of the cultural baggage and ridiculous associations, to see straight into the heart of the tragic mode and make it palpable and alive in the twentieth century.  That is not all: the black and white cinematography is both formally assured and often outrageously daring; the soundtrack is one of the finest efforts of the greatest Japanese composer of the 20th century (or any century for that matter); the acting is demonically inspired; and the narrative is relentlessly gripping and involving.  The film illuminates the relationship between the individual and society and between society and history.  It is a tender meditation on familial love and the ties of friendship that transcend even death.  This film will cut open your bowels, pull your soul out, and force you to stare it in the face.  There may be other films that attain similar heights, but I cannot imagine any film, ever, being more perfect. Forget Citizen Kane, Seven Samurai, the Godfather, etc. etc. all of those commodified canonical works that everybody raves about because everybody else is raving about them.  Don't get me wrong, they're fine--but this stuff is 200 proof.  See it today.  Buy it yesterday.",False
6,10,Humanism against the Samurai code of honor,frankde-jong,n/a,15/08/2025,"The generation that came after the renown Japanese directors Kurosawa, Ozu and Mizoguchi is generally regarded as less talented. The main representatives of this generation are Kaneto Shindo, Kon Ichikawa en Masaki Kobayshi. Personally I would like to make an exception for Masaki Kobayashi, who is in my opinion the equal of Kurosawa, Ozu and Muzoguchi.Kobayashi is best known in the West for his ghost stories ""Kwaidan"" (1964). The rest of his repertoire, among which the samurai movie ""Harakiri"" (1962), is not to be sneezed at either.A samurai movie is usually seen as a sort of Western of the East. Main ingredients of the Western genre are action and the battle beween the law (good) and the villains (bad).In ""Harakiri"" (which literal translation is: hara = belly , kiri = cutting) in stead of the law there is the samurai code of honor (Bushido in Japanese). But this code of honor is not the good element of the film. Rather it is revealed as a force of ruthlessness and hypocrisy. In the film the Bushido is represented by the Li clan.In ""Harakiri"" there is also little action. Only towards the end there is something that can be seen as a ""shoot out"". But in this shoot out the evil is not overcome, but only revealed as shallow (the idol of the Li clan is shown to be an empty armor).Translated in Western movie genres ""Harakiri"" is therefore no Western. Maybe it can be categorised as a Court room drama. The heart of the film consists of main character Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) telling his sad story. This story is in essence a requisitor against the Bushido. The performance of Nakadai as a broken Tsugumo is brilliant. His requisitor is not only aimed at the Li clan, but also against his own past. Once Tsugumo also was a samurai.Kobayashi was a convinced humanist all his life. Apart from ""Harakiri"" he also made the 9,5 hours epos ""The human condition"" (1959-1961). This epos is situated in World War II. For Kobayashi kamikaze was just another form of Harakiri and thus just another utterance of the old Bushido.",False
7,10,A Gem of Japanese Cinema,lstrawser,n/a,15/08/2025,"Harakiri is an excellent human drama set in feudal Japan that involves a ronin presenting himself to a powerful clan and asking to commit harikiri. However, through a series of flashbacks we see that this ronin is motivated by more than the idea of dying honorably. The events that follow are a critique of the feudal system and a celebration of dying for one's beliefs.Every frame in Harikiri is wonderfully composed and a treat to view. The cinematography is crisp, the sets wonderful and the actors are spectacular. Much can be said about this film's technical merits as well as its social implications. I found out about this film through my love of Akira Kurosawa's samurai dramas (who else...) and I must say that it is very different from Kurosawa-sans work although it draws inevitable comparisons. Due to its themes, Harikiri is more of an anti samurai film. Generally Kurosawa's work seems to glorify the honor of the samurai and celebrate them as Japanese heroes by showing them gloriously in battle. Kurosawa is the Japanese John Ford, taking an icon from his culture and celebrating it. Harikiri exposes the virtues that Kurosawa portrays as being ""a facade"" to directly quote the film.I say this so as not to mislead any potential viewers, I do not know enough about Japanese history to judge what the samurai really stood for and really I am not concerned with the idea. This is the only Kobyashi film I have seen and it has been brought to my attention that many of his films deal with similar themes. All in all I think that Harikiri is a wonderful film that offers a new take on feudal Japan.",False
8,10,Does to the Samurai genre what Wild Bunch did to the Western!,OttoVonB,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having seen this film the mind becomes clouded with the innumerable things to say about it. Only praise comes to mind. Kobayashi has crafted The great samurai film for the rebel generation and he mixes a deftly handled criticism of authoritarian hypocrisy with a very touching piece of human drama.The plot is deceptively simple: an old samurai (touchingly portrayed by Tatsuya Nakadai of ""Ran"", ""Kagemusha"" and ""Sword of Doom"") arrives at a clan castle to commit seppuku in their yard, and then tells his tale, seemingly trying to gain time at first. What seems to be the rambling of an old man soon turns out to be a grieving account of how this man (and, more significantly, his loved ones) was wronged by the clan. Then comes the violent revenge (this is where you think ""Wild Bunch with katanas"", though they do up the ante toward the end with guns...).Kobayashi's direction is masterful, keeping an unbearable suspense during the mostly talky film, handling the touching scenes with care and maturity and giving us a sweeping fight to top all that. The 133 minutes running time never feels half that long! At the heart of it all though, is Nakadai, who, despite an excellent CV, delivers his greatest performance ever. His Tsugumo evokes a wounded panther, grieving an grieving until it gives in to fury. Nakadai's performance alone marks the film as essential viewing.If you're open to samurai flicks, this will rank among the finest films you've ever seen.",False
9,10,This is the best character study & Samurai movie ever made.,FRANK13,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have seen this movie numerous times (at least 10, probably many more), and enjoy it each time.  The first couple of times I saw it was right after it came out.  It did not have sub-titles, and as my Japanese is not very good, I made some assumptions about the characters, relationships, the plot,etc. When I saw it with sub-titles, I was surprised at how few incorrect assumptions I had made.  That I made so few errors is no credit to me, but rather to how well the plot, character development, character relationships, and the overall movie were done.The movie is not limited to feudal Japan, for it transcends this era.  It has lessons, for those who look for this in art.  For instance, just one example occurs to me now:  It underscores the need for a person to stand on principle, and to maintain their honor, ethics, and dignity, even when those who are the political leaders have long since lost theirs.  However for purely entertainment value, the realism, suspense, art, and action could not be better. Words fail to express how this film captivates and entertains. Few films can equal this one.  It is a ""must see.""",False
10,9,So Close To Perfection,jonsefcik,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seven Samurai is pretty great, but I think Harakiri is even better. This tale of a ronin seeking revenge and exposing the flawed samurai code is so close to perfection. The story is engrossing and despite the slow pacing it's never boring. What the production lacks in scale it makes up for with emotional intensity. The sparse, ominous score is perfect for this film. The direction and cinematography are masterful and the camera's slow pans and zooms really butter my croissant. The editing is great and purposeful too. There's not a single weak performance but Tatsuya Nakadai in the leading role steals the show.My only complaints are with some of the pacing and fight choreography. There's a standoff scene in the middle that could have been cut (since it felt like a cheap way to build tension and it wouldn't make sense for them to continue waiting afterward) and the long flashback could have also been trimmed. The film is 2 hours 13 minutes but I think exactly 2 hours would have been perfect. From a fight choreography standpoint the one-on-one fight scenes were well done but climax was shaky. There were many interesting ideas and moments in there, but also several points where I was like ""okay, how did they not strike him there?""Harakiri is an outstanding film that deserves more attention. If you haven't seen this film check it out. The Criterion restoration is absolutely beautiful. I intentionally kept this review vague since it's best to go into it knowing as little as possible. With a few thousand more ratings, this film would be pretty high up on the IMDb Top 250, and I'd be delighted to see it there.",False
11,10,Honor and Hypocrisy,tintin-23,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt would seem impossible that any ""samurai"" movie could surpass Kurosawa's ""Ran,"" ""Kagemusha,"" or even ""Rashomon"" in visual impact, masterful storytelling, and moral imperative. However, there is such a film, and it is ""Seppuku"" (""Harakiri""), produced in 1962, arguably the best samurai movie ever made.""Harakiri"" (1962), as it is known in the West, was directed by one of the post-WWII great filmmakers of Japan, Masaki Kobayashi. This film, considered by many as his masterpiece, won him the International Jury Prize at Cannes in 1965. Unfortunately, Kabayashi is not as well known outside Japan as some other giants of the Japanese cinema. He was very much affected by the war, and his films, contrary to most Japanese filmmakers of the post-war eras, are very political in nature. Kobayashi's films explore the dark side of the Japanese culture, with its wars, corruption, and hypocrisy, and their consequences. His film, ""The Thick-Walled Room"" (1953), won him the 1956 Peace Culture Prize. His nine-hour trilogy, ""The Human Condition"" (1959/61), won the International Jury Prize at Cannes 1963, which actually launched his public recognition, presents a scathing critique of the horrors of WWII, experienced first-hand while on the Manchurian front, and later on the Ryukyu Islands. While serving, as a statement of dissent against war, he refused any promotion and remained a private until he was taken prisoner by the U.S. He spent one year in a prison camp before returning to the business of film making, in 1946, until 1952 as an assistant director under Keisuke Kinishita.In Japan, Seppuku is the formal term for ritual suicide by disembowelment. Harakiri, as it is known in the West, is the common term, which literally means ""stomach cutting."" It was an integral part of bushido, the code of conduct of the samurai warrior class. Seppuku was ordered by a superior as punishment to redeem some offence, or chosen over a dishonorable death at the hands of an enemy. In both cases, it demonstrated the honor, courage, loyalty, and high moral character of the individual. Except when performed on a battlefield, it was a very formal ceremony, requiring certain etiquette, witnesses and considerable preparation.Harakiri is a particularly painful and rather messy way of ending one's days. In this ritual, the ""performer"" opens his abdomen, starting from left to right and then finishing from top toward bottom. But there is so need to be left for hours contemplating one's entrails. Another swordsman acting as a ""second,"" called kaishakunin, is standing by to decapitate the departing at a pre-arranged moment in the ceremony. Lord Ieyasu Tokugawa, who founded Japan's last great shogunate dynasty in 1603, ordered the practice of harakiri to be discontinued by both secondary and primary retainers. Later on, in 1663, a stronger edict from Lord Nobutsuna Matsudaira of Izu, put an end to the practice altogether. By that time, the ritual had become an idle formalism, and the ""performer"" was decapitated at the instant he took his sword out of the scabbard, thus avoiding a painful death. In some instances, the sword was replaced by a fan.Hanshiro Tsugomo (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to the castle of the Iyi Clan to seek revenge for the humiliation and cruel death of his son-in-law, Anjiwa Motome (Akira Ishihama). Kobayashi is a superb storyteller, and in a slow and deliberate rhythm, he develops his story, which could have been taken from the pages of the Iliad or of the Mahabharata. The tension grows, as the Clan members slowly realize that they are in turn being humiliated by this stranger who truly believe in the samurai code of honor: he must be terminated to prevent him to broadcast his truth.The final duel with the master swordsmen of the Clan, Hikukuro Omodaka, on the Plains of Gojin-in, is like a meditation, a ballet of death. The film ends in a spectacular combat, and the coup de grace to Hanshiro Tsugomo's seppuku is fittingly not applied by a gallant swordsman, but a cowardly platoon of muskets. Even to the end, the samurai honor code has been violated by the Clan.As Toshiro Mifune has long been associated with the success of Kurosawa's films, so are Kogayashi's films enhanced by the brilliant interpretation of Tatsuya Nakadai (also staring in the leading roles in Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha"",and ""Ran""). This outstanding actor contributed further to the success of this director's films, ""Kwaidan"" and the ""Samurai Rebellion."" The screenplay by Shinobu Hashimoto is based on a novel by Yasuhiko Takiguchi The cinematography, by Yoshio Miyajima, in black and white, is gorgeous. Many on the shots are ""haiku-like"" in the imagery. The musical score, written for an ensemble of ancient instruments and percussion by the renowned classical composer Toru Takemitsu, is used sparingly throughout the film, reinforcing the dramatic moments.Masaki Kobayashi's film is an indictment of the hypocrisy of the establishment, any establishment, would it be in feudal 17th Century Japan or in any other time. Dogma, on which the establishment's authority rests, is evil. The established, codified order, with all its smoke and mirrors, must be preserved at all costs, and nothing must be allowed to come in its way. It is the duty of each member of any government, organization, church, or brotherhood not to spare any effort and to go to any length to protect the appearances and status quo, to achieve this essential goal of survival. The end justifies the means, and no lie or deceit can be eliminated if this survival is at stake.Although taking place almost five centuries ago during the Tokugawa Shogunate, this film is also a strong denunciation of the entrenched cultural legacy of coercive rituals, blind obedience, and chauvinism that resulted in the tragedy of the Pacific War.The outstanding screenplay, the superb acting, the cinematography and editing makes ""Harakiri"" the best samurai film ever.",True
12,9,Harakiri,Ninja_Sinai,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well what can I say.. this 1962 movie directed by Masaki Kobayashi is one of the MOST powerful movies I have ever seen in my life! It is really a tremendous example of outstanding film making! The cinematography is absolutely exceptional! However it is the haunting plot of a samurai explaining the meaningless and worthless flawed belief of the samurai spirit which grips the viewer.Tatsuya Nakadais mighty performance in Harakiri further proves for me, that he is without a doubt one of best actors in the history of film. This man takes on his roles with such prowess that it is easy for the viewer to forget that you have seen him play a different role in another movie.By the way - The Criterion 2 disk DVD version is mint!

13,7,Hanshiro is introduced as a Ronin asking the Iyi Clan masters if they would accept his desire to perform harakiri in their courtyard as a dignified samurai.,paolaxsanchez13,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film is narrated by more than on e person. However the main character, Hanshiro, gets to tell his full story of how and why he got there to the Iyi Clan. There is suspicion from the beginning when he is asked if he really ants to perform harakiri or if he simply wants money or a job. The counselor asks him this and Hanshiro replies the same answer that his son in law, Motome, did when he came in search for an open hand. Through Hanshiro's story telling, we are able to see the true meaning for why he is there; revenge for his lost family. Althpugh his intention is not on killing them, he simply wants them to acknowledge the unethical way they went about with Motome. In the beginning of them movie, the Iyi Clan armor is depicted as honorable, brave and even a little frightening however after the plot uncovers how the samurai retainers acted, the armor becomes an insignificant and worthless statue.",True

This is all capped off with some ""fighting"" Ten-year-olds finding an old bag of golf clubs in the basement have acted out better sword fights than the ones this film offers.I recommend the beginning of Seppuku to anybody, but turn it off when it slides into a endless ho-hum debate about ""who's honor is the deepest""",False
15,n/a,Rituals and appearances aren't just about the Japanese,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Harakiri"" (""Seppuku"") (Japanese, 1962): It is the 17th century. A young Samurai warrior arrives at a mansion, asking to perform his ritual death there. In a series of flashbacks, we learn who he is, why he came, and what has occurred since. Although quietly told by another ex-warrior (about whom we also learn more), this is an interesting story that builds in complexity and tension. Debates about rituals and appearances may at first seem to hold more significance in old Japan than in the contemporary United States, but it is not difficult to translate and implement such thoughts. Love, honor, duty, family, children, saving ""face"", determination, desperationthey all exist in OUR everyday lives. Dramatically photographed in beautiful black & white, given a strong Japanese score, and paced so that even the mildly patient will be glad they saw it, ""Harakiri"" is epically huge, and a must-see for story & film lovers.",False
16,10,A classic!,WaveTossed,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA classic, surviving the test of time -- made in 1962 about 17th century people. Here in 2005, we still watch and discuss the film and the issues that it raises. Tsugumo Hanshiro, a middle-aged ronin formerly serving a clan abolished by the Shogunate, appears at the Ii clan gate. He wishes to commit seppuku rather than live on in poverty. In his inner headquarters, Saito Kageyu, the chief retainer, bemoans the fact that hordes of starving ronin have been making similar requests at clan gates; most have wanted handouts rather than to actually commit seppuku. Kageyu suspects the same of Hanshiro. Kageyu attempts to discourage Hanshiro. He tells a tale of another ronin from the same abolished clan, Chijiiwa Motome.Motome had appeared a few months earlier, with a request, but had carried bamboo sword blades  the clan members had been enraged. As an example to other scrounging ronin, particularly those without real blades, the clan decided to force Motome to commit seppuku with his own bamboo wakizashi.Hanshiro tells his own life story. The film shows us some historical background. Thousands of ex-retainers had been thrown out of their positions, made into ronin, by the Shogunate's abolishing of clans. In the rigid class system (samurai, farmers, artisans, merchants), these displaced ex-retainers had no place at all, being forced into marginal subsistence. Most trades (because they required long periods of apprenticeship) were out for most ronin. Many ronin became outlaws or obtained bodyguard positions for gangsters. If law-abiding, they were able to teach in schools for commoner children. Or become piecework artisans; they could contract with wholesalers (who also lent money) to make fans, umbrellas, insect cages, ink brushes, and the like. Even as most ronin had to fend for themselves in this netherworld, they still were to carry the two swords of their original rank, and to uphold their obligations. Hanshiro and his daughter Miho make umbrellas and fans to sell to wholesalers for a pittance; Hanshiro is in debt to one of the wholesalers. Motome teaches commoner children and receives a minimal wage for his work.Miho and Motome marry and have a son. All goes well until sickness strikes. Miho contracts consumption and the child contracts a fever. Neither Hanshiro nor Motome can afford a doctor. Motome attempts to get a laborer job (which pays more than teaching does) and runs straight into job discrimination: ""no starving ronin need apply."" Motome sells his sword blades at a pawnshop, obtaining bamboo blades to wear inside his sword fittings, not an uncommon practice; some ronin (and some low-ranked clan samurai) desperately needed money. And yet, the sword was considered to be ""the soul of the bushi."" A bushi who sold his blades had to appear to wear the badge of his rank. The bamboo blades were available, thus no one would know of the despicable act of having sold his ""soul"" for money.But Motome has not received enough; he still cannot afford a doctor. So Motome decides on something more desperate: to appear at a clan gate, with his hidden bamboo blades, in order to request seppuku -- with the actual intention of receiving a handout to get a doctor for his wife and child. The Ii clan officials have decided differently. The scene where Motome must commit seppuku with his bamboo wakizashi is one of the most harrowing scenes ever filmed. Motome is utterly humiliated, surrounded by the Ii clan retainers, with Onodaka Hikokuro, his assigned second preaching on how the sword is the soul of the samurai, the bamboo sword is what is appropriate for Motome, and so forth. While Motome painfully carries forth. Hikokuro refuses Motome's request to cut off his head and end the ritual's mockery, so Motome ends it himself, biting off his tongue.Hanshiro has realized -- too late -- that he had never dared to even consider selling his own sword blades to help out the family. The scene when he is confronted with Motome's body and the truth of what has happened is truly gut-wrenching, as Hanshiro weeps and slams down his ""useless tokens"" that he had clung to. Hanshiro reveals his own secret  he has used his ""useless tokens"" to avenge Motome's death. He has tracked down the three Ii retainers who were most responsible for Motome's death. The final duel between Hanshiro and Onodaka Hikokuro is absolutely stunning. Instead of taking the lives of these three, Hanshiro has taken their topknots. And while Kageyu has preached to Hanshiro about samurai honor, these three swordsmen have hidden themselves away, claiming sickness to cover up their own shame, while their topknots grow back.Kageyu cannot deal with Hanshiro's revelations. He commands his men to slaughter Hanshiro. Hanshiro fights back gamely, taking four of the Ii clan retainers and wounding several more. In a symbolic scene, he tears down the ancestral armor of the Ii clan. Some Ii clansmen use their rifles against Hanshiro, but Hanshiro sticks his own sword into his belly, committing seppuku as he has pledged to do. In the end, Kageyu fashions a cover-up of the entire event; mysterious plagues have hit the Ii clan and a number of their retainers, including Onodaka, have died of ""illness"" rather than by the blade of an impoverished hungry ronin.This film raises many issues. It is Kobayashi's impassioned protest against rigidly militaristic societies that uphold hypocritical codes of ""bushido"" while disdaining what that term really means. The film is also like a Greek tragedy, with a character (Tsugumo Hanshiro) possessing the tragic flaw of his own pride -- which in the end, he must pay for with his life. Which he does in a heroic way. This film doesn't just recount the oppression of poor people. It shows the strength that these poor people have, the choices that they make as individuals, refusing to just bow down and be mere victims of their society.",True

18,10,Excellent cinematography,dino_cattaneo,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's quite surprising that some old masterpieces fall easily into the oblivion. Harakiri (Seppuku) is a good example. Quite simply this is one of the best Japanese movies I've ever seen.Everything is this movie is exceptional: the cinematography is top notch, the acting is very good, the direction is almost perfect.Tragedy, revenge, ethics, political contents...this movie has all of these elements wrapped in an exceptional 16th century samurai environment.The only defects I could see in this movie is that someone may feel it is slightly slow (as actually there are very few action scenes...this is not a ""chambara"" movie!) and the fact that it is not dubbed (at least in the Italian edition)...so you lose some of the details while reading the subtitles....that is, unless you understand Japanese.If you like black & white Japanese movies this is definitely a must see. GREAT.",False
19,10,A Heartbreaking and Tragic Story of Poverty and Revenge,claudio_carvalho,n/a,15/08/2025,"In 1630, after a long period of peace in Japan after the end of the clans, thousand of samurais do not have masters and are living in absolute poverty. The ronin Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai) and former samurai of Lord of Geishu arrives at the house of Lord Lyi requesting a spot to commit hara-kiri (an honorable form of suicide through self-inflicted disembowelment followed by decapitation under the samurai code).Tsugumo is received by Umenosuke Kawabe (Yoshirô Aoki), who tells the story of the young samurai Motome Chijiiwa (Akira Ishihama) that arrived at the house also asking for a place to commit hara-kiri but expecting to receive coins instead. The warrior Hikokuro Omodaka (Tetsurô Tanba) convinces the clan to force Chijiiwa to really commit suicide using his bamboo blade as an example to other samurais that would appear using the same pretext to receive coins from the master.Tsugumo discloses that the lad Chijiiwa was his son-in-law that was forced to the situation expecting to raise some money to treat his sick wife and baby son. Further, Tsugumo had arrives in the house expecting to die not committing suicide, but revenging Chijiiwa, his daughter and his grandson.""Harakiri"" is a heartbreaking and tragic story of poverty and revenge in a period when Japan was ruled by the Tokugawa clan and thousand of samurais lost their work with the fall of the clans. This film is a little masterpiece based on the wealthy history and culture of Japan and the screenplay uses flashbacks and gives an explanation of this period of story for those that do not have a minimum knowledge of the history of Japan. The Internet is a useful tool to understand the big picture of this historical moment.The acting is top-notch and the cinematography in black and white is magnificent. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Not Available",False
20,8,"Eventually there is only one valid code of Honor, the Human one...",auberus,n/a,15/08/2025,"Masaki Kobayashi studied art and philosophy before starting as assistant director at Shochiku studio. His oeuvre is guided by the need to understand the human condition. In the 1962 Hara-kiri aka Seppuku, we can clearly see the philosophic influence in this story about confrontation between Human condition and Rigid Code of a feudal society. The result of this confrontation is a multi layered masterpiece in which the clarity of the script, the perfection of the interpretation, and a very well balanced ""mise en scène"" make for a powerful film based on transgression: a genre transgression, a code transgression and an image transgression.Most of Shambaras take place during the Edo Period but rather late in that period (just before the Meiji Era) as most filmmakers try to romanticize and glamorize the period which marks the end of the Samurai thus playing the nostalgia card. Here Masaki Kobayashi transgressed the genre and decided to film a story taking place in 1630, 17th century Japan during the Edo period. At that time Japan was ruled by a Shogunate (Ieyasu Tokugawa). The Tokugawa Shoguns established Peace and continued to rule Japan for a remarkable 250 years. But such a long period of Peace had a price and Ieyasu Tokugawa brought the whole country under tight control. He cleverly redistributed the land among the more loyal vassals, breaking up warrior clans thus throwing thousands of samurai into poverty.In the film an elder ronin, Hanshiro Tsugumo, the hypnotic Tatsuya Nakadai (Goyokin) seeks admittance to the house of a feudal lord to commit the act of Seppuku as he can no longer stand his Life of Dishonor and Poverty. There, the administrator tells him about the fate of a young Samurai who committed the same suicidal ritual few times ago. But there is much more to this story and soon we understand that all protagonists are related one way or another. As the film progresses we witness a confrontation between two conceptions. One is based on a Human code; the other is based on a rigid traditional one.Masaki Kobayashi uses both symbols and raw images to show this confrontation. The film starts with the Display of a Samurai shining battle armor representing the feudal system. The armor is empty of anything human and strongly symbolized the feudal system. Can a code make sense if it is followed without acknowledging the Human condition? This is in essence the question raised by ""Hara-kiri"". We see this armor soiled and dragged but at the end of the film the armor remains intact as if nothing had ever happened, as if changes in an given Society take some times to occur. Indeed social Progress has always been slow leaving Men and Women struggling with their condition.The suicidal ritual, Hara-kiri reinforced the sense of cruelty. Raw images of Ronin opening their stomach with a sword were a transgression at that time (1962), still is today. In the film the ritual is portrayed in a non glamorized way and very realistically. It also symbolizes even for the Japanese audience the lack of sense in the act of Seppuku. In fact Hanshiro Tsugumo is the only one giving meaning to this act by motivating it with mixed feelings of Love, Revenge and Sorrow, in short with humanity.With the film Hara-kiri, Masaki Kobayashi signed one of the greatest philosophical films. The script by Shinobu Hashimoto is a good example on how to make a story clear but more importantly sufficient enough for anybody to understand the drama, in one word universal. Also writer of Jôi-uchi: Hairyô tsuma shimatsu aka Samurai Rebellion (1967), Dai-bosatsu tôge (1966) aka Sword of Doom or ""Hitokiri"" aka Tenchu (1969), Shinobu Hashimoto is among the greatest writers of the 7th Art.I can not recommend Seppuku enough, every single frame, acting, piece of music is irreproachable. The story is profoundly Humanist, timeless and universal. I suggest we all confront the codes of our respective societies in order to find out if they still make sense or if they are leading us towards a terrible social Hara-kiri",False
21,10,Exceeded expectations! Near perfect! Better than every Kurosawa film,cwkenreich,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHarakiri is an outsatanding and underrated Japanese masterpiece. It seems to be heavily overshadowed by so-called magnum opuses like seven samurai. However, this samurai film was truly incredible in almost every way. The visuals and the themes complimented each other perfectly. It really shed light on the samurai experience like no film before and subverts expectations with regards to numerous samurai cliches.The recurring mood of this movie is deceitful. Nothing should be interpreted at face value. Our protagonist Tsugumo enters seemingly disturbing the peace at the honorable House of Iyi. He even wears a dark outfit, deceiving one into thinking that he is evil in nature. One would expect that Tsugumo would promptly carry out his ""wish"" of dying honorably. Given that we know nothing about him and that the camera often keeps physical distance from him, he initially does not evoke pity. However he repeatedly prolongs the ritual, much to the annoyance of Sennukko. And Tsugumo finally tells his grand tale which subverts all of our expectations. It's revealed that he is the victim of corrupt government policies initiated by indifferent upper-class elites. He is really out to vent his grievances in front members of the elite.But the film doesn't stop there. Part of its magic was just truly how unpredictable it was. Not only was Tsugumo lying in his intentions, he revealed that three of his proposed ""seconds"" to his harakiri were not sick at all, but could not face the humiliation of losing their buns. The final lines in the film in which sennukko orders the events of the film to be whitewashed to preserve the House's dignity, accentuates the theme of subversion. This is supported when the camera cuts at some of the most climactic moments. While not my original observation, I'd like to echo other reviews in acknowledging how in every death or samurai battle, we never actually see anyone die, or have their hair cut off. It's as if the audience is denied the convenience of being eyewitnesses and instead must accept Sennukko's words with submission.I've read how this film, while taking place in the 17th century, has striking parallels to Japanese institutions during WWII, however I admit to being no aficionado on Japanese history.This was my interpretation of the film. Samurais are often depicted as saviors and honorable warriors (ahem all of kurosawa's films), but this interpretation of them has to be the most pitiful and revealing.In terms of entertainment value, this film was easily 10/10. We grow intrigued as our bereaved protagonist asks to commit ritual suicide after facing poverty. We then have to witness the cringy demise of one previous man named Chijiwa. As we are awaiting Tsugumo to succumb to the same fate, he creates tension by interrupting the procedure with his own anecdotes, where we learn an emotional backstory surrounding the loss of his job and ALL of his immediate family. As if this weren't intriguing enough, the suspense is cranked up when Tsugumo reveals how he retrieved the hair buns and preaches about the evil workings of the ruling class. The ending is a well earned and a well executed climax of realistic and authentic fight choreography for the time the film was made.Again, I don't know how historically accurate this film was and I'm certain many inevitably dismissed it as political propaganda, but the execution of this movie from a filmmaking standard was near meticulous in my opinion.Best Samurai film and probably the best foreign film I've ever seen! 10/10.",True
22,10,Masterpiece,42ndStreetMemories,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have seen 6,035 motion pictures in my life. I have seen many of these more than once. I am not boasting. Nor am I proud that not only have I spent so many years of my life in front of a flickering screen but that I actually know the number of films that I have seen.With that said, ""Seppuku"" (""Hara-kiri"") makes that whole trip worth while. For every hundred pieces of celluloid tripe you can be fortunate to find a diamond in the rough and for me that was my first experience with this Kobayashi masterpiece. Pure enjoyment, pure excitement.The film is brilliantly constructed and multi-layered in such a way that the film defies genre classification. To call it a ""samurai film"" is akin to categorizing ""Psycho"" as a murder mystery. ""Seppuku"" could easily slide into the mystery, suspense, drama, or western genres and feel right at home. Perhaps an eastern film noir, if you will.Kobayashi's telling of the tale incorporates elements of despair, tradition, fortitude, revenge but mostly love, pride and honor in a grand visual style.The story's setting, direction and Tatsuya Nakadai's strong performance invite the inevitable comparison to Kurosawa and his favorite samurai Toshiro Mifune. All are of such high merit that I would propose ignoring the temptation to compare and appreciate the genius involved in ""Seppuku"".For those who have not seen ""Seppuku"" of course I strongly recommend that you do so but I also suggest that you avoid reading any synopsis and take delight in watching the tale unfold.10/10 (and not too many of the 6,035 are 10's)",False
23,7,"Revenge, Redefinition and Ritual",KaceyLeggio,n/a,15/08/2025,"While ""Harakiri"" was not my first experience with Japanese history, culture or cinema, it was still an impacting and enlightening film. While ruthless in nature, ""Harakiri"" does a wonderful job in conveying the history of ancient Japan, samurais and the Bushido code. While some people's knowledge of samurais only extend as far as the Disney film, ""Mulan"", ""Harakiri"" sheds a great deal of light on the underlying meaning behind the truth, strength and honor of the code. With a protagonist that is both relentless and appealing, ""Harakiri"" delivers special performances all over the board. While it moves a bit slow, there is an undeniable enchantment about this film. The story, while heart-wrenching, is so well done that you come out of it rooting for more. It makes you question history and the way it's perceived, just as I'm sure Mr. Kobayashi intended. With engaging choreography and near-perfect consume and set design, ""Harakiri"" brings you to a place and time that you otherwise may not have known existed. Kobayashi does a wonderful job at conveying the internal struggle between all characters, men whom have an obligation to their families, and those who have one to their code. This film challenges all the elements of revenge, redefinition and ritual. A job very well done.",False
24,1,Overrated Samurai Snoozefest,danchappersreviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFrom its prolonged sequences to its tedious plot, Masaki Kobayashi's Harakiri manages to be an exercise in cinematic lethargy. How anyone can laud such a snooze fest is beyond comprehension. Some claim it's a classic; I say it's an excellent cure for insomnia.The pacing is an undeniable flaw in Harakiri. Some might argue that its deliberate pace allows for introspection and suspense-building. However, it often comes off as needlessly prolonged and tiresome. Scenes that could have been resolved swiftly linger, dragging the narrative down with them. In today's fast-paced cinematic environment, movies masterfully balance contemplation with brisk storytelling. Yet, Harakiri seems stubbornly anchored in a time-warp.The frequent pauses and prolonged silences, intended for dramatic effect, often turn into moments of distraction for the audience. This cinematic journey feels less like an exhilarating adventure and more like a tedious chore. Harakiri's characters lack the multi-dimensional depth one might expect from such a heralded film. Their motivations, desires, and fears appear superficial and, at times, even ambiguous. Such one-dimensional characterizations leave the audience yearning for more.Where are the arcs that challenge and transform these individuals? Movies thrive when characters undergo tangible growth or evolution, but such transformative arcs are glaringly absent here. Instead, we are presented with static figures who remain predictably stagnant throughout.Their predictability turns potentially intense scenes into monotonous exercises. One can often anticipate their every move and word, stripping the plot of any true suspense. The experience is reminiscent of watching paint dry-tediously drawn-out and devoid of any engaging surprises.Harakiri purports to delve into profound themes, suggesting a narrative depth that should captivate its audience. However, these attempts often come across as surface-level explorations rather than deep dives. Such cursory treatment belies the film's ambition, reducing its thematic elements to mere pretense. These shallow puddles, masquerading as profound depths, leave viewers unsatisfied and underwhelmed. Instead of drawing the audience into a thoughtful exploration of its themes, the film skirts around them. The result? A missed opportunity to truly resonate and leave a lasting impact.Kobayashi's intentions might have been to make a grand statement, a magnum opus of cinematic storytelling. However, his execution falls woefully short. The film's inability to deliver on its promise transforms it from a potential masterpiece into a glaring disappointment.In a nutshell, if you're in need of a good nap, Harakiri is the film for you. For those seeking entertainment and intrigue, look elsewhere. This film is the cinematic equivalent of a sleeping pill.",True
25,n/a,Layered Stories in Conflict,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis has to be the best movie I have seen in a while. Good luck to me that I would like to pass on to you.We have two warring narrators. The first begins the film as an entry in his journal as local governor of a wealthy country estate. The film is closed with him finishing his entry, some days later. This official narrative deviates from what we see at the end.His story: one, then a second unattached ronin appeal to commit suicide in their courtyard. The first of these it is plain is just looking to be paid to leave, but our narrator is very strict about cleaving to that ronin's story. If he says he wants to kill himself, well then he must. This poor man had sold his sword and was now carrying bamboo, and it is this that he was forced to use. The resulting death is disturbing.So midway in the film, we have a samurai who has suffered because he was forced to live his story, forced by the narrator-governor who we later watch not live the story he has created and instead change it to suit.Now along comes an older samurai with the same request. He is dealt with in the same manner, but insists on telling a story to the assembled household before killing himself. He tells an amazing story: a fall from grace of his master, the dissolution of the household, poverty. His frail daughter and her son lay dying without a few coins for a doctor.The man's son is his daughter's husband, and it is he that came and was forced to die. The wife and son do as well, shortly after. Details of that death were told by the governor to the elder samurai earlier, though known because of the mocking way the body was returned.Until now, we have a classic case of warring narrative. We have the captive audience assembled. One storyteller is an official, so much so that he controls the official version of the film's story. The other has power in his gritty, true story.That story, incidentally is very close to what I consider noir: a random innocent fellow is cast in circumstances that seem full of circumstance and accident. The events of his life are played out not as they would in real life but as they would in a fictional life in a story told by others.Truth versus power in a struggle for the story of the film, essentially a struggle for the allegiance of the outer audience: us.The two beings as they face off are perfect in small mannerisms belying tension.Then slowly, the governor's world explodes as we learn new bits of the elder ronin's story of recent events. Many die.We (the audience) and control of all the cinematic effects was won by the ronin. Our governor is seen at the end writing the official account to be seen by his master that for his safety eradicates all story on both sides. The main actor, the winner, features in some of Kurosawa's best work as well.",True

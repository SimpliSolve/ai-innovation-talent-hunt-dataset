1,10,Good documentary,kate_buckley,n/a,16/08/2025,Great documentary. I learned a lot about Derry and Irish history. Jamie is a great person to showcase Derry. I would definitely recommend to anyone interesting in learning more about this subject and any Derry Girls fans.,False
2,4,"One sided, not balanced at all",nikki2635,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhilst one would expect Jamie's views and experiences to be one sided growing up in the City of Derry, this very much felt like an anti British documentary that glossed over the thousands of deaths caused by Republicans to focus on the (admittedly horrendous) events of Bloody Sunday. It was almost as if this was to justify the campaign of terror the people of Northern Ireland experienced.This could have been much more balanced, visiting a band practice of a loyalist band was hardly a complete representation of the PUL community even if it touched on some of the difficulties they face.There was a certain ignorance displayed as well as lack of insight into the experiences of other communities.Growing up in 90s Northern Ireland as a Protestant who went to a mixed school and have best friends from both communities, I do not feel this documentary gave a fair representation of both communities,
It touched on Lyra McKee's murder but so briefly, almost as an after thought.My husband isn't from NI, i live on the mainland now. He has no interest in NI politics whatsoever and even he found it difficult to watch due to the one sided nature of the show.",True

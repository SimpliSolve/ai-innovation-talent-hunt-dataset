Seems when her father died it really caused a deep cut within her, the scene where she is crying at her fathers grave, like a young girl angry at her father for turning up late, it was the most gut-renching scene.The director eric anders, no good POS, shame hollywood allows the most wicked of us to succeed and continue working.Watch it to see a different side to chyna, not sure if the whole truth was told but seeing a portion of it.... truly makes me sad.It is not a scary world, it is people that are scary.",True

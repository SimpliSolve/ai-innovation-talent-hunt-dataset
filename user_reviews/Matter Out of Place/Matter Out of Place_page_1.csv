1,7,Liken to a YouTube satisfying compilation video. But full of rubbish.,gricey_sandgrounder,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerDocumentary films where it's more about observing rather than being told a story can be strangely satisfying.Great examples are Samsara, Bakara and Ascension. This particular one focuses on items that isn't a part of the natural environment around it. That mainly relates to, trash.It was both satisfying and unsatisfying to watch. How certain countries treat their surroundings, how they process their rubbish and how certain cleaning groups are helping their community.There was a great sense of scale throughout. Also, some of the locations choice gave a great variety in different climates approach collecting and dumping rubbish.I think they have gone a bit daring or extreme with the content as I know some areas are caring for their rubbish and controversial ways.But this was still a well balanced documentary that showed how not and how to treat your surrounding environment. While it may make you lose faith with humanity, it also gives you hope.Some content would also fit in nicely to those satisfying YouTube compilations.",True

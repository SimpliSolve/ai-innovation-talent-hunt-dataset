1,n/a,Last time watching it live,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Slogged through over 5 hours of this mess for about 90 minutes of good content. Aside from a few really great moments I feel exhausted and frustrated and pissed off that I wasted so much time watching this live.Highlights: tributes to Ozzy, Foreigner, Kool and the Gang.Low points: lots of off tune singing, terrible sound (broken microphone), people who can't read off cue cards, and worst of all some really REALLY long-winded endlessly tedious and boring speeches. Loved Ozzy calling them out. Unreal that anyone would think that a night celebrating so many artists is the right venue for them to get up a preach a sermon that lasts 30 minutes. Talk about sucking all the energy out of a room.Also, the show should have ended on a high note with the big energy fun and exciting tribute to Ozzy, not with the MOR ""jam band"" Dave Matthews. What was with them putting the DMB at the end? Save the mediocre for last? Something tells me that had more to do with Julia Roberts (or the ceremony producers) insisting she go last because she's such an A-list star. Reality check: This isn't 1990. She's not. *yawn*Overall, a really terrible idea to try to watch this live. Stick with the edited down replay, though I suspect that version will still have many of the same issues.",False

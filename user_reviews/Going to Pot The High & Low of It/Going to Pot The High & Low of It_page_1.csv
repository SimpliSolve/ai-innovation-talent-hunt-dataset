1,2,Couldn't even watch passed a few minutes,Soulmateswd,n/a,15/08/2025,"Here I am trying to enjoy a nice little documentary about pot while stoned, I couldn't do it. The graphics alone were too much for my brain and eyes to handle. Tone it down.",False
2,2,This had potential.. then didn't.,hessm-56824,n/a,15/08/2025,"This program started off pretty okay, but continued to get worse. A lot of the information is biased and/or not backed by evidence, which can lead to a lot of misconception. Also - animal testing? Really? The experiment they showed that was conducted on rats was unsettling to watch. Why are you fumigating tiny, wholesome, and intelligent rats? I wish this docu sounded less like it was narrated by a pot head, and rather more like a scientist or a doctor. I'm very pro-cannabis so I was hoping this would've been executed better, where it seemed reputable and accurate. There was some interesting knowledge they shared but again, was it true and accurate? Not sure..",False

1,7,Feature instead of Short,unknownduck,n/a,15/08/2025,"I would have liked to seen this as a much better funded feature length documentary instead of a thirty minute short. Elizabeth Epps deserves a tonne of credit and respect for what she has achieved, America needs more true hero's like her. The issues with America's policing and for-profit jailing are widespread, systemic and globally known, hopefully that will change one day but as a Canadian watching the USA gong show from afar, I highly doubt much change will come to a country so ingrained in politics, power, racism & outright hatred. I once wanted a Greencard, now I don't even want to visit.",False

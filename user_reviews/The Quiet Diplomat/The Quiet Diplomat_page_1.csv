1,10,Looking for example of inspiring leadership? Watch now.,SusanF-86,n/a,16/08/2025,"Given these days of unsettled times, this superb, poignant, and candid documentary tells the story about how a man shaped by war, became a man of peace with a genuine belief in collective action and global transformation. His secret sauce: strong values, unwavering commitment, quiet diplomacy, multilateral approach and focus on the most vulnerable (those often left out of the decision making tables and most impacted). Lots to reflect on here in terms of what each of us can do to make a difference -- in big and small ways. His life and leadership has been focused on enriching others and not himself -- serving as a beacon of light for others to follow. Thank you SG Ban!",False

4,10,Keep believing,imdbfan-2224976,n/a,16/08/2025,"Through the extraordinary journey of its former head, a Child of War forged into a Man of Peace, this documentary powerfully illuminates the United Nations' unyielding dedication to peace, human rights, and development.It offers a compelling reason to keep believing in collective action, especially when global unity and progress face unprecedented peril.",False
5,10,Wonderful and Enjoyable!,PaulM-6257,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched it without expecting much and knowing very little, but really enjoyed it. It clearly showed what the UN does and how Ban Ki-moon handled global crises. Even without much background in international politics, I found the complex issues easy to follow. I came away with a better understanding of global leadership and diplomacy.",False
6,10,"A Gentle Face, a Global Impact.",GoldenSKY-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ban Ki-moon may look like a gentle grandfather at a glance-but as The Quiet Diplomat shows, he is a remarkable leader who has dedicated his life to humanity with quiet strength and decisive leadership. It's truly awe-inspiring to see someone so warm-hearted take on such global responsibility with courage and grace.You can tell how exceptional his character is just by his constant gentle smile and the calm, approachable presence he brings-and by how much the people around him clearly admire and respect him. One interview in the film stood out to me: he humorously said he didn't agree to this documentary to win an Oscar, but to show how hard the people at the UN work for the world and for humanity. That alone reveals his sincerity and sense of purpose.This documentary reminded me that true leadership doesn't shout-it shines quietly, with integrity and heart. Ban is deeply humble, and because his leadership is never loud or self-promoting, many people may not fully recognize the scale of his achievements. I hope more people come to appreciate the depth of his contributions and the values he represents.",False
7,10,"""There is no plan B, because there is no planet B!""",imdbfan-190664,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Quiet Diplomat left a deep impression on me. Watching Ban Ki-moon's quiet yet determined leadership reminded me that diplomacy doesn't have to be loud to be powerful. His personal journey-from a boy saved by the UN during the Korean War to becoming its Secretary-General-was both humbling and inspiring.I was especially moved by how he stayed true to his values even when facing global crises and political pushback. The film made me reflect on the importance of multilateral cooperation in today's fragmented world. Ban's story gave me hope that empathy, persistence, and humility still have a place in international leadership. It's a powerful reminder that meaningful change often begins with quiet conviction.What struck me the most was his willingness to personally visit conflict zones, even when it was dangerous. By doing so, he gave a voice to countries in crisis-not with noise, but with presence. Unlike many politicians who shy away from risk, Ban chose to stand with vulnerable communities. I was also touched by how genuinely humble and kind he is toward those around him. His warmth, integrity, and quiet strength made me rethink what true leadership looks like.",False
8,9,Now more than ever... a film to be seen,BruceD1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sadly, the constant drumbeat of wars, famines and other global crises often leave us feeling exasperated and helpless.But in this sometimes sobering, often uplifting, and always thought-provoking film, we root for a man who give us hope.Ban Ki-moon's rise from near starvation as a boy during the Korean War to lead the United Nations as Secretary General serves as an inspiration to us all in his ""quiet"" way.

13,10,Champion of gender and climate,AshokP-22,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie was highly inspiring.

If you're into international relations or just want to understand how big global milestones like the Paris Climate Agreement came together, this is a must-watch.SG Ban doesn't seek the spotlight, but his self-effacing and steady leadership has clearly left a positive impact and legacy.

His balanced, humble, gentle ways through hurricanes, wars and judgmental media attacks.

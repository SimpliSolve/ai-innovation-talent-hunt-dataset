1,9,Indispensable for the preservation of Brazil's political memory,carllozhenrique,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although the coup d'état is an event that took place six years ago, its effects are still deeply felt by Brazilian democracy. However, the very narrative about the event is still a subject of hermeneutical dispute in the Brazilian public sphere and this prevents the correct diagnosis of its institutional consequences. Just as the memory of the military dictatorship's crimes is very little remembered or discussed, which allows its ills to return as unexorcised ghosts, most of Brazilian society does not even realize that it lost an important part of its own sovereignty with a coup that overthrew the former President Dilma Rousseff. As the news outlets and the justice system were associated in this campaign of institutional destabilization, as they were in the 1964 coup, they will hardly recognize the crime even with all their fingerprints on the scene. That's why the film by Victor Fraga and Valnei Nunes plays a role not only as a work of creation, but also as a historical document for the country's memory.",False
2,10,Fundamental,izarodrigues-33568,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must-see movie, that reveals how devilishly a government was overthrown in Brazil.An unmissable film, which reveals how diabolically the government was overthrown in Brazil. With a clear, direct dialogue that is alarming because it unmasks important institutions and public figures. Also, gains strength with a bias of standing applause!With a realistic approach and with a fundamental guideline for the understanding of history, political events and their impacts and consequences on the lives of many people. A film that marks a story of corruption and revels relentlessly never to happen again: as a cry for help against brainwashing!",False
3,8,Probing documentary,eoghanlyng,n/a,16/08/2025,"For many of us here in the West, this film will serve as a strong document about what occurs Brazil. And with the recent election of Lula, the film is even more necessary, as it allows the viewers to engage with the local citizens, eyeing their interests in a style that is taut, intelligent, and deeply lyrical. Best of all, the film boasts a sultry vocal interpolation from co-director Victor Fraga, who smoulders through scene after scene to come up with an engaging narrative style that recalls the voiceovers of Terry Wogan. Only time will tell if this veers beyond the festival circuit, but it's definitely deserving of a wide viewership.",False
4,10,Powerful. Epic.,PatriciaGomes7,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most important documentaries that has bren produced to highlight a coup against a fragile Brazilian democracy.It is impossible to deny history and the facts. Essential watch this courageous documentary to understand the democracy in Brazil and beyound.The documentary reveals how the media and right-wing party deposed the first woman elected in Brazil, Dilma Rouseff (Labours party) during her second presidential term.The coup d'état took place six years ago, but it is clearly how the coup still reflects in all sections on Brazilian society today.Again: Powerful. Epic documentary. Must watch it.",False
5,9,Brazil is not for amateurs,postmaysa,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary The Coup d'Etat Factory explains the recent political history in Brazil, comparing it with its violent and turbulent XX century events.More than a collection of testimonials, directors Victor Fraga and Valnei Nunes sew a thread of surreal facts in Brazilian current affairs into a patchwork. It's difficult to explain the unexplainable. But this documentary succeeds in chasing the truth -- the playful truth that likes to hide itself.Brazil's complexities and plurality do not show off only in music, arts and sports, but they reveal themselves in daily life. Hence it is quite complicated to understand how Dilma was impeached, why Lula was imprisioned and why the extreme right-wing ""suddenly"" became so powerful.The power of TV Globo is as strong as Fox News in the United States, with the difference that there is no other TV channel as broadly watched as TV Globo. 29% of Brazilians are functional illiterate. The majority of the population watch TV Globo newshows without comparing it without any other medium. But most recently, Brazilians have been infuenced by fake news to a degree that it is difficult to verify what is really true.If The Capture (BBC show) is still fictional, and deepfakes of politicians were not yet detected in British politics, in the Coup d'Etat Factory the Fake is alive. It is devouring Brazilian people.A copy of The Coup d'Etat Factory should be sent to cinemateques all over the world. It is crucial that Brazilian history ceases to be erased.The effects of such a dominant.",False
6,9,The birth of fake news,paolinha-28516,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows how media manipulates the public opinion through what we now call fake new. Victor Braga wrote an extraordinary didactic script. It's one of those documentaries that succeed to point it out ugly sides of power and society with elegance.He himself is the narrador. His narrative is clean, sharp, ironic, delightful. His regional accent adds an extra charm as he comes from the most lucid region of Brazil, NE. NE didn't fall into any fake new whatsoever about Lula for instance and gave the most votes against fascism at our President election 2022.Fundamental movie to understand why Brazil has such a fragile democracy.",False
7,10,"Powerful, important truths about Brazil - with relevance worldwide",souvenir-96897,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you DO already know the grim story that the journalist/directors are telling about how big media and elites conspired to crush democracy in Brazil, you'll know just how important, courageous and necessary this documentary is. And if you DON'T already know the story, it's high time you did, especially if you want to know why Lula's electoral victory and vindication in 2022 is so important - and so hard-won. This is a clear, well-made and intelligent documentary that does what all good journalism should do: fearlessly ask questions and look past accepted narratives to find the real story, and in doing so, serve society by holding the powerful to account. This is a film about what happened in Brazil - but it's very clear that there are similar stories to tell about a lot of other countries, too. Kudos to.",False
8,10,The media's influence on political upheaval in Brazil,werner41,n/a,16/08/2025,"A must-see film to understand Brazilian society and its contradictions. The film is engaging and depicts, with impressive accuracy, the dangerous dark clouds of fascism coming not only in Brazil but all over the world.Directors Victor Fraga and Valnei Nunes have done a great job exposing the media's influence on political upheaval in Brazil. Firstly they focus on the role of TV Globo, the most important TV channel in Brazil, owned by the late media mogul Roberto Marinho and his family, playing in supporting and influencing the coup d'état of 1964 that led to the overthrow of President João Goulart by members of the Brazilian Armed Forces, with the backing of the United States government. They expand this disturbing narrative to encompass the more recent coup d'état which led to the overthrow of Lula's political successor Dilma Rouseff in 2006.",False
9,10,Very important film,dk_matanuki,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed watching this movie. Very important! And could not come at greater poignant time. I was unaware of Brazils political structures and fundamental corruption caused by the right wing, almost fascist ideology of Bolsanaro. As I write this, even now similar scenarios of Trump throwing his toys out of the pram when America finally voted against him are line to Bolsanario.. One could say Trump is a saint in comparison.. Well, at least Lula is back! Hope for the Brazilian population that peace can be restored, away from a government injecting ideas of violence and hatred toward it's own people.",False
10,10,A must see,lidiopsneto,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being Brazilian, I'm well aware of how our mainstream press work, and even though, those tactics are not only restricted to the Brazilian press, you only need to go back a few years and see how the British press, which is supposed to be impartial and a public service, clearly supported one candidate to the detriment of the other. But not wanting to digress too far, A Fantástica Fábrica de Golpes, is a smart and well researched documentary, showing the inner works of Brazilian press and their disregard for fairness, truth and democracy. A must see to all those who care for those principles and even those who don't.",False
11,10,A must see,dialterats,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary that denounces what the TV Globo machine can destroy in its eagerness to control the course of the country. One of the most important documentaries in the recent history of Brazil.It is a film that reflects the moment we live in, that of the power of certain media outlets where democratic values are corrupted and destroyed. And, that factory of coups called Globo that sought to defend the dark interests of the ""elite"".This documentary allows us to reflect on how the backstage of power works to manipulate, control and change the course of history.Interviews with great personalities from the recent history of Brazil, people who have lived through other coups and their perspectives on this assault on Brazilian democracy. A must see.",False
12,10,How does an aggregate Media powehouse control a country!!!,li0904426,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary ""The Coup d'Etat Factory"" reveals how a powerful media conglomerate ""Globo"" with the help of corrupt businessmen and the US builds, destroys, and manipulates Brazilian politics for many decades. It is fascinating to watch and at the same time to be disgusted how Grupo Globo, the largest communication network in South America that includes television, newspaper, magazine, books, stream, and music record label collaborated with the Brazilian military regime in the 60s and 70 and more recently with the coup d'état in the government of President Dilma Rousset.This documentary is very important, and it should be watched by everyone to understand the current far-right movement of Trump, Italian Giorgia Meloni, Polish Mateusz Morawiecki, Brazilian Bossonaro, Sweeden Ulf Kristersson. Media in general is helping Fascism and Nazism feelings to return in the name of the motto ""God, Country and Family""",False

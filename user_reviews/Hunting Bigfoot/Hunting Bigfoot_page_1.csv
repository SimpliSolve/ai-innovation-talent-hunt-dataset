1,7,This is NOT a documentary,beefwellington-59883,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to admit. I went into this thinking it was a documentary about Bigfoot and soon realized it w snore about the psychology of those that perused them; then only to find out it is a work of fiction. Excerpt from the Snowqualmie Valley Record paper: or his current project, Guterson describes the film as neither a documentary nor a completely fictional work, but a blur between the two. He said one of the goals of the film was to make it feel natural and authentic.""I'm proud of how real this one feels,"" Guterson said. ""Some people have seen it and thought it was just a documentary, and that's really gratifying to me.""",True
2,6,A real documentary. Read the critics reviews.,frankblack-79961,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I'm not a believer in this subject (not a skeptic either) but, I do find cryptozoology fascinating. This doc is more about the man Mr Green, and the phenomenon of the Sasquatch hunter. It's pretty hard to watch this kind of obsession and what it can do to some folks. Also, this other reviewer (only other one at the time of my submission) claims this is fake. It is not. These events did happen from what I've read in online news articles. The one thing I did find very interesting was the find they make and the DNA implications. Anyone who has half a brain knows that unknown species of zoological varieties are still discovered all the time. To shut out all possibilities in these regards is just ignorant. I would recommend this documentary. Interesting human drama with cryptozoology as a backdrop.",False
3,7,"Mockumentary, but still worth a watch.",steveo-26107,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI went in to this completely oblivious to the fact that it wasn't an actual documentary. Normally Bigfoot documentaries are pretty lame, and full of cheese, but I still watch them because ""I want to believe."" When this one was over I told my wife it was probably the best Bigfoot documentary I'd ever seen...Then I found out it wasn't real, but that's okay. It was very believable to me, and a very enjoyable watch. It basically tracks an aging widower as he descends deep into isolation in his pursuit of a primate. If you want a true documentary, this isn't what you want.However, if you enjoy the subject of Bigfoot, and the people who search for them, I think that Hunting Bigfoot is absolutely worth the watch. It's a sad, and lonely story that was shot very well, and acted incredibly well. Would love to see more stuff from the director, and things in this vein!Also, can we get John Green's workout regime? Dude's built like a Sasquatch!",True
4,6,A well done snapshot in time,davidconant-46608,n/a,16/08/2025,"For me, no not a documentary, even by definition. This is a very well done 87 minute reality film.The film is about John Green and his very good friends, who are there for him unconditionally. John has endured many hardships in his life. Once a multi millionaire business owner, now broke, the loss of his wife and now based on what i have read, the loss of his daughter.John has an obsession, Big Foot. He spends most of his time treking the Pacific North West, looking to get his 2nd glimpse at the elusive cryptid. Estranged from his family, his obsession, some feel John has a problem. Well as you watch this, you at first feel sorry for him, but later realize he is living his life as he wants, the way you wished you could.This film talks of Big Foot, but its more about humanity and tolerance. How many of us have friends like his? How many of us do exactly what we love every day? How many of us have the huge house, cars, great vacations but just really arent happy or satisfied at all, but the guy in the tent looking for Big Foot is.I didnt know what to expect when i started to watch this, but for me it was a reminder about the quality of our lives. Wealth can be measured in many ways, and i bet very few of us have as many happy moments as John Green.",False
5,2,Quite Disappointing,wandernn1-81-683274,n/a,16/08/2025,"So apparently this is a fakeumentary. A made up story about a Bigfoot Hunter that spends way too much time in the Woods, looking for Bigfoot. But none of it is true.The movie spends way too much time talking about the Hunter, and not actually Hunting Bigfoot. With about 30 min left they finally are out in the woods. Jumping around. And that part is very short and we're back to the made up story about the 'hunter' again.Now if this was a true story it might be more appealing, but it's a made up story and really has nothing to do with actual Bigfoot Hunting. It's really Quite Disappointing.2/10.",False
6,1,Horrible in Every Way.,JDahlNV,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNaked old guy washing his junk in the river, swimming naked in the river... and we want to see this why? We don't. This was the most misleading, seriously AWFUL piece of crap ever produced for TV. It has nothing to do with Bigfoot other than this man's fascination with him. There is no real evidence, just some old, whacked out man running around naked in the woods who can produce no real Bigfoot hair samples -- he carries around an empty plastic bag and says, ""oh I don't know what happened to it, the hair used to be in here. I must have lost it."" There are no footprints, no photographs, nothing to substantiate anything about the existence of Bigfoot. How did this ever end up on TV? At best it should be on a YouTube channel and it should be explained up front that you will see nothing but bad family home movies and a man with dementia living in the woods who is obsessed with Bigfoot. Misleading in every way and not worth a second of anyone's time.",True
7,8,"An interesting look at ""Bigfoot Obsessives""",jordanomiller,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI watched this at Cinequest Online--not recommended for someone who wants a traditional Bigfoot horror flick but rather a psychological study of a BF obsessive mocked by his friends but who gets vindicated at the end.,True
8,4,Confusingly NOT real documentary,sweetnsexyfeetu,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I do appreciate the documentary film style, I think it's super misleading to claim something is a documentary when it is fiction. It had me going and almost laughing at certain points but long story short, I wish I had the last 2 hrs of my life back.All details proving this is FARSE is easily found. Why I cannot post links here. You may search ""valley record snoqualmie resident produces new Bigfoot movie"" and read the film producers own words that it was acting/actors.Also, alarmingly, discovered the actress (yes actress not actual daughter) who played John's daughter was possibly murdered?",False
9,8,Not a fakeumentary,jeffthinknot,n/a,16/08/2025,"The ""Featured Review"" indicated that this was a ""fakeumentary - a made up story about a Bigfoot Hunter""This is incorrect. John is indeed a real person and his life and obsession with Bigfoot has been accurately captured in this film.The film is more about the man (John Green) and how he ended up in this quest to prove to himself that these creatures exist...and less about the beast itself.There were aspects of the story that could have been elaborated on and expended. The lost connection with his family is one of them.I found it entertaining and a wonderful vacation from the normality of most documentaries.",False

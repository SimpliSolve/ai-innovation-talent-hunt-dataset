1,5,Love Rats ( Netflix 2024),gurumaggie,n/a,16/08/2025,"One question keeps booming in my head why would you give money to someone you didn't know?These women are sad and lonely and I still am questioning why they gave these guys money, if a child made up some of these stories you'd punish them for lying so how can an adult fall for it?1) he works for a secret organisation/army/oil rig2) he has an inheritance/ wound up a business/messy divorce3) why don't they do simple detective work, reverse image search, check facts? One woman actually said it's only money, I'm flabbergasted.4) if they did something positive to stop it happening to other people that would be just great and a worthwhile ending.",False
2,2,Interesting stories packaged in unwatchable trash,Flashroxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like the lowest standard of 90's documentaries, edited in a style in line with a trashy reality show.Started the first episode with two older gentleman being scammed by an online ""catfish"". The show very quickly becomes unwatchable.Over the top editing and a musical score like something out of a straight to video horror movie, the cringe is overload. Even the lead detective feels like an actress, for all the talk of scam artists, I felt like I was being conned watching it. You get a more authentic experience from daytime tv shows about nightmare neighbours on channel 5. Really disappointing as the standard for documentaries on Netflix is normally of a much higher caliber.Awful. Couldn't finish one episode.",False
3,10,Must watch for people seeking love online.,bilmw,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is compulsive viewing for anyone as it demonstrates the power of online dating at its worst. Binge viewing of incomprehensible situations people get themselves into with very costly outcomes. Truly shocking warning for everyone in the age of cyber crime and scammers.Should be on main stream media. Seemingly decent people wanting to dip their toe in the water and relentlessly scammed of money despite friends and family having concerns about their behaviour and devotion to online, unknown and palpable sharks. Across the board methods of divesting vulnerable people from hard earned money.Not an easy watch. If it seems too good to be true, it sometimes is.",False
4,1,Fake documentary!,tjharwood-21892,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please don't waste your time watching this. It's all fake. The police are actors and actresses and there are fake acted voiced interrogations with no video. It's awful. It's so ironically fake. The 'policewoman' in the first episode is laughable, looking very seriously at paperwork on her desk. Netflix please remove this tripe, you're also conning people. Absolute rubbish. Watch worst ex ever or worst roommate ever, they are much much better, there we are netfilx I'm.doing you a favour. Actually it was all quite interesting until the fake police officers came along so maybe watch it for 25 mins then give it up. I do feel conned.",False

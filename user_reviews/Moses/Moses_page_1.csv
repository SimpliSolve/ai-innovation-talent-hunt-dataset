1,9,The Power of Redemption,msoren-78084,n/a,15/08/2025,"Francisco Guijarro's ""Moses"" is hands down, the best film about homelessness I have ever seen. Pursuing his subject, Moses, for over 14 years, Guijarro paints a heartbreakingly
compassionate portrait of a man broken by addiction but never without hope and joy. Moses' humanity will make you think twice about your next interaction with a homeless person. His charisma and dignity steal the show and Guijarro's gentle presence in the film is rarely seen but always felt. Moses the film is a labor of love that has it all. Not only the rise and fall, but the slow hard work of forgiveness and redemption. Bravo!!!",False
2,10,Deeply moving,Faribafaiz007,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rediscovering Humanity: A Journey Through MosesMoses is a powerful, moving documentary capturing the journey of a musician who, after a promising career derailed by addiction, spent two decades homeless on San Francisco's streets. Directed by Francisco Guijarro, the film highlights Moses's rare gift for connecting with strangers, turning brief interactions into moments of recognition and visibility. When a student filmmaker offers him the lead role in a short film, Moses embarks on a path of rediscovery, reconnecting with his music, past, and sense of self. Filmed over 15 years, Moses is a testament to resilience, human connection, and transformative power of truly being seen.",False
3,10,A major life experience,mjstone-92213,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw this film as part of the 27th United Nations Association International Film Festival in San Francisco, at a sold-out screening. I got to meet a few of the people who participated in the film, friends and family of the film's subject, which made it an especially poignant experience. However, I feel that anyone who sees this movie will come away having learned important things, not just about homelessness and addiction, but also about humanity in general. This is an incredibly beautiful story; harrowing at times, but filled with lovely arcs and resolutions, lovingly and compassionately recorded and shared by Guijarro. If you loved the character of ""Bubs"" on ""The Wire"", you will appreciate meeting and spending time with Moses.",False
4,10,An unforgettable story,stephaniefliu,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's not every day that you get to witness someone's journey across 15 years, especially when that someone is as unforgettable as Moses. This film broke my heart and put it back together again. Hopeful, inspiring and deeply felt, I found myself in awe of the narrative's twists and turns, as well as its refreshingly inventive moments - fictionalized scenes and musical performances are artfully woven into the storyline, creating a sense of connection and hope that lingers with me still. This film is a testament to resilience and a reminder of how the process of filmmaking itself can be a conduit for healing and transformation.",False
5,10,Masterpiece,szymonklopocki,n/a,15/08/2025,"Moses is a deeply moving documentary and a fascinating story of human nature. It's beauty and complexity. Moses proves that humans can shine in the darkest places and when life hits hardest. Great pictures and music. Well paced storyline and unexpected turns of events keep you engaged. Overall a very satisfying experience for the eyes, ears, mind and heart. Watching all this as a documentary and knowing it actually happened and is part of San Francisco's every day life makes it even more impactful and interesting. You will cry and you will laugh too. You'll walk away a better human afterwards.",False
6,10,"Surprising, compassionate, & hopeful",eric-35480,n/a,15/08/2025,"The problem with so many films focused on issues of homelessness and struggles with substance abuse is the degree to which they flatten the characters into servants of social messaging. If you think you know what this film is about based on brief descriptions, prepare to be surprised.When you meet Moses and the people in his life, you're given the opportunity to experience the full spectrum of humanity. It does not preach and it does not pull its punches. The film is a continuous unfolding, defying traditional narratives of suffering and redemption.Add to this it's beautifully shot and edited, and captures San Francisco and the Bay Area as it has changed over time. Through Moses' eyes, you might just the city in a new way.",False
7,10,Eye-opening film,chepopeye,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched Moses at the UN International Film Festival in San Francisco, and I must say it completely changed my view on the city and the people in it. In my opinion, it's a film that just sticks with you... not because it's trying to be dramatic, but because it's a real life being shown.Fran does an incredible job of telling Alvin's story with so much honesty and heart. The film doesn't just 'document' his day to day life... it introduces you to the true reality of it, showing his struggles, regrets, and hope in a very personal way - unlike anything I've seen before. This movie is not just about the hardship some people endure, but about the hope of love! The real possibility of redemption and love, even when it feels like life has passed.I can't recommend Moses enough. It's not just a great documentary but for me it's a reminder of hope and the fact that 'not all is lost'.",False
8,10,A unique and radically compassionate movie,imdb-q,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw this film as part of the 27th United Nations Association International Film Festival in SF. The screening was sold out, so I was fortunate to get to see it.This movie is many things -- it is the story of a film maker who in recording his subject, changed his subject's trajectory. It is the story of a musician who became a homeless drug addict -- a kind of person who all too often tends to be viewed as less than human -- viewed through an entirely human and compassionate lens. It is the kind of story humanity needs more of honestly. The ending feels miraculous.Mini rant here: homelessness is a manufactured problem. It doesn't have to be this way.",False
9,10,Unlikely Angels,JavierE-46,n/a,15/08/2025,"A young graduate begins a short film that, unwittingly, Will forever change both his life and that of a homeless man.We often speak at length about all the things we would do to help others-but in the end, we do nothing. It's all empty words and superficial gestures.This film is the complete opposite. It stands as an unwavering act of compassion: one person helping another who is wounded and lost. But that help doesn't disappear into the void- It is received, embraces, and returned with LOVE and GRATITUDE.This work is a tangible example of what the most noble people throughout history have done. They all shared the same purpose: to serve others with LOVE.",False

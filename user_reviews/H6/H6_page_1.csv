1,10,A look of humanity and philosophy of life,changichieh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen this movie in Paris on 2nd February 2022, with a following debate, between the director Ye Ye and a political professor of Chinese studies from Inalco. The film is great, 10/10. It's impressive, touching, and funny. Sure, it's not perfect, but the feelings are absolutely real, and the problems it reflects for the China today are authentic.There are perhaps some problems of the medical system or even unspoken issues of political environment, but this movie remains neutral and just presents the reality. As a former medical student at this very H6, I validate all the efforts the director put to protect this authenticity.At the Q&A section, one psychiatrist pointed out that the position of Ye Ye to document this film is actually the same as the position of nurses or care workers in this hospital. I totally agreed. Her camera gives a look of humanity. I recommend this film to all my colleagues and friends the next day. I hope you would like it too.",False

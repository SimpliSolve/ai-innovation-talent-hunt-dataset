1,9,I've been waiting for the opportunity to see the streaming,awvknj,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was not disappointed it's not a perfect film, but it was one that George was working on himself and didn't get to finish so bearing that in mind, I preferred to see this documentary as an opportunity to celebrate the incredible talent and resilience of this beautiful man with all his faults And struggles. Would I like more in-depth controversial coverage of who he really was? Of course, but this was a wonderful celebration of his life and music and the impact that he did have as he continued to grow as a human being. So heartbreaking that he left us so soon -he had so much to offer through his songwriting, but I believe his heart just could not take the pain of living in this world feeling as intensely as he did The film totally ignored any addiction references so that was the untold part that might've been had he been able to find recovery and a new way to process and live his life and express his art- rest in peace, George Michael I love your music
and I'm grateful for the legacy you left us. Still Praying for time...",True

3,8,Very good documentary,lisafordeay,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerFreedom Uncut is an extended documentary based on George Micheal and his career from after Wham. The whole documentary contains unseen footage including some of his memorable hits from Everything She Wants to Careless Whisper to outside his music career including his former lover Fasimo who tragically passed away from HIV back in the 90s.I've always been a die hard fan of George Micheal since I was born in the 90s as my mom would listen to him 24/7 on TV back in the day and I became an instant fan the older I got. It was a real tragedy that George passed away on Christmas Day in 2016 from heart failure. If you are a fan of George's do check this one out. It's actually better than the Wham documentary on Netflix.Rest easy George. Gone but never forgotten.,True
4,10,I laughed and sobbed,peanutclairebailey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh precious George. I absolutely adore George Michael. My sister had his albums and I used to enjoy them as a child in the 90s. As an adult I've become quite a fan. I've been lucky enough to see George live and up close. Witnessing George sing 'Praying for Time' with a rising sun behind him; a favourite memory of mine.I'm so grateful he created this work. I enjoyed it so much, although I could hear a distinct change in his narration. His voice somehow different. I do wonder how he felt in the months before he passed. I hope he was okay.I was sad to learn of such pain and suffering, especially when he sang the tribute to Freddie Mercury. What a terrible loss George endured.I was waiting for this documentary to cover his later days. The dark days. It didn't. I'm so glad. It was a beautiful tribute to a truly beautiful man.We love you George. I remember you as an amazing singer, songwriter and incredible human being.",False
5,10,Lovely and devastating,angeladee1,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fantastic and respectful invitation into the heart of a very private man. Some of the reviews here are weirdly negative, and I don't think the film deserves that. So I want to counter them with an urge that you watch.I loved George Michael (as a Brit I concur with James Corden's statement that GM was woven into the fabric of UK life for those of us who grew up there in the 80s and 90s) and know all his music so well. So of course it was hard not to sing and dance along! I appreciate the focus on the music, the life behind the songwriting, and the sensitivity and humor the filmmakers lent to the overall.It's a love story, a legacy film to a man who brought so much joy to the world.",False
6,10,We Are Reminded,VanBooter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic documentary and it's been a long time waiting for one which would blow my socks off, yet even though I was glued to the screen it left me feeling sad at the end.Same happened when I watched tributes to Freddie Mercury, David Bowie and a host of others. Watching this reminds us of what we no longer have.It's not one of those cheap documentaries which grabs photo's from the interweb and mixes in commentaries from unknowns, its one done ""in the best possible taste"" and one you will want to watch again. Loved it.",False
7,10,A Masterpiece About A Master Star,rkeilitz-19-537915,n/a,16/08/2025,"A chronicle of the tumultuous - yet creatively fruitful - period of Michael's life and career following the release of his 1987 solo debut, 'Faith', then through the creation and release of his 1990 follow-up 'Listen Without Prejudice, Vol.1'.The film features George's incredible, unseen archival and private home footage, giving viewers a first-person account of this dramatic period in his life, revealing how he became one of the most influential recording artists of all time, who alone fought a corner for all artists by challenging the standard recording contract helping to rewrite the rules of the music industry. He talks about why he stepped out of the limelight and turned his back on celebrity.A cast of celebs who worked with him just shows you how respected he was in the industry. The feature documentary includes the original five supermodels from Oscar¬Æ-nominated director David Fincher's ""Freedom! '90"" video - Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Tatjana Patitz and Linda Evangelista - who come together for the first time to discuss their experience on the iconic music video. The film also features interviews with some of Michael's most famous friends and music legends, including Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Ricky Gervais, Nile Rodgers, Mark Ronson, Tracey Emin, Liam Gallagher, Mary J. Blige, Jean Paul Gaultier, James Corden and Tony Bennett.",False
8,10,Amazing,leahoster,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI loved this documentary so much! It gave amazing insight into George's life... I wish I could've watched it in theaters a ton more times. I loved George's humor. It had a lot of footage from behind the scenes of George's performances.I journaled everything that happened throughout the movie.. there was quite a bit of home video too. Andrew wasn't interviewed, I was hoping he would've been and in the movie. There also wasn't much input from those who worked with him (like his band), which I would've enjoyed.There was quite a bit of language throughout the movie, one person in particular kept using the f word a lot.",True
9,5,Kind of a let down,mt0,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this mostly because i'm a big fan of GM and was hoping for more insight into who the man is. We know how George always needed his privacy and this is completely normal. When you're a world-wide megastar at 21, things start to mess with your head. I think he handled it really well. I enjoyed the rare photos and live concert clips of Careless Whisper etc. But the general mood of the documentary was a bit sad. The interviews seemed really cherrypicked and one sided. I learned some new things, like how losing the love of his life affected George. I just wished for more hope, more structure, more celebration. He brought so much joy to the world - this documentary ignores it like it's some small thing.",False
10,3,"Less documentary, more commercial",postalisches,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really adore George Michael as a Songwriter and much more as a singer because of his immaculate and compelling voice. I am a fan since the first Wham album. When I watched it, I felt I am looking a commercial more than a documentary. Wham was a snippet as much as the interesting part of his first band, where there were close to no songs presented. They could have, but they did not want to, as much as they do not release his unreleased Legacy. Fans already knew 100% of the informations given by this documentary, so what's the point? The point was to find more buyers for the already released songs. Compare the publication of his Legacy to like Prince's. Huge difference and made for the fans a 100%. Everything GM Estate brings out has already been released. A very conservative and fans unfriendly handling on all his legacy by them is fact. There were fails in his career not shown and unexplained like the Trojan Horse session. Where is Andrew? I disliked the interviews much. Where are the critic voices? Ricky Gervais made me laugh as ever but did not fit in as much as the others did not too. When Ricky said he was a good actor I remembered George in Little Britain immediately with his bad performance. He was a bad actor for sure but exactly this has shown clearly, they only wanted to show what was good during his career and praise the snippets. They did not know him much either and you can feel it. The estate is a shame.. All I know now is, he could not live up the pressure of the music industry like Madonna, Prince and Jackson and he could not release/compose like 20% as much music, but compares himself with those big names like there was no difference at all. They did work hard for their fans compared to George and this is the feeling left after this documentary. Very sad.",False
11,2,Not Good,eviltrav,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a pretty poor excuse for a documentary unfortunately. The film breezes through his early career only to grind to a screeching halt covering his career in the early 90s as it spends forever on obscure album tracks that don't really tell us much about the man.There's an interesting story about a highly influential artist in here, but this documentary does not deliver it.",False
12,5,Lacklustre Doc,PrinceCharmingHere,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big George Michael fan. But this wasn't a particularly well made documentary. If you knew nothing about George beforehand then I'm sure this doc would suffice. But for fans this doc wasn't interesting to watch. What ruined this doc the most was the constant interspersed interviews and comments from his celebrity friends who kept vomiting out notes like a Wikipedia article or online fan club.There was some good George voiceover as he commented on his career as it played out in the doc. But, again, a lot of the voiceover came from his celebrity friends who just glazed him the entire time and it was boring to hear.The doc rushed through his early years with WHAM! And went straight into his solo career which was disappointing.Overall, the doc wasn't engaging and was boring in general.",False

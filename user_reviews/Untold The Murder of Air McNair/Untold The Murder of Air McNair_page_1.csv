1,5,Too brief an assessment of Steve McNair's life and death,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Untold: The Murder of Air McNair"" (2024 release; 58 min.) opens, it is ""July 4, 2009"" and Robert Gaddy, longtime friend of Titans QB Steve McNair, calls 911 in distress upon finding 2 dead bodies at McNair's apartment in Nashville. We then go back in time to 1995 when Jeff Fisher, interim head Coach of the Houston Oilers, is named head coach period, and Steve McNair is drafted in the first round of the NFL draft by Houston. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: of course I remembered that McNair was killed in 2009 but I didn't remember the exact circumstances of this horrible event. This documentary aims to dig into those exact circumstances. At net even an hour of running time, this felt less like an in-depth assessment of a tragic, and more like a sensational paparazzi piece. In this particular piece, it turns out that Jeff Fisher is one of the most pivotal talking heads. Bottom line: this could've been a truly interesting review of Steve McNair's life, but instead we receive something that is interested only in the sensational headlines, and not the deeper background.""Untold: The Murder of Air McNair"" recently started streaming on Netflix, and Netflix recommended it to me based on my viewing habits. If you are a fan of the NFL or a fan of true crime, I'd readily suggest you check this out, with tempered expectations, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,6,The ending failed,wishonstar25,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed it until right near the end. They brought in more names, more suspects and then never told what became of that. Like, how did she actually get ahold of that gun? It was never explained how she really did become to possess it. They could have done much better with this. They never did explain why the first person on the scene didn't call 911. He just drank a beer and called someone else to come over and they called 911, I'm guessing the first person left before police got there because of his unregistered gun but I don't know because they didn't explain it. I didn't know who this guy was before watching this so I appreciated the football clips within it to understand who he was.",True
3,2,WTH?,sgyumeez,n/a,16/08/2025,"I literally thought I'd missed something when the documentary ended. I was expecting additional episodes that would delve deeper into the other suspects and explain some of the twists and turns in the story. It was all surface. Netflix usually has great documentaries. I normally Google the person/people the documetary is about, if I am not familiar with them, in order to know who the key players are just in case the documentary doesnt. Netflix did a decent job at that, so I just changed my rating from one star to two stars. I'm glad I didn't Google him, as I would've learned everything the documentary was about beforehand and wouldve have been even more disappointed as I had wasted my time watching it. Perhaps this was created during the Writers Guild strike ðŸ˜‚",False
4,1,"A documentary about American Football, not a murder",kay-kidd,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I understand Steve Mcnair's career as a footballer and the US having such an intense relationship with the game and its players, I found it to be extreme and excessive in terms of how much football is in this show. This is supposed to be a documentary that covers Steve McNair as a person who was killed. Football is just a part of who he was. But this whole documentary reduces him to a player in a team sport, it focuses on the team as a whole, the game, the moves, and about a hundred too many clips. We even start the first episode with way too much information on the backstory of the coach's career - why??I know very little about who he was, the sort of person he aimed to be, the kind of father he was, did he volunteer in the community, did he donate to charity, did he have a favourite pastime, who was this man outside of ""a great arm"" and ""ghetto fabulous"" (this was seriously said by a commentator about McNair and his new team uniform, GHETTO FABULOUS, I damn well choked on my chicken wings).There is little to nothing regarding the investigation, forensics, suspects, his abandoned family that he left for a ""barely legal"" child (this documentary did nothing for his image outside of football).This felt like a poorly done introductory episode to a series that fell flat. Terrible work, don't waste your time.I hope the victims are offered better coverage in another documentary sometime in the future. This was a slap in the faces to them both.1/10.",False
5,4,"An interesting story, badly told.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Talented NFL Quarterback Steve McNair becomes a superstar, and comes very close to winning the superbowl. His life is cut short however, when he is killed in 2009.I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but this wasn't a particularly good documentary, for such a big story, it's just so poorly assembled. It's almost chaotic, it jumps about from one thing to another, and the pacing is somehow frantic.Documentaries should be factual and informative, there must be a temptation to sensationalise them, and this one is guilty of that, it's too glossy, too heavily produced. Those interviews, come on, they're like scenes from a cheesy movie.It certainly shows that McNair had a great life, halfway through I felt like I was watching a show about a saint, in reality he was an incredibly talented young man, who enjoyed the spotlight, and probably had a lot of fun.That ending though, come on!!!4/10.",False
6,8,Not sure why this is getting so much hate?,doncholish,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a 1 hour review of his murder, the investigation, and the outcome. They do flash back to tell the story of his playing days which is important context for those who didn't know how big he was. Don't most documentaries give the background of the person who was murdered? The investigation was not complex and there really wasn't much more to be said. They tried to throw in a little drama at the end, but I don't think there is much merit to that. If people want more information about that drama I think they were expecting a much less straight forward case. Some murders are simple and don't need 3-4 episodes to explain.",False
7,1,Not a murder documentary,cherylanderson-69308,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't waste your time. It was awful. They tried to run the story of a football player along side a murder and ended up missing the story completely. Ended up with far more questions than answers and no actual answer of what really happened. Pointless. Could have been really good but there wasn't enough sustenance at all. More like a vague football documentary. An hour of my life I will never get back. There are far more and far better documentaries out there and done much better too. If you want to be left guessing, watch it, but you'll be guessing for all the wrong reasons. You don't get an answer.",False
8,2,Possiblyt he worst of the Untold series,docslop,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you're not familiar with the story, McNair was much like most young rich athletes. He loved his ladies and got around while also having a wife and kids. This documentary tries to paint both him and his killer in a very good light with nearly half of it focused on building him up through his football story, which is fair enough. He was a great quarterback and nearly won a superbowl. The other half of the story is focused on building up his fling, who would go on kill him in a murder suicide. They go out of their way to show she ""had a good life"" working at dave and busters (riiiiight) and even interviewed her ex boyfriend whom she left for mr football player. McNair begins supporting her by paying for her condo, buys her an expensive SUV and he's paying for a lot of her bills. It's obvious he's getting sex and she's getting the life of a side girl to a millionaire football player. Shockingly, Steve is also banging other girls and she finds out. She also gets a DUI two days before the murder. I'm not sure if Steve was breaking it off with her, cutting her off, or whatever but she wasn't having it and killed him and then herself. The documentary crew then goes on to try to claim the police didn't investigate well and try to blame it on some gang banger she bought the gun from with zero evidence to back it up. This is a great example of the quote ""History is an agreed upon set of lies"". It's disgusting to the McNair family, his kids, and honestly even the gang banger guy they tried to imply committed the murder despite having overwhelming evidence to suggest she killed him and herself. Shameful and a blight on what I find to be a pretty cool series.",True
9,4,This could have been great,CaitlinRTodd,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary could have been excellent but it felt very surface level. I know many people dislike the amount of football that's in here but that didn't bother me at all- I think it's relevant to show what he meant to the NFL and to Nashville.This is a 15 year old crime, so why wasn't all the evidence discussed? Just a cursory glance at any article detailing the investigation shows there was so much this documentary left out. And why did they even talk to that awful conspiracy theorist? Seriously? It felt like they had time to fill and said ""let's include a super random conspiracy theory before it's over."" They did Steve McNair dirty- don't bother watching this documentary. Just read an article about it.",True
10,1,Absolutely ridiculous,meh-gan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis wannabe-documentary starts with the first man who arrived at the apartment, didn't know the body on the couch was Steve and went to the fridge for a beer... then tried to BRIBE the police officer? Then we never hear about that guy again. Why was he there? (I learned from news articles that this guy also calls A JUDGE!!). But like.. come on. A 6'2"" Black man is dead on the couch and you know whose apartment you're at and you can't deduce that it's him? It makes you wonder truly what this apartment was, as it's said to be Steve's but also the murderer mistresses... never truly answered. The fact that so many people came and went makes me wonder if this was a de facto brothel for the circle of McNair, as hookers and sexual escapades with other women were mentioned in police reports. Why else would his friends randomly stop by and have keys? But again, none of this is ever answered. Was Steve living with his wife at home? Were they really getting a divorce? Did she know about all these women and that he was financially supporting them? Again - the doc covers none of it. They teed up plot twists of the ex boyfriend who got a line of credit to help her, plus the felon who sold her the gun who they allude to was dating the murderer mistress - those storylines all go abandoned. So the mistress was dating McNair, the ex and the felon? McNair was married and dating the murderer, sleeping with her friend, and others? I'm not sure what the filmmaker was trying to accomplish with this, but the best part was they got Jeff Fischer on board, whom I adore. Skip this if you're a fan of Air McNair. It will likely just p!ss you off.",True
11,9,Untold: The Murder of Air McNair,IceCream-57,n/a,16/08/2025,"So I am be a little late to this because I do not watch football and I am not much of a athlete so I do not know who Steve McNair was until I watched this documentary last night. I thought it was a really good documentary, especially if you did not know the story, as I did not. Steve was a very good quarterback with a very sharp mind in the football world. He was great at him prime and seemed to be very loved by the fans. But unfortunately his life was cut tragically short when he was murdered in 1999. Out of respect for his family, I will not voice my opinion on what happened because that's not my place. I think this is a very well put together documentary. The only thing I would say is there is maybe to much time spent on the game of football and less on the actual Murder investigation.",False
12,1,More Questions Than Answers After Watching,sgw-04189,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhoever filmed this had severe ADHD and was all
over the place with the story being told. Weird stuff going on that needs to be followed up on.......
Why did the first guy who entered the apartment call everyone but 911, go directly to the bar, and then later try to bribe the police officer on film at the station? Why did so much time pass before anyone called 911? Why wasn't the felon who owned the gun honest with police about knowing Jenni and his whereabouts the night of the murders? What gave police the idea that Jenni was the murderer beyond a shadow of a doubt? Did she have residue on her hands? Why didn't it show the forensics?",True
13,2,The Mark Wahlberg of documentaries,BurtHandsome,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI remember vividly when this happened. I believe it was deemed a murder suicide almost immediately when this documentary starts they act like it's some sort of mystery behind what happens and then they reveal it is actually a murder suicide. It is sad that it happened. It is sad that these people got caught up in a situation that they did, however, nothing about this documentary is compelling. They don't even show Steve McNair as a person they show footage of him running and smiling. There is absolutely nothing about him in this. They tried to make a mystery out of some thing that is very simple. I don't feel like they really gave Steve McNair another dimension nor his former lover. It also kept bouncing around like dates were important and they were not. Him being drafted has nothing to do with his murder, him almost winning. The Super Bowl has nothing to do with this murder. It's just boring.",True
14,1,I cannot believe they called this a documentary,caraleegraduate,n/a,16/08/2025,I cannot believe they called this a documentary. I was very upset that they did not give full credence to this person in this documentary as the explanation to the murder was very convoluted and just jointed and while I understand to pronounce his amazing football career go ahead and do that but do it in an organized fashion the whole documentary made no sense. Poorly done. I love most documentaries for the store they tell even if they are not done perfectly this was not one of them. It was also frustrating that you could barely understand why anyone was just saying I don't know if it was an editing issue or watt but come on filmmakers can do better.,False
15,4,The Title is Misrepresentative.,ChrisMoore-2315,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first 50%(at least) of this documentary is coach Jim Fischer's journey (along with the Houston Oilers) to Nashville Tennessee and the now Titans run to the Super Bowl following the 1999 season. Taking second fiddle but also included is Air playing for HBCU Alcorn State University - this I believe OK to be included - in build up to the homicide, but not so much of the rest.So, eventually the producers get to the murder of McNair. And then the second decedent at the scene. And it is ""revealed"" the second dead person is married Air's girlfriend/mistress 18 yo Sahel 'Jenni' Kazemi and she the perpetrator of murder suicide. It takes a while to reach this point, with repetitive archival footage of newscasters getting the viewer here.Once we get to this determination by the police,no forensic evidence is offered to back it up. The only reason presented is a few days before the deaths, Jenni is busted for DWI and is unhappy with Air's tardiness in bailing her out.After the producers accept the conclusion of murder/suicide, they touch on two possible other scenarios, but don't follow up, and stay with what seemingly less than competent Nashville PD's version of things.Conclusion: when the murder is finally presented, it is a very weak true crime drama.",False
16,3,RIP McNair,d_penn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix and their ""Untold"" series are rolling out a few of their famed sports documentaries and one in particular caught my eye. ""Untold: The Murder Of Air McNair"", a documentary about Steve McNair being murdered in cold blood by his 20-year-old mistress. My favorite quarterback of all time? Yeah, I was excited to see what new information they were going to release and what they were going to highlight.I mean it's been 15 years since McNair was killed on 4th of July in 2009 and they drop this on us out of nowhere, surely there has to be some new information here right? Not even close. This documentary was a complete waste of an hour. 0 new information presented an a just a waste of time. Kind of fitting that these Netflix sports docs are falling flat on their face. Swamp Kings was awful, the Johnny Manziel one was not done great at all, and this one now joins the others as time you'll never get back.Now it wasn't all bad, we got some good quotes and stories from McNair's former coach, Jeff Fisher. My guy is sitting cool guy style in a leather chair just spitting some great stories. I did enjoy hearing from him, I'd have loved another hour of that. But other than that, there's nothing too good. Interviews with his friends and a former player, his old coach, some police and that is it. The doc bounces back and forth between his playing career and the timeline and events of the murder. But they just continue to go over things that we've already been told. 0 new redeeming qualities about this film.Maybe the wildest part of the whole documentary was the interview with the mistress' ex-boyfriend. They basically made him relive the time his girlfriend broke up with him and started dating his favorite football player of all time while they still shared a lease. I mean talk about rubbing someones nose in it.",False
17,2,Netflix's worst murder mystery documentary ever,YanL-34,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary could have been only 15 minutes long, there was so much time wasted talking about his football career, only 5 minutes would have been enough for that. Really, his former coach who tells the story of his career has no relevance to this documentary, I don't know why he agreed to participate in it, it's so pointless, he must have needed money.There are not enough details about the investigation, the murderer, and the person who helped her. Not enough details about those who discovered the bodies and who did not notify the police immediately after their discovery.Very disappointing for this type of documentary, usually Netflix gets us used to something really better.",False

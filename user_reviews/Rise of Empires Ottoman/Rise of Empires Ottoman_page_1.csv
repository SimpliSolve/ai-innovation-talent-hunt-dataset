1,8,Daniel Natu ( Vlad Dracula),ayhdal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yes historically not accurate, lots of BS etc.. But it was entertaining. I actually watched the whole series in a day. Mehmed vs Vlad is better than the previous one. I like the actor who played Mehmed ( Cem Yigit Uzumoglu) I think he was great. Story telling was also great ( I think he is the guy who played the lanister in GOT) . But what people should notice is the actor who played Vlad Dracula. He wasn't acting, it looked real. We don't see this level of acting very often. Absolutelly amazing. I think he is World Class and he should be in Hollywood. What a great actor. Well Done Daniel. I wish you all the best. And would like to see more from you. 10/10.",False
2,9,Very entertaining and educational,kostas-02274,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this mix of drama and documentary highly entertaining, visually impressive, and educational. I've read a few books about the siege of Constantinople, and always thought ""what a great story, why doesn't anyone make a movie out of it?"". When I found out that this was a Turkish production, I was afraid it'd be based as they are too close to the subject to be objective, but the basics of the story are accurately displayed. Yes, they puffed up Giustiniani and added a couple of female characters while other protagonists are missing. They simplified a lot of stuff and didn't go in depth into what preceded the siege and the motivations of the characters. But most of what made the cut is historically accurate, always allowing for the conflicting accounts and various viewpoints. Choices were obviously made on basis of which made better dramaturgical sense and which were more realistic, not in order to glorify this or that side. Some Turkish reviewers insist that ""this isn't how it happened"" (meaning ""not what was I taught at school"") and even believe that sultan Mehmet actually designed his cannons himself. Now maybe that's reported by one of his biographers but how possible is it that a 20-year old prince with no knowledge of metallurgy designed the most advanced weapons of his time? Anyway, I found that the producers used the source material well and come out with a gripping docu-drama that generally respected historical truth. If you want more nuances, read some books! I'm already looking forward to the next series.",False
3,8,Historically accurate with an Italian fetish,a_dratzidis,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a a Greek, I could have been pre-emptively negative about this series.
However, I cannot ignore the fact that the producers did some serious research and consultation before they put pen to paper.
From the small conversations to the serious arguments, it appears that they have checked first with the historians.There is good acting, good atmosphere, good costumes, decent battle scenes and loved the fact that the producers were careful with not allowing the documentary bit to take over.The only three things that stopped me from giving it a 10/10 are that
-) The utter obsession with Justinian to the point the whole series is about him and how heroic the Italians were.
-) The obsession with portraying all Greeks as treacherous cowards (you couldn't help yourselves there :)
-) Portraying the Turks as inferior and Mehmed a hotheaded and recklessI strongly recommend and can't wait for the sequel (probably about Vienna)",False
4,8,This has no business being this good,jesuison,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was pleasantly surprised that a second season came out, and about Mehmed II and the notorious Vlad no less. I really liked the first season because it's like a storytelling by historians with the flare of well done reenactment. Obviously, there are liberties taken for the drama, but it's cool to have a mix of history with what could be another Vikings type show. Although some of the the acting isn't Oscar worthy, the actor playing Mehmed has a memorable face and owns the role.I am hoping they do another one about the Romans or, better yet, the Egyptians. But I love this retelling because I'd take a guess that the average Westerner doesn't know a lot about the Ottoman Empire. I'd like another season, please!",False
5,10,More Turkish and Ottoman History please,nooneanyway,n/a,15/08/2025,We practically are not aware of any of the Ottoman and Turkish history. To date there haven't been any American or European movies covering the conquest of Constantinople to my knowledge. I believe this indicates a bias.,False
6,8,Somewhat inaccurate but very well dramatized depication of the Siege of Constantinople,Madeleine007,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not sure what exactly the future of this series is - will the next seasons be about Ottomans, other empires, or will there not even be more seasons? Regardless, this first season could more aptly have been named the Siege of Constantinople, as it is almost all about that famed siege. Good thing too, because 6 episodes seems to be the perfect length for depicting the siege in full. And the series is very well paced, although some of the flashback scenes feel a bit too long.The siege itself is exceptionally well depicted. The budget was either very high, or very well used, because the quality of the CGI, the sets, and the costumes is simply superb, and the actors too are brilliant. The show doesn't quite bias towards one side. If there is a bias, there is a bias against realism. Both sides are depicted in a more positive light than should be. The Genoans and Venetians were far less scheming than they were in real life, and the mercenaries defending the city more adept and brave than they truly were. Conversely, the show also glosses over the Ottoman plundering of the city. But apart from that criticism, I can't really find anything I disliked about the depiction of the siege itself. I also really appreciated that the show stressed the importance of it - the demise of the 1500 year old Empire, giving birth to one that would last nearly 500 years more.I'm not sure I quite like the docudrama style of storytelling. I think it is a tad lazy compared to just telling a story through actors. But that is a minor issue I have with an otherwise excellent depiction of a legendary siege.",False
7,9,I like it but too much Giustiniani,sariadil,n/a,15/08/2025,"It seems the war was between Giustiniani and Sultan Mehmet.
Also some how all the elite Ottoman soldiers are not elite at all. They died very quickly. One more thing. About 4 ships against 100 doesn't make sense. How come ottoman didn't use cannons to destroy them.",False
8,6,Good series but wrong title,emrebuyukgungor,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTitle should be Rise of Legends: Giustiniani. Whole series are about Giustiniani, he was shown more than Sultan Mehmet and Emperor Constantine. They show him/his name at least once every 5 minutes. It is being demonstrated as the war is between 80.000 ottoman army and Giustiniani.",True
9,8,Vlad was much more than shown in this,dumitrescu_vld,n/a,15/08/2025,"All chronicals besides turkish ones say that Vlad scored a great victory at the Night Attack and Mehmed fled the camp. If this was not the case then i ask you Where would he gather so many ottomans to impale near Targoviste? How about time to impale?Recommend HistoryMarche on youtube for a better view on Vlad the ImpalerThe show has it.s ups and downs , depictes some aspects good and some rather miserable. Since it.s a documentary, historical facts should be represented as they were and not florished to make Mehmed more apealing to viewers. I still recommend the show and the actors playing Vlad and Mehmed did a great job. Still better than hollywood movies. At least Constantinopole had a ditch in front of the walls and this was the most esential defending construction during that time. Enjoyed the costumes as well. Anyway, keep this genre going as it.s way better than any movie.",False
10,6,"I wanted to give the angry 1 star, but that is only for the history part - the rest is actually good",serbancamelia,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI liked the first season, although I definitely felt that their version of history favored the ottomans. But I didn't know that part of history that well so I let it go. However the second season angered me so much I couldn't even sleep.First of all - the sets were beautiful, the shots were gorgeous and so were the effects. I even loved the clothes - especially what they were at war and in Walachia - quite accurate since those I have the knowledge to judge, although very much on the dark side, probably meant to match the atmosphere...people actually liked colors back then too
The actors that played Muhamed the conquerer and Vlad the Impaler were great, special shoutout to the one that played Vlad - I could tell from a mile off that he is romanian, and that he lived that role, not just acted it. I also loved the ones that played Mara Brancovici and Giovani Lungo - they have great screen presence. And Charles Dance's voice is always amazing as narrator.Now, I am an actual romanian, born and raised in walahia (walachia is about a third of current day romania, btw), and I am quite proud of my country's history, so couldn't help but pick up on so much historical inaccuracy and turkish propaganda. But it's a turkish docuDRAMA, so it's expected. While I dislike the portrail of Vlad Tepes, and won't be recommending this show, I have to say I appreciated it. I'm happy that now there's a version on tv of Dracula that is more realistic and has nothing to do with vampires. I'll take mad prince over vampire any day.Now on to the complainingTo begin with, the Ottomans were always the good guys...according to the Turks. It is understandable, all of our heroes were villains for someone else, all of our countries's history gets filtered through a patriotic filter and then half is forgotten and partially replaced by fables. As someone who loves history, I have nothing but respect for great conquerers and empires, however they might have risen of fallen. And in my country, although everyone knows that the ottomans were our historical nemesis, no one has eny leftover ""ancestral"" anger towards the turks - we actually have quite a good impression of them, from what I've seen much better than other, more western countries, have.But as impressive as the Ottoman Empire was, it was a force of conquest and testament of power, not a force of good that came over other countries to enlighten them. They conquered because they wanted, and the conquered countries were forced to convert to islam, with many dying for refusing to give up their cristian faith. It was a time when religion was much more important to people, and even as an atheist, I can't help but be impressed by the many of my country's rulers that chose to lose their lives and have their entire family follow then to give up their souls. And about those countries that got conquered and forcibly converted - lets count s Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania - on them it was imposed a money tax, quite high, and also a blood tax. That one was a practice that started in the 14th century, couple of decades at most before the setting of the show, and through which the ottomans forcibly took children, starting from age 7 and up, converted them to islam and trained them, making them into that famous army of jenesarries or yenicers or however you spell it (in romanian it's ieniceri). And make no mistake, these were slaves whose lives were not valued as much as those of normal foot soldiers, brainwashed and forced to fight many times against their own mother countries. Yes, some rose in ranks, but many died as mere animals.I'm not writing this just to show what good people the ottomans were, but also to point an innacuracy. Vlad and Radu weren't just given as political prisoners, they were taken, and they were first imprisoned along with their father for a year. Then he was released and the ottomans started to raise them for the purpose of making them puppet rulers, loyal to the ottomans before their own people, as they had royal blood and the time to use them might come one day. And they succeeded with the young radu - he was more tame and agreeable and didn't have the violent nature of vlad. Later on, when vlad is on the throne and the vassals are sent to demand years worth of the money tax (he didn't have the money to pay it), they also demanded the blood tax. That angered vlad, as he himself saw his political imprisonment as hell, and he had it easy as he was a prince. He was asked for 500 children, tax which he refused to pay. But I guess were not showing that. Kudos here to the writers, I enjoyed the part where where he killed the messengers - if anyone missed it, he bolted their hats to their heads, to ensure they never take their hats off in front of anyone - that one is from the legends.I found it amusing that in the last episode the sultans actually said ""Unleash the jenissaries!"". Like unleash the dogs..On the topic of their childhood - vlad was a year or two older than muhamad, but their friendship isn't an actual thing. So all those scenes where they spar are innacurate, especially considering muhamad was more of a strategic genius that commanded the troops from behind than a warrior at the front of the troops, as vlad was. His childhood friend was, in fact, radu, and there are records that state that their relationship later was that of lovers, but I am willing to accept that that might have been walachian propaganda, even though the chronicars that tell those thories are greek - radu died of siphilis too. And radu was known as both radu the beautiful and radu the coward. He enjoyed culture and parties and easy life, and when he was put on the walachian throne it was actually the ottomans in charge and everyone knew and accepted it. Vlad was probably as much of an edgelord as he is portrated, being famous for describing himself as a prisoner and making life at the ottoman court horrible for himself by not complying. I like the kid actor playing him, the rest of the kid actors are meh.I feel like I have to make my own views clear here - I value peace, and I value freedom, but I value loyalty and patriotism so much more. Betray your country for selfish reasons, like your own safety, and I don't like you. I might not expect this from regular people, but I expect it from leaders and kings. So I'l always prefer a king that will take his country into war for the sake of freedom to one that will choose peacefull opession,and the ottoman terms were not particularely good, even if kept as vassal country and not actual part of the empire.On the tactics of war - yes, Vlad fought a guerrilla war, and he poisoned the water and burned the granaries before the ottomans arrived. But he evacuated the people. He never touched the ones loyal to him, tho he did hated cowards. He is loved by all romanians now, yes, but even back then he was loved by the small people. Because yes, he was black and white. He appreciated the good and loyal and righteous people and protected them, and the bad ones, the thieves and thugs and traitors ... well they were mostly treated with impalement. And the lords and politicians were always, as they are everywhere, on the bad side rather than the good - selfish and corrupt. So yes, he got betrayed, and yes, he at multiple points ended up executing his own people. He was cruel and violent and probably mad, but he was not indiscriminately cruel and violent and mad. He simply had no mercy for those whom he considered sinners and/or enemies of his people. His cruel nature was most evident in that (the Walachians were not conquerors; they just wanted to protect their own lands, but they did invade sometimes to get revenge or show power, and in those moments it didn't matter whether you were man, woman or child).Also, he married three women and didn't really love either, supposedly his love belonged to another with whom he had 5 bastards, I don't remember her name. Stories tell that after the bargain was struck with mattias corvinus and he falsely imprisoned vlad, radu decided to take control of his lands, including Poenari castle, where his first wife did suposedly killed herself after hearing of her husband's fate, but it was in fear of meeting the same fate aka ottoman prisoner. So the whole sidequest of his brother is made up, as is his whole presence in the field. He only went ""conquering"" after Vlad was imprisoned and it was with the whole backing of the ottoman empireDuring the night attack, vlad went for the biggest tents, got to two of them, and they were of two of sultan's pasas, which he killed. No brother soap opera drama there. And his head did end up at the gate of constantinopol, but it was 16 years later, shortly after he had taken his throne back and expelled the turks out of walachiaI generally think that the people that learn about him, even if just from this docudrama, and still think he was just some bloodthirsty madman, are either idiots of have roots in the ottomans - I don't judge the latter. But the rest, hear this - the hurgarians betrayed his and didn't show up when they promised. His and Walachia's fight, along with the likes of Stefan the Great of Moldavia (his cousin, Moldavia is another third of current day romania) and Skanderbeg of Albania (with whom I think it was more rebellion than opposition) - they are the only reason the ottoman expansion stopped there and didn't enter central europe. They stood a wall against islam entering europe, and against war plaging so many others. Yes, Vlad did horrible things, but he didn't just do them for fun. He fought what he perceived as evil with everything he had at his disposal, including evil. Orthodox christians are hardheaded and I don't doubt they would've died by the thousands if islam came over them, and romanians, then and now, were very patriotic and would have never stood to be conquered - which is why they kept on fighting the ottomans for centuries to come.",True
11,8,Powerful and bingeworthy,DreamTinder,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a historical fiction docuseries, showing the Fall of Constantinople from a Turkish perspective. Historical fiction is by definition not fully historically accurate, because past events are placed on a narrative arc and dramatized in order to build a strong story. Accept this and you'll be a happier viewer.The iron-willed Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror is beautifully played by Cem Yigit Uzümoglu, who's destined to become a global star after this memorable performance. Because of Cem's passionate portrayal of the young Ottoman ruler Mehmed II, I found myself rooting for him despite of the tragic fates of many soldiers, mercenaries and innocent civilians.This series was produced and directed by a Turkish film team, and most actors are also Turkish. Critics who claim that the series is biased in favour of the Romans are clearly missing something. In this particular story the Romans are defending themselves against an attack, and many of the victims are civilians, so there's bound to be scenes where we sympathize with them. This is how good storytelling works, and it would have been a creative failure not to include that side of the story.'Rise of Empires: Ottoman' is a powerful, visually impressive and absolutely bingeworthy series that will linger in my mind for a very long time.",False
12,7,1st season good enough but 2nd has more inaccuracies,evi-75011,n/a,15/08/2025,"Text: I removed my first comment because I hadn't watched season 2 when I wrote it. I am coming back since I have just finished it. First of all the 2 seasons differ concerning inaccuracies. The 1st one relies more on history apart from the fact that they avoid to mention that Constantinos Paleologos was Greek,as many of the greatest emperors in eastern Roman Empire,and they paid too much attention to Justiniani. Ok the latter might have been a very good fighter but he left the battlefield while Paleologos fought till death as a man of honor and a real hero. So HE was the legend and the soul not Justiniani. However many other facts are decent and correct. Mehmed was really smart educated and wanted to be a Ceasar not just a sultan. His mother Huma Hatun was not Turkish that is why they didn't mention her origin,she was probably from Greece or Serbia. Historians say that is why Mehmed was different from other sultans and much more educated Or maybe helped him his adoptive mother Mara who was from a noble family half Serbian(from her father)half Greek(from her mother). Mara was really qualified and built many churches too so the environment Mehmed grew up was civilized concerning religions and different cultures.Constantinopolis was really difficult to be conquered that IS true but at that specific time the City was weak and the emperor abandoned and betrayed by his allies So I think all these things are present in season 1 one way or another But season 2??What happened ?? Vlad was NOT the invader he was a hostage while all his childhood so he did what he should do! He wanted freedom! And he was cruel but not against his own people I have never found any official source about something like this! He was cruel against the invaders that's normal not??Moreover the direction tries to present that hostages live happily with ottomans. Yes ok sometimes this had happened but have you ever thought that they did not have any other option??they just try to survive this is not friendship! Vlad was much more than what season 2 presents! Don't forget that many people suffer from the taxes to ottomans they wanted independence and they had suffered a lot. Ottomans weren't educated as Mehmed,he was an exception. That is why Balcans remained so underdeveloped and we are still trying to overcome all this cultural damage!Last but not least they mention Alexander the Great many times since Mehmed admired him as many others Caesars did and Napoleon some centuries after,but one more time without telling that he was Greek!!We are still speaking the language he and his teacher Aristotle spoke,of course in a modern and simplified version,but nobody mentions his origin as in other Tv series! That is a little bit stupid I think
Fortunately acting and battle scenes are really good I liked the actors for Mehmed,Vlad and Mehmed as a child I have seen this boy in another Turkish série he is talented!So give it a try I think it is worth but in some points you will feel dissatisfied.",False
13,1,"Welp, the Turks drank the Kool-aid",lumosnight,n/a,15/08/2025,"It has been a trend for many Turkish telenovelas to portray the brutal Ottoman Empire through the lens of nostalgia, and these types of series have been propagated at an international level: first the Balkans, then the Middle East, then South Asia... and finally one of them reached Netflix.The Turks are presented as the honourable good guys who treat everyone fairly. The non-Turks such as Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians and Hungarians are all portrayed as slimy, back-stabbing hypocrites who betray their nice Turkish overlords. Imagine, they do not understand the honour of living under the Turkish boot!The few non-Turks who are the 'good guys' are Mehmed's subjects who have a servile attitude and are happy to obey his orders. They are the Uncle Toms of the series. Such as Princess Mara, who is portrayed as Mehmed's biggest supporter... when in reality she hightailed out of the Sultan's court when her husband died and became a nun in Serbia. She wanted to get back to her family, not to be a pawn in Mehmed's games - in fact, the reason why she even married Mehmed's father was to save her country from Ottoman invasion. That was why she never had Murad's children and instead became strategically friendly with his son and heir. She was a well-known benefactor of the Orthodox Church and strongly lobbied for the rights of Orthodox Christians across the empire.Vlad Tepes Dracula is portrayed as a cartoon villain, who kills his subjects in the most brutal ways. The series conveniently omits that he and his brother Radu were sexually abused by Mehmed himself, or how Vlad learnt from the Turks all those horrible ways of putting people on the stake by witnessing how they executed civilians who couldn't pay the 'infidel tax'.Mehmed is portrayed an a nice guy who tolerates Vlad's non-payment of taxes and is horrified by the way Vlad kills people - oh the irony.I couldn't continue watching this propaganda. It is one thing to romanticize your history, but entirely something else to give an entirely falsified version of accounts in order to spark up the sentiment of Turkish nationalism, which this series plainly does.",False
14,8,Fictional Documentary,jethronom,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you intend to shoot a docu-drama with some historians commenting on it, you need to base your story on the real facts.This is not a docu-drama about Mehmet nor Ottomans; this is a story of the great defence strategist, mighty Guiliani.If it's another legendary story; I could give it 8 (which I did because I respect the work done).As a docu-drama I could only give 3 maybe.A docu-drama should be researched well. This one was not. Where's the Orthodox Patriarch? Mehmet gave him the Ecumenical Power right after the conquest. This was the greatest wisdom of his time. And Mehmet was a great strategist, artist as well as an intellectual.This story has very few accurate facts. That was disappointing.",False
15,10,Rise of the Cem Yigit Uzumoglu,yusufpiskin,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFew people can call themselves true world conquerors but when it comes to Mehmed II, there's a reason this man was known as Mehmed The Conqueror. Following the conquest of the iconic city of Constantinople, Rise Of Empires combines narration and expert analysis with dramatic reenactments that'll be instantly recognisable to anyone who watched last year's The Last Czars. With a lot more focus on warfare and strategic battle planning, Ottoman is a fascinating and educational series, one that takes a wise approach to showcase more action alongside the narration.Split across six episodes, the series begins with Mehmet taking the throne from his Father and desperate to prove himself and appease the people following a few rebellions in the empire. In order to do that, he sets his sights on the ""Butterfly"" city of Constantinople; a Roman-ruled gateway between Asia and Europe. From here, the series progresses through the build up to this battle and the ensuing issues Mehmet II had to deal with, both on the battlefield and with his personal life.From ingenious acts of navigating spy-filled forests with ships to bombarding city walls with cannon-fire (or 8 metre long ""Basilica"" as they're referred to in the first episode), there's a solid amount of educational content here worth digesting. Much like Hannibal & The Punic Wars, Ottoman is essentially a lesson in military warfare and it showcases this perfectly across the series.At the heart of this tale are a series of impassioned narrators that do a great job fleshing out the scenes and adding more background behind what's happening. These are handled in much the same way as the aforementioned Last Czars, with cutaways to face to face interviews. Personally, Celal Cengal is a firm favourite here, with exaggerated mannerisms, an unwavering enthusiasm and some great colloqualistic language that really helps you understand what's happening. That's not to take away from the others here of course, but he'll likely become a firm favourite over the six episodes.
There's a good amount of animations, expository text and diagrams that help to paint a portrait too and seeing the screen filled with shades of blood red is both a cruelly ironic symbol of the bloodshed that went into the conquest of this city and also an informative guide as to how the Ottomans actually accomplished this feat. Most of the series revolves around this epic battle, although there is some history behind Mehmed's life too.It's not perfect and there are a few stand-out moments that spoil the party. The very last scene at the end of the first episode feels ripped straight from Gladiator, with Mehmed II running his hands through corn, while the finale sees Mehmed look directly at the camera and smile before uttering ""Now it begins,"" which seems a bit of a cheesy way to end things, especially after such an epic explanation around how significant this victory actually was. The face to face narration is engaging although the questionable manner the cameraman skips the shots around three or four times to different parts of their face is a bit distracting.Gripes aside, Rise Of Empires: Ottoman is a fascinating and educational series for a period in history I admittedly have very little knowledge on. Unlike The Last Czars, the dramatic reenactments wisely stick to the battle and action for large periods of the show. This is ultimately to Ottoman's benefit and hopefully this is a trend Netflix can continue going forward, especially given the History Channel appear to have abandoned these sort of documentaries long ago. It's not without its flaws but Ottoman's battle-centric viewpoint and engaging six episodes make it a step-up from The Last Czars and a welcome addition to Netflix's growing documentary library.",True
16,10,Easily one of the best historical docudramas I've ever seen...which is many.,DGPTA,n/a,15/08/2025,"For the most part, docudramas can have great acting and writing, but suffer tremendously from budget constraints that cancel those out entirely.They can also have horrible acting and writing, and a decent budget.Unfortunately, as any history buff will tell you, this is just part of being a history buff since most people could care less about history and thus rarely are historical works that aren't a World War special given the love and attention they deserve.But, on the rare occasion, you do you have a docudrama that has both great writing/acting AND a big(ish) budget AND is historically accurate.This is one of those.If there is ANY field you simply have to give Netflix credit for, it's how much they support historical documentaries and docudramas, moreso than just about any platform does or ever has. Not only do they have a great selection of them, but a lot of the Netflix produced ones are actually quite good.Like, who'd have thought, right?However, what is MOST important to me, more than any other thing that makes any sort of film production ""good,"" is historical accuracy. And in this regard, Rise of Empires excels.Anyone who says otherwise either doesn't know history or doesn't know what a docudrama is.Here is a fact of life about history: We almost never, like literally just about never, have any idea the conversations that actually took place behind closed doors when some of the big moments you do read about in history books happened. We know this battle happened, this guy was assassinated, this mission was planned, attempted, and failed...but rarely do we know what was ACTUALLY said in the King's chambers when it was planned.Enter: Docudrama. Take what we know for sure, and fill in the blanks. Sure, it's entirely possible many of the conversations in RoE never happened even remotely as they did in the show.However, Rise of Empires, both season 1 and 2, captures pretty much every major KNOWN fact and event and portrays it with supreme detail, while ALSO making it clear the writers did their research on the characters they're writing for, and so make it likely that this very well could be roughly how these unknown background moments actually went.As for historical accuracy, maybe with a few small exceptions, like seeing Mehmed II leading the front line of his armies into battle (when it was much more likely he stayed in the back commanding troops), or the bright, fanciful colors of Ottoman uniforms replaced with colorful-compared-to-Crusaders-but-still-dull ones, it really is quite accurate.And as for the filling in of the blanks...imagine Game of Thrones, but without the fantasy and nudity. All of the political intrigue, espionage, family drama...basically the real life events that inspired GoT...are front and center here. Machiavelli confirms this stuff not only went on, but was quite common...why would it be any different with a man named Vlad ""the Impaler"" Dracula?Are you familiar with the phrase ""real life is stranger than fiction?"" Well that phrase exists because of people like Vlad Dracula, and historical moments like what's seen in season 1 and 2 of Rise of Empires.So, long review short, even if you aren't particularly a history buff, or have even the slightest interest in Ottoman history, if you like medieval battles and good performances, this really is a must see. We don't get many medieval productions these days, so you kind of have to take what you can get...and as of now, this is as good as it gets.And, honestly, I don't think it'll get any better than this unless it's a big budget Hollywood production. And it's unlikely those will feature commentary from real historians and experts on the subject, so, in all seriousness, Rise of Empires is really quite a gift to humanity and history lovers alike.Thanks for actually doing something that makes me not question bothering to keep paying for you, Netflix. I, for one, am grateful.",False

18,7,Vlad vs Mehmed,paulabuzgau,n/a,15/08/2025,"Too bad Netflix didn't do season 2 about Huniadi. It makes no sense why Vlad hates Mehmed so much. His hostage time with the ottomans couldn't have had such an impact on his personality. People weren't that complicated then... If the viewers had seen Ioan Huniade's war with the empire and how Vlad's family was involved, things would have had more clarity and truthfulness. Plus viewers would have had the chance of finding out how Vlad's family came to be known by that name...
On the other hand it's good that western civilisation has a chance to know more about this famous or rather infamous ruler which inspired Stocker.Unfortunately, the Romanian historians invited to participate in the making of the documentary are not the most representative. Or were not given enough space to complete and explain the story....",False
19,8,The idyllic representation of Empires should stop,Dalinaby,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think the idyllic representation of Ottomans should stop. It's nothing glorious in Empires! If only we're thinking how the janissaries were formed, and you'll understand the sickening aspects of Empires oppression. The ""heroic"" janissaries were ruthless soldiers, because they were raised from childhood in a draconian structure, grabbed from the parents arms, usually coming from the Balkan countries as a direct tribute for the Empire, thrown in a foreign lands, forced to adopt other religion than their own religion. The irony is janissary could end up fighting against his own parents lands. But I still appreciate the producer tried with certain accuracy to take in consideration historical data .",False
20,7,"UNTRUTHFUL SUBJECTIVE documentary, with great visual effects.",Caglatureray,n/a,15/08/2025,"I gave it a 7rating due to high quality of visual effects. Moreover the actor playing the main character, Mehmed II, seems to be a great actor. Overall Production quality is good. On the other hand, the historical explanations, details are not really truthful. They made heroes out of Genoese and Venetians. ??!!! What about the story behind the conquest by Ottoman emperor? What was the emotional reason behind it ? Why are there no details about the christians' crusade wars? Where is the talk about revenge? Where is the talk about the importance of Istanbul ?
Plus, Mehmed's mother is known, she is Hüma Hatun, she even has a grave! But this productions says: ""mehmet's mother is unknown"". That is very confusing! This whole production is mainly lacking the truth. I didn't find it objective at all. The history has been demonstrated as if it was a Spartans movie. What about the customs and traditions of Turkish people? This documentary is Really really brain washing !! Who the f. is Giustiani?? Why is he at the center of this documentary? For example why didn't we see more of Zaganos Pasha? Isn't he more important as the right hand of the conqueror?? Doesn't he deserve more scenes than Ana character? Why is the emotional struggle of Ottoman army NOT shown, why does this production heavily weigh in towards the emotional struggle of Byzantine fighters? This production is very biased. This is a documentary but unfortunately NOT OBJECTIVE and NOT TRUTHFUL. Where are the great Turkish historians who can tell us the story better? For example Professor Ilber Ortayli. He should have been involved in this production.Another problem is with language. The narrator is great, he gives a lot of fresh air while watching, nice to ears. However the spoken English of all actors/actresses is horrible. I could barely understand what they were saying. I had to watch it with English subtitles. Since English subtitles is a must to be able understand, then why was the outspoken language between ottoman characters not in their own language? Why do our ears need to suffer? History is needs to be represented as it is. In the production they could have easily made: the narrator speaks in English, historians speak in English, Byzantine characters speak in English or Latin, Ottoman characters speak in Turkish. At least among each other. It was ridiculous. At one point Ana speaks Turkish when she is talking to Sultan Mehmed, Apparently her parents are Turkish so she does speak the language, but when Ana meets the wounded Ottoman soldier, she suddenly forgets Turkish and they speak in English. B.S.!!
Net net, if season2 is in the making, it needs to be objective and truthful.",False
21,10,Turks Doing Justice to Vlad!,Florina_Massbaum,n/a,15/08/2025,"""VLAD VS MEHMET"", Netflix a second series of docu-drama ""Rise of Ottoman Empire"". I enjoyed this historically depiction of the Vlad the Impaler real character: brave, patriotic, bloody, tragic yet charming... Finally Turks are doing justice to Vlad, showing what lead him to the point of infamous impaling his enemies. Daniel Nuta did an amazing job, I see so much talent and future for him. Superstar Tuba B. Shines as ever as Sultan's Stepmother Sofia, looking for alliance against Vlad. When will Romanians do something similar for our heroic character? He saved Hollywood more than once. In 2007 in a meeting Sony, I proposed a real story of our tragic king. ""Dracula Untold"" followed, Luke Evans did a great job as Vlad.",False
22,7,A lie there another one here but,tomescu_katalin,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am 100% sure that not even 50% of what they told is real. There are so many things said wrong. I don't understand why the Ottomans are seen as heroes for so long, but considering that the director is a Turk, it makes sense. But I'm not going to sit here and do a bad review because I really liked both actors. Especially Daniel, he is made for this role, you could see the sparkle in his eyes, something special indeed. I hope we will have more series like this but with a bigger budget. And one more thing, use the native language of the respective countries as much as possible, we have subtitles, that's not the problem.",False
23,1,"Accurate retelling by experts, muddied by horribly inaccurate dramatization and narration",Erlik_Han,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off every single Turk in the show, except the slave girl that converted to Christianity, have the stereotypical ""evil guy"" look. They always have an evil grin and they always dress in black. Every single scene they are threatening someone etc. Meanwhile the eastern Roman / Byzantines wear colorful clothes, have soft nice expressions (except Giovanni Giustiniani who is portrayed as a ""lovable womanizing pirate / mercenary"")In reality the Sultan would have worn colorful robes made from expensive silks with intricate details and embroidery etc etc. He wouldn't have walked around in black leather all day every day.. same for his followers. From the moment we see Mehmet he is wearing his black leather outfit. What even is that supposed to be? Obviously not his actual armor, we even see him wearing more realistic armor to battle, so what's with the black leather? Remember, this is the same for every single Turk. The only people with color are the Jannisary troops, which I'm sure they would have made to wear black if their uniforms weren't as iconic..but strangely they all wear no armor for battles and storm into battle with ceremonial outfits.Every time we hear the historians talk, they talk about how brilliant Mehmet is. How he spoke 5 languages and was a great commander etc etc. But then we switch to the reenactment parts and Mehmet acts like a angry, bratty, spoiled, bully. This happens with almost everything. The Historians will say something positive and then the reenactment will be a complete mess.**Let's move on to Giovanni.. Honestly the show is more a dramatization of Giovanni than a a docu about Mehmet or the Ottomans**. Giovanni was a ruthless pirate so brutal even his own nation hated him. He came to Constantinople because he thought it would be an easy way to gain a lot of glory and honor (he damaged his family name with his actions and came from a great family). He also hoped he'd get land etc in the end. Likely expected an easy defense and eventual western reinforcements. He did not realise the Ottomans had giant wall destroying cannons.The moment he rode into the city the music made it clear he was going to stare at a girl, who'd in turn become his love interest. It was so cliche, I swear I guessed it before it happened. But I hoped it was just a throwaway scene and he wouldn't get some dumb love plot, which is based on absolutely nothing! It only served to make him a likeable guy, a womanizer etc it's a very cliche thing to do with the ""HERO"" of the story.There is even a scene where Mehmet goes to the wall and talks to Giovanni, tries to buy him..This is absolutely ridiculous! Mehmet would have been pierced by hundreds of bolts before he even came close. Those are called KILLING FIELDS for a reason. In that scene Mehmet offers Giovanni the entire Aegean and Giovanni refuses. This is a complete joke and meant to show that Giovanni was now suddenly dedicated to Constantine and Constantinople.So this dude is getting a nonsense love plot and is made to seem like this honorable warrior that gave his heart to this city and wouldn't ever betray it (he does though, doesn't he). He even threatens everyone else who tries to suggest a truce or tries to stop the war. He threatens everyone by calling them traitors. Suddenly this dude is the most loyal byzantine.It's crazy that the hero in the show is a mercenary of the other side who is made to seem so much greater than he was.Meanwhile poor Constantine, who likely bravely died fighting in the heart of his city, takes a back seat to ""the great Giovanni Giustiniani"" who ran away with all his men and died not long after.Then we get to straight up inaccuracies and other misrepresentations.1 We know who Mehmets mother was. It was Hüma Hatun. The show shamelessly claimed we did not know his mother and Mehmet kept it secret?? What? How is a prince supposed to keep his birth mother secret. Ottomans also did not really have ""illegitimate"" sons. Whether your mother was from a peasant/slave or royal aristocrat background you are equally a prince.2 The idea that he was beaten like that is absurd. He would have been disciplined. But lashed and wounded? It's illegal to spill royal blood.. when members of the family were killed they would be strangled because of this. They would never cut a member of the House of Osman as it was believed that it was a very bad omen.3 During the battle reenactments Ottomans get slaughtered like lv1 enemies vs a lv99 boss. Giovanni stands on his own in the middle of the killing field slaughtering Ottoman after Ottoman. Which is again, complete nonsense. First off giovanni would have stood behind his 700 heavy plate armored men with giant shields, pikes, crossbows etc. They were the last line..Second of all for the Ottoman soldiers to get to them they had to cross the killing field! This is where most casualties happened not during the fight. So they had to run trough a field that's constantly bombarded. Shot with make shift shotguns, hand cannons. Thousands of arrows and bolts. Trough a moot, then trough multiple walled sections etc etc.But the docu pretends like Giovanni and a handful of his men were single handily stopping the assaults. Also pretends like Ottomans just threw troops at the problem which wasn't at all the case.. remember Mehmet was a very very well educated and extremely experienced commander. He had been ruling his own province since he was like 10. He had been leading men since he was a child..The docu also pretends like Mehmet was almost out of men. Which, again, is not reflective of reality.4 Ottoman troop composition.The documentary talks about the Serbian miners but never mentions the 1500 allied serbian heavy cavalry that mehmet had in his army! Which reminds me of Moldovan Radu and Vlad Tepes which we never hear off btw but I'll come to that later.They constantly show these guys wearing furs and bones, with their faces painted. Then they claimed these were Bashi Bozuk. Bashi Bozuk did not dress like that. Deli Cavalry did. They also wore wings on their backs which is where the winged hussars got their wings from.. this is such a huge inaccuracy it's insane that it's in there. They pretend like a large part of the army was bashi bozuk which is also wrong. Deli Cavalry were shock troops they didn't just go in and die, they were meant to intimidate and act as shock troops (hit and retreat)Bashi bozuk were random irregulars. They did not wear furs, masks, face paint or wings like the deli troops..All Ottoman troops have dirty faces even the Jannisaries.. the historians talk about how organized this army was, the only true standing army in Europe, first military band in history etc. And then the reenactment shows them as a band of undisciplined savages.Historians are like the Jannisaries were the best trained, most feared warriors. Cue reenactment of Giovanni Giustiniani slaughtering hundreds single handily lol.The Ottoman army was so simplified and everyone wore leather. Where are the Sipahi heavy cavalry? Where are the armored Jannisary? Why are they all wearing their ceremonial clothes?How an Ottoman armored soldier would have looked vs an Aragonese5 The documentary tries to raise the drama by pretending Mehmet was worried about western reinforcements from the start and that was all he thought about. It wasn't. It would have taken a while for them to arrive, if they ever did. But long before that the Ottomans took control of the horn. And although the Ottoman navy alone wouldn't be able to properly block reinforcements if they came with frigates, the Ottomans had lined the entire bosphorus with cannons. The horn was a death trap6 They claim the Ottoman navy had a 100 ships. Which it did, but only 35 of those were galleys there rest were large rowboats. The ships could easily overwhelm and destroy any frigate. But frigates are so large and fast they can ram trough those galleys. That's why they were unable to stop them. The wind also didn't ever die down as far as I know. They just rammed through the blockade.The baltalu scene was a massive dramatization and nonsense. Sure he'd be angry but he understands warfare he understood what happened and that the admiral couldn't help it. He made an example out of him but wouldn't have gone too far as that would create resentment between his forces, as the admiral was very well respected. Remember this is the guy who spared the vizier because his support might come in handy.7 The documentary pretends like Mehmet had this lonely, cold and horrible life. Never mentions all the kids he grow up with etc.Mehmets closest friend is never even mentionned! It's Radu III Dracul. Younger brother of Vlad III ""the impaler"" Dracul. (the guy that Dracula is based on)8 Weapons.On one hand I'm happy to see the swords have Yalmans. It's the double edge at the end which makes Turkish Kilij swords/sabers tip heavy. This makes it easy to swing the sword with just the wrist with barely any effort. But I'm also a bit confused as to why experienced Jannisary warriors would attack plate armored foes with kilij swords. Although they can cut trough armor it works best on horseback. **they would have used Maces, Pickaxes and Axes** against armor.. which they carried. Not to mention where are all the Ottoman firearms? Muskets and arquebuses etc?I can go on forever. But I dont think allows reviews that are much longer than this. Thanks for reading.",True
24,10,Loved it,jameshets,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is awesome. I didn't know anything about Sultan Mehmed and Vlad. I can't believe Dracula family was real. Their sons were raised with Mehmed. Only historians knew all these facts I guess.I really loved it!! It's highly charged, awesome and epic battle scenes!! Superb acting by Cem Yigit (Sultan Mehmet The Conquerer) & Birkan Sokullu ( Giustiniani) and not to mention an easy to follow narrative on what transpired during that period and how Constantinople was conquered by the Ottomans led by Mehmet II in the 15th Century at just the age of 21! Sure..it's not too accurate on few points or some infos haven't been included but enough to make one understands and keep ones interest and curiosity throughout the series. I'm so looking forward to the second season if any. A must watch.",False
25,9,Better than expected,kenjo-15513,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerI enjoyed watching the six episode series of rise of empires ottoman. Especially enjoyed the history lessons given throughout each episode.The issues that I have would be the one example in season one episode six where the Sultan gets knocked off his horse and becomes disoriented but miraculously recovers to kill several Genoese mercenaries who throughout the series are considered the best of the best. I would rather being it is a docuseries that they would stick more to historical facts instead of theatrics.Otherwise I really enjoyed it,True

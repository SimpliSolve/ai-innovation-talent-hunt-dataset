1,8,An entertaining watch with a simple premise,sjn-88287,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not a complex concept for a show, but a damn fun one. Cops and robbers on a closed course. Doesn't need to be more than that. The show works best when it's focusing on the spectacle of the chase and the overconfidence/skills of the drivers, rather than following the tv trend of spending time showing a contestant's sympathetic backstory to try and invest viewers. This is clearly, purely a dumb fun kinda show, and entering it with that mindset is how it's best consumed. The editing cuts don't always flow and can be choppy, which makes it hard to consistently follow the chase from different angles, but the footage of the camera drones tailing the contestants' car is always very cool. Overall not perfect, but still a good time.",False
2,7,Not bad,phoenixrose-51724,n/a,15/08/2025,This was a fun show to watch so far. I'm glad it wasn't biased. I really thought it would be PC. It's not. Give it a watch.,False
3,8,Fun to watch,rickychanxd-117-738072,n/a,15/08/2025,Good drone footage to go with the pursuit and some fun drivers to watch. Entertaining and an exciting new type of reality show.,False
4,n/a,This is a reality show,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"In case you thought this was a story, it's just people trying stunt driving on a closed course.",False
5,10,we want more episodes,Cinema2kMendoza,n/a,15/08/2025,"The course looks hard to do, and michelle rodriguez is the girl you call when u want to see cars going fast.Basically is a race with the cars-owned by the contestants-to escape cars sho chase them.So. It feels like a furious spin-off because you see fast cars in a real place going fast.the course is really hard, because theres so many curves and places to crash.",False
6,10,I WANT MOOOORRREEEE üòéüòçüòéüòçüòéüòç,c_stammel,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolut sick, crazy, fastpaced, adrenaline filled show for Carlovers EVERYWHERE. So many different drivers with different backgrounds and many many crazy builds. Some typical builds and some more crazy and insane ones. Love this show and i hope we will see more of these very soon. Bring It On üëçüòéüëç",False
7,5,Gets repetitive quickly and lacks balanced risk vs reward,simonkwanfacebook,n/a,15/08/2025,"Note: I've only watched the first episode.The reason I haven't bothered to watch another is that by the end of the first episode, I already determined it's not worth my time compared to the many other wonderful shows I could be watching.The premise is interesting enough: three drivers in their own cars take turns navigating an urban obstacle course to try and find one of two exits while being chased by two pursuers. At the start of each run, Michelle hands the driver a $2K roll of cash. If they make it through an exit, they keep the cash. If not, no cash but the two of three drivers who survived the longest against the pursuers get a chance to try it again, but at night. Night attempts are now worth $5K but instead of two pursuers, there are now three, and now only one exit. Simple enough formula for some cheap thrills.But that's the main problem: it's a very simple formula that gets repetitive quickly. Yes, ALL reality competitions are formulaic, but there's something about the set up and the editing that makes the excitement feel forced.Also, and maybe it's just me, but I genuinely feel bad for the competitors, because they're driving their own cars, which they've often built themselves, and the cars get beat up pretty badly! Between the obstacle course and the pursuers (who are allowed to make physical contact and ram the drivers), there's no way the prize money is worth the repair costs for the majority of the contestants. I've worked on cars and I know how expensive and also emotionally taxing it can be for your pride and joy to be damaged.Netflix had another driving competition show, called Hyperdrive, that was much better. It was much more skills based, with a better calibre of drivers who, thanks to better backstory telling, the audience cared more about. The drivers in Getaway Driver, however, feel disposable and I have the feeling many of them will regret putting their cars through this punishment for 15 minutes of TV fame.",False
8,1,cash grab amateur TV series,stevensxrturbo,n/a,15/08/2025,Rubbish tv series run by fake unskilled drivers! I highly recommend that you do not watch this tv series unless your a child that likes watching kid shows! If it had more aggressive chaser drivers and a tv show spokesperson that was mean to the amateur fake drivers. And also gave more money to then rather then pocket change maybe it would be ok.Also if the drivers had to pass a basic drivers course and that they did not drive an automatic vehicle then let the compete in the challenge.Really a piss poor effort made up of playstat9n and xbox car racers.Also run this same contest in Sydney Australia for season 2.,False

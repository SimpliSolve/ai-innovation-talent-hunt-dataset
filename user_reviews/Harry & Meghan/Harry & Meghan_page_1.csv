1,4,"Ok, Meg = Lady D. Next..",ymesika,n/a,16/08/2025,"I honestly began watching it with the hope to better understand the point of view of this couple. I found the first three episodes mostly boring and solely complaining about paparazzis while itself being a one long paparazzi show. As expected it is 80 percent around Megan and 20 percent about ex-prince Harry.Not sure if it's only me who felt it but it seems like the main thing that this series tries to do is to subconsciously inject into the viewers' mind that Megan is the living Lady Diana. Probably as a way to gain some viewers empathy. However, besize sharing the same paparazzis problem I don't see anything similar between the two.I hardly survived the first episodes and will skip the next ones.So glad the couple is not part of the royal family anymore and I guess I can better understand now why.$$$$. Next.",False
2,6,"Not the best, but these reviews are biased",emo5123,n/a,16/08/2025,"Decent, interesting documentary and important look at the racism inherent in the U. K. & the British Royal Family. It's one thing to think of that much hate being cast on Meghan back in 2016 with the press stirring the pot, but quite another to see so many of the reviews here. A lot of you are going to extreme lengths to hate on this woman that you've never met... including spending the time to hate-watch a multi-episode docuseries. From someone with no preexisting opinions coming into this documentary (I had never paid attention to the tabloids because I have no real interest in the Royal Family) - it's not a great documentary, but it is also not a bad documentary. And a lot of y'all need to find a new hobby.",False
3,4,Mehh..,terrah-91414,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm mean, I just don't understand this documentary? They decided they were going to tell ""their story,"" no one else. Though, everyone of their answers seems irritability vague, throwing daggers of 'hints' as to what they are talking about. Without saying much of anything (anything new), it's coming out real cringe and awkward. Their stories don't always flow cohesively, a few plot-holes to say the least.This episode, omg I must say the suspense was killing me during the wedding. Me, anticipating a gunshot to pop-off at any second, it was too slow for me. I be forgetting we not in America anymore.I kind of feel like this documentary has tarnished my initial impression of 'H & M'. Please stop with cheesy action-movie 'code-names', we can all hear you.",False
4,8,Better than the ratings suggest,annebouscal,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust finished the 6th episode and really enjoyed it. I don't get all all the low ratings, dismal reviews and outright hate in some cases from people who apparently didn't watch the series.As some of the couple's friends and media insiders point out, hate has become an industry on its own which generates revenue as clickbait. A small group of individuals who control multiple user accounts are responsible for the majority of hate being spread online. Reading the negative reviews on this site shows that their influence is huge.The couple come across as intelligent, caring, likeable, and honest. The program is professionally produced in documentary style, but the feel is quite relaxed. As well as first-person accounts, friends, colleagues, and royal watchers appear on camera to add context and depth. Harry and Meghan clearly inspire much loyalty in their supporters including Tyler Perry who provided them with a secure place to live.We get to see lots of candid photos of the couple as well as media and official footage of them with family in official events. Regardless of how a person feels about the British royal family or Harry and Meghan, the program is definitely worth a watch to see another perspective.",True
5,1,So Much Whining,suzyrjago,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two privileged people with more than any normal mortal can imagine going on and on and on and on about how hard their life is. They were given a 34M pound wedding, and she spent more than a million pounds on clothes in one year, but didn't like ""not getting paid"", and split for LA, then were shocked that they lost benefits when they quit and moved to another continent. I would love for them to have the fabulous PRIVATE life they said they wanted. I will not give the PAIR any more clicks. If you notice when you watch, she's wearing the same thing in different scenes supposedly in different time periods. It looks like this was filmed in one day, then edited to make it appear to be a narrative. I think this teeters it right into mocumentary.",False
6,9,Watch for yourself,rich-rossi-50,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't usually pay much attention to royal family stuff. I've seen pieces of royal weddings because someone else was interested in them, but I would never turn on the TV of my own accord. I had seen ""Suits"" years ago and I knew that Harry and Meghan had ""quit"" the royal family or something because the news covers the heck out of it.I figured I would watch this series to get it right from the source.This is a well made documentary that explains the their story. I find both Harry and Meghan to be people that I respect. They are involved in humanitarian programs and had challenges growing up. I have always hated the paparazzi and will continue to do so. The documentary only has 3 of 6 parts released so they haven't covered the split from the royal family yet, but I imagine that I will find their reasons for doing do valid.Finally, I find all these 1 star reviews to be very suspect. To someone who barely pays attention to royal stuff, it certainly seems like there is a well financed smear campaign going on.",False
7,7,Better than I Thought It Would Be,conway3000,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched all 6 episodes yesterday. Based on all of the reviews, I expected it to be boring and snarkier than it was. It was interesting and definitely not nasty. They clearly have a strong marriage. Also what came across loud and clear is that they love living in Montecito. Neither of them enjoyed being Sr Working Royals.- certainly not for a lifetime. But it was Harry who made the decision to leave his Sr Working Royal job. Since Harry is not the heir, he wanted an outside life and profession like many of his cousins. The second half is stronger than the first half. I think they both did a good job presenting their positions.",False
8,1,Unimpressive and Biased,mayrenechester,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was disappointed. The documentary felt more like a one-sided promotion of Harry and Meghan's image than a balanced exploration of their lives.The documentary lacked any real insight into the couple's experiences, and instead relied heavily on anecdotal evidence and hearsay. There was little effort made to delve into the complex issues surrounding their departure from the royal family, and instead, the narrative seemed to be heavily influenced by Harry and Meghan's perspective.Moreover, the documentary failed to provide any real depth or analysis, and instead felt more like a collection of talking heads offering their own opinions. The lack of diversity in the perspectives presented was particularly disappointing.Overall, I would not recommend the Harry & Meghan Netflix documentary to anyone looking for an unbiased and thoughtful exploration of the couple's lives. Instead, it feels like little more than a shallow attempt to burnish their public image.",False
9,8,Interesting how the media,Shiryu05,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can influence the weak-minded and those looking to hate others simply due to personal dislike.I don't feel either way toward the Sussexes but noticed that where the social media community is concerned, there are 2 primary parties: Fervent and ardent supporters of the royal family who are fully blind to the actual mechanism that keeps it running - this also comprises 99% of the communities harassing and creating hate on the Sussexes; and those who support the Sussexes.What I found interesting is that Sussex supporters are called trolls when they defend the couple but the supporters of the British monarchy are ""royalists""... Everyone has flaws, let's not pretend the Queen and her family are perfect. William is currently making the rounds again re: his purported affair with Rose Hanbury but supporters of the RF ignore that. Were the situations reversed and it were the younger brother, it would create more online waves directing more gate their way.Yes, Meghan Markle takes the lead in the couple's relationship as is common where the woman is older. Women mature much faster than their male counterparts and she is at least a decade older than him mentally. Why does this bother so many people re: ""controlling woman""...Meghan and Diana's struggles are very similar in many ways. If the British royal family were as ""in touch"" with the current state of society as their supporters emphasize, they would have evolved. As it stands, they are a symbol of a former colonial power who has never personally apologised, a family who refuses to adapt and embrace the 21st century, and should anyone dare to suggest changes, those who emphasize royal protocol leak and manipulate the media.It's good to view a documentary where they are actually doing the talking.",False
10,7,Educational,mcason77,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI felt compelled to write a review bc all the reviews I read are awful. I did not feel I was watching rich, privileged people complaining about being privileged. This offers a unique view into Harry's background and why the couple has decided to make the decisions they have. I don't love Meghan; Harry really humanizes her. But she has gone through some significant trauma related to trying to fit into the Royal family and the insane paparazzi that surrounds that institution. It's ironic what was going on in the country at the same time this couple got together and when the relationship became public. It begs the age old question: do you give up your right to privacy when you become famous. And adds another layer when, from Harry's perspective, he didn't pursue this. It was his birth right (curse). Looking forward to watching the rest of this series.",True
11,1,Absolute Garbage,asoomij,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is very different from the rest of Netflix documentaries. The other said is not given a voice and the couple keeps failing to build up a solid case in regards to ""racism"". They keep mentioning words like 'agenda' without explaining what those agendas are. How did Meghan experience racism is not explained, who was racist towards her is not mentioned, how was the press racist towards her when there wasn't a single article talking about her skin colour? They kept saying they moved to the US because they want privacy yet go on to share intimate photos, images of their kids, videos of their daily walking around the beach when the rest of us were forced to quarantine.",False
12,n/a,You're only getting one side of a slanted tale,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the series contrived and one sided. I do not feel sorry for two ADULTS who had very cushy upbringings. Death and Divorce occurs and most the ADULTS I know have gone on to lead exemplary lives without self promoting by crapping on family members. The paparazzi sux and shame on anyone who reads trash. Harry and Meghan's version of events is just as tabloid like, misleading and fantastical. No pity for either one and completely no respect for them either. The two are grifters wallowing in their own self pity while sitting in a mansion. We will never get the other side but by fact checking what comes out the Windsor's mouths has proven to be a lot of falsehoods and so whats?",False
13,1,Grotesque,nataliecarry,n/a,16/08/2025,"They come across as entitled brats.No one disliked them until they became the biggest hypocrits ever telling everyone how to be environmentally friendly then fly everywhere in a private jet. Then lie and over embellish. Why would you want to keep your titles that were given to you by such a disgusting and racist institution. Oh - money 💰
Bore off already.I hope everyone sees through them and their massive egos.Such a shame that Harry comes across as this absolute whipped melt. It's actually grotesque.Now memoirs. Really? How many times can you flog a dead horse?Literally no one cares. The scene in the car - omg. I had secondhand embarasment.I genuinely feel that Harry is deeply troubled and Megan is exploiting him. I mean, she did pretend she didn't know anything about the royals but her friends said she was obsessed with Diana. ( and she visited Buckingham Palace as a child - photos to prove) and she did say she was gonna go find a wealthy and famous man after suits? And there is video of her boasting about being able to cry on command.Anyone that believes or feels sorry for these 2 needs to give their head a wobble...",False
14,1,"Staged, one sided and out of touch with current times",sergeialexander,n/a,16/08/2025,Truth is never one sided. Never.H&M don't seem to take any responsibility for what's been happening to them at all? Come on.Also - constant moaning and complaining - omg. Reality check - would people of Iran and Ukraine want to swap places with H&M (and their tiny cottage)? 10000%. Would H&M swap places with people of Ukraine and Iran? I doubt it.Time to move on. Please.Note to Netflix: there are so many struggling artists and film-makers who would love your help and support so their voices can be seen and heard....and yet you invest 100 mlns of dollars into something that has no originality or uniqueness.,False
15,10,"The Art of Love, Great Documentary",KassyL,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can feel their honesty, humility, pains and sorrow. It is really beyond me how anyone cannot feel the deep love radiating from these two people every time you see them. Every photo, every unauthorized tv series or movie...I love them even more. It has nothing to do with their celebrity. I can feel their genuine honesty and appreciate their transparency and sympathize with their heartbreaking heartwarming story. It's good to hear from them directly. Their wisdom in telling their own story instead of being victims of soo many misrepresentations is profound. I don't know them, of course, however their authenticity radiates through the screen. Harry and Meghan, I pray that those who love you creates a shield of armor against all of the hate and negativity. This isn't about whether I agree that there should be a British Monarchy, its not about Meghan identifying (or not) with her Blackness...its about two people in Love...that's it. Now a beautiful family of 4. I wish you every happiness and peace of mind.",False
16,2,Self Indulgent and Planned,lisaboekenoogen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was sort of as expected. I wanted to feel sympathy for Meghan at times, a couple episodes in, but this documentary was so very obviously planned as a fallback, with all the emotional vlogs over a number of years, that by the end I was over the drama. The victim/race card is hashed and rehashed, but what if it's actually not race and its actually just personality? We're not actually allowed to ever say that thoogh. Meghan comes across as someone who thought she could change an old institution, but when she couldn't change centuries of tradition, she decided to destroy and monetize it. I realize I'm not allowed to say this, but the modern monarchy doesn't come across as racist and I believe the initially welcomed Meghan, which means there is either a massive conspiracy, as they suggest, or maybe she was tough to deal with for other reasons. Based on how this was contrived I'm inclined to believe the later. Of course no one is perfect and I'm sure there are individuals here and there in the institution with racist views. Harry seems genuine and Meghan is definitely an actress, with a well timed pause and tear.The rich, money grabbing victim card just doesn't work for me.",False
17,9,A well done personal film,sagashop70,n/a,16/08/2025,"One thing that I do not understand is why people hate it so much, Meghan Markel. The only thing that is left to try to understand the hate she receives in the media and social media is because she is mixed race. Megan and Harry's documentary was announced several months ago and premiered recently. Some people were upset because the first trailer premiere coincided with the visit of the Prince of Wales and his wife to the nation. Coincidence or not, the hate continues. The documentary opens the door to the couple's world, showing never seen photos and videos. It is a space where they tell the story of their lives before and after they became a couple. The film is well-made and includes interviews with people close to the couple, such as friends, family, and people who work with them.Some people criticize them for speaking up, especially her, but I question why people consume whatever media story they feed and prefer that to whatever they want to say on their terms. Many people accuse her of making him break with his family, but why blame her? Did she force him? Apparently, no, because he says it was his choice, but still, people don't listen.I have seen over the years many documentaries about the royal family from different perspectives and presented by many ""royal experts."" The members of the family themselves have participated in very few films. I remember in the 1990s when Diana was interviewed after her separation and when she spoke up about what today Harry and Meghan continue to talk about: the rigidity of the royal family and the need the institution has for change. And hearing both films tell us that little has changed in one of the world's oldest monarchies. However, even though Diana's words were controversial then, she never was attacked as Meghan has been. And maybe, one big reason was that Diana was white, and Meghan was not. People can be racists even without accepting they are, which is called unconscious bias.""Harry & Meghan"" is a good documentary for those interested in the royal family and the many layers such an institution has.",False
18,7,"Not so bad, the real point is something else",Monicca93,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been reading the reviews and I don't totally agree with them,Nobody is saying anything against the Royal family in this doc, at least I haven't seen or heard,
Harry has lost his mother, the reason for that was that D was being chased from the paparazzi,
The main topic here is about the impact they and the family have/had from the paparazzi,
Everybody that are mocking them would've not endure a month in their shoes,
I don't see Meghan mocking as well, normal people are not used to the Royal family traditions logically.I see them trying to be normal family, I see Harry looking out for his family, longing for his mother and doing everything to not let history repeat itself, that's trauma for life!",False
19,1,Enough already,tessa-454-754454,n/a,16/08/2025,"I fast forwarded through Ep. 1. This couple really love to talk about themselves...ad nauseam and to a self obsessed degree. She comes across as way too savvy and ambitious, and he is just a bore. So six episodes of two people whose sense of entitlement surely outstrips their intelligence. America get over your fascination with the Royal House of Windsor and its wounded wives.This is a rehash of the Oprah interview where Meghan talked endlessly of her suicidal thoughts when she was pregnant and Harry trashed his brother. So Harry is still trashing his brother and his father and there is still the endless agonizing over his mother's death and the way the press hounded and abused her. When will the obession ever stop?",False
20,8,I am British,karenchapman-87572,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am British and I know what a despicable group of people the tabloid press are. I thought it was very telling having read all the vitriolic articles in the press about her baby shower to see the actual reality which was it was paid for by her friends in America who were entitled to spend their money how they pleased! I literally remember the ""avocado"" comparison in the tabloids between her and Kate - it was shameful and obvious. I'm not sure I'm sold on the racial bias I personally believe it was more to do with their increasing popularity and Harry's refusal to toe the establishment lines. I point out that I'm not a Harry and Megan sycophantic fan nor do I hate the Royal Family. I think you are just left with a sense of incredible sadness that in how the whole thing unraveled into such a mess and destroyed so many family members. Do I believe every minute detail? Possible not but perception is reality and if there is a slightly glossy ""Netflix"" sheen to this it doesn't detract from the very sad fall out of the vicious UK tabloid media in all its forms.",True
21,7,There's two sides to every story,sharliep,n/a,16/08/2025,"For the past several years I have read the gossip columns about the Royals, mainly about Meghan and her temper/the way she treats staff.However, like my title says, there's two sides to every story. After the second part of this documentary came out, it truly gave me Princess Diana vibes with how they had to deal with the paparazzi and how she really wasn't treated the best. None of us actually know what happens behind closed doors, but I honestly have more sympathy for the two of them than I started with.Final note - for those giving reviews about them whining about everything - Meghan wasn't brought up as a Royal. I can't imagine how hard it would be to fall in love with someone and have your world and the way you have to behave and do EVERYTHING turned upside down. And then the backlash received...heck I'd be a little whiny too.",False
22,1,Theres is no point watching,tjbgzvtyn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't hate these two in the way that a lot of people do, nor do I think the the RF is perfect.But dear god these two seem to have a problem Of being permanent victims. They never gave it a proper chance nor did they fully communicate with each other what would be expected. They thought that everyone would love them without actually trying.""Their story"" and ""their truth"" just seems so cheap and moany. Yes they have issues and we can all sympathise because even if they're rich they still have feelings but come on. Arguing over the size of a free house? It's hard to take them seriously when they remind me of my 5 & 7 year old nephews arguing over who gets to sit on which end of the sofa.",False
23,2,"I WANTED to be interested in this series, but UGH these two!!!",LiaS_12,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boring, boring, boring, and painfully self-serving - definitely not the ""documentary"" I expected from the marketing hype. And I thought these two left the UK in part to protect their family's privacy - in which case, I'm very confused about why they keep trying to inject themselves into the limelight.In the end, I'm left thinking ""why should I care about these two?"" After enduring the boring first 3 episodes, I really don't.As an American who was originally sympathetic to H&M's situation, I believe I'm Netfix's target audience for this series. But if this is the best they can do, I think Netflix really wasted their money. I won't be watching anymore...",False
24,n/a,Meghan's Niece,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this not really knowing what to expect but a few minutes in I thought what could they have to say that could stretch across 6 episodes? Well, in this first 3 episodes nothing new really or all that interesting. For me the one thing that stood out is her relationship with her niece. Yes, Meghan has a neice.We all knew her mother was the only blood relative reported to have been to the wedding and we're aware of the drama with her father...no family is perfect...but the revelation of a niece was, well, a revelation.Meghan invited all kinds of ""friends"" to her wedding, even Oprah who we know she did not know for real yet she did not invite her actual niece she actually had a good relationship with. Why? Because she was so concerned with the possible debacle of explaining why her half sister (the niece's mother) was not invited. If Meghan was ever pressed to say why she didn't invite her half sister she could have simply stated she had no relationship with her but she has a relationship with her niece...case closed. Period. For someone who is so well-spoken and clever as Meghan you think it would have been a no-brainer, nope, instead she cared only about herself and not her neice's feelings. If you ever get invited to a family member's wedding this would have been the wedding. I would have been heartbroken if she was my aunt. That decision, to me, speaks volumes about Meghan.",False
25,1,Insufferable documentary,daviddeloso,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is so confused. It's became apparent to me on Episode 3 that these couple of attention seeking celebs are just taking us viewers for a ride. I didn't see any evidence of the things their accusing the royal family, media, Meg's family etc of. Also clear to me is the producers and director have no respect for the intelligence of us viewers. They think they just make up things and we just believe them as true. Sorry but your lies can't be your truth.What's also clear is that Meg the actress planned an exit route even before she officially joined the family. All the photos and video recordings prove just that. I can't discount the possibility that she used her race as one of the exit arguments right from the start. All the comparisons with the late Princess Diana is sickening. Diana was universal admired and loved. Meg is almost universally hated, especially now she has exposed herself. Harry also exposed himself as damaged good, gullible, suggestible and lacking longterm understanding of the consequences of his actions.I wasted 6 hours watching this garbage from Netflix. I'm stopping my subscription.",False

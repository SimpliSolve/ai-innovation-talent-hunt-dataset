1,7,The essence of American 21st century nihilism,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As the documentary ""Cusp"" (2021 release; 92 min.) opens, we get to know three teenage girls (Brittney; Autumn; and Aaloni; each is about 15-16 yrs) somewhere in central Texas. School has just let out for the summer, and each of them is overcome with anxiety on how to navigate their very existence. Every day brings the same routine (hang out; drink; smoke; drugs; guys pressuring them). Can the circle be broken? Just watch.Couple of comments: this is the feature length debut of co-directors Parker Hill and Isabel Bethencourt. They had seemingly unfettered access to the three girls and their circle of friends, family and acquaintances over the entire summer. A very disturbing picture emerges, as we watch how these girls and the people around them seemingly have no hope of anything positive happening in their lives. (Along the way we learn that all three girls have been used, abused, and molested or raped, either by a close family friend or a so-called boyfriend.) And what to make of these guys hanging out with them, ever ready to pounce? At some point one of the girls mentions that their friend Nina was raped by a (boy)friend). Comments one of the guys: ""but they were both intoxicated, so it couldn't have been rape"". SAY WHAT??? Also noteworthy: not a single of the young people or the grown-ups we see in this documentary appears to have a job. Not one. Ultimately the documentary is dark, very dark. It frankly represents the essence of American 21st century nihilism. The film makers do a terrific job of capturing it, warts and all. The documentary makes at times for difficult viewing, but really demands and captures your attention. As for the negative reviews on here, please note that the term ""toxic masculinity"" is NOT mentioned in the documentary itself. Also, these so-called reviewers are unwilling or unable to distinguish between the topic covered by the documentary (which they hate), versus whether the documentary itself is any good (in fact's it's very good--there is a reason this is currently rated 90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes).""Cusp"" premiered at this year's Sundance Festival to positive buzz. It started airing on Showtime last weekend, and is now available on SHO On Demand (where I caught it last night). If you are interested in getting a sense of what life without meaning looks like in this country and in this era, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,3,A less glamorous'American Honey',cindyrellaexists,n/a,16/08/2025,Trash. These juveniles are representing the future of America. B-O-R-I-N-G Their struggles have been done by past generations but without the lamest excuse for being inconsiderate to others. This film just gives us a glimpse into the lives of those stuck in little circles of self importance. I was that age but I don't recall any of my friends being this stupid. I hope they grow up and do something with themselves.,False
3,3,Hard To Know What To Make Of This Doc,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"In general, I tend to be a pretty big fan of human nature/drama documentaries, which is what drew me to ""Cusp"". But this little documentary is so far-reaching (in terms of themes) and so hands-off (in terms of content) that it is difficult to know exactly what to make of it--only that I didn't enjoy it all that much.For a very basic overview, ""Cusp"" follows three teenage girls during a Texas summer as they deal with male relationships, various degrees of troubled home situations, drugs/alcohol/parties, and their entrance (or lack thereof) into a larger or adult world.Though obviously there is always some editorial content in any documentary (simple deciding what footage gets used and what doesn't provides that), in ""Cusp"" it truly comes at that very minimum of an amount. It's not like directors Isabel Bethencourt & Parker Hill actively ask the girls any questions or probe into certain topics. This is very much ""point the camera and let it capture what it may"" style filmmaking.On one hand, this tactic produces what is probably the closest-to-reality vision of events one could ever see (even considering that the nature of the present camera itself may lead to performative aspects). In other words, it captures the essence of reality simply by not pressing for it. There are indeed a few moments of clarity where the girls stumble across relatable quandaries that have been pondered by young people across the decades.But that leads to what I consider to be the major problem with ""Cusp"": just what, exactly, is it going for or hoping to accomplish? Is it about the fraught nature of teenage girl-dom? Free/aimless summers of youth? Unstable home lives? Complicated relationships with boys? Because the filmmakers don't define any boundaries, it can be difficult to know what the take-home points are supposed to be.Overall, I think that one's enjoyment of ""Cusp"" may largely be determined by an individual's ability (or interest) to ascribe meaning to mundanity. This film gives the viewer absolutely nothing in terms of parameters, so it is entirely up to us to piece together the take-home messages. I guess I prefer my documentaries with a bit more of an ingrained thesis or ""leading questions"", hence the low star ranking.",False
4,9,Super nostalgic!!!,billiemorris,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whoa! I cant believe the literal town i grew up in is featured in this! This is good ole' Copperas Cove, TX where there's nothing but fast food joints, pawn shops, and dollar store's. I'm a bit older and was doing the same exact thing's in the late 90s- 2000s. Nothing to do but get as drunk and high as possible to drown your misery.",False
5,3,Shower required after viewing.,shannon-bill,n/a,16/08/2025,"With an average IQ hovering right around room temperature everyone featured in this documentary make tree stumps seem erudite. Luckily these folks don't represent average America. Among the rural lower class the filmmakers have found a pocket of people from a Jerry Springer-like ""Bizarro World.""Like rabbits these people are destined to reproduce early and often and thus guarantee there will be plenty of fodder for future trash TV shows, documentaries like this and to keep welfare rolls stocked. These are the kind of people who keep the American meth industry afloat.This documentary offers nothing in the way of solutions nor does it explore the causes. Thinking people will instantly recognize that education is the way out of living hells such as this. Our ""stars"" in this movie bask in ignorance and apathy.All that said it can be diverting to watch our nation's underbelly writhe and struggle for 90 minutes a slice.",False
6,9,Why the low rating?,missbestworst,n/a,16/08/2025,"These girls reminded me of my besties back in the day. I don't get all the low ratings, it was interesting and subtle with some beautiful and stark back drops. Honest and doesn't really ""pick a side"". We are all awkward, and want to be loved/accepted, and vain, and funny, and wild... especially as teens. I really enjoyed it. And I definitely fell in love with every single character. Give it more than 20 mins. It grows on you.",False
7,1,Horrible Parents Have Horrible Kids,dfresh-01384,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPass on this just another wannabe ""KIDS"" . This is one of the worst supposedly coming of age films. These girls have zero boundaries from their parents and learned nothing in school it seems as they have the IQ and personality of a rock . Kids just be sleeping over guys houses, guys sleeping over their house , drinking , smoking, doing drugs , having sex and we are supposed to be shocked these girls aren't going anywhere in life? How do the girls have zero hobbies , sports or jobs? Not even babysitting for some extra cash . Somehow they afford all the drugs, beer, alcohol, cigarettes, gas, phones etc doing absolutely nothing every single day but partying ? Supposedly they have this tough life but we see they have zero responsibility and do whatever they want day after day ... if you wanna watch what happens when crappy parents have kids and watch said girls at 15 yr old do whatever they want during a boring summer the movie is for you. Best is when the one dad who served in the military doesn't like what his 13 yr old is wearing the 15 yr old goes berserk saying meanest shit like wish you weren't my dad and we hate you no reason to have any sympathy for these brats as she's chugging a beer in her room like wtf . Girls of course make a ton of dumb decisions like we all do but just cant connect with them .Sounds of Cicadas is the basic soundtrack and get on your nerves after 5 mins.",True
8,4,No One to Like,jimdex,n/a,16/08/2025,You really don't care what happens to these girls who have no respect for themselves and no hope for a better life. The result is depressing without being interesting. A documentary about anthills would be more involving.,False
9,1,Carbon copy of another Sundance doc,GlorKohl-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Female version of ""Rich HIll""- same identical format, teen drama backed by intriguing landscapes. Just a rehash- so watch both and compare. 10 years later, more convincing evidence that this generation of poverty will never rise. 3 protagonists with immature parents living in reduced circumstances, however in Rich Hill one characters had enough pluck to seek a way out of his situation. Here there is such lassitude, such a sense of ""life is what happens to you,"" rather than electing any control over the circumstances and the resignation is truly palpable. Just timely due to the current judicial hatred of women and girls, and Texas has that identifier solidified.",False
10,8,"American/Texan men treat women just as bad as Islam does (or rather, the western VIEW of Islam)",The_Melancholic_Alcoholic,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the West, we think of ourselves as treating women with the utmost respect, and we think of Islam as a culture which treats women as second rate citizens. But ""Cusp"" shows clearly that American culture, isn't all that different from Islam. Or, what Westerners like to tell themselves Islamic culture does to women.""Cusp"" follows three 15-16 year old Texan girls (Brittney, Autumn and Aaloni), on the cusp of womanhood. It seems that the filmmakers met these three teens through a sexual assault group therapy for teens in rural Texas. Both Brittney and Autumn are part of the 85-90% group of rape victims: they have been raped by people they knew: family friends, who were friends with one or both of their parents. Autumn was raped by her mother's best friend, a man, and this is the reason her parents have split up and she lives with her father. Brittney has been raped by her father's childhood buddy. The relationship between the two men isn't made entirely clear, or, I've missed it. Aaloni has an absentee father, who is in the military and who has been in Afghanistan for many years. The problem here is that when he gets back, he wants to completely lord over his family, and Aaloni doesn't accept that no more. Things come to ahead during her sisters 13th birthday when her dad (who's never shown) tells her sister that her bare midriff shirt is too revealing. Aaloni explodes: who does this man think he is? We get the impression her father acts more like a dictator who orders his family around than a parent who protects and listens. Aaloni's relationship with boys her own age isn't that much better: ""You can say no to boys all you want, but in the end they're gonna get their way"" she says. When asked why that is, she replies ""boys are very powerful"". Autumn, equally, is disappointed by her older boyfriend who promised her to not have sex with her but ""I guess, apparently that one time, he forgot all about his promise.""The impression this documentary leaves of how American teen girls are threated is pretty bleak. They are subject to either outright rape, or forced into having unwanted sex before they are ready to do that, often with boys they consider their boyfriends. One might claim they are an exception, but recent news stories of white men who get away with rape, either because they're rich, in a position of power over those women or well known or all three, are seeping through to the media. Like trump, Larry Nassar (raped American gold medal gymnast girls) and SCOTUS judge B. Kavanaugh, we get the distinct impression these cases go underreported. It's almost as if the American patriarchy/meda complex doesn't like to report about (white) males who rape the girls who are part of their own family or in their circle of friends.And the 10 previous reviews here don't make me hopeful this American culture will change anytime soon.In that sense, the ending of ""Cusp"", a glossy MTV-styled quick montage of happy flashes of the good times the girls dó have, and which also shows their friendship with each other and with other female adults, seems somewhat out of touch. I guess the filmmaker wanted to end on a positive note and give the viewer with a bit of optimism.8 oth 10.The Melancholic Alcoholic.",False

12,1,Awful,sunnyanita,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rambling and ridiculous. Don't waste the time. It is apparent that they were trying to create something that had great meeting we're teenagers were involved. I found it completely unrelatable. Since it is a quasi reality movie oh, there is no script and due to this you have to try to decipher half mumbled and incoherent sentences from young women. I just do not see how this film is relevant and serves any purpose in society.",False
13,2,WTF Am I Watching?,operacha-39498,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this after seeing it on a top 10 list. Waiting for it to get to some point. Watched it all the way through. Seems like the filmmakers just setup a camera, took the resulting footage and with minimal editing slapped it together for an hours and half long movie. What a waste of time.",False
14,2,Telling story of why we have people like MTG & Lauren Boebert,peggyatthemovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you want to know how people like Marjorie Taylor Greene, Gym Jordan and Lauren Boebert get to power - then this is the documentary for you. Useless trash parents have kids when they are essentially kids themselves, so said kids grow up to be exactly like them as they have no role models. They do however, find time for drugs, alcohol, cigs, guns and phones. They live in trailers hence the word trailer trash comes to mind - there is one shot of the girl Brittany who is 15 at the time, sleeping at her b/f's house where he has a confederate flag for a curtain.. it's a hellscape for sure. But they could have broken the chain and seemingly none of them want to. The epitome of 'barefoot & pregnant' along with child molestation and rape to boot. This backwards town stuff is the thing nightmares are made of. And it never ends.",True

1,n/a,Regurgitated rubbish,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is just a rehash of a doc from a few years back which was written and presented by Bernard O'Mahoney which I have on DVD, and an absolute hatchet job at that. Looks like they stole the same footage and threw in a couple more interviews, including interviewing O'Mahoney which is just odd! Scrapes the barrel of a tired story that for some reason they think there are people out there who still care. Very amateur and feels like it was put together by some clowns trying to make a quick buck. Signature/Revelation films need to change its name to 'Poundland Films ltd'. Probably cost less than a pound to make.",False

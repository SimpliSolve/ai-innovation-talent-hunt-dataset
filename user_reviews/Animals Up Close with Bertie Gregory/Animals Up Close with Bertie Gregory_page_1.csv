1,10,Never thought I would love documentaries in water.,mariadamnyoureyes,n/a,16/08/2025,The action music is so good. The cameras are HD. Everything you love the sunset the animlas almost anything is in it and they capture it soo good like insane. I've seen documentaries such as our planet and planet earth but this one is on another level I gotta tell you guys. I mean you guys should defenetly watch it till the end. If you guys just watch the first episode you will just fall in love with it. It's something beyond your expectations. Like so much better than what you think. I really loved it so much and want you guys to watch it you guys won't regret it. It's just so good guys. Just watch it!,False

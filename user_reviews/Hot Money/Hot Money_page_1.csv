1,6,Wes Clark Jr. was right,info-19352,n/a,16/08/2025,The movie is a must see for everyone. Important message. The true nature of capitalism is money and greed. Wes Jr. Sees that. His father does not.,False
2,5,Informative on financial aspects - a bit goldilocks though,Polly_Styrene,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed very much and was informed by the business and economic discussions which have knowledge value outside the climate discussion, however the film works hard on climate fear which is dealt with a bit hysterically as tends to be the case when millennial Trustifarian elites discuss the topic.Not the only thing, but one thing I thought the film maker dealt with dishonestly was holding up the netherlands use of bicycles as a virtuous and ""non fossil fuel"" mode of transport, as if North American's would not ride their bikes IF THEY COULD. Our topography, geographical distances and weather means that only a small portion of us can rely on our bikes to get where we need to go. Many urban centres in NA are similar to Toronto where we have 9 months of ice/snow and a very hilly city and much larger distances than they do in say Amsterdam. I know as I lived there that you can't compare the 2 situations. Torontonians don't have the public transport infrastructure to rely on it. And we have rules against bringing bikes on trains. So one cannot realistically use their bike for a work commute. My train ticket is $18 from a suburb to downtown where you can connect with the underground trains or buses for an additional cost. . It costs $300-$450 per month to park at the train station (not downtown, money can't buy a parking spot there) and then there's the cost of the train ticket itself. I would like to ride my bike to the train station, but that costs $$ and you are not guaranteed a spot and often there isn't one and you aren't allowed to lock your bike to the fence (it'll get removed). And my bike was stolen 4 times. Worse if if you need to travel to another urban centre - a budget rail ticket costs $400 to Montreal last I priced it (1 way). Although the film does arrive at the need for governmental intervention in the matters of infrastructure, a valuable observation.",False
3,1,Jr needed to stay home,Asiadef,n/a,16/08/2025,Could have been compelling had they picked better presenters. Gen Clark has certainly earned his seat but isn't it about time for Jr to stop living off of Dad's reputation? What credibility does he have? None and I think we're all sick of hearing from the trustafarian generation. Next.,False
4,1,We'll travel the world in our gas vehicles and complain about global warming!,muddd,n/a,16/08/2025,"What are your solutions? If you like to hear people complain for 2 hours this is your film...there's about 4 minutes where they talk about solutions but they are pretty thin. Want change then tell people what the solutions are, there are solutions.",False
5,10,Eye Opening,George62,n/a,16/08/2025,An eye-opening and intricate look at the global financial system. Sometimes shocking and sometimes funny; revealing just how precarious the whole thing is as it is tied up with mortgages insurance and debt. If people think 2008 was bad... guess what is coming. I also appreciate the film spends the latter half looking at solutions.,False
6,10,A timely documentary that everyone needs to see.,missinnayang,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hot Money delves into how deeply connected the economy and environment are and no matter what your beliefs are, you need to see this film. The human race is on its way down a dangerous path and we need to educate ourselves before it's too late. The relationship and banter between General Wesley Clark and Wes Clark Jr. are a perfect fit for this type of doc. 10/10!",False
7,10,HOT MONEY FUN TO WATCH,jay-251-777157,n/a,16/08/2025,"Populated throughout with clever, animated, New Yorker style cartoons, fantastic old timey ""money shots"" and the wisdom of international business experts, the newly minted film, ""Hot Money"" is a heap of fun to watch.It exposes how today's moneylenders tie society up in knots. It took a military hero and his son to find out how to make sense of it all with uncanny humor and wit.Who would of thought that a sudden global onset of fire, flood, and pestilence would turn money into chump change, time into currency, and transform the clich√©, a day late and a dollar short into a prophesy?Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander, General Wesley Clark and his son Wes Clark Jr. take us on a rollicking trip through the new reality of how money may no longer make the world go 'round.Catastrophic climate change combined with looming financial turmoil is making it clear that the only bank account that matters may be the number of livable days and years we have left. The good General and his son show us how to balance the books before the closing bell.Hot Money is rich with historical context. It severs the knot of economic and political forces that may lead to societal collapse.This investment in knowledge with a little luck, will pay dividends in the future.Hot Money may be just what we need to avoid burning down tomorrow.",False

9,10,A Great Doc To Join The Conversation,Dzi22,n/a,16/08/2025,A great film that brings insights to how the economy and environment are connected with a bi-partisan approach.

10,9,Mortgages and Climate Change 101,sunbath-shows-q,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mortgage backed securities, derivatives, the federal reserve - very interesting stuff against the backdrop of climate change. A mixture of interesting educational commentary and felt like the father and son dynamic worked well - I'm sure similar generational conversations are going on everywhere - interesting that the former General is more optimistic about solving problems than the son.",False
11,10,Very important and enjoyable film,nbibic-19262,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't recommend this film enough. The film provides an eye-opening analysis of the flaws in our financial system and how this system is leading us towards self-destruction in various ways, such as the irreparable harm the system is inflicting on our climate and what this means for us and our democracy, which this film highlights well. I enjoyed the funny and personable moments in the film between Wes Clark Jr. and his father Wesley Clark, they share a very interesting relationship and they are both passionate about making the world a better place in their own unique ways.",False
12,9,Sobering,livrobert,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hot Money is a really interesting and informative documentary about how the financial system affects climate change. While the film warns of the potential dire consequences of climate change, there is hope in knowing that we still have time to stop it, and the film offered up many solutions to this crisis. I also appreciated how there were moments of levity in such a serious film.",False
13,10,An amazing documentary that left me speechless!,DZLConsulting,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great film! I typically don't watch documentaries, but this film left me wanting more! It's fun while still being informative, and the timeliness of it all makes it even better. 10/10!",False
14,10,Absolutely Brilliant,lastdiane,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredible movie that really strikes home, given the current weather disaster in Texas and the recent news of rising home insurance in Florida. We're in trouble and we're in trouble now.",False
15,10,Hot Information,info-54468,n/a,16/08/2025,General Wesley Clack and Wes Clark Jr both give amazing insight on the very close relationship between the environment and economy.

16,10,Truth as Sword,seanmulvihill-03723,n/a,16/08/2025,"When noone speaks, power wins.
When someone speaks, power wins.
When someone listens, power suffers.
When more than one speak, power retreats.

Speak.

17,10,"Smart ,Funny and Scary as Hell!",Steve221,n/a,16/08/2025,"Global finance and climate change; debt, your mortgage and insurance payments made understandable and entertaining. An eerie glimpse into a not-so-distant future and what we can do to avert collapse.",False

20,8,Super informative but you may want to watch it in 2 sittings,Laura-216,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great presentation of some really heady material! The animations and humor help a lot as well as the very genuine feeling that you are going along on an exploratory journey together with the Clarks (General Wesley Clark and his son)- father & son duo who are the advocates and walk you through the information. It is very long but so incredibly timely and relatable to so much happening in our world right now - climate change, fires, real estate, investing. Upper class high school students and college students should be required to watch this - such a great lesson and call to save our planet!",False
21,8,Highly recommend!,bainesalexis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary was extremely interesting to watch and very timely. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is interested in climate change and how it'll effect not only our environment, but our economy as well.",True

1,10,Universal Reflections of Youth,ayhansalamci,n/a,15/08/2025,"With a calm opening, my stress coefficient increased with each passing minute. It's a very scary situation for young people to doubt their independence in the future and unfortunately, these and all similar concerns are experienced in almost every country. Sometimes I can't help but think about this, I had a depressive personality with similar thoughts in my adolescence and I must admit that I still carry traces of those days. I don't know if all these future concerns are a state of extreme fear of the unknown or just a romanticized situation.I didn't realize how time flew by while watching expressive faces and their expressive thoughts. I recommend real people who know what empathy is who are interested in someone else's problem and who like to brainstorm about that problem to watch this documentary at the first opportunity. The thoughts, shooting angles, and the open minded and brave appearance of almost all young people that illuminated the inner world of each individual and visualized the moments they wanted to be in in the future from their perspective were magnificent. In order to share the concerns of young people and even find solutions, it is necessary to have empathy.",False
2,9,Inspiring,LaDolceCinta,n/a,15/08/2025,"Simplicity is one of the keys of this documentary.One more, honesty which it's given via the multiples voices and looks captured by the directors of the film.A must watch for policy makers everywhere -even so the focus is Italy-, because it gets the point of how common youth feels disappointed with public policies that don't pay attention to them.The disoriented vigor, the beautiful candor of the youth it's something that had attracted Italian art for centuries. This movie return to that theme; it''s a search for truths among those who have plenty inquieres more than certainties. A triumph of this doc it's that from those innocent minds it extracts interesting and mature reflections.",False
3,10,Excellent Work,EdgarST,n/a,15/08/2025,"I recently watched two outstanding documentaries, on very current issues, even though they were released several years ago. One called «Futura», about the vision of the future held by today's youth, was co-directed by Alice Rohrwacher, Pietro Marcello and Francesco Munzi; and the other talks about the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, titled «Of Land and Bread», and directed by the Syrian musician and filmmaker Ehab Tarabieh.«Futura» is a beautiful compendium of young people's thinking, recorded in many places in Italy, from cinematic locations that we have seen in many films before, such as Roma, Venezia and Napoli, to neighborhoods, small towns and communities where it was probably the first time that a team of filmmakers arrived. It is an Italian film, about the voices of Italian boys and girls, but it is surprising how much they resemble young people from all over the world.The number of testimonies is large and varied, and the opinions of the youngsters are lucid and help us understand what these young people face in the era of a dying empire, devalued public education, savage capitalism, ethical and moral crisis, which translate into unemployment, hopelessness and an understandable rebellion.It is very illuminating to listen to them, to know their reasons, their vision of the future and to see that there is no lack of optimists even in deprivation. We older adults are accused, with good reason, of not listening to young people and, worse still, of refusing to learn new and necessary things to have a better life. It is also interesting to listen to young people from an ancient culture who express themselves and reason with order and logic and contrast with many boys and girls reduced to a poor educational level, who lack of information and the knowledge of processes, a deprivation for which the State and the private sector of the country are responsible.Although the film is directed by three filmmakers, the voice we hear most behind the camera is that of Alice Rohrwacher, whom I admire and who does not disappoint me here. They do not fool her... In her dialogues with rich boys and girls, she confronts them and, by contrast, shows how alarming it is to know that the ""future"" of the title depends largely on economically favored sectors alienated by their privileges. A highly recommended documentary.",False
4,5,Viva youth....but also a note on how the Futura ends.,ThurstonHunger,n/a,15/08/2025,"Saw this in the library, and thought it might be interesting to watch with another new year on the horizon. Noticed Alice Rohrwacher involved in this project, and while I feel this film is sort of up to the viewer in terms of what s/he might take out of it, her ""Happy as Lazzaro"" is highly recommended for all, especially for those who enjoy film and reading as a way to travel beyond the boundaries of their selves and their countries.As for this documentary, clearly based in Italy, there is a universal feel. I'm pretty old, older than the sum of decades spent on this planet, but I remember being young. I do appreciate the revolution is never wasted on the youth, but a reactionary response can lay waste to the youth.I had heard some about Venice restricting tourism, which is mentioned in the travels herein. Sadly, I must admit I knew less about the Diaz School and the cruel cabineri response to that. The shadows of that event are cast on a latter segment in the movie, but through-out there is a sense of youth having an agitated energy towards the trappings of their station, no matter if it is a beauty or boxing school.It was interesting that the interviews were exclusively captured on youths in packs. The camera would take a slow portrait of the members and then key in on one or two speakers, sometimes while tracking others reactions. Maybe more a function of technique, than trying to lump individuals into a generation/crowd.I don't trust crowds much, and I do remember being young and not trusting older people. Maybe the camera would be too much of a drug if filming single dreamers, but dreams might be harder to ride like kites in the air when 10, 15 or 20 others are all attached?Was there one segment from years ago. I think so, and that recalled the ""Seven Up"" series which is far more triumphant in my mind, while still tackling that same sort of energy that is ready to rise up. Going back and back to those individuals, we see a more balanced view of how youthful ideals and aging get intertwined to the point where one is not sure where the weed is, and where the flower is.Anyways, I hope 2024 keeps idealism and rebellion driving our world forward. I am keenly aware of my ""status quo addiction"" and do want to feel that progress is possible, and well beyond the mere financially measured aspects of it.One thing I have to say I found humorous. The closing shot we have a young boy, on a snowy expanse wandering away from the camera. I assume one it is a ~5 year old child of one of the three directors. The child pushes his independence in playful defiance, but in distant background cars are hurtling past. The credits roll, the child continues his expedition....alone....and then we see off to the right and parent. Not exactly helicoptering, as the phrase goes here in the US, but perhaps akin to a shepherd. At first gently, and carefully on her own, but then with more and more purpose to secure the kid before possibly wandering into danger. It is unlikely the kid would have strolled onto the highway. Or that drivers on the highway would have been unaware.But I found that a funny little coda to the voices of youth. Trust me, I realize at a point (where my kids are now) that telling them about trouble is next to worthless, experience will speak 100 times more loudly, but like the mother figure shepherding during the closing, we really would like to avoid anything horrific for any child, especially those we somehow brought into this harsh, cold while simultaneously beautiful and amazing world.Also in Italian is the Future necessarily female? Maybe it needs to be these days, and maybe that was a subtle subtitle to this? Although there are definitely groups of young men and young women and sometimes mixed. Anyways, kind of caught my attention. Of course so did the shadow of Covid and masks, as this was all recently captured footage. That certainly adds to frustration and dread for anyone, old or young these past nearly four years. Sigh.Again, like I just did above if you want to bring more to this film, have at it. Maybe even watch it with your teen or young adult kids/cousins/friends? Or maybe just listen to them better. I know I will try.",False

1,9,Through the Movie Screen,imogensara_smith,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBuster Keaton's most surreal movie sprang from his insistence on logic and realism. His tribute to cinema was inspired by stage magic tricks he remembered from his vaudeville career. His most dazzling and original movie is also one of his least formally perfect. All these paradoxes belong naturally to this ""through the looking glass"" work, which examines the dream-like nature of film혰or is it the film-like nature of dreams?As Buster told it, the origin of the film lay in his desire to use certain illusionary stunts, like the bewildering dive through a living assistant's stomach, which he had learned the secret of as a child. But he firmly believed that impossible or ""cartoon"" gags were not acceptable in feature films, so he could only include them by making them occur in a dream, which is also a film-within-a-film. This is odd, when you think about it, since what he seems to be saying is that impossible things can happen in a film혰but this was the very rule he himself refused to break. By creating an outer film that is ""real"" and an inner film that is ""not real,"" Keaton shows that, while film enables illusions and distortions of reality, the filmmaker has a choice혰and a responsibility혰to clearly delineate fact from fantasy. In one scene, Keaton uses a camera trick (dissolving a wall) to prove that he's NOT using a camera trick when he dives through a window and comes out disguised as an old woman. Because he was analytical, mechanically-minded, and a stickler for authenticity, Keaton took pleasure in revealing the processes of magic tricks, and camera tricks, rather than using them to fool the audience.Buster plays a hapless cinema projectionist who yearns to be a detective, but is so clueless that his romantic rival manages to frame him for stealing his girlfriend's father's watch. In a dream, he enters the film he's projecting and becomes a great detective who solves a similar crime. While Buster's on-screen character is a schlemiel who can only achieve mastery in his celluloid fantasies, as a director Keaton's grasp of the mechanics of film-making enabled him to control the camera and its imagery as thoroughly and gracefully as he controlled his acrobatic body. SHERLOCK JR. is the most technically advanced film he ever made, including special effects (as when Buster steps through the screen and gets edited from park bench to street to mountain-top to lion's den) that can still leave audiences wondering, ""How in hell did he do that?"" It's often said that Keaton's films inspire gasps rather than laughs. Well, I just saw SHERLOCK JR. with an audience last night, and the laughter was loud and regular as fireworks on the Fourth of July. But it's a particular kind of laughter: surprised, amazed, incredulous laughter.The first half of the movie takes place in the ""real"" world; it begins with some nice small-scale gags involving Buster's attempts to scrounge up money to buy candy for his girl, and his adorably awkward visit to her house. After he has been thrown out due to his rival's machinations, Buster ""shadows"" the man (literally, copying his every motion exactly), but is tricked again and trapped in a freight train. There's a beautiful shot where he runs along the top of the train, staying in the same spot on the screen while the cars zoom by under him in the opposite direction; but I can't watch the stunt where he rides a water-spout down to the tracks without wincing, knowing he fractured his neck doing it.The beginning of the dream sequence is one of the greatest self-reflexive scenes in the history of film, as Buster's ghostly double rises from his sleeping body, picks up his ghostly hat, marches down into the theater and steps into the screen. Haven't we all wanted to do this at some time? Once over his turbulent introduction to the medium, Buster becomes the elegant Sherlock, Jr., investigating a theft of pearls from a mansion. In a marvelous game of billiards, Buster smoothly plays around an exploding 13 ball; he escapes from the thieves' den with one of the neatest tricks you'll ever see; he rides through busy streets on the handlebars of a motorcycle that no one is driving; and he goes for a romantic sail in a floating car. All this is packed into a mere 45 minutes.Significantly cut after poor previews, SHERLOCK JR. has more in common with Keaton's short films than his features. Because of the fractured story-line, it doesn't have the narrative coherence or trajectory of character development that most of Keaton's great features do. His performance is split between the shy, inept projectionist and the suave, infallible detective. He is totally convincing in both roles. When he wakes from his dream, the projectionist finds that all is well: the girl has solved the mystery and come to apologize. He is still timid as ever, so for a romantic denouement he looks to the screen: peeking out of his booth, he copies the actions of the movie hero wooing his leading lady. This is Keaton's most trenchant bit of social satire: whose ideas of kissing and love-making haven't been influenced by what they see at the movies?",True
2,8,Anything but Elementary...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,"You can only marvel at the craft of Buster Keaton. The choreography and precision in coordinating these stunts and sequences would be astounding and breathtaking whatever period of cinema they came from but more so here as the medium was still in its infancy. For an imagination to conjure up such things, with the practice and patience to perfect them, can genuinely be considered genius. A performance by an absolute legend of silent picture perfection.",False
3,9,marvellous and inventive,didi-5,n/a,15/08/2025,"This Keaton classic is both funny and extremely clever in its construction. Our hero is a cleaner but dreams of becoming a detective, always with his nose buried in a book on the subject.The first third of the film is much like any other comedy. There are lost dollar bills, things sticking to other things, something stolen, mistaken identities. Our heroine is introduced in a charming scene where they seem terrified to hold hands. Her father is played by Buster's father Joe Keaton, who would appear in many of his son's films.There's a mustachioed cad with slick hair and a sharp suit who is after the girl, a cartoon baddie who the audience instinctively knows deserves a hiss and not a cheer.It is in Junior's other job as a cinema projectionist that the film comes alive. We are watching the film he has set up and then, suddenly, he is part of the action. In a sequence of great inventiveness, we see the film within a film changing scenes and watch with delight as the character adapts to each situation and surrounding.Sherlock Jr is very funny but is also unusual and, in comparison with other comedies of the period, ahead of its time. It includes some excellent stunts that are the equal of anything done by Harold Lloyd in the same period, and, although it has a very short running time, manages to develop a good storyline throughout.Justly feted as a masterpiece of silent comedy, Sherlock Jr represented one of the peaks of Buster Keaton's cinematic career. It is a film worth watching and has stood up well today.",False
4,n/a,Astounding Creativity,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's almost impossible to describe the astounding creativity of ""Sherlock, Jr"".  Even for Buster Keaton, this is a tremendous display of comedic and fantasy material.  What's so remarkable is not so much any particularly hilarious gag or gags, as the never-ending stream of amazing and entertaining sights - coming faster and faster as the film proceeds - that seem so off-hand and effortlessly inventive, but that must have involved many hours of painstaking work to perfect.  The film vs. reality theme is also highly suggestive, and makes this great movie one of the most completely satisfying efforts by Keaton or anyone else.The film opens slowly and allows the pace to build gradually.  Buster operates the movie projector at a theater, while trying to study on his own to be a detective.  He is involved in a real-life mystery that involves his girlfriend's family, and which turns out badly for him.  He retreats into the fantasy world of a picture showing at his theater, and from then on you just have to see it to appreciate it.  The creative comedy, the technical skill, and the subtly expressed themes are all remarkable.This is a great experience not to be missed.",False
5,10,A World of Possibilities,up2u,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not only is this Buster Keaton's best film, but it is among the greatest achievements in the history of cinema, period. While it is not a feature-length film--and thus barred from most critics' lists of great films--it invented just about every single basic special effect known to movies (except for morphing). The story itself, about a film projectionist who desires to become part of the movies, and then does, by walking right onto the screen, made palpable the desire that we all have to be in the movies: To get the girl, to be an action hero, to outsmart the bad guys. Keaton invented meta-cinema before anyone even had a phrase for it.This movie has entered our dreams.",False
6,10,A rare treat :),Nich-merry,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have to say that this is by far Keaton's finest work. I have seen and own about 19 of his films/short films and this is the one that truly stands out.It is rare these days to find a comedy which will make you laugh each and every time you see it. Yet this one, to me, seems not only to be able to do this but also to get BETTER the more you watch it.The physical comedy, sight gags and insane stunts never cease to amaze me. That is what I love about Buster, the fact he did his own stunts shows that he was a great believer in producing a film that was genuine, that didnt try to trick or fool it's audience.I find it sad that today most people seem to think that comedy is about dialouge and punch lines, when it is clear from film master pieces such as Sherlock Jr. that this is not true. Silent movies are not to be ignored just because they are 'old', when I watch many of them they feel as fresh as any new comedy - if not more so.So thank-you Buster!",False
7,10,Intensely Poetic and Creative,Polaris_DiB,n/a,15/08/2025,"Though a lot of older films tend to be neglected, Sherlock Jr. definitely isn't a film that could be called obscure. I imagine most people at least know OF this movie with its famous movie-in-a-movie surrealist scene.Still, having previously heard over and over again about the brilliance of this film, I never really understood until I saw it myself. It's not just the dream-story and the surreality, it's what Keaton does with it and the importance he places on cinema. This film is even rather unique in using montage in a new way, or showing how much film appeals to the imagination as much as an artistic endeavor.Thus, this film itself becomes both wildly imaginative and brilliantly artistic... and best of all, it's FUNNY! Thus, it becomes a film for everyone. There's no hard-found artistic conceit that leads to cries of ""Pretentious!"", but still people can say ""It's amazing."" There's no comedic conceit that says, ""Bah, just simple slapstick, it's low-culture!"" because it's rather intelligently done. And it's creative in a way that isn't like an opium-dream. It can appeal to anybody of all ages. It's one very well-done film.--PolarisDiB",False
8,10,Very inventive short feature,AlsExGal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sherlock Jr., is only 45 minutes long. It actually failed when it was released, but today it is considered ground-breaking. Keaton performs some stunts such as appearing to jump through a woman backed up against a fence that remained a secret for years. He also, at the beginning of the film, jumps into a motion picture that is running in the theatre where he works as a projectionist. Once on the movie screen, Keaton has to adjust his strategy as the scene changes from the front steps of a house, to the edge of a cliff, to a lion's den.The presence of interesting film tricks doesn't mean the absence of a plot though. The film is about a boy (Keaton) who dreams of being a great detective. The girl he pursues is also sought after by a dishonest employee of her father's who frames Keaton's character for a theft. As a result he is ordered to never to return to the girl's home again. The boy goes back to his job as a projectionist, falls asleep, and dreams of being a great detective - Sherlock Jr.",False
9,10,A hard act to follow,Damfino1895,n/a,15/08/2025,"As I sat reading the other reviewers comments I wondered what I could add. Oddly enough I watched Sherlock jr only this afternoon, after so many viewings it still amazes me how far ahead of his time Buster Keaton was, often copied, rarely equalled never surpassed. I would hate to be the kind of movie fan who never watches silent or black and white movies (you'd be surprised how many there are). So if you are like that do yourself a favour, get hold of a copy of this movie and enjoy, it shocks me that films such as 'Something about Mary' are rated higher than this masterpiece of comedy, there is nothing wrong with 'SaM' even I laughed at it, but, watching it once was enough, however I watch Sherlock jr again and again in pure amazement at Buster Keaton and his cameraman, Elgin Lessley's achievements without the aid of modern technology, like most other's the scene where he dives through a window to reappear as a little old lady gobsmacks me, how did he do it? Keaton can only be described in one word, genius. I have to add that I have the Kino version on DVD with the appalling soundtrack, but, luckily I also have it with a more appropriate soundtrack, which is far superior and adds extra enjoyment to an already fabulous movie.",False
10,8,Brilliantly Worked Out Gags,sean-ramsden,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sherlock Jr. is one of Buster Keaton's best films, and possibly his greatest. The film starts somewhat slow as it sets Keaton up to be a struggling wannabe detective. There are some comedy moments that play well and the opening is rather enjoyable.But then, the film soon becomes 100x better as he literally steps into the movie that he is watching. We watch a sequence that maybe is not necessary for the overall story but what is a completely entertaining watch as the scenery changes in the movie he is in. Every cut is timed perfectly, even watching it back in slow motion is still a struggle to work out any unusual movements in his character between the scenery changes. It is brilliantly funny, especially when the scenery changes just as he is jumping into the sea to then jumping into a snow pit.The rest of the film follows Keaton as he goes about as a habitually clever detective in the film he has entered. The gags are so brilliantly worked out that you don't know whether to laugh or to watch in amazement. You think that surely that gag was the greatest of the film but then he goes and tops it in the next scene. Keaton did all of his own stunts which makes it even more astonishing to watch, and sometimes rather intense especially when he passes over a train track being just inches from the moving train. It is a film that words cannot describe and that has to be seen to truly be believed. Sherlock Jr. represents the truly unique style of filmmaking from the silent era, something that you would never see any other time in the history of film.If you're looking to get into silent film comedy, or just silent film as a whole, then Sherlock Jr. is a great place to start. Every part of the film is still as funny today as it must have been then. The timing is perfect. And the film is only 45 minutes long!",False
11,7,Brilliant for its time,saraccan,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you watch some of the other movies that came out in the 20s, you will quickly notice how innovative this movie was. It brought so many new and interesting ideas into what film making can achieve. I really think its worth seeing just for its uniqueness even if silent films aren't really my thing.A poor and simple guy who works as a projectionist, dreams of being a detective.",False
12,10,Masterpiece,gbill-74877,n/a,15/08/2025,"Buster Keaton shows such genius in this film. It's a breathtaking moment when he walks into the screen for the movie within a movie, and one of my favorite in all of silent cinema. From there we are treated to lots of impressive stunts, many of which were quite dangerous, as well as nearly nonstop visual playfulness and misdirection. Loved the slick pool play too. An absolute gem.",False
13,6,Magical FIlm,estebangonzalez10,n/a,15/08/2025,"""We are lost! He is sending for the world's greatest detective - Sherlock Jr.!""After watching several of Chaplin's classic films, I decided it was time to give Buster Keaton an opportunity beginning with one of his most revered movies, Sherlock Jr. Keaton and Chaplin dominated the silent movie era, but most people are divisive as to who was the most talented actor-director of that time. So far I'm on Chaplin's side although I still have to give Keaton another shot with The General. Perhaps the problem I had with Sherlock Jr. is that I'm not a big fan of surreal films. I know everyone seems to love this genre, but there are very few surreal movies that work for me. I can see how Buster Keaton garners recognition for his magical work in this film, being one of the first to actually incorporate dream sequences into his movie. Many other films (and especially cartoons) were inspired from several scenes in Sherlock Jr, like the one in which Keaton's character jumps into a movie screen and becomes a character in the movie that is being projected (better known as ""the movie within a movie"" sequence). There are several action scenes including some spectacular chases that make you wonder how Keaton could have shot them way back in 1924. I was more impressed with this wizard like aspect of Keaton than on his comedic performance. His deadpan expressions were outdone by the gadgets he devised to create such advanced special effects. Despite being bored by the story, I have to give Keaton credit for his inventive and magical sequences.At the beginning of this silent film, written by Jean Havez, Joseph Mitchell, and Clyde Bruckman the title card reads: ""There is an old proverb which says: Don't try to do two things at once and expect to do justice to both. This is the story of a boy who tried it. While employed as a moving picture operator in a small town theater he was also studying to be a detective."" We are then introduced to the projectionist (Buster Keaton) who is reading a detective book instead of cleaning up the theater. After work, he goes to visit his girl (Kathryn McGuire) and buys her a ring. Another man (played by Ward Crane), who is also fighting for the girl's affection happens to be at the house and steals her father's chain watch and incriminates the projectionist. The girl's father (Joe Keaton) kicks him out of his home and tells him never to return again. The projectionist sadly returns to work where he falls asleep and dreams of being a detective in the film that is being projected. In his dreams, he becomes the hero of the film and the adventure begins.Buster Keaton's film has some brilliant and magical sequences, and I think it is a bit unfair to compare him with Chaplin because he has a very different style. Chaplin has a more humane approach, writes his own stories and composes them as well, while Keaton does some impressive work behind the lens using some trickery. As performers they both have different styles, Chaplin uses a lot of physical comedy while Keaton uses deadpan humor and incorporates a lot of action scenes doing some risky stunts (in the train sequence he actually fractured his neck). Depending on which style you like best, you will probably claim Keaton or Chaplin is better, but it would be unfair to say one is less talented than the other because they both proved to be geniuses during the silent era and have left us with a rich legacy. I can see sparks of both in contemporary film making. Despite not being a fan of this film as much as others I still need to watch Keaton's The General to get a clearer picture of his style.",False
14,5,Certainly not Keaton's best,bigsleepj,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm afraid that the legendary ""Sherlock Jnr"" has left me cold. It just not as good as Keaton's other movies (Our Hospitality, Steamboat Bill Jnr, The General) which doesn't feel as forced as this one. It's not that I have anything against surrealism but from the beginning of the ""surreal"" part of the movie (i.e. when he enters the cinema) the movie just stops being good (not that the beginning was all that great as well).Sure, there are great parts (like when he jumps into an old lady's stomach) but eventually they don't amount to much. I'm sorry, I really wanted to love this movie but it just does not stand on its own like most of Keaton's silent movies.",False
15,n/a,"nobody has ever done it better, maybe even as well, as Buster",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"There ought to be a theater that shows nothing but perfectly preserved prints of the silent comedies of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Harry Langdon. There ought to be a lot of things, I guess. But anyone who thinks that silent film is nothing more than a crude and unskilled ancestor of today's motion picture need only spend some time on these great comedies to realize that, in this genre at least, the peak was reached in the 20s. Yes, there are funny movies with dialogue, but the humor is generally IN the dialogue...nobody--not the Marx Brothers, or W.C. Fields, or Abbot and Costello or the Three Stooges and nobody since--has achieved the sublime mastery of physical comedy these geniuses did. And the best of them all for pure comedy, to my mind, is Keaton. And the best of his movies is Sherlock, Jr. The dream sequence in which he becomes an actor in the film he's projecting is astonishing; the way in which this movie is a sort of window into a different and appealing age is charming--and the ending of this movie takes the breath away. Keaton made some of the great endings in film, I think. Check out ""College"" some time--just for the last minute or so. If you ever have the chance to see this film in a good print at the right speed with appropriate music, and you don't take that opportunity, shame shame shame. This is one I'd like to own.",False
16,10,Absolute Magic,Taz750,n/a,15/08/2025,The best silent I have seen yet.. Buster Keaton's a film genius for making a movie like this.. the scenes where the film surroundings change while Buster is in the film is hilarious and even seems hard to make as a realistic special effect today. His stunts are great and its amazing that he did them himself. They're all perfectly timed and done and look as hard as they must be. This movie is one of the best.. Not a single sound the whole movie and I enjoyed it greatly.. Keaton is without a doubt the best comedian.. better than Chaplin or anyone else.,False
17,9,A classic of the Silent Era,grantss,n/a,15/08/2025,"A young man works as a projectionist at a movie theatre but dreams of becoming a famous detective. His studies toward this goal are put to the test when visiting his girlfriend. A rival steals his girlfriend's father's watch and frames him for the crime. He is forbidden from seeing her again. Now he must fight to clear his name.Buster Keaton at his finest - a classic of the Silent Era. Good plot, all of which is a central structure around which Keaton can build some incredibly clever scenes, sub-plots and sight gags. Some of these are brilliantly funny and intelligent, as Keaton toys mercilessly with the audience. The pool scene - the adventure of the exploding ball - is a great example.Some very clever cinematography and editing too - some of the visual effects and stunts were quite innovative for their time.Superb.",False
18,9,"A seamlessly crafted, yet easy to watch slapstick",samarlocrossley,n/a,15/08/2025,"I give this movie a 9-star rating, not because of its importance in cinema, and not entirely due to the story, but because - put simply - it made me laugh. Sherlock Jr.'s bits, body language and general comedy allow it to rival, even outperform modern slapsticks and physical comedies before even beginning to look at the story. My experience with older comedies is limited mainly to Chaplin, as I am sure is the case with many rookie film enthusiasts; this did not worsen my experience whatsoever. I was surprised to see how different the styles were, and how both this comedy and Chaplin's have very much their own identity. I loved many of the scenes in this short film, and my laugh-to-time ratio was higher than city lights (not to take away from that incredible artwork). I don't want to spoil anything, but I will point out that this film is a meta-commentary on cinema as a medium, and shows this in a beautifully effortless manner. The editing was outstanding for the time (I assume), and the exciting scenes gave me more of an adrenaline boost than nearly any action could. It's not that I don't care for modern cinema - that is frankly untrue, but commentaries frequently seem to be more effective in older, often silent films. This - I believe - is due in part to the very nature of silent films. These words may have been uttered by many before me, but a good silent film would be only held back by dialogue. Upon watching this film, I believe I see why Chaplin chose to keep creating silents long after their peak. This all being said, I am sure many will struggle to enjoy this film, but as my introduction to Buster Keaton, I think this film has served him well.",False
19,10,"Footage of laughter, romance and technical audaciousness",TheLittleSongbird,n/a,15/08/2025,"Am somebody who likes humour with wit and sophistication when it comes to comedy (that's why so many pre-1970 comedy appeals a lot to me), while appreciating comedies with a broader style providing it doesn't become too vulgar and the risque kind. Have found though that in recent years that there has been those that are very juvenile, crude and even puerile to the point of offensiveness, which is as one may have guessed appeals to me far less.There are many fine examples of silent film comedy, with Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy though in both cases it wasn't the case of finding their feet immediately. In both cases the early stuff was fairly hit and miss, but when they did settle their best work was classic. And of course Buster Keaton, who didn't transition as well or smoothly into the sound era (whereas Chaplin made some of his best work in it) but when he was in his prime there was nobody back then, when it came to comedy, more daring in terms of the jaw-dropping stunt-work, or who was able to make deadpan funny and expressive, and actually it is still like that now. Keaton wasn't nicknamed ""The Great Stone Face"" for nothing, and in my mind he was every bit as funny and easy to like as Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy, while also being a bigger risk taker, having bolder material physically and his films being technically in his prime period superior. The reasons for the comparisons being because they were all geniuses in comedy, who started their careers around the same time, a lot of the comedy was physical rather than verbal and their prime periods were in roughly the same time period.'Sherlock Jr' is another one of Keaton's finest, an achievement in pretty much every way. On a technical level, it is one of his most audacious and best-looking along with the slightly more ground-breaking on this front 'The General'. Again, it is beautifully shot and designed and the effects and how they're used stand out, it should be used as an example of how to have effects that still look good and like a lot of effort and care went into them and also use them properly, rather than overusing and abusing them to gratuitous effect with varied at best success as seen frequently now. Films today should learn from this film and the best of Keaton, they really are an example to all in many senses. The direction keeps things moving with control, progressing gradually and always assuredly, and balances everything beautifully.When it comes to the humour, 'Sherlock Jr' is one of Keaton's funniest and most inventive, chockful of hilarious moments timed to absolute perfection. While none of the stunts are quite on the same level of awe-inspiring as for example the climax of 'Steamboat Bill, Jr', they are still incredibly daring. Also found myself surprisingly educated, which makes this film one of Keaton's more interesting films, in learning the trade tricks in editing and effects and some of the most genius use of back projection (often done cheaply and obviously, but inventively done here).Like 'The General' and 'Steamboat Bill, Jr' it is really great to have a story with brains, heart and logic, treating the audience with respect and there is never any trouble following it. In terms of structure it stands out too when it comes to the story elements in Keaton's films and is one of the most interesting. The romantic element that features heavily here is done with more charm and pathos than most comedy when balanced with romance, without being too sentimental or soap-operatic, never does it slow the film down either. As to be expected, Keaton as to be expected is superb here, not only is his comic timing on point but he once again provides a character that's endearing and worth rooting for. His physicality and how he copes with the stunts is awe-inspiring and he is one of not many to make deadpan interesting and entertaining because he still makes it very expressive and nuanced. Don't overlook the rest of the cast though, they may not have as much to do but they are also amusing and charming.In summary, one of the Keaton essentials. 10/10",False
20,8,"short, silent, and really funny",JimDenney,n/a,15/08/2025,"My second silent film for the class that I viewed for my class was just as entertaining as the first, which was Charlie Chaplin's The Circus. Buster Keaton playing the role of the movie projectionist Sherlock Jr. was very entertaining. The story is simple, yet interesting and fun, and the movie comes in at much less than one hour, 44 minutes to be exact. While there are a few points in the movie that are disjointed and not as fun, overall you can stay engrossed enough until you get to some really cool and innovative special effects, which given the technological limitations when this was filmed in the 1920's are simply amazing.",False

And for a film released 96 years ago, this one hasn't aged badly at all. There were several times watching this where I thought to myself ""wow, I can't believe they actually pulled that off!"". With the constraints they had, it's remarkable all the things they were able to achieve. And of course, it was pretty funny too, though I can't say there was anything that was laugh-out-loud hilarious. Still, this was definitely not a bad film at all, I'd say it was pretty good.

Keaton's stony-faced modernist holds up better than Chaplin's Victorian crowd-pleaser. In this film, Keaton is wonderful as a film projectionist who imagines himself as a movie hero even as he tries to woo the girl he loves. Although it's only 1924, Keaton evokes the dreamer's love affair with movies as well or better than ""Walter Mitty,"" as the film explores the tenuous boundary between reality and fantasy. It also has a perfect ending. I rate it a 10.",False

25,4,How not to be a detective,dkncd,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Sherlock Jr."" is Buster Keaton's film about a movie theater employee who aspires to be a detective. Keaton handles his role well and the supporting cast is solid as well. The film has impressive cinematography, but a generic score.The film has amusing moments: the very close shadowing of the villain by Keaton as a detective, Keaton walking through the safe door and Keaton taking cues from a film to guide his romantic actions. Some of the stunts were entertaining, particularly Keaton's escapes through a window and a stomach. The famous scene where Keaton enters a movie scene was cleverly made, but I found it only moderately entertaining.However, I found most of the film's jokes basic and not very amusing. A lot of the stunt sequences, while well-shot, were overlong. While ""Sherlock Jr."" had some funny moments and is a meticulously constructed film, I was disappointed by how few times I was amused by it.",False

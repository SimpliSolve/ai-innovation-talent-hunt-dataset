1,7,Its fine but promised more,kent-grinnekullen102,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, there are som reviews here that are negative that are just Russian propaganda at best. Its full lies and half truths promoting the Russian narrative. As for the movie its a 7 for the fact they were there and the footage they took, as a documentary its a 5-6. Most of all it lacks depth and analysis from politicians and experts from the west on the military and political side leading up to the war. Its a little to much look how great we are who made the movie and the focus of a real documentarian is the subject, not the creator. There are a lot of interviews with ordinary Ukranians and governmental ukrainians that saves the movie, but a stronger message could have been sent by showing and destroying the Russian lies and have them as a comparable, not in the least showing all the atrocities that Russian troops committed in places like Bucha.",False
2,5,A waste of a rare opportunity,tmccray,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, the editing of this is terrible, just awful. There's no story arc. Chopped up bits of meaningless conversations are interjected throughout. And the cliches, oh the cliches. They smack you in the face with their obviousness.But worse than this is the wasted right place, right time opportunity. To happen to be in Kyiv during the first day of the invasion with access to Zelinsky, yet get so little from it is devastating and disappointing.Zelinsky wisely took the time to meet with this high profile American to ask him to communicate the need for American support. Penn responds with a platitude about heroism. And then bolts right out of the country.There is very little content about the cost to the Ukranian people. One segment shows a woman in her blown-out apartment. And a hole in the ground of a children's playground. We all know the toll of death and destruction is unspeakable and this felt like it was being trivialized.More time is spent on glorifying Penn and his celebrity tourism of war-torn and natural disaster areas. As well as wasted footage of him sitting in a car driving out of Ukraine.In the end, it's mostly a puff piece about how a silly comedian put in an unimaginable position, rose the the occasion to take on the evil empire. Rife with trite banalities.",True
3,10,Excellent documentation of the first moments of war,jxkbjsb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sean Penn made this documentary to something special. It's not just made because of some attention, it's made with heart. You look in the scared eyes of people and feel directly the pain where they go through. The fear of not knowing what will happen next and the bravery that they will not let it happen without defending. This documentary shows how people come from ordinary life's, wearing army clothes and defend families, the land and the freedome of Ukraine against the biggest country in the world. Outstanding documentary of the strongest and bravest people on earth, who resist's against everything who will take freedome from them!",False
4,10,Sean Penn Takes an Emotional Dive into Ukraine's Fight for Freedom,honest_reviews17,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary started out with the goal of covering Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky. It had already begun production as Russia inched closer to invading Ukraine, during a time when nobody really knew what would happen next. Because of this, it first covers the last 20 years of Ukranian political transitions and turmoil, and how the country's desire to become democratic and free has evolved over the last 30 years since becoming independent from the USSR. This is what the first portion covers. Not war, or guns, or explosions, but where Ukraine was during the days before Russia invaded.After that, it shifts almost immediately to Zelensky, who amazingly still agreed to meet for a planned interview the day after the invasion had begun. From that moment on, Sean's perspective and perception of the man whose story he had set out to cover suddenly took a dramatic turn with the country now being at war.Throughout the rest of the film, Sean tries to raise awareness in every way possible about the situation and the courage and strength he's seen first hand in Ukraine. He does interviews on various news channels and gives various talks. He holds a couple of additional calls with Zelensky as he finds out the sort of messages he'd like to get out there regarding need for equipment. He visits sites where Russia has only days or hours before bombed apartment buildings, destroying poeple's homes and property, and yet they still refuse to leave their cities. He visits playgrounds destroyed by missiles, he even visits the frontline in the trenches, 150 meters away from a Russian position, leaving most of his crew behind.While the documentary began in a slightly fact-based manner, the longer it went on, the more emotionally invested Sean became in the spirit, determination and courage of the Ukrainian people -- both on the frontline and off. It culminates with a poignant interview outdoors with Zelensky and closes with a slightly dramatized but nonetheless deeply emotional scene with his son.By the time the credits rolled, I was surprised at the feeling it left me with. One of the future, looking back on these times, and hopefully being able to say that democracy and freedom were victorious, and peace was lasting.",False
5,10,This is a film everyone needs to see...,Baeysif,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary everybody needs to see. In a time where democracy is challenged, hope & courage emerges. It is bizarre how knowledge can be a deterrent to what is possible, all this time I have studied Vladimir Putin only to find out President Zelenskyy is the true story. This president has restored my hope in democracy, and it is significantly inspirational to see such unity, and strength on the frontlines of Ukraine. My support for this president and country has increased tenfold just by watching this film. Sean Penn is a true journalist, and as he quoted Ronald Reagan's ""To be a good actor, you have to be able to be yourself on camera."" An unwavering strength this actor holds. Sean Penn is an inspiration and I commend his ability to withstand the politics and offer strictly true human emotional responses to this brutal & unprecedented invasion. I am incredibly proud to be an American and represent the ideology of democracy, but to be Ukrainian right now means to fight for it. We must all refrain from wavering our support to the upmost important mission of our time, freedom. God bless America, and God bless Ukraine.",False
6,10,Beautiful film - Ukraine Will Prevail,jhadcock-94653,n/a,16/08/2025,"We will never see such a courageous leader like Zelensky in a hundred more years to come! Love love what Penn has done in this film. Bless Ukraine for your fight. Democracy will prevail. I know Zelensky will lead Ukraine to victory. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has indeed been widely regarded as a hero by many, especially for his leadership and resilience during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. His refusal to flee Kyiv and his efforts to rally his country and the world against the invasion won him admiration and support from people around the globe. Despite the challenges and the ongoing conflict, Zelensky's courage and determination have made him a symbol of resistance and unity for many Ukrainians and others worldwide.",False
7,10,"Thank you, Sean Penn!",AfterShare,n/a,16/08/2025,"No matter what is said about you, I am totally by your side. Don't let haters get you down. I know what I'm seeing in you. And Zelensky. Totally. This is your best achievement so far.I loved this documentary with all my heart. I hope it will get picked up wider than Paramount+. Everyone should see it and be reminded of why we are helping Ukraine. Why it is important to us and the world. My favorite scene is in the apartment. The woman mentioned trying to save things that were emotionally valuable. Sean didn't say, ""What can I do?"" but ""What can I carry out?"" Right there, in the moment. One reason why I admire him.",False
8,10,Very powerful movie,annagorodskazok,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows the reality of cause and consequences of the war in Ukraine. The value of unity of nation and how powerful a nation can be when it's unified. The role of a leader when a nation is facing a catastrophic disaster. The transformation of president Zelensky from a comedian to the leader of the nation at the most brutal war since WW2 is very well performed in the movie.I looked at Sean Penn with a different perspective. The courage of celebrity of his level to attend the most dangerous parts in Ukraine, visiting the frontline is inspiring. Much of respect to Sean Penn for this work.",False

10,10,Blood sacrifice,andreescu-ion06,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why the documentary cannot be considered mediocre: because someone put in the effort to make it at that particular time, it deserves a 10/10. Westerners don't understand one thing: what it's like to be located in this part of the world, at the crossroads of three great historical empires. One of which will never allow you to live as you wish. The only solution is the sacrifice of blood, otherwise you will cease to exist. No nation in this geographical area has gained the right to self-determination without going through 2-3 wars and millions of deaths. And the fact that this is happening in the 21st century is horrifying.",False
11,4,Blaring with Agenda Driven Self-aggrandizement,scott-rodrick-721-616661,n/a,16/08/2025,"I could not believe the number of 10/10 reviews of this mediocre docudrama. A rating that says everything about them and nothing about the movie being reviewed. The opportunity to show what Putin has wrought upon Ukraine was right their in front of Penn. Unfortunately he cannot think about others except as they relate to him and what he does. Penn is the ""always dependable opportunistic ultra leftist demigod"". How long did he stay in Kiev after the first day of the invation? Who is the focal point of this film? What was the goal of this production, and what was the alterior motive.Shawn 's motives are not difficult to understand. They're the same as when he volunteered to be a ""human shield"" protecting Sadam Husain, or when he glorified Cesaer Chavez before his communist revolution put Venezuela (a country with the largest oil reserves of any country on earth) on the path to ruin. Likewise support Ortega and Castro. He is consistent.",False
12,10,Penn Goes Where Others Will Not,payiyugk2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sean Penn amazes me with his dedication to showing the world these Russian atrocities.Im sure the MAGA deplorable will hate this film because it makes their precious Putin look like a war criminal when he bombs kindergartens, playgrounds, and schools. But to the compasionate educated Americans left in the world I'm sure this will be a great viewing.Sean charges into bombed building without a care and is one of the most human of stars I have ever witnessed. Americans need to wake up and stay clear of authoritarian figure like Putin and his American asset Trump. If Trump wins in 2024 American democracy will die and the world will become a very dangerous place.",False

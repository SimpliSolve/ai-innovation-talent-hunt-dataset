1,3,waste of time,venimusrex,n/a,17/08/2025,"Films like this are used by skeptics to dismiss truth, because it is so devoid of convincing evidence. There is a handful of actually good photos of craft in the sky. The other 99% is stock footage and recreations of people pointing off-camera, using typewriters, dialing old-fashioned rotary phones, looking in file cabinets, flying airplanes, and some poor quality CG flying saucers. It does show a very accurate CG depiction of a gray being that will probably disturb some people, but at least that breaks up the boring narration and visuals. There are so many better documentaries out there with more detailed footage and interviews. Like the project this film claims to ""expose"", there is a small degree of disclosure and truth to be found; but that is largely overshadowed by relatively useless material. This does little to enlighten anyone about very real events and phenomena that have been systematically denied and covered up to keep the public in the dark.",False

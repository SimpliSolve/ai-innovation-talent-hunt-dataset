1,n/a,Music is colorblind,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Music is colorblind.""America, between the 1920s and 1950s. Washington D. C., the nation's capital, is both its heart and its bleeding wound. Racial segregation is rampant, with no effort to rectify it. A whisper passes from ear to ear: ""If you find yourself in trouble on that side of town, seek refuge at the Turkish Embassy. They will help you.""Jazz has always been an integral part of my life. Like the Ertegun brothers, I followed it on the radio (even in my preschool years). To this day, a significant portion of my vinyl and Blu-ray collection consists of blues and jazz masterpieces.This documentary, clocking in at a mere hour, is a compressed historical document. From the moment it begins, it serves you centuries of pain and anger, all set to the rhythm of jazz.I had the privilege of viewing this documentary with special permission from the director (and journalist) Ãœmran Safter. According to her, a wide-scale marketing campaign is in the works, which is excellent news.This is the story of the Ertegun brothers. Their lives intertwined with the likes of Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown, Otis Redding, and even Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Led Zeppelin, and Yes. Ahmet and Nesuhi Ertegun held a special place in the personal lives of these musical icons.It's a tale that began in Istanbul in the 1920s, extended to London, and continued in Washington D. C. Ahmet and Nesuhi took this issue so personally that they ventured to Los Angeles in the 40s to lay the groundwork for Atlantic Records, inviting New York into their adventure.I had the honor of briefly speaking with Ahmet Ertegun for a mere two or three minutes when he was in Antalya. It was just before the release of Tarkan's album ""Come Closer,"" around 2003 or 2004. Even in that fleeting encounter, I was captivated by him, and watching this documentary has only deepened my respect.In sum, ""Leave the Door Open"" (2021) is an exceptional work on jazz and humanity, boasting superb cinematography and sound design. It's a poignant reminder of the power of music to transcend barriers and unite people from all walks of life. The film's exploration of the Ertegun brothers' legacy is a testament to their unwavering belief in the transformative power of music, a belief that continues to inspire and resonate today.",False

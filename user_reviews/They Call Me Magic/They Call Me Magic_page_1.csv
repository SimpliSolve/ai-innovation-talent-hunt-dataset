1,8,Could've Been Better,PNEPmac22,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler4 episodes are not enough to document the 13 years of Magic Johnson's career, inside and outside the court. His rivalry with the Celtics and Pistons in the 80's should've been detailed extensively. The 90's also had significant events which also needed greater detail.",True
2,9,It's Magic,danielcereto,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, I grew up in the 90's as a teenager loving NBA basketball. I remember Magic's smile and showtime. This documentary helped me a lot to understand who really was and Magic Johnson. One of the best basketball players of all-time.Second, the documentary it's pretty well done, probably not as good as The Last Dance but not far from it. After watching this, I think Michael was the best player but Magic was overall better. With all his mistakes I think he has more charisma than Michael. His smile is contagious and it's difficult not admire for what it represents.So, overall a great documentary if you loved 80's - 90's NBA and specially the Bird vs Magic era. Enjoy!",False

4,10,"Helps us appreciate Magic's humbleness, sacrifices and challenges he experienced to be the Legend he is today",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like They Call Me Magic because it is a four-episode docuseries about the life and career of Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, the five time NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers. The audience can appreciate Magic's humbleness, sacrifices and challenges he went through in order to be the Legend he is today.They Call Me Magic is about the beginning of Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson's career as a basketball player, his journey from playing in high school, college, becoming an NBA All Star player, and a successful businessman and advocate for the minority communities. The audience will learn where his nickname Magic came from. What type of obstacles Magic had to go through to have the successful life he has today. He experienced racism, rivalry, jealousy, three engagements gone wrong with his actual wife, Cookie Johnson, he has the HIV virus and had to deal with the acceptance of his son, EJ Johnson, being homosexual and the repercussion that comes with it.This Apple TV+ docuseries was directed by Rick Famuyiwa with editor Dirk Westervelt and cinematographer Rachel Morrison. The audience will enjoy listening to special guests narrating some of Magic Johnson's highlight moments in his life. We get to see former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton expressing their admiration for Magic. Former basketball players like Charles Barkley, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talking about their personal experiences with Magic, inside and outside the basketball court. Jimmy Kimmel, Arsenio Hall, Samuel O'Jackson and Snoop Dog are also some of the celebrities expressing their admiration and narrating Magic's influence in his community and globally. Today, Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson is a successful businessman, an advocate for HIV/AIDS patients and for the minority community. He owns several sports teams as well.The moral of this docuseries is that things always happen for a reason and to never give up when situations in life get hard. Magic never thought that having the HIV virus will turn his life for good by educating the world about this illness. He shared his experience with the virus and taught the world that AIDS is not necessary a gay illness. Anyone can be contaminated by this virus.I'd give They Call Me Magic 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, with adult's supervision due to foul language. They Call Me Magic is available now on Apple TV+. By Ethan P., KIDS FIRST!",False
5,6,Lame,tube-52272,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like Magic but this documentary is lame and hasn't the dynamic of the Last Dance by fare .Also they don't show the very low points of his personal life when it came to all the scandals with the hookers ,groupies and cheerleaders involved at the beginning of the showtime era.",False
6,7,"While this series isn't Magic, its still Pretty Good.",KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall, its a pretty good, but short docuseries. It shines and entertains, but like Earvin 'Magic' Johnson's career it seems short and a little rush towards the end. Still it is pretty good, and almost anyone will love watching the series. Magic Johnson is just easy to love. He's a legend on the court, and off the court he cemented a legacy unlike anyone else.This series is very very pro Magic. It almost feels like propaganda although its all true and Magic has done so many great things for him, his family, his community, and the rest of the world. This series mentions his relaxed nature and party-boy nature, but kind of glosses over his life as a young adult and what led him to his H. I. V. Diagnosis. But this series does mention his absolute love and loyalty to his family so its hard to think Magic would ever do wrong.I came away from this series knowing more about Earvin Johnson and his business career than I initially did. Its just amazing what he has done since his first retirement from the NBA. Magic is lucky to be here and we are lucky to have Magic.",False
7,1,Trash,elburro-50703,n/a,16/08/2025,Way trash winning time is way better. Looking sad bland and no life as if it was rushed to put out an unpolished product to compete and it didn't work it's pure pure trash avoid this at all cost if u can.,False
8,3,My real question was not answered,jeffalindogan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Magic Johnson and Showtime Lakers up to this day. But I have been pondering this the whole time, how was Magic's sex life after the diagnosis? I think Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty is a better watch. Why would he also think that Karl Malone stabbed him in the back, during those times AIDS was raging, it's just natural that there would be apprehensions playing with him. And this documentary focuses more on his relationship with his wife Cookie, which despite his being a polygamist, wedding plans cancelled still ended up with each other. Watch this if you have 4 hours to spare.",False

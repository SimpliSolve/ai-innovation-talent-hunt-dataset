1,1,Wow this is dumb,eschase,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm gonna pretend this is a real documentary and attack it's thesis; it revealed no connection between Bigfoot and aliens apart from eyewitnesses claims that people saw UFO's around the same time they saw Bigfoot. It's really a mix of a Bigfoot, alien, and ghost documentaries, just slapped together like some kind of Frankenstein's monster. The narrator implies that these are all possibly related, but provide no evidence. At one point, a bug flies in front of the camera, and they play it back in slow motion saying something along the lines of ""it seems Bigfoot turned himself into a fairy to play a trick on us"". So dumb. Kind of entertaining background noise, but this documentary is so devoid of any substance I can't condone its existence.",False

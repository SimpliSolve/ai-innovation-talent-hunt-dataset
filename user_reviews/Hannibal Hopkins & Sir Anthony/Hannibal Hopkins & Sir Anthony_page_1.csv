1,7,Not bad but could have been much better,guisreis,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is nice to see a little of the career of great actor Anthony Hopkins and to know a little (very little, indeed!) of his life prior stardom in Hollywood. However, the documentary is not engaging, and its parts seem a little disconnected. At least there are some good stories, andnit is nice to see the films' backgrounds. The documentary does not explore it deeply, but there are several very psychological testimonies by Hopkins too. I was surprised how he disdains kost of the films he acted in as bad ones.",False
2,8,Delightful,mekjd,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is something about Hopkins that captivates even when he does not seem to strive for complexity, or perhaps that is the very thing that draws us in.Thank goodness he never became a ""star."" Big, big fan of Hopkins, just as he is.And as the biopic notes, Magic is a much underrated film......the IMDB says that I must write more....more there will be, then.I was also glad that this was not a fall from grace/redemption picture. While alcoholism is not given short shrift, it is not center stage, either.I would have liked a deeper explication of the characters he played. Not just Dr. Lecter, but others. Some are touched on, but not enough to satisfy my curiosity. Nixon! Dracula! Doctor to the Elephant Man! So many lives lived by one man, more would have been great.",False
3,5,NOT AS INSIGHTFUL AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN,rkeilitz-19-537915,n/a,16/08/2025,Anthony Hopkins is one of my favorite top 5 actors and he never disappoints even in his movies that are turkeys. This documentary is more like bits and pieces of past interviews spliced together to tell you what makes Hopkins tick. I wish they would have interviewed actors and directors he has worked with for a more rounded story about him since he seems to have a love-hate relationship with most of the movies he has been in.,False
4,4,Story of great actor.,DRwatashi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anthony Hopkins is a classy actor, he is a great actor in my opinion, although I mostly only watched the Hannibal franchise with him, but even so I realized how good his acting is in movies, how good he is, and not only that. Anthony Hopkins is also a great improviser, he improvises often in movies whenever possible, and this trait of his only complements and makes the characters he plays better. I plan to watch other movies with this wonderful actor in the future, but his magnificent role as Hannibal will always be remembered. As for the documentary itself, it's very interesting, Anthony Hopkins himself glimpses his childhood, the way his career development, his failures and of course his successes, he also talks about himself, which allows you to better understand what kind of person he is and what he is like.",False

1,9,Piece of Detroit History,evannewel,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film leaves a lasting impression on what it means to be a Detroit Red Wing fan. I grew up watching the Red Wings and Colorado Avalanche battle night in and night out which is why I really enjoyed this film. My parents basement has several pictures of the fights from March 26th, 1997 and after watching this film it re-ignited my love for the wings. Great film! Highly recommend that hockey fans watch this! (P. S. I still don't like lemieux)",False
2,10,Oh the memories!,joewerner-63938,n/a,16/08/2025,Great sports documentary about the time in hockey I loved the most. It was awesome to see so many of the players and coaches interviewed. Definitely reinforced my hatred in the Red Wings! They made me cheer for Claude Lemieux and for that I will never forgive them lol.,False

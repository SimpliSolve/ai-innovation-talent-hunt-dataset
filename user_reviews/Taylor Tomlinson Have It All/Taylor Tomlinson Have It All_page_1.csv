1,6,"Enjoyable, but a running a bit on auto-pilot...",paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,17/08/2025,"Well, I did enjoy the previous shows from Taylor Tomlinson, so when I stumbled upon this 2024 comedy special on Netflix, while browsing through the contents, of course I had to watch it. I didn't know that she had a new show out, but then again I don't really keep up with what she is doing.Now, the good news is that if you enjoyed the previous two shows from Taylor Tomlinson, then you will definitely also enjoy this 2024 show. You know what you are getting and she does deliver. And yeah, I definitely was adequately entertained by this 66 minute long comedy special, no doubt about that. The bad news is that as a comedian, she isn't really progressing or evolving, it feels very much like the shows that came before this.Again, as with the previous shows, Taylor Tomlinson feels naturally at home on the scene and she has a good charisma and carries the show with grace. And her interaction with the audience is good.Something that I didn't like about this 2024 show was how much she talked about her career and her Netflix specials, it felt a bit pompous and as if she was rather full of herself. You're on Netflix, yeah, we get it. We are watching you there already...I was genuinely entertained by ""Taylor Tomlinson: Have It All"" and it is well-worth sitting down to watch and enjoy, whether or not you have seen the previous shows.My rating of ""Taylor Tomlinson: Have It All"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",False
2,6,"Okay, but disappointing",grantss,n/a,17/08/2025,"I enjoyed Taylor Tomlinson's two previous Netflix comedy specials, 'Quarter-Life Crisis' and 'Look at you'. The content is very personal, relatable and funny and her delivery is great. The only negatives were an occasional clumsiness, especially when ad libbing, and a degree of repetitiveness.Based on these two specials I was looking forward to this one. It's okay, for the most part, but feels like a retread of the previous two, like essentially the same perspectives and material rehashed. The same old things come up - boyfriends, married friends, her parents - none with a new slant.The clumsiness in the ad lib parts is magnified here as she has an audience participation segment and her responses to their suggestions do feel forced and are more about insulting the suggestee than being funny.Her delivery is still great and its this timing and animation that sustain the show.Overall, funny enough but disappointing in that it feels like nothing new.",False
3,8,Another (mostly) strong special,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,17/08/2025,"Of the two blond Taylors who've become super popular in the last few years within their respective fields, I'll take Tomlinson over Swift any day.Have It All is not quite as good as her previous two specials, and so I think there might have been a little disappointment for me as a result. Quarter-Life Crisis was great, and then Look At You felt like one of the funniest and most insightful/balanced I'd ever heard.Have It All is still strong. Most of the jokes landed and Tomlinson's honesty and introspection are still compelling to listen to, and probably would be even if there weren't any jokes. Parts of this still hit hard and there was something of an emotional rollercoaster to be had, what with laughing one minute and then feeling despondent the next when she gets very real.I just don't think the ride was as consistent or thrilling as previous specials, but it still felt like high-quality stuff and I'm still keen to listen to/watch whatever she puts out next.",False
4,10,"Great Job, Taylor!!",leomangine,n/a,17/08/2025,"Amazing comedy. I've been watching her standup for years now. And listen very carefully: when it comes to humor and comedy, Taylor Tomlinson truly does Have It All. There's a reason she's this successful. She didn't just walk into Netflix HQ a nobody and be like ""Give me three Netflix specials, b****."" ""âœ¨okayâœ¨""
That's not how that happened. Talent. She really has a knack for this kind of thing.And if you have the time, I really do recommend seeing her other two specials. And After Midnight. It's worth it. Anyways, from one comedian to, as Taylor put it, ""losers with no talent,"" this is a great special.Ok I should stop rambling.",False
5,9,Killed Me,braincandle-1,n/a,17/08/2025,"This special had me reeling. From cringe first parental 'sex talk' memories to crazy religious upbringing stories, these jokes hit way too close to home. Her crowd work was excellent as well, flowed right thru the jokes and just kept going. Like honestly some of the best crowd work jokes I've ever seen. You can tell she's been perfecting her craft. That's it - killer special, will definitely watch again, and now I want to go back and rewatch her old specials. Taylor killed it and made my boring Tuesday night a laugh riot! Check it out, she is awesome! Thirty six more words required blah blah blah.",False
6,10,saw it in real life + on Netflix,aistejasper,n/a,17/08/2025,"I am a big fan of Taylor Tomlinson for a while now and enjoyed her two previous Netflix specials a lot. I saw this show in Brussels and now again on Netflix, I laughed so much both times, absolutely loved it!Such an honest, authentic and funny show. I always love how vulnerable Taylor can be on stage, it's just such an amazing type of comedy. As in her previous shows, she shares insights about her mental health, working on herself, her doubts and feelings about regular adult things we're all feeling and turning 30.The way she delivers her jokes is of course excellent and made me laugh throughout. My absolute favorite comedian eveeeeer.",False
7,9,Still my fave :),hwhit1389,n/a,17/08/2025,"Had really high expectations coming into this, as I'd watched her first two specials loadsss of times and quickly established that she was my favourite comedian. The fact that I wasn't disappointed is no mean feat, and I genuinely did laugh out loud several times. 9 as opposed to 10 just because I still think she's got more potential, but thoroughly enjoyed it. She says this one is more like Quarter Life Crisis, but I disagree, and feel like it's pretty balanced in terms of the influences of it's predecessors. Definitely adding this to the roster of specials to watch again, and so yep, if you liked her first two, I'd recommend this one :))",False
8,5,That's it?!,mozes_pilgrim,n/a,17/08/2025,"Taylor is very talented, quick witted comedian (commedienne?) and she have proven this already in her last two Netflix specials where she briliantly crafted her stories with impecable delivery.This one, not so much. Recycled, reused jokes, repackaged to assemble the special at any cost, shows forced performance from the very begining. It was a compilation of her previous jokes with few new/old ones and that's about it.It looks like new comedians cannot last more than two specials, (Iliza Shlesinger, taking about you).So what now? Taylor will be used and abused for that abomination of After Midnight, until she crashes and hopefuly comes back to stand up with new and fresh material. Or, maybe not. We'll see.Huge talent and natural comedy genius is going to waste in real time. At least it was good while it lasted.",False
9,10,Laughed so hard I almost threw up ðŸ˜‚,maddelise,n/a,17/08/2025,"Another great special from Taylor - she knows her lane and she sticks to it. She has recurrent themes but she's always got fresh material and doesn't flog every topic to death.I think Taylor's humour lands especially hard for me because we loosely have a similar background and are of a similar demographic, but the way she delivers personal anecdotes (especially heavy stuff) and a hilarious way is amazing. It's a great outlet to watch, as well as being entertaining, and I'm saying that as an annoying married person, not a fellow single person ðŸ¤£I've enjoyed each special and hope she keeps coming back with more!",False
10,9,Authentically funny,kdxqkqgu,n/a,17/08/2025,"With some comedians you sense how the gears ground to create the bit. Not a bit of it here. This lady is very funny and very real at the same time. She has natural flow in abundance and you kinda want to be friends with her.I'm thinking of turning to chat gpt now because this review has to be 600 words at least according to IMDB and I've already said my bit...or I could write the Lord's Prayer maybe followed by my National anthem if still necessary - if only I knew either of em well enough. Yikes, my thumbs are starting to stiffen up! Is it too late to swap to dictation. Anyway, Taylor - Respect!",False
11,2,Awful and subpar,Kincaid85,n/a,17/08/2025,"Taylor Tomlinson's previous specials were comedic genius, were Taylor used her history of anxiety, depression and her growing up ever so brilliantly to create a show that wasn't only relatable as she touched many aspects of every-day life, but was also hilarious and comedy gold.But unfortunately, this third special doesn't even come close to their predecessors. Taylor uses old jokes and repeats them endlessly, and it doesn't take long before you realize that her entire special is about one thing only: dating. And the dating jokes are not even good ones as she rehashes old material. There are very few new jokes thrown in there, but they're not really good.Interaction with audience was also awkward and weird. I've seen her interact with audiences in many YouTube videos of shows she's done in clubs, and she's actually very good. She wasn't trying too hard and was real, genuine and funny. But in ""Have it All"" it's scripted and it's painfully shows. There's nothing natural about the interactions, and for some reason Taylor resorts to ""insulting"" the ones she interacts with, and not in a smart and funny way.For someone who films their third special, she also seemed very uncomfortable and nervous. She was talking way too fast like she was hurrying or trying to do as much jokes as she can, which also hurt her delivery- which is usually very good.If there'll be a fourth special, I'd probably watch. I still believe Taylor is very talented and very funny, but she needs to come with new material and be more herself. That's what made her previous shows so good. Here it felt like she's trying too hard, and the end result has left a lot to be desired.I guess we truly can't have it all sometimes.",False
12,4,"We get it, you have a Netflix special...",Thatbusistight,n/a,17/08/2025,"We had a really hard time watching the special even just halfway through. The constant gloating and mentioning that she has a Netflix specials and that she's so important really got old. She seems to have a really negative view of people who are married and continues to talk about how boring and sad they are. Since she has no idea what it actually means to be married it was kind of embarrassing to watch her trying to describe it.Unfortunately, we found the jokes to be stale and it was hard to watch in a ""I feel bad for her"" way. We turned it off, and then tried to watch it again the next night in hopes that things would turn out better, but it almost seem like there was a sense of insecurity about her in incessant gloating and bragging about having Netflix specials that was just a huge turn off.Her other specials were so good and came from such a humble place but this one just missed the mark unfortunately.",False
13,5,Weirdly sexists,Jesse80025,n/a,17/08/2025,"HUGE fan of the last two Taylor Tomlinson specials. I've been an evangelist for her cause. This special, I don't know what happened! It's like she suddenly has so much vitriol for men! I hate to sound like I'm partaking in the ""everybody hates straight white men"" conspiracy, because I generally shush people that tell me that the world is out to get us, but she makes generalizations of swm that are really bizarre. It's like she's had a habit of dating REALLY obnoxious guys and somehow crystallized this into a man bashing special. Really disappointing because I was HYPED for this and her late night special! Taylor! Where did you go!? What happened!? Honestly feels a little betraying. It makes me wonder if maybe some demographics really do feel like it's open season on swm. I generally ignore such sentiment, but there is a difference between equal and playful stereotyping, and full on disgracing.",False
14,5,Opposite of what I said - advice to Taylor,namob-43673,n/a,17/08/2025,"The last special was to 80% great. When Taylor was talking psychology, pharmaceuticals, dead parents etc. It was fun, insightful and very good comedy at the same time. The other 20% was typical mainstream girl stand-up i.e. Relationship, male organs and dating and I found it very boring.So I said in my review on that special just that, but did she listen? No. Instead she here does the complete opposite; takes the 20% that did not really work and is boring run of the mill girl stand-up and do a full hour of it. Why Taylor? Why?Taylor Tomlinson is a comedic genius and is so funny, so insightful and can make a sponge laugh but for some reason she is dragging herself into the same corner as all other female comedians end up in. A lot of sex, a lot of phalluses, dating and all the rest. It is like female comedians think they cannot get the audience to listen unless they talk about orgasms. Why?Talk politics, talk world affairs, make fun of dwarfs, or do anything but this. Taylor can do it for sure, and probably better than anyone else, sad that she does not.With that said, and me pretending she will read this and listen to my insane ramblings, this is still good. Although she is overusing the tropes and cliches she does it very well and she is still funny, but not as great as this could have been.Worth a watch, but 5/10 is all I am giving it.A final advice from me to Taylor: take a break. Travel the world, come to Europe and visit Spain and I will buy you a few beers. Just get out of the comedy business for a while and start writing the insightful hilarious jokes about things that are more fun to listen to. You are on your way to becoming one of the biggest stars of all time, don't get stuck in the female cliches and instead do what you do best.",False
15,2,Stale bread,TerribleMovie,n/a,17/08/2025,"Taylor starts her newest comedy special with a dating rant, then transitions to a dating rant, before transitioning to a dating rant. At some point it hits you, this is just an hour long dating rant. When the best part of the special is her asking the audience for sleep advice, you know it's a bad special. The whole thing felt like stale bread. Even the audience grew wary of her never ending dating rant. She has good energy, but doesn't have anything interesting to say. She briefly mentions how she might be bi-sexual, but after hearing about dating only men for an hour, it's not to be believed. There was no standing ovation at the end for good reason, she didn't deserve one. She mentions on stage how talented she is, but someone should tell her the truth: she's not that talented at comedy. This special is stale.",False
16,3,Pacing is off and audience is fake,karl-72,n/a,17/08/2025,"The pacing of this is so fast that it's exhausting. And the audience, I swear, is fake. It reminds me of the fake audience shots from COVID era TV. Pretty sure this was done to an empty theater. A couple good laughs here and there but jokes need time to breathe. I was worn out in the first 10 minutes. She doesn't give time for the audience to genuinely react, and that is what breaks the illusion that this was done in front of real people. I don't think any comedian had been so scripted since a George Carlin routine. Too bad she's half as funny. Clearly a canned laugh track. Taylor has clearly lost her sense of comedic timing. Maybe 3 Netflix specials is one too many.",False
17,2,1 hour long rant about sex and being a failure,totymedli,n/a,17/08/2025,"This was so bad that it is hard to call it a stand-up. Her performance and jokes mostly revolve around sex, relationships, being single, and just being a failure in life in general. I understand that there is self-deprecating humor, but it has to be at least funny. It was interesting how, at the same time, she was so full of herself being a comedic success. I can't stand when mediocre comedians are unironically praising themselves.She is super cynical about everything positive, especially if it is in other people's lives. Of course, it is exaggerated, but every joke is half true, and from her behaviour, she appears to be a toxic person. Her audience interactions ranged between mean and awkward. Her performance was overplayed and overemphasized. Just because you theatrically exaggerate everything, it doesn't become funny. The same goes for her constant and unnecessary profanity.The whole show seemed like somebody who isn't satisfied with her life is just ranting about topics she didn't manage to succeed in and acting like she is just joking, but in reality, she is desperate.This is clearly an ideologically liberal themed stand-up with all the sexual topics and constant bashing of Christianity. Which doesn't contribute to it being funny for everyone. But what is worse is that there isn't any philosophical depth in it. Most of the jokes were just mean and unrelated. There was very little truth factor in them, unless you are as desperate as her.",False
18,5,Top 3 favorite female comedian,Dottsylove,n/a,17/08/2025,"I mean, she's not bad at all. I usually can't get into woman stand up comedians but Taylor Tomlinson is sorta like me so I can appreciate her humor more. The other 2 Ladies who I enjoy are Hannah Gadsby and Ms. Pat.. Taylor's pace is non-stop. No hemming and hawing,, she remembered her set and performed it masterfully. She did a little crowd work during the show and one of the inquiries were for the audience to shout out strange and weird ideas for getting to sleep. All of which she lambasted. That being said, if she happens to read reviews --Cover up the ear that is not laying on your pillow. Just the ear not the face or head at all. I mean maybe a sliver of your head and side of face can be covered if using your blanket or sheet. Try it each night over a week, should work. At the very least it IS strange and weird and nothing you heard before ----and it works.Anyway 5.9 - - 6.7 rating.",False

1,9,Great insight of Bu単uel's work and thinking,gustavo_arrieta,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing and very articulate tour through Bu単uel's rich filmography. Using restored and well selected pieces, very clearly explains the underlying thinking, motives and symbols of a true genius. The documentary itself helps Bu単uel's intention to provoke and unsettle while expressing himself.The love of Bu単uel's work shows, and brings us through all the threads of his life, his influences and his creative processes, not just to be another enshrining of a famous director, but to help us enjoy more his work.The documentary is totally delightful and interesting, keeping a good balance between the depth of the art presented, and the accessibility to make it attractive.",False

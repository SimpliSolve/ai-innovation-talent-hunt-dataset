1,10,Uncharted territory,trent-89751,n/a,16/08/2025,"True Crime goes viral on social media, so when social media influencers fall to earth- they commit horrendous crimes. Full circle. Documentary has great pacing and well researched. I would assume it's very hard to piece together narrative via social media but some how filmmakers did it. Interviews were shot great and characters were perfect to giving background into the seedy side of Las Vegas. Question that have after watching this episode, is it all worth it? Gaining millions of followers and being recognized as an influencer, but at what cost? What goes up must come down- you get a sense of this throughout episode.",False
2,4,Slow and kind of random,codygdietrich,n/a,16/08/2025,"With the title of Deadly Influence: The Social Media Murders I was expecting it to be about murders occurring at once or by the same committed by some sort of cult that arose in social media. Deadly Influence makes it seem like someone is influencing others to commit murder and putting ""The"" in front of Social Media Murders makes it sound like one event. The reality is it is a collection of different stories involving ""influencers"".I would like to know how the producers define influencers. I wouldn't consider a teenager in social media an influencer, I would consider that normal. Someone using social media to promote their business again is normal, doesn't make them an influencer. Through episodes six and most of the murders are unrelated to social media, some sorties the people met on social media but that is as far.The show tries to push people as influencers so the show spends a lot of time on their social media presence which makes the episode move really slow. By the end of the episode I don't feel like I know the people involved, there had to be more to them and their lives than what was posted to social media and yet the show focuses only on the social media aspect.",False
3,10,Dark sidez of social media,salardajeshein-94525,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDeadly Influence: Social Media Murders (2023) is a chilling documentary-style film that explores the dark side of social media and its role in facilitating dangerous behaviors, including cyberbullying, manipulation, and even murder. The film delves into the stories of individuals whose lives were affected or destroyed by the toxic influence of online platforms, shedding light on how digital environments can amplify existing societal issues.A key takeaway from the documentary is the profound impact of social media on mental health, especially in an era where comparison, online fame, and cyberbullying dominate digital spaces. The constant exposure to idealized lives and online validation can erode self-esteem and contribute to anxiety and depression. Deadly Influence also calls for greater digital literacy, urging people to understand the dangers of unchecked social media use and encouraging more responsible, empathetic online behavior. It serves as a wake-up call for both individuals and social media platforms to recognize the risks involved and take steps to prevent harm and protect vulnerable users.",True

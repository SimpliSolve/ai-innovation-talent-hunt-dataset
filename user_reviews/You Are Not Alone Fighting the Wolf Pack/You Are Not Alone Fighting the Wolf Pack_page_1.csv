1,8,LA MANADA,Guanche48,n/a,17/08/2025,"A very good documentary. A complex challenge due to the importance of a case that marked and changed the Spanish society. And maybe it sounds cliché but it is was necessary and I am really glad that they have documented it for Netflix.I know the case, but after having seen the documentary I realized that I didn't know everything, it is very well detailed and told. The work is done with care and clarity not only talking about the case but also generating a debate that is still very alive, like the fight against machismo in society. On a technical and artistic level it follows a standard, although the use of some nice music is a good choice.I really liked the way it transports you to the 'San Fermines' in Pamplona and shortly after the big party has started it becomes a real and big brutal crime.'No estás sola' is important to see and emotion and information will not leave anyone indifferent. This was a horrific gang rape in Spain! And they meticulously put together the events of that horror night.It is about the fight for justice, raising crucial questions about consent, victim blaming, and societal responsibility. There is no doubt that this documentary provokes high emotions of injustice, frustration and at the same time empathy.Don't miss this one.",False
2,10,"Moving, many layered documentary",lalasCat,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an extraordinary documentary (on UK Netflix as 'You are Not Alone' ) Like most women I was afraid of the amount of emotional distress and fear I would feel in watching a film about rape. This many layered and empathetic documentary, taking us through the violent event leading to mass protests all over Spain and the world, eventually forced Spanish Law to be changed forever. It could have been emotionally manipulative but Instead it was empowering and gave me courage knowing we are not alone. I am sending it to every young person I know.Writers/Directors: Robert Bahar & Almudena Carracedo

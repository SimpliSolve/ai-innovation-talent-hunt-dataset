1,7,"By the fans, for the fans.",FergusMBurke,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is more about the fans than it is about the movies. Having said that we get to see the movies through their eyes. Mad Max fans from all over the world come together to share their deep love for a film franchise that started life as a low budget distopian survival movie. These people are superfans who eat sleep and drink Mad Max. It's a touching look at how the Mad Max movies have affected the actors, the extras, the fans and even the people who live close to the filming locations in Australia. We also get to see the cars, the bikes, the costumes and some interesting memorabilia. But this is about the people, an induring group of devoted fans.",False

3,10,Best Doco ever !,bikerleo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bertand Cadarts idea to make a film brought to life by Eddie Beyroothy. Bertand has passed away now he was an amazing guy. Bertand was a mayor for Glamorgan Spring in Tasmania for many years he has a museum display in Swansea Tasmania, how many people have that happen ever, he was special. Not only was Bertrand (clunk) in Mad Max 1 had run a bike shop that built many of the bikes for Mad Max 1. Since there are literally thousands of Mad Max fans of course there are the die hards who just have to dress up and collect memorabillia, most of them have watched the film more times than evry other film genre in existance.This Australian film has touched people all over the planet for many many reasons leading to creation of Wasteland Weekend juat outside of California City every september , people from all over the globe meet there to show their love of art and world peace, aswell as building vechicles and costumes to either look like they are from a Mad Max film or like they should be in one. It is truely a fun experience. Now another event has popped up called Pox Eclipse in Western Australia similar to Wasteland Weekend USA. Anyone who loves the postapocalyptic genre should check them out ! Thanks for making this film !",False

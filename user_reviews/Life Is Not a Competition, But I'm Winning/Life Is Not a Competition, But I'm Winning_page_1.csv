1,9,Be a good sport and watch this film!,njferns,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, I should say that I don't like sports (stereotypical gay guy in that manner lol) but even I enjoyed this film and learnt A LOT from it, so that's saying something!Did you know?Women were first allowed to participate in the Olympic Games only in 1928.The first woman to win the 800m race, Lina Radke, was robbed of her opportunity to be feted at the prize ceremony and stand on the podium.The tradition of the Olympic torch relay does not come from antiquity. It was instituted by the Nazis in 1936.You'll discover this and so much more from this film.This documentary fulfills multiple purposes:It honors the female and queer athletes from the past whose victories have been forgotten and their legacies lost.It includes novel concepts like going back in time to these historical milestone events to kind of communicate to these individuals and/or bring peace to their souls for being wronged.It celebrates these sporty souls and even seems to say almost a prayer for each of them as well. So it also feels DEEPLY spiritual.It reveals fascinating facts (like the three I mentioned above).It aims to empower the current crop of female and queer athletes who are forced to participate under stipulations drawn by the cis male gaze or enforced by the cis male lens.It features so many beautiful conversations and effective dialogues between current players from varied intersections and generations. For example, on how patriarchy has found ways to enforce its whims and levy accusations on them. And how this has been happening through the decades and eras, just to nurse the fragile cis male ego and insecurities.I'm hoping all of these points have shared will make you want to watch this movie. If you're a sports fan, especially when it comes to the Olympics, this is a must-watch. However, even if you aren't into sports, this is an immersive, educational watch.",False

1,7,Delia Derbyshire: The Myths and Legendary Tapes,Prismark10,n/a,15/08/2025,"Members of the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop has been heralded as the unsung heroes of experimental and electronic music.They were not creating strange sounds and noises for television and radio shows. It was musical harmonies from their small cramped studio in Maida Vale.It is only in recent that they have been regarded as pioneers especially in the field of dance and new wave music.Delia Derbyshire is probably the most well known member of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. A woman who had been knocked back by various record companies, she had to deal with rampant sexism of the time.Delai is mot famous for the realising the Doctor Who theme tune after it was composed by Ron Grainer.I remember many years ago, Midge Ure in a quiz show cited not only Ron Grainer as the composer of the Doctor Who theme but mentioned the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. He acknowledged their contribution.This Arena special (which ironically has an introductory music from Brian Eno, an avant garde electronica musician.) is a love letter from Caroline Catz. She wrote, directed and stars as Delia Derbyshire.This is not a straightforward drama documentary. It has to be taken as a piece of artwork itself as it explores Delia and her music.Delia was a mathematician who graduated from Cambridge University. Her fascination with white noise was influenced by the bombings of her childhood city of Coventry during the war.Delia volunteered to join the Radiophonic Workshop. Others had to be forced to work there and they did not last long.Along with Brian Hodgson, she would branch off with composing experimental music with several collaborators.The film is enhanced by voiceovers from Delia herself and interviews with friends and colleagues.Although a celebration of her life and music, it does not shy away from her alcoholism.Catz has made something that has a lot to enjoy and I learned a lot more about Delia Derbyshire.",False
2,9,"An uplifting meeting of minds, style and subject",tiltilton,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an inspired and inspiring film. Catz and her team brilliantly bring to life the oddities and wonders of Delia Derbyshire's beautiful, rebellious, determined, ever-searching creative mind. This is such an uplifting film - one that not only honours its subject well but does so by drawing its visual and sonic inspiration from this remarkable and, until recently, overlooked composer (and yes, sometimes troubled 'de-composer'.) It makes me want to make music again. And noise. Our human need for and affinity with organised sound (isn't that what music really is?) filled my living room with light from my TV screen. And I was only smoking plain English tobacco with a few mugs of English tea. A good end to a good day and maybe even the first bubble-clouds of new sounds forming in my head like familiar, unfamiliar smoke. Thank you so much, Delia, Cosey and Ms. Catz. I'm now in love with all three of you. And very high.",False

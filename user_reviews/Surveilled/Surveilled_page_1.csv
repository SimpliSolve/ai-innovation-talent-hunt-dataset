1,7,Hot topic deserves a more in-depth assessment,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Surveilled"" (2024 release; 61 min) opens, we are in ""Tel Aviv, March 2022"" and investigative reporter Ronan Farrer is speaking with someone about Pegasus, the spyware made and owned by Israeli company NSO Group. Pegasus is the best known of the spywares out there and is completely intrusive. It can access any and all smart phone remotely and completely, with you ever knowing about it. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: while the upsides of spywares are obvious (to combat terrorists and murderers), the downsides are even scarier (to track political opponents, etc.). And as this documentary shows, the latter is being done more and more (the Spanish government used it to track Catalan politicians in favor of splitting from Spain). All super interesting stuff. Alas, at just 60 minutes, it all flies by in no time. I wish that Ferrar and the film makers had spent a little more time digging around to show more examples of authorities abusing the spyware for political advantage. When asked how to curb a nefarious use of spyware like Pegasus, a talking head laments ""you can't put the spyware genie back into the bottle, I'm afraid"". In other words: it's going to get (a lot) worse before it'll get better...""Surveilled"" recently started showing on HBO and streaming on Max, where I caught it the other night. If you have an interest better understanding the potential (up and down) of spyware like Pegasus, this is a good starter (but the last word on this is surely yet to come). I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,7,A piece of a larger puzzle,Marc-Drost,n/a,16/08/2025,"On the positive side, this documentary informs the public and it's a good thing imo that it is being done trough this more mainstream channel and spokesperson. So I give it high marks for effort and exposure.However, as other reviewers point out. There are noteworthy omissions. First of all, the spyware is being developed in Israel. It is strange, in the context of the ongoing war in Gaza and the situation in the occupied West Bank, that there is no mention of Palestine at all. By now, we are informed, most notably through the excellent book The Palestine Laboratory by Antony Loewenstein, of how this type of software is being tested in the apartheid regime, on the Palestinian population. But I guess this can be excused because the documentary would probably get shunned by many outlets if this disgraceful chapter would be included. Also it would have been interesting to know more about which countries are using it.Conclusion: the doc leaves me hungry for more in depth and elaborate information. But stimulating this appetite is a good thing, hence my 7 stars.",False
3,4,Disappointing Ronan Show,JensSeidl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately, this documentary is nowhere near as hard hitting as it makes out to be. The scope of the investigation is rather narrow. Especially given the accusations about countries in the Middle East and Africa abusing modern surveillance technology, none of this is actually substantiated. Instead the investigation focuses on one ology provider (who opened their doors willingly in a PR trust exercise), the US, and Spain. To make things worse, the style of the documentation is heavily focused on the author and narrator, Ronan Farrow, and therefore turns into a personality show about him, rather than the real subject matter. This leaves the viewer with a sense of a missed opportunity.",False
4,10,This movie couldn't be more timely,sandrakwylie,n/a,16/08/2025,"While much of the content of this film has already been in the public information stream for some time (see Nicole Perlroth's ""This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race"" from 2021), it couldn't be a more timely warning in the wake of the 2024 presidential election.I give the movie 10 stars as a wake up call to all who care about privacy, transparency, democracy and our drift towards the Surveillance State. We can and we must talk about this ceaselessly.I give it only 5 stars for not addressing the surveillance abuses in China and Russia.While it mentions the ban on federal use of such ""commercial"" programs, the film doesn't address the abuses local law enforcement have and could wield in the name of public safety.Finally, it's concerning that the movie's narrow focus on a singular program by a single company could lessen the impact of the message of this movie. Hopefully viewers will grasp that Pegasus is the ""canary in the coal mine,"" so to speak. The US government may currently prohibit the purchase of commercial spy programs. But government-developed programs are still viable. And once those get into the wild, as they surely will, it will be impossible to close Pandora's Box.",False
5,n/a,Ruined by the narcissistic journalist,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incredibly important topic, but sadly this doc is ruined by the fact Farrow seems to be the president of his own fanclub and apparently had to make sure he's in every second frame. We get it, you're a big time hot shot. However, this movie would have greatly benefitted from him taking a step back - literally - and let the troubling facts speak for themselves. A good documenary filmmaker is invisible. At least if your name is not Louis Theroux. Somebody should pass that info along to Farrow. Massively wasted opportunity and a rare miss from the otherwise very strong HBO documentary departement.",False
6,4,Insufficiently enlightening documentary on spyware,mateoame,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film follows Ronan Farrow's investigation for the New Yorker into the Pegasus spy technology. It's a hot topic and something that interests me, so I decided to see it. However, I write this review with the feeling that my time would have been better spent if I had just read the article instead of watching the whole picture.On the plus side, it does serve to recall some recent espionage scandals (albeit mostly just mentioned) and effectively raises the question 'Do you think it's posible to have a world where such a thing exists and it's used responsibly?' The Catalan example makes you ponder that.On the downside, I think this piece lacks the virtues of a good didactic documentary. It is rather a TV product: it focuses on selling Ronan to the public and doesn't dig deep enough into the subject. I missed more information on how Elies or Citizen Lab manage to uncover the infiltrations and also more on other espionage cases. I was hesitating whether to give it a 5 or a 4. After reading other reviews I gave it a 4.",False
7,8,Yuval Noah Harari,smoochemail,n/a,16/08/2025,Being in the truth community for the last four years it kind of became obvious to me what these smart devices were really about.Harari said at a WEF conference that humans are hackable animals and that free will is over. We now know what you're thinking (NeuroLink)It seems that everything is about surveillance and data harvesting as data is money.In order to stop them harvesting your data it's best to throw away your smart devices. Use a laptop that's hard wired.The only smart device I have is a tablet that never leaves my home but it's difficult when you leave as you're captured many times through 5G Face Recognition.I think Max Igan recently spoke about Pegasus.,False
8,3,There will always be evil,furrytailfarm,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo a technology that was created to do good will be turned around and be used for evil. Yawn. Everything that has ever been developed for good has always found its way to evil. No surprise. The pearl clutching and faux horror that Pegasus can be used for nefarious reasons is ridiculous. Bad people acting badly should not surprise anyone. Bad people will always use good inventions for bad reasons. Pegasus is not bad. Some of its users are. Same with everything. Sorry but good people need not worry. I was hoping for something new and all I got was same old, same old. Ronan was lovely to watch!!!",True
9,1,HBO's 'Surveilled' (2024): A Descent into Fearmongering and Documentary Deba sement,fdsafdsafd,n/a,16/08/2025,"H, HBO, how the mighty have fallen. Once a beacon of insightful and nuanced documentaries, you've now apparently decided to trade substance for sensationalism with 'Surveilled.' This supposed 'documentary' feels less like investigative journalism and more like a poorly scripted scare tactic designed to whip the public into a frenzy of paranoia.The premise, a shallow dive into the supposed omnipresence of surveillance, is delivered with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Instead of presenting balanced arguments and exploring the complexities of the issue, we're subjected to a relentless barrage of ominous music, distorted visuals, and breathless pronouncements of impending doom. It's less a documentary and more a horror movie, minus the jump scares (though, the sheer level of manipulative editing certainly tries).And let's talk about the 'experts' featured in this production. A parade of individuals, each seemingly chosen for their ability to deliver pronouncements with maximum gravitas, their voices often artificially deepened or otherwise altered to sound 'authoritative'. The vocal fry epidemic is also in full effect, with every other interviewee sounding like they're struggling to keep their voice from descending into a gravel pit. It's less informative and more like a bizarre vocal exercise.The once-respected HBO Documentary Films brand has been tarnished by this exercise in fearmongering. Where are the in-depth explorations? The nuanced perspectives? The balanced analysis? Instead, we're left with a shallow, manipulative piece of 'journalism' that prioritizes shock value over substance. It's a sad day when HBO, a network that once championed thoughtful documentaries, descends into the realm of cheap, sensationalist drivel. If 'Surveilled' is any indication, HBO's documentary division has lost its way, trading its legacy for a quick and dirty attempt to scare the public. Avoid at all costs.""",False

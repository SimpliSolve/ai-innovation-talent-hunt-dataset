1,10,As good as it gets,timaldiss-463-404122,n/a,15/08/2025,"Aaron has put together a definitive view of those crazy few free years where those of us who had the sheer luck to be part of what feels like the last unhindered cultural movement of people, experienced the time of our lives.This film features all the stars of the scene and tells the story of the times and of the social movements that collided to bring the free party scene alive.Dancing in front of large, often outdoor sound systems, under the stars, shoulder to shoulder with strangers who became best mates, often for days, we were the blessed few, and this film brings it all back. Thank you.",False
2,9,Excellent Documentary,qbjczsd,n/a,15/08/2025,"An energetic film both serious and joyous, Free Party: A Folk History expertly documents overlooked events in rave history. Following the free party movement up to and including the infamous Castlemorton festival (known as the Woodstock of the rave scene) and its aftermath, viewers are informed about historical events while at the same time, invited to the party. Director Aaron Trinder delivers with a professional approach, yet brings the audience in by being faithful to its subject. The music, interviews, photos, and video footage all contribute to evoke an era defined by both fun and rebellion. An engaging watch.",False

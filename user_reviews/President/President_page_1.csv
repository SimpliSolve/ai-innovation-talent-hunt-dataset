1,10,Democracy's fragility laid bare - finally!,zisoreg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two of the most compelling hours of documentary footage covering the African political landscape I've ever watched.This documentary tells the unfortunate story of events leading up to the announcement of the 2018 General Election results in Zimbabwe. It tests the nerve of those who believe in Justice, Equality, Human Rights, Citizen Agency & Democracy.Camilla Nielsson captured the mood perfectly, as well as the emotion and I urge all to watch this and search within themselves for the answer to the question: What have I done for Democracy today? Am I compelled to do more?",False

3,10,A great many thanks from the people of Zimbabwe,zambezitolimpopo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you for the effort you put...in telling the true story of the inhuman oppression of the masses of Zimbabwe by a system that is bent on staying in power at all costs. Since 1980 Zimbabwe has suffered under the brutal misgovernance and corrupt rule of zanupf. they have and still continue to plunder the nations resources, even donor aid is not being spared!Zimbabwes systems of government are captured by the ruling party, the cartel is running all corners of the state and elections will yield nothing but another 5 years of misrule.Nelson Chamisa won the 2018 election, but there is no system to ensure the losers conced defeat and allow for a swift transfer of power. The nation has seriously plunged into becoming a securocratic state and the democratic space has been shut down. The constitution has been thrown out the bin and they have instituted a grand state capture!All the whilst institutions like the UN, AU, even SADC stand by watch and even rush to congratulate an illegitimate 'president'.Zimbabwe shall be free!!",False
4,10,More dramatic than drama,WhyBadMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Reality and politics is always more dramatic than any script people would dare to write. The structure of the movie is so simple and direct, which make the events even more outstanding. I love the story telling!I didn't know much about this country except its currency, now I have some idea how corrupted, ridiculous and shameless the regime is, but there are dreamers who are still struggling to bring hope to the country.",False

1,6,"I love Bert, BUT this was just ok .",mavashack,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched with my girlfriend (who found it funny ) but I think this humour is probably suited for young adults. Nothing memorable in this special. Not bashing Bert; I am a fan of him. I hope we see some more sharper angles from him in the future ? One of the problems is a lot of people tune into his podcast with Tom, which is amazing . People eventually expect your comedy level to be more crisp and smoother as your podcast. It's kind of like watching your favourite baseball player hitting .300 and cranking 40 homers , and then the next season only hitting 20 (which is fine) but not to the level we expect.",False
2,7,Quite okay,travanca,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was expecting an overworked special since everyone has had to wait 3 years to put out new stuff.Yes there are his ""clich√©s"", or is ""Bertisms"" but it's well constructed and funny.I know he is 50 and a comedian for a long time but what angers me about Bert is that deep down he has what it takes to became a worldwide famous comedian, an household name, and even though he is extremelly famoun in the US, he falls short in the rest of the world due to playing too much into his ""frat boy"" personna.That's his identity, sure. But he should grow with it and the humour is still ""I drink, my wife's a redneck, my kids are dumb""Overall it's still a pretty funny special that very much exceeded my expectations, well done Bart!",False
3,9,Hilarious!,apelissi,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best stand up performances I've watched in a while. Nothing against Chris Rock's new special, but I thought this was way better.The show revolves around funny things that happens in his family life. I wouldn't recommend this to people that are offended by off color humor. Although I wouldn't recommend comedy in general to people that are easily offended.Anybody that enjoys Burt Kreischer on podcasts will be thoroughly entertained. IMO Burt is starting to approach Bill Burr and Eddie Murphy territory as an all time great. He has a little ways to go yet, but the dude is killing it and deserves the shine.",False
4,9,absolutely hilarious,alextatewallace,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always been more of a Tom Segura fan and have always felt Bert to be mildly funny, but this special is off the charts hilarious. Truly really great standup, I have not laughed this hard in a long long time. Bert deserves recognition for being a master of the art form at this point because this is his best work yet.His delivery, transitions and almost all new material give the special room for him to spread his wings and get away from the (very funny) machine story. This special proves unequivocally that he is actually a legit standup act and not a one hit wonder. Also I love that he puts out fewer specials than saturating the market with one a year like a lot of other comedians. Well done Brent Chrysler.",False
5,10,Best comedy special in the last 5 years,joeymarra-68293,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was never the biggest fan of Bert but thought I'd give this a try and I'm glad I did. Bert seems to have almost totally perfected his story telling and punchlines, I have not laughed out loud at a comedy special in years, this had me cracking up from start to finish. Absolutely hilarious punchlines. Bert has come a long way, his family stories are too funny and well crafted to make you laugh the whole way through. Too many comics have been taking on ""wokeness"" and using that as the way to set up 90% of their jokes that may land for some people, but it is so old at this point. Bert makes only one ""woke"" joke during this special and it is the absolute funniest one I've ever heard. Bert killed it and I can't recommend this special enough! Easily 10/10.",False
6,3,Glad I didn't pay money to see this live,jon_anderson77,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've been a big fan of Bert over the last 3 years discovering him after his succes from The Machine story and then consuming all of his original series of Something's Burning, his Podcasts with Tom short-lived Netflix show The Cabin and have always found him funny however he has really missed the mark here. From the opening knotted ass hair joke this special is lazy crude and unengaging. He covers info about his family for a new audience but for those who have followed him for years this is boring rehashed jokes about His wife being a redneck & his daughter being a bit slow. Zzzzzz. I guess it's true that when you lose the hunger of fame your art suffers and it really suffers here. Repetition and swearing does not equal comedy gold and makes me worry about the upcoming movie based on his Machine anecdote. It's by far the weakest special from that particular group of comic friends. If you want to see something we'll crafted and funny watch Andrew Santino's Cheeseburger and give this one a miss. It's not the end of Bert by any means as he will have continued success as a podcaster, TV presenter, movie star etc but maybe it should be the end of Bert the stand up. Give this one a miss.",True
7,1,Bert needs less exposure to be more funny,airmanleo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hate to give this such a poor review because I'm genuinely a fan of Bert's. To me it this special was lots of recycled stories that were maybe a bit better polished. Only two jokes I hadn't heard before.The first 1/3rd of the special Bert talked so fast and was out of breath, seemed nervous, he eventually settles in to a rhythm.I've been following Bert since before his Travel Channel days, I have to say his comedy has suffered in recent years in the sense that I think his creativity is spread too thin, between podcasting and film projects.Also when a person is in the public eye as much as Bert it's not as much of a ""treat"" to hear stories from the podcasts or his stand up 2 years ago. Too much exposure is a real thing.I hate to use this example but look at Dave Chappelle, you don't see him but maybe once every month or two and it's exciting because he's having experiences and people want to hear about what he's been up to.People know what Bert had for lunch last Saturday and how many drinks he had, he needs less exposure to be better at stand up.",False
8,1,Not his best work,xmbyhphk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Big big fan of Bert's I've seen all of his specials, he's a great podcaster and comedian but I was not a fan of this special, I really felt like he just wasn't ready to do this special. A lot of recycled jokes, not a whole lot of creativity or original stuff. I hate to leave this but it didn't get me going like his last specials. I think he should have waited another year to polish his jokes or come up with some new material. Bert feels the need to rush into releasing a special right away. The first 20 minutes he was sprinting through all these mediocre jokes I've heard several times from other comedians. I could go on but watch it for yourself, personally not for me. To each it's own.",False
9,1,Drunk at a party that everyone is trying to ignore.,adamnixonNE,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is so bad. It's not so much that this one prop pony(you take off your shirt, again, well done) is using rehashed jokes that were not funny in the first place, it's that instead of being edgy and hilarious like a Chappelle, Kreischer is just crude. It feels like he's trying to play to a frat house audience. None of the bits are even polished. Did he try this material out in clubs first? Were these just the jokes he used on his own tour? He should have done open mics instead to get proper feedback and he could see where the bits flatlined rather than going to the well of existing fans. I could not get over the feeling that this is the old guy at the wedding, who is drunk, and doesn't realize how loud he is, while prodding and pushing other guests who don't want to know him.",False
10,2,"I wanted to like it, but sadly didn't",pauldinh-26205,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've enjoyed some of his older stand up specials but this sadly felt like the worst of his work to date.His punchlines barely got a chuckle out of me at best and there's a lot of reusing his old tropes. As an example, I don't get why there is a a slow-mo of him bursting out of his shirt and why being shirtless has become his 'thing' because while it might have some value the first time, I just don't find it funny the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time.I felt his stories left me puzzled in this special, which is a shame because his most famous 'the machine' story is so well polished and funny. These jokes fell flat because I constantly was finding myself questioning the believability of his stories and that he is simply trying to make them as crude as possible because that's what he thinks the audience wants (and if it works well more power to him, it's just not for me).",False
11,1,Burnt Chrysanthemum,hankstrickland-10561,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBert Kreischer's new stand-up special Razzle Dazzle was a disappointment as it failed to showcase his comedic talents. Bert's continuous shirtlessness was unappealing, and his excessive twerking and drinking during the show were distasteful. It was cringeworthy to see him pass out during the taping due to the excessive shots he had taken. Additionally, his repeated use of the phrase ""call me daddy"" while grinding on the audience members made them extremely uncomfortable. Overall, the show lacked the humor and wit that Bert Kreischer is known for, and I would not recommend it to anyone. Bert burps broccoli bites behind big berthas breakfast bar.",True
12,4,comedy is dead,ashilman-20581,n/a,16/08/2025,"Comedy is dead in this society and this is a good representation of this. Cancel culture and political correctness has taken over every aspect of this business and it's shown in this special. Big fan of Bert from the beginning but these jokes and stories are very unlike him. He was always the funny, immature, fat alcoholic with great stories but now it's more of a careful wordplay to not get in trouble with anyone. I would laugh uncontrollably at his old specials and this one would crack a smile out of me here and there. It wasn't unfunny, just unlike him. It's hard to see great comedians such as bert being blocked by norms forced into society.",False
13,1,I Want To Like It,genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"As I've wanted to like all of his specials but I just don't get what I'm missing when it comes to peole like him and Whitney Cummings and Kevin Hart, and a few others. Other comedians seem to appreciate him but there's just so much over-the-top nonsense in lieu of actual comedy. I've felt the same thing about Robin Williams - he was probably funny but the manic, inane delivery isn't enough to distract me from the fact that there's very little comedy there. Seriousy - watch it and don't get lulled into laughing because you know it was a punch line. Actually be discerning and think 'is this actually funny?'
Thank GOD Ryan Sickler and Big Jay have 2 great specials coming out in a week - I KNOW they will actually be funny.",False
14,4,Bert needs fewer comedic specials and more joke writing...,Airman87,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bert Kreischer is easily at the top of the index of least funny people relative to their fame. I don't want to say I despise Bert, because he seems genuine in a lot of ways outside of standup comedy, but this special is pretty terrible. My prejudices aside Bert against, Razzle Dazzle really feels like Bert phoned it in, reusing old jokes and harping on overexaggerated mediocrity of family story time. Normally I can stomach one of Bert's specials if I am pretty bored, but this was on another level that I could not finish it. Bert has done himself no favors if he believes this special while serve as pasturage for growing new fans. This special is a hard pass for me on a recommendation.",False

1,10,"Brilliant film employing music, poetry and real life drama",bill_nevins,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a brilliant film which employs contemporary trad music, poetry and the drama of real life to show a picture of contemporary inner city Dublin on the cusp of change.One hopes the director will continue with a film about Dundalk, about Derry, about Belfast and about Limerick. We need such a clear sighted view as Ireland moves forward.The participation of many of Ireland's most powerful contemporary singers and instrumentalists contributes so much to the impact of this film. Shooting it in black and white is a genius move, giving the film a timeless air.I watched this film in an art theater in Albuquerque New Mexico and I am recommending it to everyone.",False
2,1,Exploitative and negatively biased film,morrisonmarie-02096,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is shameful, exploitative and rambling.It was incredibly non-representative of the communities it reported to portray. This depiction of these communities was deeply biased and negative. There was a disturbing emphasis on the 'darkness' of the area as opposed to giving the audience a contrast of light and dark (which is more representative).The film lacked structure and was simply confusing and misleading as a result. It was geographically inaccurate. The North Circular Road is a straight road and yet many detours were taken in the film. Ironically, most of the film wasn't actually based on the North Circular Road.The one star I gave it was for the music, which was the film's only saving grace.",False
3,1,A dead hand,PVN-9,n/a,16/08/2025,"What was the aim of this film? It was condescending towards the people it implied it championed. It celebrated a few elements of backwardness and degradation as working class 'culture'. Yet gave no chance for the people to articulate their views. Using artistic artifice the film was a sleight of hand that slandered the working class communities it supposedly portrayed, A truly nasty piece of work. Deeply cynical.",False

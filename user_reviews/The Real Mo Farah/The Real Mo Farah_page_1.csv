1,10,The title says it all...really brave of Mo to do this,findlay-62023,n/a,16/08/2025,"Apart from the track heroics, I really commend Mo Farah for helping us understand the impact human traffickng can have on our wellbeing. He was one of the lucky ones I suppose...so many others without his talents would have been forgotten. This film conveys the emotional turmoil that Mo has gone through...and his acceptance of how he overcame abandonment not only because of his incredible track abilities but also his mindset which gave him the strength to overcome family strife. And the film crew did an amazing job filming Mo back in his village in Somalia -- and what a welcome he received. You could argue he should never have been sent to the UK but who knows what would have happened if he remained in Somalia.",False

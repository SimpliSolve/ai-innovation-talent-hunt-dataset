1,9,Compelling UFO Documentary,JGReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Want to Believe is one of the more compelling UFO documentaries that I've seen. I'm a bit of a skeptic still, but I like watching these films to see what they have to say and I Want to Believe definitely maintained my interest. The film presents well known UFOlogists, why they got into the field, and the most credible information about the subject. Whether you're a skeptic or a believer, I think you're going to want to watch I Want to Believe.",False
2,4,"Lacking content, would be fine as a radio show.",rodder-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sadly just another repetitive UFO documentary which uses too much CGI and pointless or random unexplained imagery to spice up what is effectively a radio show style discussion.What was being said was fair enough, and well enough put, but for those who have followed the UFO story, it brings nothing new to the table.It's almost as though these CGI fest all talk with no visual substance documentaries are being made to bore the pants off of people who may otherwise have gained some interest.",False
3,8,I Believe Now,daveh2332,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's been docs about UFO enthusiasts, and it's time for an update and this one does a good job of doing so, by not only relying on the accounts of regular people, but also actual government workers who were employed to track this kind of data. It was good to see the two camps juxtaposed and how they compare and contrast to each other. I have been around when people saw what was commonly described, but also don't feel like it's such a wild and crazy idea, or even that big a deal, so I tend to believe there are such unexplained aerial phenomena, anyway. So not sure this will change anyone's mind, but I did find this doc informative and engaging.",False
4,9,An intriguing UFO film.,harriscalvin-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Want to Believe was truly an intriguing UFO film. All of the interviews were really compelling. Director J. Horton did an impressive job giving the audience an inside look in this continued phenomenon. This subject matter is one that has always peaked my interest. Hearing first hand from several experts who have worked in this field within several world governments helped to lend credibility to the film as well. The music, editing, camera work were all on point.",False
5,9,"Deep, balanced, well-produced",JCanni68,n/a,16/08/2025,"A well-produced doc on ufology, I was pleasantly impressed with the depth, quality and presentation. Though I'm a skeptic, I'm also a big sci-fi fan and am fascinated with the topic, and this film successfully kept me interested throughout. I felt most of the interviewees were each qualified to speak on the subject, and I was relieved that some had some new insights I hadn't heard before. What I was particularly impressed with was the balanced approach it took, not trying to force you to believe, but laying out the data and letting you decide. And the amount of data, personal accounts and theories will give you plenty of food for thought. Would highly recommend for the doubters!",False
6,9,Terrific UFO documentary,craigahrens,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a sucker for anything UFO related. So of course I find myself watching a lot of crap! However, not this time!! This is one terrific UFO documentary. Director J. Horton does a great job of telling the story without lulling the viewer to sleep (which is often times the case). This is a wonderful UFO doc to watch for the skeptics. Skeptic or not, you will be entertained watching, I Want to Believe!!",False
7,8,Highly Informative,abuckeye-93632,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Want To Believe is a highly informative Documentary on UFO's and if you don't believe in them, you may after watching this Documentary. I believe in UFO's and have watched many specials on the subject and this Documentary gets two thumps up.",False
8,8,Gripping doc!,Smgrte235860,n/a,16/08/2025,"Super interesting documentary about people's experiences with the extraterrestrial. If you didn't believe before, you might now!",False
9,9,Solid UFO Doc!,robertjuster,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Want to Believe is a well-produced and compelling UFO documentary. Whether you already believe or not, this film does a great job at presenting evidence through interviews and footage with well-known ""UFOlogists"". I've seen a handful of documentaries about this subject and I Want to Believe is definitely one of the better ones! Totally worth checking out on Amazon prime!",False
10,8,An in depth study of UFOs,kjs1144,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Want to Believe is a really immersive documentary about the never ending UFO fascination. All the interviewees are very knowledgeable and informative. I actually learned quite a bit that I didn't know before. The editing is fantastic, with good pacing and interesting archive material. Check it out!",False
11,9,Excellent UFO documentary,WatcherOfTheSkies777,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIt really distinguishes itself from some lesser UFO docs by having credible sources and experts and providing some intriguing details and compelling proof. A must watch for both UFO fans and sceptics alike !,True
12,8,For Ancient Aliens fans,andrewtschroeder,n/a,16/08/2025,"Im fan of the show Ancient Aliens so this doc caught my attention. It takes a couple of the shows more credible, level headed contributors and lets them talk about recent sightings in a cohesive way without the crazy spin and jumping to conclusions that Ancient Aliens is famous for.",False
13,8,Really decent documentary,Anmer93,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really decent documentary. I watch a lot of documentaries in this genre and no matter how many I watch I still get the same sense of wonder. The cases discussed might not be groundbreaking but the subject matter is just as engaging as ever. The sad truth of this genre is again there's no definitive answers here, but the questions as still so interesting!",False
14,8,I really do want to believe.. but I'm a skeptic,lbruhnca,n/a,16/08/2025,"So do you or don't you - believe in UFOs and life beyond earth? This documentary will take you into a world of research and information with a variety of perspectives so one can become more informed. Then it's up to you to decide if you believe or not. Many unusual non tangible events can be explained away, but if there is compelling repetitive information and data, such as presented in these interviews, you can to take a minute to consider if the skeptic in you is still valid or not.",False
15,9,Best UFO doc,alanakmd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you believe in aliens or not, this documnetary is thoroughly engaging. It provides a pulse on what is currently happening in the world of UFOlogy, and I even learned a new term - USO - unidentified submerged object. Definitely worth the watch!",False
16,8,What a great panel experts featured in this UFO documenary,jimlewisjr,n/a,16/08/2025,This group of UFOthogy true believers lay out a good case that make you want to believe too.,False
17,8,Compelling,big007,n/a,16/08/2025,I want to believe is basically wanting to believe people who have seen UFO and I will probably never know but I documentaries like this make you want to believe.,False
18,8,Ufologists and Nick Pope,GilbertS-85,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is one of my first forays into UFOs and such. The interviews came from highly credible sounding ""Ufologists."" I couldn't stop listening to one in particular. I believe his name is Nick Pope, who worked for twenty-one years in the British Government's Ministry of Defence (MoD) and was posted to the UFO Project by the government. The information he gave out (and challenged us to find through recently released declassified files) was compelling. I'm not sure ""I want to believe,"" but after watching this, I'm keeping an open mind. After all, UFOs are only unidentified, not necessarily extraterrestrial.",False
19,9,UFOs and More,grantpichla,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary will take you on a journey into the unknown, considering some of the phenomena surrounding UFOs and the people ready to discuss them. It isn't the first of it's kind, but for someone looking to learn more about UFOs, it's a fantastic starting point. A few of the stories in this are very entertaining!",False
20,10,Balanced Compelling Doco,gpigville,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm very interested in UFO's and if you have even a passing interest in this phenomena then this doco is a great watch. Experts in UFOlogy (is that a word?!) discuss famous cases and lesser known stories. All of them fascinating. A great introduction to the world of UFO's. Are we alone in the universe? Are UFO's extraterrestrial? That is for you to decide. The documentary takes a measured unbiased approach allowing you to draw your own conclusions. Regardless of where you stand, this is a great doco that is well worth your time.",False
21,8,Entertaining and Informative!,gabriela-tollman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a subject that I have always wanted to know more about. The Filmmaker did a great job distilling all the information into a coherent narrative. The film was very easy to follow, had a great pace and interesting interviews. I enjoyed some of the visuals and the film does not spoon-feed or preach. I also appreciated the inclusion of various timelines and that the information is very recent and up to date. I also really liked some of the spiritual quotes included in the storytelling. I definitely recommend this to anyone who has an interest in the subject!",False
22,9,Great UFO Documentary,tlg317,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stuff like this always interests me, so I've seen my fair share of UFO shows/films. That said, I Want to Believe is really well done. The film masterfully dives into UFOlogy without any of the low budget shaky cam/weirdness you often find with these types of documentaries. I also really enjoyed how they spent time looking into the lives of the experts they interview. It's easy to put any John Doe on camera and have him read a teleprompter, but I Want to Believe used real experts and does a great job at showing how these experts are real people with real lives just like us. It was a solid watch.",False
23,8,Really interesting info,lindapalmer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not much of an alien follower, so don't have a lot of experience or knowledge, so I found this documentary very informative and well directed and produced. Would definitely recommend.",False
24,8,If you're a fan of Ancient Aliens you'll enjoy this.,yuengling215,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a fan of the show ""Ancient Aliens"" you will probably enjoy watching this. This documentary goes a little more into detail about what people like Nick Pope believes & they look more into stuff that's happened around the world.
To the person that says Nick Pope & Nick Redfern were given more time, obviously doesn't have a clue who these people are. Nick Pope worked for the British Ministry of Defense & actually studied these phenomenon. He's also been in MANY documentaries along with Nick Redfern & Mike Bara who were also in the series Ancient Aliens on the History Channel. They are highly qualified & very well versed in UFOlogy.",False
25,9,Excellent Work,allison91,n/a,16/08/2025,This doc does a great job of combining the best parts of the classic History Channel documentaries with current information and--ahem--disclosures. If you are at all intrigued by the UFO phenomenon this is well worth the watch. I leaned so much and appreciated the in depth interviews from sources I hadn't seen before,False

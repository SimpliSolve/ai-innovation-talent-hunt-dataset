1,8,Bizarre yet breathtaking documentary about an acrobatic stunt couple,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.Rooftoppers are a strange trend and the movie does a great job on exploring a well-known rooftopper couple Angela Nikolau and Ivan Beerkus with gorgeous camerawork, breath-taking stunt angles, and tense style that is mixed with thriller and documentary elements together. The relationship between Nikolaj and Beerkus was interesting as the documentary does a good job on their relationship, their purposes and what makes them special for the stunts they do. Including some interesting insights on their lives outside of the stunt works they do.Throughout, the visuals are amazing as there are some amazing looking camerawork where moments are high in the sky and dangerous and tenseful moments are in play. If this was in IMAX, this movie would be breath-taking but also very tense and nerve-wrecking.I really did enjoy the documentary. I did found some of the editing choices to be a little poor as if it was something from an annoying youtube video. But overall, I never felt bored and I was captivated throughout.Side note, if you suffer from fear of heights or vertigo, don't see this cause there are tons of moments of high heights.",False
2,6,once upon a time...,mak_600,n/a,16/08/2025,"...kids went to college, got an apprenticeship, learned a trade, became sportspeople if they had the talent or just simply got a job. Nowadays that ain't good enough and to get ahead you gotta go all social media and provide content that is gonna entertain, shock and/or mortify to get a rabid audience in sufficient numbers that you can make a living the 2024 way. This is stunning, impressive, compulsive and horrifying all in one package - yes they've got skill, sure they've got balls but yes they're also breaking the law and one slip and they're dead - but hey, that's just more content eh and sure Netflix will happily make a documentary out of that too, because why not? We're heading towards a dark and dystopian future for generations to come if this is the way entertainment is going - do we really need to give legitimacy to, not to mention glorification of, arguable lunacy..?",False
3,8,I Was Really Moved By Their Story,sandra-54396,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ok, I admit, my first thoughts were, ""I hope they fall."" Yeah, I know, what kind of person does that make me? I just thought that this type of stunt was stupid and dangerous and they deserve what they get. I WAS SO WRONG!The views were breathtaking and at times I was paralyzed by the fear of heights. Who knows why people do what they do. But the couples stories, and the 2 coming together to create the works of art, I was so drawn in and I only wanted to see them succeed.A real love story about TRUST!! Absolute trust and confidence. Ignore the nay-sayers. The ending had me cheering for themðŸ‘Œ",False
4,n/a,crazy and illegal,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Angela Nikolau and Ivan Beerkus were banned in Europe for illegally climbing buildings and now have their sights on NYC. The most experience mountain climbers have to get permits to climb Everest and others to get to their summits. A lot of them lose their lives doing it. This couple needs to be stopped doing this because what they are doing is trespassing and is illegal. As a documentary it was interesting to watch and to see how the two met. Climbing buildings started as a hobby and ended up being a job for them. They were doing stunts for social media likes. This documentary isn't for everybody.,False
5,6,VIEWS ON FILM review of Skywalkers: A Love Story,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSkywalkers: A Love Story is one of those movies where you say to yourself, ""how the heck did they film that?"" I mean was the director even there? Or was it found footage? Or did the subjects involved just have cameras attached to their noggins? Seriously this is pretty jaw-dropping stuff, something about a couple of lovebirds (Angela Nikolau, Ivan Beerkus) who form a romantic relationship scaling the roofs of the highest skyscrapers in the world. ""Now we were more than just daredevils"". Ah, you don't say.So yeah, why am I about to not fully recommend ""Skywalkers"" even after that animated first paragraph? Well for one, what Angela and Ivan did was illegal and no matter how talented they may be at rooftopping, they were putting their lives at risk and well, breaking the law. And again speaking of Angela and Ivan, well they aren't the most likable participants in a documentary. Entitled, preoccupied with themselves, nearly defiant, yada yada yada. Those are the words I would use to describe these borderline, whiny millennials. I mean you want them to ditch the attitude, get a real job, and not tick off the boys in blue (another word for the rooftop po-po).So what's left for Skywalkers: A Love Story? Well it has beautiful cinematography, shiny production values, a Richard Linklater approach to its shooting schedule (that means it was filmed over a period of more than five years), and good old Netflix on its side (that was a joke people). Basically you have a well-made docu that like the more superior Fall (from 2022), presents itself as a cinematic car accident. I mean even if you are afraid of heights (and I am), you just can't look away from the sheer drops you are witnessing. It's just too bad you hesitate in rooting for the people doing the swarming up. ""Love"" in a mist.",True
6,9,Terrifying but couldn't look away,Nikkiangel002,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI feel physically sick at heights, that movie THE FALL, I put myself through. I have to say I'm a huge horror fan.... but these types of movies with heights really make me recoil and fully feel fear.Now this is horror to me but real life. But I just felt absolutely wrapped up in the story of these 2 and found myself willing them to actually manage their mammoth final act.It's a documentary but I felt myself getting fully drawn into the ""story"". What a couple.... all these reviews ""criminals"" blah blah.Imagine having the will and determination of being so confident and successful at such a niche thing?I was emotional at the end, their emotions were real and you felt that. Very well done docfilm. I recommend fully.",True
7,6,"Hated her, but show is good",Bmore-Hero,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler*""Skywalkers: A Love Story""* is an ambitious blend of romance and science fiction that shows flashes of brilliance but ultimately struggles to find its footing. The film attempts to weave a tale of love across time and space, yet it never fully reaches the heights it aspires to, leaving the audience with a mixed experience.The story follows two star-crossed lovers from different galaxies who find themselves inexplicably connected through a mysterious cosmic phenomenon. The film's concept is intriguing, and the visual effects are impressive, with stunning space vistas and imaginative set designs that make the universe feel vast and alive. The cinematography is a highlight, capturing the grandeur of space while also honing in on the intimate moments between the characters.The performances by the lead actors are solid, with both delivering heartfelt portrayals of lovers caught in a cosmic dilemma. Their chemistry helps anchor the film, even when the plot becomes convoluted. The romantic elements are touching, and there are moments of genuine emotional depth that resonate.However, the film's pacing is uneven, and the story often gets bogged down in its own complexity. The script tries to juggle too many sci-fi concepts, and as a result, the narrative can feel scattered and difficult to follow. This lack of focus detracts from the emotional impact of the love story at the heart of the film.Moreover, while the movie has its share of breathtaking visuals, it sometimes leans too heavily on spectacle, at the expense of character development and plot coherence. Certain subplots and supporting characters feel underdeveloped, leaving some narrative threads unresolved or unsatisfying.In summary, *""Skywalkers: A Love Story""* is a visually stunning film with a unique premise, but its execution falls short of its potential. It's an enjoyable watch for fans of sci-fi romance, but the uneven pacing and overcomplicated plot prevent it from being truly memorable. **6 out of 10 stars**.",True
8,10,Breathtaking. Best doc I've seen in awhile.,nicolasgorena-74366,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely blown away by this one. The couple was so good on camera, that at times it seemed like a scripted foreign film. Their passion for climbing these ultimate skyscrapers and pushing the boundaries was so inspiring.Obviously we shouldn't be promoting trespassing in any form, but these two made it an actual art. Their grace and dedication to this crazy ""hobby"" was so fun to watch.Finally, the fact that it was paralleled with a brewing love story also contributed to its success. In a sport where ""flying solo"" was the norm, this couple made climbing so romantic. The drone and GoPro shots were magnificent and I'm so glad I gave it a shot. I think everyone should. It's really worth the watch.",False
9,7,7.2/10. Recommended.,athanasiosze,n/a,16/08/2025,"At times, it seems staged and scripted. I didn't understand the reasons of their dispute, why they argued ? Did she want to give up on their career? If so, how is he protective, from the monent he pushed her to continue to engage in those dangerous activities?A lot of things look fake here, but the one that surely doesn't look fake, is their stunts. I was so nervous and anxious watching them do the things they did. Too much intensity here and i cannon not appreciate their courage. So, i recommend this documentary because the viewer gets what he/she came for : A lot of adrenaline pumping and nail biting moments.Although, i really wish for the couple to stop doing all those things. I am afraid that, giving high ratings to this is like encouraging them to continue risking their lives. So, i feel guilty for my rating but on the other hand, this is so impressive that it would be dishonest to not appreciate their effort. So, yes, this is mindblowing. But please, stop doing it.",False
10,10,I never write reviews but I was compelled to,pyzxwbzch,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is absolutely compelling, the bravery, intelligence and compassion these two people have for their craft is unbelievable! I have never written a review before on here but use this app constantly, this is a class a documentary! This has the same vibe as the deepest breath but with triumph not tragedy, this is up there with one do the best documentaries I've ever seen in the extreme sports real , usually I am more drawn to the psychological thriller documentaries but this is out of this world, can't say enough goood things about this, the chemistry that these guys have is unreal.",False
11,7,Construction scaffolding,lasliem,n/a,16/08/2025,"They forgot to take down the scaffolding from the top of Merdeka 118. If it was taken, it must be taken off.It is clearly visible when looking at a satellite image.It's true that the picture isn't completely sharp.The sun's shine reflects off the scaffolding.We need to make another movie about removing the element.The film depicts the madness of adolescence well.I had the following feeling during the movie.I go up high to suffer.Like a masochist.In severe frost without gloves on the tower crane.It was also mentioned in the film that there are hardly any couples left.I think this climbing genre is extinct today.",False
12,10,Heights of Love,ovnaidenko,n/a,16/08/2025,"The final scenes of this movie brought tears to the eyes of at least one 32-year-old man.Firstly, I want to highlight how remarkable Angela's personality is. I had the brief privilege of knowing her in real life, and I am truly amazed by how such a seemingly delicate girl can encompass so many emotions, bravery, and inner strength. While I do not know Ivan personally, I am confident he is equally outstanding.Secondly, I am delighted with how well Netflix portrayed the characters and emotions of these two individuals. This film isn't just about roofers; it's a phenomenal love story between two people.",False
13,4,So so,yelenamna,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThough what they do is incredible, the storyline felt super scripted for dramatic content, which took away from the documentary. Plus her pretty much saying that her parents are losers because they didn't become famous was super cheap, disrespectful and shallow. You don't have to be remembered by masses for your life to have meaning. Girl needs a lesson in humility.Not sure I'm buying the story of them sitting in a ""cage"" for 30 hrs without water and a toilet. And where did he fill his water bottle on top of a skyscraper. Interestingly that part wasn't filmed. Also, not sure I'm buying the arm break with metal rods put into it, yet no scars after. All in all a scripted soap opera for kids who are obsessed with popularity and likes. I wish them long and happy life.",True
14,10,Absolutely phenomenal.,magicaltravellingblog,n/a,16/08/2025,"I followed their journey for a while now on Instagram now and all I can say it's a ""take a deep breath"" and prepare yourself for a breathtaking journey. We are witnessing the experiences of 2 amazing artists that commited their lives and their love for the ultimate Skywalk. It's raw and simply beautiful. The story about overcoming challenges, understanding the need of communication and trust.It's not a movie for the lightheaded peopleYou can only achieved the highest highs when you get out of your comfort zone.Everything is possible. Just find the balance.Thank you for sharing your story with us.",False
15,10,"""Skywalkers: Love at Dizzying Heights""",paliwaldwij,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Skywalkers: A Love Story"" is a breathtaking film that takes audiences to new heights, both emotionally and physically. Based on the real-life daredevils who climb skyscrapers, this movie offers a gripping blend of romance and high-stakes adventure. The cinematography is nothing short of spectacular, capturing dizzying heights and heart-pounding moments with stunning clarity. The true-life story of these courageous climbers is beautifully intertwined with a compelling love story, making every moment resonate deeply. The performances are authentic and moving, drawing viewers into the lives and passions of these extraordinary individuals.""Skywalkers: A Love Story"" is an exhilarating and emotional journey that you won't want to miss.Personally I loved it, and the movie had gripped me from beginning till the end!",False
16,10,Don't judge before you watch,runicdust,n/a,16/08/2025,"You might think the film encourages risky behavior and how dare Netflix promote this. But it's actually Instagram that does that promoting, while the film delivers quite the opposite message.In fact, I believe the more people watch it, the fewer will try to do this in real life.Instagram shows you breathtakingly beautiful photos of well dress model with thousands of likes and all the excitement.The movie reveals the reality behind those stunning shots. The couple went through a lot; they are athletic and skilled, yet they still faced fears, concerns, and panic on their way to the top. It's a hard journey, not meant for everyone. Many people have lost their lives, and only a few become known and successful.On a personal note, I admire how supportive friends and families can be. This aspect of the film felt very touching to me.",False
17,10,Equally Parts Amazing & Terrifying,jenniferlegg-60546,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. What cave have I been living in that I've never heard of ""roof topping""? I've never considered myself afraid of heights but I felt actual anxiety at times just watching this. My heart was racing. I'd never heard of Angela Nicolas or Ivan Beercus before so the entire story was new. I won't give spoilers, but I actually felt a sort of sense of relief when it ended, yet I loved every minute. Lol. The entire story - their personal journeys of self discovery, and how it led to their journey through the complexities of love, was beautiful. I'll definitely watch this again, and I highly recommend!",False
18,1,A cringe love story with 2 self-obsessed influencers trying to get more Instagram followers,allidoiswatchmovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Skywalkers: A Love Story"" is a cringe-worthy depiction of two self-obsessed influencers who risk their lives for the perfect shot atop skyscrapers. The film's attempt to blend romance with adrenaline falls flat, as the characters' shallow motivations and reckless behaviour make it difficult to empathize with them. While the cinematography captures great perspectives of urban landscapes, the plot is predictable and the dialogue often feels forced. Despite its flashy visuals, this film fails to deliver a meaningful message, instead highlighting the empty pursuit of online fame. Save your time and watch something else.",False
19,8,Impressive Documentary,gfink02,n/a,16/08/2025,"If watching people break the law (trespassing) gives you more anxiety than the death defying stunts portrayed in the trailer, this film probably isn't for you. That said, this documentary does not glorify the act of trespassing, or even the art of skywalking. The consequences of anything going wrong, or getting caught, are very real.Skywalkers is a fascinating inside look at who these people are and why they do what they do. It also shows that though they are capable of doing something most people would consider absolutely insane, they are very human, with human fears and human problems.The cinematography is breathtaking and the production value is very good. My favorite part of the film was learning about the impressive preparations, reconnaissance and planning that goes into making a high-risk climb. These are not just thrill-seekers, and they take what they're doing very seriously. It was almost like watching a heist thriller in real life. I give it a solid 8.",False
20,10,Over the top,cdmdfm,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDocumentaries not really my thing. Yet as I started watching I found myself hooked. The fact it was all shot by the pair using drones, gopros and phones brilliant. A love story that was more REAL than any I've seen. The raw nerve and dedication it took to do these insane shots on top of impossible places. If you don't find yourself amazed , I would be surprised.Spoiler: Happy Ending is coming but the possibility of a dark ending was present and extremely possible. The story builds and builds. Yes I fast forwarded to make sure I wasn't going to be mad. Then I went back to the middle of the and just enjoyed the ride. You might think it is a bit predictable but this isn't just a story. It is real life. I went back and checked the facts after I finished the movie and was satisfied to the honesty of the documentary.CDM.",True
21,9,Wonderful documentary,jase-74414,n/a,16/08/2025,"A compelling story of two young people who find each other in a unusual setting of tall buildings. They climb the heights of some of the tallest buildings in the world.The cinematography is outstanding, beautifully capturing their journey.I'm haven't got a heads for heights, but didn't stop me watching enthralled as they scale the buildings. Showing the planning, the artistry and the physicality, but also the mental strength and trust they have in each other.Not often does a love story come with such views and challenging circumstances.The drone footage and still photos are sensational.Both are very likable people, and the story tells how the got into climbing and why it was their escape from the harsh reality of life to their successes on the international stage.",False
22,10,Amazing,oliverharris-42918,n/a,16/08/2025,"At first I was considering watching this because I thought it can't be that entertaining people climb up buildings but wow I was so wrong, incredible documentary very well presented and both climbers seem like great people. 100% worth a watch & also great love story. It had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through! Personally I can't really deal with heights so to see another human go to the extreme level that these two super humans do is actually incredible and it really does make me think anything in this world is possible, it actually gives me motivation and makes me feel like I can do anything I can.",False
23,8,Mesmerising,alfonso-desas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having fear of heights, watching this film was probably not a good idea. The first scenes were terrifying and I felt vertigo at every stunt this guy Vanya performed. But when Angela's story begins, the whole thing becomes more emotional and heart starts permeating the physical and mental prowess. It's a true love story in different aspects, and it never goes into contrived, convoluted plot twists. It's kept simple, human and real. Neither of them is a superhero, just two down to earth (no pun intended) young persons with a supernatural talent and a great capacity for love. How he cares about her is touching, how she gets to understand the nature of his caring is even more touching. The climax is breathtaking, with due suspense and a real risk of everything coming down crashing, but the success is subdued, intimate, beautiful. I really loved this gem, unpretentious and very well crafted.",False
24,9,Drawdropping!,lardycat,n/a,16/08/2025,"We selected this documentary not really knowing what to expect! But were compelled to watch from beginning to end, staying up to finish it, despite an early start for work the next day.The connection between Angela and Vanya is as compelling as the shots they pull off on their journey to achieve greater things. ""Living the dream"" is an understatement; they eat, sleep, travel, argue, make up, cajole, plan and pursue their dream, turning an adrenaline fuelled pursuit into an incredible art form. The drone footage alone takes your breath away! An amazing couple pushing the envelope. I'm now following on Insta!",False
25,10,Unbelievable....must watch..!!,nickpenwarden,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an awe inspiring and truly edge of your seat film...raw emotion, mixed with unbelievable tension. Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole film...if you suffer from fear of heights then I would watch this hidden behind a cushion as some of the scenes are unbelievable...the photography is amazing and some of the drone footage is incredible and really shows the magnitude and bravery (if you can call it that) of the climbing that these two embark on...I liked the the way the film showed the ups and downs of their relationship and really showed the trust and love that grew over time. Would highly recommend this film...providing you don't suffer from vertigo...",False

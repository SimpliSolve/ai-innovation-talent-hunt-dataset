1,7,Two families torn apart by the Australian government,andrewbunney,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the true story of two families of lovely, innocent people whose lives have been ruined by government policies of taking aboriginal children from their mothers. At the centre is Brenda, charged at the age of 2 years with being a neglected child, grabbed by authorities without warning, separated from her brothers and sisters and placed in foster care with a well-meaning white family. Then, after several years of inclusion with her new parents and siblings, she was abruptly separated from them without further contact and returned to her original family.Grief, loss and separation permeate the lives of all involved, leaving it to the adult Brenda to reconcile the damaged lives of both families and herself. Brenda's first memories were of growing up in a loving white family. Decades later she feels disconnected from both halves of her life. Naturally, this is a story saturated with emotions and hurt. Hearts all round have been broken and two families torn apart.Brenda's efforts to repair the harm to all her loved ones unearth records that show the failings and lies of the welfare department through her sorry young life.The Last Daughter is a documentary about Brenda's journey to find the truth of a part of our history that has been swept under the carpet. So much has been irretrievably lost by so many, all victims of the Australian government's genocidal policies to eradicate the First Nations. The further worry is that while this story starts in the 1970s, it is not even consigned to the past, with the taking of aboriginal children continuing today.",False

3,8,Where's the apology to her and her family?,NestorTheGreat,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA look at the Stolen Generation from a different lens. A young girl taken from her black family and taken into a loving, white family.Five years later, she is removed from her white family and reunited with her real siblings and parents.How did the government come to the decision to remove her when the policy of forced removals ended in 1969? She was removed in 73 and returned 78-79. She had to grow up thinking her white sibling was a dream.Because the redress scheme only reaches actions committed in 1969, she does not qualify. But the paperwork that's turned up explaining their removal explains naught. A loving mother, a pastor father, and six brothers and sisters living in a safe home.Where's the apology to her and her family?",True

6,10,The Last Daughter,pjksx,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the most incredible movie or documentary about two families who loved one daughter. Brenda and her brothers and sisters were taken from their parents when she was only 2 years old and the family she went to were told that she was neglected and they could eventually adopt her . She fitted into her white family so well and she was loved by everyone, her white mum & dad , her brothers , sister , grandmothers , cousins, aunties and uncles, everyone just loved her , but it was all lies . She wasn't neglected at all she was taken from a loving home and her parents were fighting to get all of their children back which eventually happened and Brenda was the last daughter to return. Although this was a happy ending for her black family, her white family were torn apart. They were lied to and after loving Brenda for over 5 years she was then taken from them . Thankfully Brenda never forgot her white family and many many years later they are reunited and not just Brenda but her black family and her white family reunite together It is heartbreaking and heart warming. A MUST SEE !!!!",False

8,10,One word - brilliant!,tabascokiwi,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a secondary school teacher I am glad to finally have a movie that is suitable for my classes. It is the well-paced and sensitively-handled story of Brenda and her search into the pasft or the truth tof her identity and what happened when she was young. It began with snippets of memories of a white sister and the bond they shared, that spurred her on.I have so much respect for the dignity her birth parents demonstrated and the love shown her by her adoptive parents. The lasting impact of the Stolen Generation on families is so underestimated. I highly recommend this movie. It is one that can be shown in classrooms and is engaging from start to finish.",False

10,10,Love and Lies,dcnhp,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a story / film that all Australians should see . Even if we think we know it , the pain caused to families Black and White needs to be heard again and again . But especially the unnecessary suffering inflicted on Aboriginal people . Black and White people lied to by government. I can imagine no greater pain than having my children taken away ... the lies are unforgivable .... Brenda has taken trauma and turned it into healing ... this film is a credit to her resilience. No wonder Aboriginal and people in general do not trust the government. The two families are the true heroes and of course Brenda.",False
11,10,Heart wrenching,mettekphotos,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a New Zealander that lives in New Zealand. I didn't really know much about The Stolen Generation and made a decision when Rabbbit Proof Fence came out that I would not watch it because I would not be able to handle watching such atrocities. I managed to get through The Last Daughter and I am so glad I did. Sadness and loss on both sides. I am so glad Brenda was able to make this journey and was strong enough to see it through, to answer so many questions. So much ignorance led to so much hurt for so many years. Thankyou for opening ours eyes. I feel that when we visit Australia next I will have a far greater understanding of the country we are visiting.",False
12,10,Incredible,amyilhan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just woah! The Last Daughter is an extraordinary documentary that reached every part of my soul. It delves into the heart-wrenching story of Brenda, an indigenous woman who was part of the Stolen Generation post ""Aborigines Protection Act 1909"" an era in Australian history marked by the forced removal of indigenous children from their families. Directed with sensitivity and depth, this powerful film sheds light on Brenda's personal journey, intertwining it with the broader narrative of the Stolen Generation by showing that not all is what it was seen after the act was meant to be abolished in 1969 but therefore only changed and led to the continuous removal of children from their homes in the 1970s.

13,10,Fantastic!,jenbrig227,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found The Last Daughter to be incredibly insightful, moving and educational. I learnt so much about our First Nations People that I wish I'd been taught in school. I cried, got angry at the injustice and cried some more. Make sure you have tissues handy when watching! My only wish is that stories like Aunty Brenda's - the truth - be taught in schools worldwide. I hope this story gains international acclaim so that the truth can finally be heard. Aunty Brenda you are definitely a master story teller. You are an amazingly strong, brave woman and I thank you for sharing your story with the world.",False
14,10,"After tears, peace can be found",holly_cm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow, such an amazingly well told story. The one line that truly hit me was ""The Act may have been abolished, but the action still goes on"" or something like that.I remember as a small child in the 1970's, my parents fostered a brand new baby who was black. I never knew the full details about why he lived with us, but Brenda's story resonated as I know my parents were about to formally adopt ""Baby John"", when all of a sudden I was told that he had gone back to live with his real parents. I still wonder about him and hope he lived a life of love like Brenda.This little film should be compulsory watching for all australians and anyone else interested in stories that can get deep into your heart and teach you so much about life.",False
15,10,"A story of loss, heartache and extraordinary courage",deb-87433,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film is more than a documentary as it tells such a personal story in such an intimate way. It draws you into Brenda's life, one of tragedy and sadness but also of great courage and forgiveness. Brenda is taken from her parents by Government welfare when she is two along with her six siblings who were all sent to various different foster homes. The lie her foster family was told was that Brenda's father was an alcoholic and she was a neglected child. She was loved and cared for by her foster family for nearly 6 years until she was returned to her Aboriginal family. This only happened because her parents fought to have all their children returned by 'proving' they were fit parents. Brenda grew up knowing there was something missing, in particular the bond she had felt with her white sister. Brenda had the courage and support from her husband to try to find her foster family as an adult and to ask her Mum to meet them as her Dad was too ill by then. The scene when they meet is very moving and shows the generosity and genuine love they all have for each other. Ultimately the film is uplifting but it tells a dark story of our recent history as this only happened in the 1970's. I believe that Aboriginal children are still being taken from their parents to this day. Everyone who sees this film will have a new understanding of the stolen generation and the trauma is causes for generations. Thank you for having the courage to share your story Brenda, your bravery is inspiring.",True
16,10,Heartbreak and healing.,krisgreg-71532,n/a,15/08/2025,"Packed with a roller coaster of feelings and emotions this story needs to be shared with everyone at every opportunity.

17,10,How to lead a nation,liberty-78705,n/a,15/08/2025,"In The Last Daughter Brenda and her family model for us what we can achieve if we pursue love with grace. Days after watching the film I find myself thinking about the power of love, and the gentle, strong, clear example of leadership Brenda embodies as she leads us through her journey of injustice at the hands of the Australian Government, balanced with the values her parents have taught her. Not only am I transformed by her grace and strength, I've learnt about the layers of abuse inflicted on Aboriginal families in the 1960's and 70's which has contributed to my understanding of the complexity of what it will take to continue to fully heal our nation. Thank you to Brenda, her family, and to the film makers who have shared this story with skill and purpose.",False

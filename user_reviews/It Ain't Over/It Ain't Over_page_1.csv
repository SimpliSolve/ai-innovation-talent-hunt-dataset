1,8,This nickel is worth a dime,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. In a perfect world we would judge each other by character, personality, integrity, and accomplishments. Unfortunately, too many still judge the book by its cover, and therein lies the only explanation for why Yogi Berra was not on the field at the 2015 All-Star game with Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, and Johnny Bench as one of the greatest living players. Berra, though he never cut the imposing athletic figure as those players, certainly fulfilled the four attributes listed above ... including his accomplishments in the very game that was offering tribute to the greats of the game. Director Sean Mullin expertly proceeds to prove that Lorenzo Pietro ""Yogi"" Berra was not just one of the best baseball players of all-time, he was also a war hero, beloved father, grandfather, husband, public figure, and above all, a world-class person.What Mr. Mullin does to elevate this documentary is not just focus on Yogi's fabulous career as a player, but also on the rest of his life. This allows us to understand what a special man he was. Yogi's granddaughter Lindsay frequently pops up for commentary, and she makes it abundantly clear that while Yogi learned to accept being baseball's most overlooked superstar, she certainly has not. After all, Berra is the all-time leader in World Series championships as a player with 10, and has 13 rings total, including his time coaching. He was an 18 time All-Star and was voted onto the All-Century team. Remarkably, Yogi caught both ends of 117 doubleheaders in his career, and of course, caught Don Larsen's World Series Perfect Game. As a New York Yankees player and coach, his presence in pinstripes linked the careers of Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, and Don Mattingly.Those are some of the pieces of a life that are indelibly linked to baseball history, and in this documentary, we learn even more. He grew up on the same St Louis street as (another future major league catcher) Joe Garagiola, and the Branch Rickey story involving the two is fascinating. After signing with the Yankees for $500, Berra enlisted in the Navy, and found himself in the middle of the Normandy landings. Lindsay recounts the story of why Berra never received his Purple Heart, and the process she went through to ensure that he received a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom. He was married to Carmen for 65 years, and they raised three sons, Dale (a Major Leaguer), Tim, and Larry. The story of how Carmen named Dale is one of the highlights of the film.Lest you buy into the image of Yogi as the cartoon character (Yogi Bear) in Yellowstone, or the lovable post-career pitchman for Amtrak, Aflac, YooHoo, and Miller Lite, pay particular attention to the segment on Jackie Robinson's steal of home in the World Series. This will clue you in on what an intense competitor Yogi was - helping to explain his incredible track record of winning. Of course, none of this is meant to minimize Yogi's creative use of the English language. He became iconic for his malapropisms ... often referred to as ""Yogiisms"". This includes the famous one from which this film's title was derived, ""It ain't over till it's over"" ... right up there with ""I really didn't say everything I said.""Berra's rift with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is analyzed, leaving us respecting Yogi's years-long stance over being disrespected. Their eventual make-up led to an incredible ""Yogi Berra Day"" at Yankee Stadium, where the game remarkably lived up to the pre-game moment when Don Larsen threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Yogi. Director Mullin capitalizes on a long stream of former teammates, opponents, players, writers, and family members to provide insight into Yogi Berra. There is little doubt even more would have loved to contribute, as much in the way Yogi gives credit to Hall of Famer Bill Dickey for tutoring him on catching, so many are anxious to offer stories on how Yogi Berra influenced them. Let's end this with more of Yogi's wisdom. ""If you come to a fork in the road, take it."" And when it comes to this excellent and entertaining documentary from Sean Mullin, keep in mind that ""You can observe a lot by watching.""

2,8,"""I really didn't say everything I said.""",classicsoncall,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI couldn't write a better recap of this documentary than IMDb reviewer 'ferguson-6', so I won't even try. He hits all the highlights of this film in such a way that it allows me to rest easy while you take a look at his comments. For my part, I thought this was a pretty comprehensive doc on the life and career of one Lawrence Peter Berra, affectionately nicknamed 'Yogi' after a New York Yankees teammate once remarked on how he sat in front of the dugout with his arms and legs crossed in a sitting position - ""You look like a yogi"". The film does its best to justify Berra as one of the best baseball players of all time, lovingly led by granddaughter Lindsay in a tribute to his career accomplishments that surpass almost all former and living players. His ten World Series rings alone (as a player) is a career milestone that won't be matched, but then you have to add three more as a coach and manager. The highlights of this documentary include Yogi's friendship and rivalry with Jackie Robinson, especially that steal of home plate in a World Series game where the controversy of the umpire's call still lives on. There's also that feud with George Steinbrenner that lasted for years, and of course, the perfect game pitched by Don Larsen in the 1956 World Series. And lest I forget, the 'Yogiisms' come fast and furious in the story, many of which you've probably heard and perhaps some you haven't. You don't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate this story, with family and friends alike lending their thoughts and warm-hearted comments about one of the greatest and underrated baseball players of all time.",True
3,8,"A Captivating Inspirational Documentary That Highlights An Important Story, And Really Connected With Me.",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"It Ain't Over is a captivating inspirational documentary that highlights an important story, and really connected with me. I definitely felt moved and more knowledgeable afterwards.This film tells the story of Yogi Berra (Lawrence Peter Berra), an Italian immigrant who had a talent for baseball from a young age. Although he had an outstanding ability to catch balls, he was extremely unappreciated in the sports industry when he first started out. Yogi didn't exactly fit the image of a stereotypical NBA star at the time, but he didn't let that stop him. After many rocky patches, Yogi eventually found a home with the New York Yankees, where he managed to work his way to a top position, and became one of the best players in baseball history.I really appreciate the structure of the film; it's easy to follow and gives a lot of insight about Yogi as a person. Throughout the film are interviews with people from Yogi's life, including his close family and friends. These are people that knew him personally and their input helps create a strong foundation for the film. It helped me get a better understanding of who Yogi was, and the positive effect that he left on people. Additionally, the storytelling is strong. The film incorporates so many important details of Yogi's life in such an honest way. There are examples of people such as Jackie Robinson, who he really helped and respected. This documentary is going to make the world remember Yogi Berra in a positive and bright way, which defines who he was. The cinematography is outstanding. I really enjoyed the incorporation of archival footage from Yogi's life, along with present day videos that showcase the evolution of professional baseball.The film's message is to always follow your dreams no matter what other people tell you.I give It Ain't Over 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. It releases in in select theaters on May 12, 2023. By Mikella G., KIDS FIRST!",False
4,10,I Now Understand Why,vjmmhfcr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary about the Great and Late Yogi Berra is something that spoke to me and help me understand why my grandfather loved him so much. Back in 2009 my grandfather, dad, brother and I went to New York for a week to watch the Yankees. Coming from Ohio it was a long drive. While we were there we went to both the baseball hall of fame and the Yogi Berra museum. We were leaving his museum while a limo was pulling up and there he was Yogi Berra my grandfather acted like a kid and cried. This documentary helped me understand why he loved the man so much, he was a man that was a normal person but showed how much he loved the game of baseball even through war.

Writer'/Director Sean Mullin, the Producers and the Cast and Crew of 'It Ain't Over'' hit it out of the Ballpark. This movie helped me to relive the great memories of my childhood. As a great Yankees Baseball Fan, I loved watching Yogi Berra place Baseball. Yogi was the greatest. As a boy I would pack a bag of sandwiches, a bag of potato chips and with only $2 go to Yankee Stadium to watch a Double Header. This movie let me relive this glorious days.

6,10,"""It Ain't Over"" Gives Yogi His Due",mebowers-88514,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yogi Berra, one of the world's best athletes but one of the least recognized, has his legacy spelled out most effectively in 98 minutes. The documentary highlights his exceptional character, baseball skill and wisdom in a fast-paced captivating way. All ages, sports fans and non-sports fans should see this movie which captures not just the essence of 20th century professional baseball, but the essence of a man who embodied all that was excellent and exciting about the game. You will learn about Yogi's unequaled stats, hear from other all-star players and sports analysts, his family and regular fans. It is riveting from start to finish.",False
7,10,Excellent documentary,chriscupo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had wanted to see this since I saw a trailer in the theatre. If you are a baseball fan this is a must. I grew up as a NY Mets fan but liked the Yankees too. I am not from the generation these older players are from, so I didn't see them play. I only knew Yogi Berra as a manager and knew his one son was a baseball player also. I didn't realize that Yogi was one of the greatest players ever. This documentary was lovingly produced by his granddaughter and we see interviews with other players of his generation, players that he managed and mentored and also his loving family. You could tell how much the family meant to each other and how much he adored his wife Carmen. Yogi's granddaughter reads love letters from Yogi to Carmen which was very moving. Other events touched upon was Yogi's feud with George Steinbrenner and his return to Yankee Stadium. I can't recommend this documentary enough especially if you love baseball. Yogi was a humble, kind man and I had so much respect for him and tears in my eyes at the end.",False
8,10,Funny and moving portrait of a true baseball legend,lauraegray,n/a,16/08/2025,"A portrait of a beautiful human being and baseball legend that will surprise you, even if you think you know all about Yogi. As the film shows, Yogi's baseball talent, intelligence, and accomplishments have long been overshadowed by his endearing and iconic personality and his infamous Yogi-isms. This film finally gives Yogi the tribute he deserves. Viewers may be surprised to learn or be reminded of Yogi's many legendary baseball achievements that have been ignored or forgotten over the years. The interviews with his teammates, latter-day baseball legends, as well as his friends and family, weave a beautiful story about this amazing and unassuming hero. It will remind you of everything that is wonderful and special about baseball, and about life. Go see this movie!!",False
9,10,The Player (And Man) Behind The Myth,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone knows Yogi Berra. Well, they know the myth or legend of Yogi Berra. The nonsensical (albeit hilarious) sayings--the distinct caricature--the commercial pitchman--the resemblance to an animated bear we all remember from childhood. But sometimes those larger-than-life capacities obscure the greatness of Berra the baseball player, man, and father. That is an oversight ""It Ain't Over"" strives to correct.Basically, this doc springs from the premise that Berra's granddaughter Lindsay wasn't exactly thrilled when Johnny Bench, Sandy Koufax, Hank Aaron, and Willie Mays were voted the ""Greatest Living Ballplayers"" in 2015--with Yogi sitting beside her watching it on TV. So, Lindsay began championing for this doc to be made--and it ultimately turns into one of the best sports figure docs I've ever seen!Though not at all affiliated with HBO, ""It Ain't Over"" has the feel of that prestige network's sports docs. The production value and graphics are extremely high and poignant/entertaining, while the amount of figures interviewed is truly staggering. From Berra's teammates to those he coached to family members and baseball luminaries such as Vin Scully, Billy Crystal, Joe Torre & Bob Costas, everyone gets a word in on Yogi's baseball legacy.Director Sean Mullin does a remarkable job here of sorting out ""fact from myth"", so to speak. The doc tells a compelling story of how Yogi was a tremendous player (his batting average & power combined with lack of strikeouts is astounding), won championships almost everywhere he landed as a player, coach, or manager, and served his country (notably in the D-Day invasion). Not only that, but Yogi was a family man who is spoken of lovingly by all who knew him. It is a bit of shame, then, to see his legacy somewhat adapted to fit the malapropisms and odd phrases that would come to be attached to him (some legitimate, some not).Overall, ""It Ain't Over"" is a remarkably achievement on making sure baseball fans remember Yogi's greatness besides the ""silly stuff"". This is a man who shook hands with Babe Ruth, played beside Joe DiMaggio & Mickey Mantle, coached Don Mattingly, and traded good-natured barbs with Derek Jeter. He was a good-natured winner both on and off the field--so affable that he didn't mind being a goofy pitchman for Yoo-Hoo or Aflac. I cannot recommend ""It Ain't Over"" highly enough to any sports/baseball fan who is even mildly intrigued. It had me belly laughing, weeping, and shaking my head in amazement in equal measure.",False
10,10,A true American hero and icon,actorcl@aol.com,n/a,16/08/2025,"We often don't realize until much later that we were blessed to be alive while a true legend walked among us.Yogi Berra fit that description, and then some!This amazing documentary film chronicles the many accomplishments on and off the field of the pre-1990s Yogi Berra that some have overlooked in favor of the bigger than life elder statesman and beloved cartoony image he became later in life.Director Sean Mullin did his homework and got lots of archival footage and interviews to build a solid case for Yogi's status as a true American hero and icon. Not a moment of footage seems out of place or strikes a false note.From D-Day in 1944 to Yogi Berra Day in 1999, it's all included, including some of the more controversial, heartfelt and personal moments in the life of Yogi and his family, friends and teammates.Baseball is the backdrop, but this film is really a call and challenge to all of us to live like Yogi did, up to the best of our abilities even in the face of doubters, to spread kindness and joy, and to leave the world a better place than we found it.It's a movie full of laughter, tears, inspiration and love. A true valentine to a class act.I highly recommend it!",False
11,5,Okay time killer,pmtelefon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yogi Berra is a legendary baseball nice guy. I have nothing against him. It is, however, hard to argue that a man who is in the Baseball Hall of Fame, has had his number retired, has his own museum, has had his face on a US postage stamp, received the Presidential Metal of Freedom, spent decades appearing in television commercials and will always have his yogi-isms quoted as being underappreciated. That is what ""It Ain't Over"" tries to argue. The movie starts off talking about how in 2015 25 million MLB fans voted for who they believed were the four greatest living players. Yogi didn't make the list. The movie argues that he should have been. Fine, I won't argue that. But if Yogi were to be one of the four then that means one of the other players, Hank Aaron, Johnny Bench, Sandy Cofax and Willie Mays, would fall off the list. Which one should Yogi have replaced? ""It Ain't Over"" doesn't address that question.",False
12,10,A life well lived,roydo43,n/a,16/08/2025,"How can you not rate this a 10? Yogi was not just an incredible athlete and outstanding competitor, but the biggest mark he left on life was the lives he touched. I am incredibly happy to find out that he was the man I hoped he was. I remember his managing and coaching days and of course his commercials and talk show appearances but many times those are just performances that hide the messy lives we all live. But Yogi was the real deal often imitated but never duplicated.Of course this Doc was biased toward Yogi and many of the flaws and warts were hidden or not really discussed but to be honest I don't need or want to know about that. He lived an extraordinary life which reached the pinnacle of this profession and a loving extended family that adored him. What more could on ask for?",False
13,10,A moving story of a life well lived,JaneDashow,n/a,16/08/2025,"""It Ain't Over"" is simply the best sports documentary I've ever seen because it is SO MUCH MORE! At it's core, this is a love story about a man who quietly stood on a mountain of accomplishments. Yogi Berra is shown in full (not just as the fun loving pitch man or the king of the sayings that make you stop, think and then realize they DO make sense). Baseball is there from the Yankees to the Mets and back again but you are quickly brought into his life from St Louis to WWII to his family and friends. If only the rest of us could have a fraction of the love of Yogi and Carmen. Bring tissues because you will need them...lots of them!",False

The film is both informative and entertaining, and it provides a fascinating glimpse into the life of one of the greatest baseball players of all time.One of the most striking things about It Ain't Over is how Berra's sense of humor never wavered, even in the face of adversity.

As someone born in the 80's I really only knew of Yogi as a great baseball player and an iconic Yankee, but this film highlights just how much more there was to Yogi Berra's exceptional career. His story is one that should be told more, and I'm grateful this film is now doing just that. Also, there is a moment near the end of the film which is probably one of the most epic moments in all of sports, and it's one I'd never even heard of!

I did get to see him manage the Mets and take them to the 1973 Series, and then the Yankees after that. But I would love to be able to judge for myself, who was the better catcher, Yogi or Johnny Bench. Bench was the best all around player I got to see in my lifetime, even though I did see a few games with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays. Bench controlled the game like no one I had ever seen.

It was very good and taught me a lot about Yogi Berra (including how he got his nickname - cool story). Like many of the people this documentary talks about it, I didn't realize how great a ball player Berra was. I knew he was a 10 time World Series champ but those Yankees teams were stacked back then so I guess I just figured he was along for the ride. Three MVPs in a decade (especially when you'd have to think that some writers outside the tri-state area have a subconscious anti-New York bias) was news to me (shame on me for not knowing) and his stats and reliability (again, especially for a catcher) were impressive.Yogi wasn't just the cute, cuddly wordsmith (the modern day Ben Franklin) or prolific pitchman (is there an ad campaign he ever turned down?).

1,8,Justice is a Matter of Perspective,Jared_Andrews,n/a,16/08/2025,"A police officer shot an unarmed Black man. One community is outraged. Another defends the officer. Sounds like a story we've all heard before. But this time, the officer is a baby-faced Asian man who had been with the force for less than a year, and there's compelling evidence suggesting it was tragic accident absent of any malice of any kind. A tragic accident with circumstances outside the control of the two men involved.
This story is told with impeccable balance and fairness - a remarkable achievement given the complicated subject matter. When race gets involved, can anyone stay unbiased? You be the judge.",False

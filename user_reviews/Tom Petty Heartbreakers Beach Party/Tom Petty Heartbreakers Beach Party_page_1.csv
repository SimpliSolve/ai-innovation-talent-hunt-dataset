1,7,More Like A Family,stevendbeard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw Tom Petty: Heartbreakers Beach Party, starring Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers and Cameron Crowe-Jerry Maguire, Almost Famous, Vanilla Sky.This is a documentary and the first movie directed by Cameron Crowe. It covers Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers around 1982 and 1983, with some lost footage added to it, mostly donated by Tom's daughter, Adria and she appears in the film, talking to Cameron. The original documentary only appeared once on MTV and has some MTV footage added to it, too. It contains songs from many different concerts and shows the group waiting to see how their newest album, Long After Dark is received by the public. All through the film, you see Tom's sense of humor on display and that the group is more like a family than just a rock band.It's rated NR but it contains footage of smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 24 minutes.I'm not a big fan-I like some of his songs-but if you are a fan, you should enjoy it more than I did. It would be a good one to stream.",True

Happy birthday, and we miss you, Tom.So what is the film like?It is everything a TP+tH obsessive like myself could have ever wanted. I was 7 years old when the footage was taken - it took me right back there. The music, the fun, Tom's humour and passion, the band's commitment to their craft. Keys to the city granted....xx.",False

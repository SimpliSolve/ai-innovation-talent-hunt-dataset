1,6,big little game,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a doc on NBA Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. It starts with his shocking death from a helicopter crash. It goes to the start of his career and then the big little game. I call it that because the number is big but the opponent is little. I've never considered the 81 point game as a big highlight in his career. It's more an oddity. He singlehandedly beat a bad Raptors team. I now appreciate it more. I didn't know that the Lakers were losing badly. It says something about the man. Obviously, he wasn't going to lose to a bad Raptors team in front of his home crowd. Smush probably delivers the only big moment in the whole thing and that's an interesting snippet. This is no Last Dance, but Kobe fans will probably love this.",False
2,4,Kobe is 10/10. This documentary is not.,mdstamper,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kobe Bean Bryant is a true legend and his 81-point game is one of the most magical nights of his entire career ... and our lifetime. The energy and excitement in the arena and videos for that game is electric, but somehow this documentary fails to tap into the build-up or flow of the game. The personal stories of players and the opposing team about how Bryant was a dedicated and competitive athlete are true. The low rating for the doc isn't to discount their stories or the impact of Kobe. The low rating is because the film repeats a similar mantra over and over about Kobe's greatest while not capturing the experince that was one magical 81-point Sunday game by a true Laker legend.",False

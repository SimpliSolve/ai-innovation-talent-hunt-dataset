3,10,Glory days,markadams-53085,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery insightful documentary about two of the most charismatic boxers of the 80's and 90's, it really captures just what a huge deal these two bouts were back in the day, Tyson was the most skiled heavyweight of all-time and this shows exactly how Don King ruined his career, Bruno was interesting inthis documentary also, he looked in pain during his panto era after being stopped by Tyson, I grew as a kid during that era when boxing was hugely popular, happy days, two great guys despite Mike being a troubled rapist.",True
4,5,Bruno v Tyson,Prismark10,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bruno v Tyson is a breezy documentary about the two pugilists who fought each other twice.At the climax of the documentary, both Bruno and Tyson meet up and talk a little about the fights they had and the progress of their turbulent lives.Frank Bruno was touted as the Great British Hope ever since he emerged in the early 1980s. He was muscular in an era where some heavyweights looked flabby. One of them was even called Tony Tubbs.Bruno had a big punch but always looked a bit stiff and there were questions about his stamina.It took Bruno 13 years to become the world heavyweight champion. In contrast Mike Tyson did it in about 2 years after turning professional. He was the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title when he beat Trevor Berbick in 1986.Tyson shook up the moribund heavyweight division that had not quite recovered from its golden 1970s era that saw the like of Ali, Frazier, Norton and Foreman.In the 1980s, there were different belts and champions of varying qualities. All seemed to be controlled by one promoter, Don King.Tyson became undisputed world heavyweight champion in 1988. The following year Tyson fought Bruno for the first time. Although Bruno hurt Tyson in the first round, by the fifth it was all over with Tyson retaining his titles.However by the late 1980s, Tyson had attracted controversy over his personal behaviour. In 1990 he lost his titles and in 1991 Tyson was arrested for rape and eventually imprisoned.Frank Bruno did become world heavyweight champion in 1995 when he beat Oliver McCall. However contractually he had to face Mike Tyson in his first defence. Tyson beat him again and Bruno retired because of his worsening eyesight.Post retirement Bruno's marriage collapsed and he suffered from mental health issues.There is little here that is insightful. It is basically a rundown of both men's careers and controversies. Even their chat at the end is brief.",False
5,10,It's a knockout,TheBigMahn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really good, factual documentary with lots of insightful stuff that is until the wokery rears it's ugly head. There's literally no need to bring Bruno's race into it but the loons at sky can't help themselves.",False
6,9,The story of a Boxer and a Slugger.,tcwaterford,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can recall this as though it was only yesterday. Frank Bruno was loved by fight fans and the general public alike.I am often asked why Frank Bruno was so liked, the answer is simply, that he was and is a gentleman.Bruno was the ultimate boxer, he loved the craft of boxing, he had style and absolute skill. Had he met only boxers in the ring, then no doubt he would have been world champion much sooner!.As a boy I boxed, but unlike Bruno, I had no style, no skill and found it hard to confine myself to the rule book.I got great pleasure in standing solid in the centre of the ring and fighting like mad. Thankfully, my Father saw my first few fights and took me out of boxing, he insisted I do Martial Arts to get some OR any discipline.I mention this only as an introduction to Mike Tyson. A slugger, with no form, no style and initially no skill.The first Bruno V Tyson meeting in the ring, saw Bruno out fight and out skill Tyson for the first few rounds. But in such a match up, the slugger will win 8 out of 10 times and this was indeed the case.In the early years of boxing there was almost constant disagreements about allowing skilled boxers to fight sluggers or unskilled fighters.Some argued that two types or class of boxing should be decided upon. One for skilled fighters only and another for raw fighters.Such indeed, was the mismatch of Bruno V Tyson. Skilled V Unskilled (or less skilled). When Tyson ended in prison for rape, the crown and title went back to the ring. Lesser boxers than both Bruno and Tyson, moved in to take the title.This motivated Bruno to take to the ring again, against the advice of Doctors. Bruno eventually got his second chance at the title and this time he realised his long held dream of becoming world champion.Sadly, like most boxers, Bruno couldn't be satisfied with the belt alone, something inside of him said that he was not a great World Champion, because the man who beat him was still on the scene.Tyson gets out of prison, he begins making shapes in the boxing world again.Bruno hears of Tysons release and comeback, then that nagging voice in the back of Bruno's mind becomes alive again, telling the Champion that Tyson is the fighter he never beat.This in turn results in the final Bruno V Tyson fight. Despite many friends and family telling Bruno to retire and forever be known as an unbeaten champion, Bruno refuses to do so.These two warriors are destined to meet one more time.Bruno is risking everything to satisfy a need to face his own self created doubts.Tyson, on the other hand has nothing to lose and everything to gain, either way it's a huge payday for Tyson at worst, or the chance to be world champion again at best.From round one, it was obvious that Tyson knew he had nothing to lose and everything to gain!.The fight opened with the most cruel onslaught of punches, one after the other Tyson launched blow after blow.Bruno was just along for the ride, though it must be said that he had no glass jaw for sure, he initially absorbed each blow easily, but a cut over his eye became a great concern for his corner.Finally, the animal was released!, Tyson became a human missile, launching one after the other. The end result saw a very talented Referee, who stepped in and on seeing that Bruno was unable to defend himself, the Ref cupped both arms around Bruno, in doing so giving Tyson the win by TKO.Sports reporters and ringside press always talk about the winner, Tyson was therefore talked of as an animal of a fighter. Since anything else won't sell papers, it's naturally all about blood and guts.I had little respect for Mike Tyson up to the second fight with Bruno. But at the end of the fight, it should be told that Tyson went to Bruno's corner and hugged Bruno, kissed him on the head and then thanked Bruno.To me this was the ultimate mark of respect between two warriors, one a great Boxer the other a great slugger (fighter). Tyson and Bruno never again met, that is until this documentary.In the final moments of this excellent documentary, two old warriors again meet. Each one eager to show respect to the other. Both men having suffered greatly as a consequence of mental health issues, brought on at least in part by their chosen profession, Boxing.Conclusion, A documentary which showed the human side of both warriors. But is more than a simple sports documentary, in that it shows both men as men first and as once warriors!.Genuinely a very enjoyable watch for boxing fans and Bruno & Tyson fans.",True

1,3,The flattest monotonous Documentary,merrieberrie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat were they trying to accomplish with this documentary? That she owned a beautiful house? Maybe should have done a house tour and called it a day. It felt like, she read off of her Wikipedia page to us. It felt meretricious and flat, like carbonated drinks that lost its carbonation. I do not mind the self glorification, she made it out of nowhere and treaded lonely laths all by herself, for which I applaud her. She truly is a lady superstar. I have nothing against the person she is, roles in real and real life she plays or her relationship choices. She is a human being with emotions. So that is not my complaint.My problem lies in the fact there were no layers to this effort. Why bother at all? Everything she said we already knew not a single thing in that came as a surprise. They talk about vulnerability but not a moment in that, did she come off that way because she was hesitant to let go of, any part of her reign on things, extremely guarded, about what she was willing to share. All of it looked forced and uncomfortable as a viewer. In short, should not have made this, if she was not ready to share or talk. If this was for the commercial aspect of it, then good for her, because it looked like she wanted to make the most returns with the least amount of trouble and risk. In which case, good for you but I watched it and this is my review.3 for effort, only because 1 ‚≠ê felt too cruel.",True
2,3,Nayanthara: Beyond the Fairy Tale my disappointing review,chaitankrish,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't understand why Netflix chose this average, documentary.There is nothing special about it. She owns a beautiful house, but she didn't even give a tour. Nothing was shown about her lavish lifestyle. Instead, the documentary only contains some old photos and movie scenes. I don't understand-if she is so private, why did she agree to give an interview in the first place?The documentary also includes a lot of actors like SRK, Suriya, Vijay Sethupathi, Jyothika, Rana, Atlee, Nagarjuna, Vishnuvardhan, Radhika, Nelson, and others. While they all praise her, it feels scripted and unnatural.The documentary could have worked if it had shown old clips, delved into her past relationships, struggles in the industry, conflicts with directors and producers, meetings with fans, etc.In my opinion, Nayanthara: Beyond the Fairy Tale is pretty much like a Behindwoods or a local YouTuber interview.",True
3,5,Beautiful yet biased!,bargaviganesan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this documentary! No drama, no masala, just beautiful emotions! Vicky is awesome and I am so happy for Nayan! She has come back strong and she deserves every bit of happiness like anyone else!The wedding as such is short, which is actually better!I am surprised to see Nagarjuna speak about her and no one but VS joined the tamil hero crew!Radhika Tamanna Tapsee Parvathy joining her to wish her is cute!I see a beautiful friendship with Atlee, Vishnu, Anu and Nelson as well!Surprised to learn that Nayan has no inner circle of friends!Beautiful feel good hallmark type fairytale if u r a fan of that genre!",False
4,1,trash cash grab,kmshyamsundar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its just some untrue story of how she came up, reality is far different. The makers have made a fool of the audience and we see a 20 minute wedding album video in the end with some celebs. This is a new low even for her standards. Save your time, there are many more worth while documentaries of real people who endure realities in life, some fake nonsense like this doesnt require attention. Why were the gritty details of her life ignored, how did she actally come up in the industry? Were these all explored? Nope. Such a travesty of film making doesnt deserve a place to exist in this world, the audiences are not fools.",False
5,2,Just a suger coated story.. Total disappointment,padmavathyselvan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Starting was very silly and childish using videos using de-aging apps. Why are the using reels worth clippings in documentary? Also dubbing was too much irritating and dramatic. They could have used their real voices atleast in one language.Their love and family portions were good. Main thing is they didn't show us her vulnerabilities. It could have covered atleast some of her challenges since they are saying they have many. Also many knows that she really had a bad time during her past relationships, especially her second one. She made many mistakes. But they only shown her positive sides. It is a pure advertisement of nayanthara. It could have more. It is not worth a documentary. Not up to the expectation.",False
6,1,It should have been named How I Blow My Own Trumpet instead,iamthess,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a documentary. When you claim its a documentary the expectations is the unfiltered. But unfortunately in this snooze fest, what we get in return is only the truth of how she got into journey of cinema (which again quite funny that her parents don't bring for movies yet so supportive of the idea). Not degrading her efforts but the start of her acting career is nothing that luck and gold mine. You think how many actress out there has the luck to begin career directly as an actress and that too with Malayalam super stars?Another annoying part is how easily she toss aside the truth behind break ups and again projected herself as a victim when Simbhu did also take the burn same goes to Prabhu Deva and just because they kept silo on what happened exactly doesn't make you the victim.Overall blunder of lies and just two cringe fest trying to promote their love life and make business. Waste of time!",True
7,1,". A disappointing, flat attempt to establish a legacy where there is none.",zamantony,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary appears to be a one-dimensional attempt at glorifying an average actress while ignoring the complexities that define her public persona and professional legacy. While artists often lean into self-obsession as a means of creativity and greatness, here it becomes a glaring flaw, reflecting insecurity rather than brilliance. This actress, despite trying hard to etch her place in the annals of cinema history, fails to rise above the mediocrity that the documentary inadvertently exposes.The production feels sanitized, reminiscent of a glossy commercial rather than an introspective or balanced exploration of an artist's life. It cherry-picks moments to establish a curated narrative, glossing over the controversies and complexities that make for a compelling story. By refusing to confront the tumultuous relationships, accusations of sabotaging co-stars, or the history of friction with producers, the documentary reduces itself to a public relations exercise rather than a meaningful examination of an artist's impact.Moreover, the portrayal lacks authenticity and depth, serving instead as an echo chamber of the actress's ego. This heavy-handed attempt at rewriting her narrative not only insults the intelligence of discerning viewers but also pales in comparison to the legacies of truly great Indian actresses. These women have faced challenges head-on and left behind works of timeless significance, standing as benchmarks of talent and resilience.The schadenfreude associated with this actress-allegations of harming co-stars, causing disruptions, and exploiting industry dynamics-is not just a personal failing but a reflection of a toxic approach to stardom. The documentary's refusal to acknowledge or confront these truths diminishes its credibility.In the end, it's a hollow celebration of an unremarkable career, one that fails to inspire admiration or even sympathy. What could have been an opportunity to reflect on the nuances of fame, ambition, and human frailty instead collapses under the weight of its own pretense. A disappointing, flat attempt to establish a legacy where there is none.",False
8,1,Boring,brenuka-59289,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although they attempted to generate buzz through controversy, in today's fast-paced world, many people lack the time or interest to indulge in stardom that revolves solely around one individual.I am just happy with people like Ranbir and Alia who exchanged vows simply at home. Their love story is even more beautiful even though I don't get to see on Netflix üòÅLooks like she was busy making a movie about her wedding instead of living truly to the moment. She chose to make money over everything, and on the contrary not accepting it when others do the same.Not sure how she got the title lady superstar, but far away from any sorts of inspiration for women. Fell in love with a man of other woman, then married someone who looked similar like him. The end.",False
9,6,A middling-but-enjoyable wedding piece that focused more on the journey than the destination! [+61%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"A relationship that thrives on humour and respect is always enjoyable to see, and the fact that the piece isn't one to just make Nayanthara seem like a superstar, which she is by all means, is a good call. When you've had 20 years of a career making it big in several industries, and so many of your co-workers saying nice things about you, it must feel heart-warming for Nayan, personally and professionally. I've loved her presence in films for a long time, including the ones where she had little to do as a performer. Even in those films, she'd have left a mark of sorts.The Dhanush fiasco aside (which I don't know for whatever reason), I like how this is less of a typical ""kalyana cassette"" and more of a journey of how Nayan & Wikki got to where they did. Nelson's occasional interventions prove to be comedic gold. It almost made me want to see Nayan in a Nelson movie again, soon. Gautham Menon's voice is heard, but he doesn't appear on screen. Well, this stuff is right down his alley (even though it says directed by ""Amith Krishnan""?). Not a fan of poshness in private (..well not so private now, is it?) weddings and the excessive showoff, but the rest of the piece struck an emotional chord with me.",False
10,1,Horrible - Just a boasted CRINGE wanna be love story . Good for nothing.,ifzahamed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just a boasted CRINGE wanna be love story . Good for nothing. They just wanted to cover their wedding expenses by selling the cringe wedding clips to Netflix. Entire Tamil industry knows that nayanthara is a swollen headed wanna be star who initially was in relationship with many directors and producers to beg for opportunities. Now she wants to convince the audience that she was self made. Lol üòÇ she had even begged some big stars in Tamil Nadu to participate in her wedding so that she can show their faces in the trailer to boost the viewership. As it failed, she ended up begging SRK after acting in Jawan which was a pichchai offered by another cringe wannabe director idlee.",False
11,10,"Worth watching, Never boring, Loved it",gayahasili,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot many can see such documentry coming in recent times that too on an actress who is grown from rags to riches.... It includes more of talkings from many celebrities giving a gist of her career and it's not all about the wedding ceremony, it's her life story... There are parts that's really touching and emotional. There is a takeaway for all the women too that strongly emphasize the failure is not the end and you have one choice to move forward. NAYANTHARA is really an inspiration and example of the quote ""Failure is the stepping stone to success"". When there are too many unwanted movies queuing up in the industry why not the sensible documentry..Worth watching and absolutely enjoyed it...",True
12,7,Nayanthara. Huge Respect. This documentary is a one-time watch.,devulapallic,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Netflix documentary is a good one-time watch.This documentary is mostly a series of talking-head interviews with very little footage from Nayanthara Garu's films.Nevertheless, the documentary has been well-directed, well-shot and well-edited.Talking about her daughter, Nayanthara Garu's mother takes you on a roller-coaster ride of emotions.I readily connected to Nayanthara Garu's mother mostly because my father was also bed-ridden, for 7 years, due to Shy-Drager syndrome (Multiple system atrophy). My mother also painstakingly took care of my father until he passed away in 2005.What is nice about the documentary is Nayanthara Garu also addresses her past relationships candidly.The second half of the documentary focuses on her relationship with Vighnesh Shivan Garu, from their budding romance to their wedding and kids. This was a bit tiring for me, so i watched it on 1.5x. Female viewers would love it though.In the ongoing tiff: Nayanthara vs Dhanush, Dhanush Garu is the guilty one. Clearly, he is cheap, crass, narrow-minded and a jerk! He should have given the NOC to her!Indian documentaries must accomodate more archival footage which would make them an interesting watch. Also, it's a win-win for all those involved in the film.I loved Suma Garu's Gurthukostunnayi series with Akkineni Nageswara Rao Garu on ETV. Very nicely done.Nayanthara Garu's 10 best films

13,1,CRINGE- Don't waste your time,earnsharu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rotten food served on a silver plate.....
Completely unrealistic and scripted....This is a classic example of style over substance-a beautifully polished facade masking a hollow core. The narrative is painfully unrealistic, riddled with forced drama and implausible scenarios that feel disconnected from reality. Despite its shiny presentation and attempts to impress, it falls flat, offering no genuine emotional connection or depth. It's like being served rotten food on a silver platter: visually appealing but ultimately unpalatable. A disappointing watch for anyone seeking authentic storytelling or meaningful cinema.",False
14,1,A Cringe-Fest of Self-Promotion,venkatdesigner-63664,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nayanthara: Beyond the Fairy Tale has faced sharp criticism for being an overly polished and self-serving documentary. Viewers seeking an honest exploration of the actress's struggles and triumphs found it lacking. Instead, the film focuses on creating a glorified, almost sanitized portrayal of Nayanthara's life, which some critics labeled as ""cringe-worthy"" and ""inauthentic.""Rather than revealing unseen layers of her personality or career, the documentary is said to rely on superficial visuals and promotional overtones, frustrating audiences who expected raw and meaningful storytelling. While intended as an inspirational piece, it has been dismissed by many as a missed opportunity that prioritizes image over substance, failing to resonate on a deeper emotional level.Some viewers have described the documentary as an unnecessary celebration of Nayanthara's wedding, treating it as a spectacle rather than delving into her journey or struggles. It has also been criticized for failing to capture the challenges that shaped her into a celebrated figure, leaving fans disappointed by its lack of authenticity.",False
15,1,Netflix's Biggest Disappointment,Faheeth,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was eagerly waiting for this show-not for Nayanthara or Vignesh, but to see how other celebs and actors attended, the grand decorations, and the celebrations. Sadly, the entire show was a letdown. Every scene felt dull and uninspiring. The opening with Nayan and Vignesh using baby face filters was outright irritating. I genuinely can't understand how Netflix even decided to buy this. If you value your time, it's better to skip this show. If you're looking to waste hours of your life, then maybe give it a try. Dear Nayanthara, nowadays you are constantly irritating your fans. Please stop doing this; otherwise, you might lose your title as Lady Superstar.",False

The so-called ""intimate"" storytelling feels more like a glossy advertisement for her public persona rather than an authentic exploration of her journey.",False
17,1,Not that great!,keerthi-37376,n/a,16/08/2025,It wasn't that great as expected. It would have been better by sharing more about their lives and how she came up in life and how she stood up for herself. And it could have been more better in the beginning as it was just people talking the same stuff again and again. It was bit boring and couldn't follow properly and also the wedding part they have shown is very less and that could have also been better and more play time maybe? But can be watched once for her though it was hit on and off at some points. Still proud of her as a person and she is amazing and looks stunning and awesome. She is a lady superstar for a reason!,False
18,1,"Looks scripted, None of the heros are taking from bottom of their heart",barathsibi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Solo performance, heros are praising her so much looks more scripted. She should have walked around her house and made it better. Nothing is so special in this, just a boring documentary with few scenes. I really don't know why they have to hype this so much. Secondly, is this required. I would like to watch Ambani's son wedding or documentary. Spent useless hours here and my internet. Can be watched in bits and pieces while using restroom, lunch break or tea break. If someone wants to watch it, you can watch it at 1.5x. Too much hype and internal fights for this documentary is unnecessary. Overall - not a worthy documentary.",False
19,1,Not good,bharaththeboss-69041,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey should have focused on the place where she born, schooling and college and then speeches from her friends and teachers from the childhood . This documentary doesn't show reality and something modified one. Being Lady superstar, this documentary doesn't show her stardom.Never thought this documentary was so bad and however directed this., please watch some old documentary.Netflix should have focused on the first to last movie which she acted and then short speeches from co actors and few fun factor from her movies.

20,10,IGNORE THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS,varvin,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was so good! It made me cry and showed how hard her life was in the industry. She deserves to be happy. The negative reviews are biased because people don't question when a man makes money, but if a woman makes money, it's selfish? This is exactly what the documentary shows, the struggles a woman has to go through, and most of the negative critiques are from men or so-called Dhanush fans. No one would question such a documentary if the lead was a male actor. The men who support this documentary are unbiased and truly understand what she went through. It's such an amazing documentary, with a good flow, I didn't even notice the time passing by while watching it. They are happy and sharing that, so instead of thinking it's some double scheme or something bad behind it, just go watch it for yourself and you'll understand.",False
21,2,A Larger-Than-Life Persona Reduced to a Minimalist Documentary,wonderwellwisher,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentaries or biopics are a tough creative medium to engage audiences, as there is a high chance they can become boring. Good scripting and direction are essential to create an entertaining documentary. Sadly, this one fails to deliver on both fronts.Nayanthara, the Lady Superstar of South India, truly deserves a well-made documentary or biopic-but not this shabby attempt. The film touches on some key aspects of her life, such as a brief focus on her struggles and her love life with her husband, Vignesh Sivan.A documentary should ideally provide viewers with insights they didn't already know about the artist or delve into something deeply personal. Unfortunately, this one does neither. It feels more like a self-promotional video where her friends and family repeatedly emphasize what a wonderful person she is. Her life, which has been filled with controversies, is completely glossed over, even though much of it is already public knowledge. Even a bigger surprise she being a such big star, the film doesn't shed much light on her movies or choices.The direction of this documentary is worse than that of a college project. Random people appear and narrate segments, which then transition into behind-the-scenes footage or arbitrary shots of Nayanthara walking around. It evokes no real emotion-except perhaps frustration at realizing you've wasted your time watching it. The editing is shabby with no flow at all.The first 40 minutes are a chaotic collection of unrelated snippets from her life, but the second half becomes slightly more bearable when Vignesh Sivan enters the picture. Their love story and dynamic as a couple are genuinely pleasant to watch. The wedding segment, however, feels rushed, leaving viewers with nothing substantial to take away.Ultimately, this documentary does little more than highlight how smitten Vignesh is with Nayanthara. It's such a poorly executed piece that it's best ignored altogether. As a fan of Nayanthara, I am deeply disappointed. This is an injustice to the larger-than-life persona she embodies. She chose to showcase only the positive parts of her life, which isn't what a creative piece like this should aim for.#PranuReviews #NayantharaBeyondTheFairytale #NayantharaBeyondTheFairytaleReview.",False
22,2,Ultimate guide to self proclamation,georgekappad,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched it on NetflixThe documentary is well done but felt like an advertisement funded by the producers.I strongly think Netflix should add a new category called advertisement so that viewer can keep themselves away from promotional materials like that.It's unfortunate that we viewers have to pay and watch advertisements like this. This may be a good study material for film students who wants to see how an advertisement can be streched and made into a long boring documentary.From the first minute to the 15th minute it was just fake low leval sympathy, I couldn't watch the film beyond that.",False
23,1,"So Ordinary, It's Almost Comedy!",tellingsreehari,n/a,16/08/2025,"What dropped on Netflix with a truckload of controversies-ranging from ego clashes between actors to whispers of a marketing gimmick-turned out to be something way too disappointing. Beyond the Fairy Tale promised a peek behind the curtain of one of South India's most celebrated stars, but instead, it delivered a painfully dull, self-indulgent snooze fest that almost tarnishes whatever love and respect one might have had for Nayanthara.Some would argue that this isn't even a documentary but rather an over-glorified wedding video. And even so, it may just be the most uninspiring wedding film ever made. The storytelling is painfully flat, devoid of depth or drama, leaving the audience constantly questioning-Why? Why did I watch this? Why did Netflix produce this? Why would someone invest time and money in making this? But most importantly, why would an actress of Nayanthara's stature, known for her self-made journey, resort to something so lackluster?The documentary does nothing but parade family members and acquaintances in front of the camera to narrate stories so mundane that even with all the glorified editing, they fail to spark interest. The film positions Nayanthara as a larger-than-life figure with unmatched courage, but ironically, it achieves the opposite-it exposes how painfully ordinary her story is. There is no real insight into her struggles, no mention of the actual controversies that shaped her journey, and certainly no depth to her love story, which is painted in dull, lifeless strokes.Even when attempting to showcase a grand romance, the film fails miserably. Instead of a compelling love story filled with passion, hardships, or memorable moments, we get a monotonous narrative that feels rehearsed and overly sanitized. It's a relationship with no peaks or valleys-just a straight line of uninspired storytelling.At its core, Beyond the Fairy Tale lacks purpose. It offers no takeaways, no new perspectives, and ultimately, no real reason for its existence. If this was meant to solidify Nayanthara's legacy, it may have done the exact opposite. The documentary unintentionally paints her as someone desperate to craft a certain image, even if it means hiring people to sit in front of a camera and say nice things about her.For a star whose journey was once admired, this film does her no favors. Instead of celebrating her success, it makes you wonder-Did she really need this?",False
24,1,Absolute cringe,bzmdzq,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was cringe from the beginning to the end, well done for her to get Netflix to buy this looool. I guess quality isn't a requirement to make it on their platform. Idk how or who gave her the title ""Lady Superstar"" all she can do is overact... Like, peak cringe. You'd think folks in the industry would know how to tell a story, but nope-this was basically a self-indulgent Instagram reel stretched and I won't get that time back unfortunately.The whole thing felt like a show-and-tell of ""look how in love we are,"" with zero depth. Every scene was them gazing lovingly into each other's eyes or dropping clich√©s about soulmates. I was half-expecting the words ""love conquers all"" to pop up in Comic Sans.They tried to make it artsy, but it ended up feeling forced-random slow-mo shots, dramatic music for no reason, and conversations that felt so scripted they might as well have been reading off cue cards.

She looks better now but whatever old clippings of hers I saw in documentary I am surprised what is all this buzz about her. She looked below average there were many better looking girls in south may be its plain luck and for sixteen years with her kind of personality there must be lots of other arrangements too to get at this level which I am sorry is her personal choice. Any ways nothing special I don't know who she is may be viewers from south may like it.",False

1,10,An emotional and well-made documentary,jakobselbing,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love how the authentic footage from the rescue operation is mixed with beautiful shots from the Amazon jungle and the indigenous people's stories about the supernatural elements of the jungle. It really gives you a sense of mystery and awe.Another beautiful aspect is how the historical conflict between the military and the indigenous people was eventually overcome and had the two sides work together side by side regardless of race or background.The difference between the two sides is also reflected in how the search method changes. Initially the military is responsible, but later the indigenous group is given more room and uses their knowledge and intuition. Finally, as a last resort the hallucinatory drug ""yag√©"" is used, and has one man transforming into a jaguar and searching the nocturnal jungle. That was definitely one of my favorite scenes!Even though I already knew the outcome, this movie had me in tears.",False

1,2,Boring!,naumannlars,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like Lewandowski as a player and he is a good guy, but this Documentary is pretty boring!Of course his skills on the pitch everybody knows and his goals for Legia Warsaw, Borussia Dortmund, FC Bayern Munich and FC Barcelona are insane, especially the 4 Goals against Real Madrid in the Champions League Game and the 5 goals in 9 minutes in Bundesliga vs. VFL Wolfsburg.But this is not a good production. Everything is standard and could be a project from a university.Pretty sad that this movie is made like every low Budget production without any love.Pro: You can make your laundry or clean your Apartement while watching it.",False

I am shore that Robert and Ania are happy together...wish them all the best for the next 50 year;)
And on the end ...this is absolutely proof that if you believe yourself you can be the best in every part you wish to play !!!! Brawo Robert!!!!",False

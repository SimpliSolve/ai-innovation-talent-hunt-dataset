1,7,Interesting - Could have been captivating,johnpierrepatrick,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary decrypts a topic that is generally (voluntarily!) put aside.
A great topic.It however makes one big mistake. I'll still advise to overlook it, it's still worth it (see below).
It wants to speak of everything that can be related to this topic, the dark side of green energy.
Thus, it lacks depth, only touching on every topic, giving fragmentary information, forgetting to contextualize...It stays in my opinion a documentary to watch.
Why? It still have essential messages within, messages that are not transmitted by mass medias, politics...
**Spoiler alert**
There is no such thing as clean energy.
More than that, the development of this new economy - sticking to every capitalism concepts that takes place everywhere else: profit, non-care of the environment and its inhabitants/workers, and of course growth, growth, growth.
The development of this new economy doesn't care if they really are clean. That's a new business. Dot.
I was amazed to learn that electric cars will worsen carbon emission, climate change and pollution. WORSEN, not reduce, not even keep it at the same level - all this without considering the continuous increase of cars on our planet!",True
2,7,Everyone needs to watch it...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Dark Side of Green Energies"" is a Documentary in which we watch how climate change affects people and how green energies becoming so popular nowadays. One of them is the electric car which does not have any greenhouse gas emission but there are other problems with it.I found this documentary very interesting since it presented very well the reality behind the mining of some elements such as cobalt and how problematic this is. People tend to observe and mainly focus on the tree without noticing the whole forest regarding climate change and the electric car as a solution of it. They have to read and do their own research on this very serious subject that affects all of us. The direction which was made by both Jean-Louis Perez and Guillaume Pitron was very good and they presented very well the whole problem but also the truth behind the so called green energies. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Dark Side of Green Energies"" is a very interesting documentary and I highly recommend everyone to watch it. Some other equally good and interesting documentaries to watch are: ""Seaspiracy"" of 2021 and ""Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret"" of 2014.",False
3,10,"""Clean"" tech: Taking the planet from the frying pan to the forest fire",njferns,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is a definite must-watch in my opinion as it will shatter any remaining illusions you hold about so-called ""green"" tech. So remove your green-tinted glasses, set them aside, and strap into your EV for a road of disappointment towards the clean tech industry, where you'll start questioning why these technologies are being so heavily lobbied by governments around the world v/s researching better alternatives.In a nutshell, here are some of the facts highlighted (that you may or may not be aware of):(Electric Vehicles) EVs require LOADS of rare metals. Which are mined in poor, low economy countries (China, Chile, and Bolivia are explored here).While EU countries and other Western nations live in their ""clean and green energy"" bubble, blissfully ignoring what's happening elsewhere because of it, countries like China, Chile, and Bolivia are bearing the brunt of it but still continue as it's a chance for them to increase their GDP, etc.Besides EVs, other ""clean"" tech like wind turbines and solar panels aren't exactly feasible for the long term either.",False

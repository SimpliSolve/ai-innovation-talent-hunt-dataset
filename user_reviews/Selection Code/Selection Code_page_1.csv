1,8,Intriguing. Convincing. Terrifying.,sjwestbrooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Selection Code is one of the best films about the 2020 election made yet. The facts it presents are clear, concise, and irrefutable proof that the voting machines used to count our votes are unreliable and in no way, shape, or form secure. This documentary also tells the story of Tina Peters, a county clerk who is being put on trial for simply investigating the voting machines in her county.It's low budget and only an hour long, but it is sure to at least leave you questioning the security of our elections.P. S. I know people don't seem to like what I'm saying, but that does not make it less true. If you are a 1-star troll, I challenge you to watch the documentary and ""fact check"" it in your review.",False
2,1,Just more debunked conspiracy theories,brucebigelow-10873,n/a,16/08/2025,"And still no verifiable proof that anyone could take to a judge and say ""I have proof of election fraud."" Mike Lindell keeps promising that he'll give us undeniable proof of election interference and never delivers on it. It's actually sad at this point.",False
3,10,Gripping presentation of documented FACTS!,christian_completely,n/a,16/08/2025,"This epic film is not just about 2020. It contains a thorough history of voting machines, along with past news articles, interviews with I. T. experts in decades past as well as current times, and testimony given in Congress and under oath from before 2020.It also presents real data about the inconsistencies and the machine tampering and secret passwords that have been occurring in 2020 and 2021, as discovered and analyzed by a County Clerk who noticed and documented votes and records having being altered digitally.But don't take my word for it. Watch this film and judge the evidence for yourself!",False
4,2,More dull than anything,popkiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping for something more insightful, but it's the same information we've been hearing all along, but sadly very boring. This isn't going convince anyone of a stolen election. It's also kind of messy, the information isn't presented in an orderly and easy to understand way. It feels kind of ramshackle. The numbers they show are im sure true, but it doesn't work in a movie. Also, he part about her dead son is sad but didn't really fit with the theme of the movie. Overall, pretty disappointing and I can't recommend it. I would just do your own research and find whatever information you need to make it believable.",False
5,10,ONE OF THE FOUR BEST VIDEOS TO BEAT CORRUPTION!,wrbutler-41302,n/a,16/08/2025,"Along with 2000 Mules, Rigged and The Truth About January 6th, Selection Code does and excellent job of exposing the huge corruption orchestration that continues in our country's government. The persecution of Tina Peters, mother of a Navy Seal who died in action, is nothing short of Hitler's tactics and is despicable! This video should be required watching for all who love America. IF WE DO NOT STOP THE CORRUPTION, WE WILL BECOME A POLICE STATE RUN BY EVIL. Do not believe we have the 2022 elections in the bag! We do not. God Bless America!",False
6,10,More evidence that will be ignored,mtbgtown,n/a,16/08/2025,"Besides all the credentialed scientists giving data, proof, evidence, just the fact that for 20 years, progressives whined about machines being vulnerable should be enough to at least look at it.",False
7,10,The space continues to thrive with corruption and will end with this movie,danmc-88242,n/a,16/08/2025,"Complete moment of truth. This will start to open the eyes of the people that are still clinging to the idea that ours elections are transparent. The whole system has been corrupt since before 1876. These politicians will all need to leave their de facto posts and bring in the de jure government back, along with our God given sovereignty.",False
8,10,"A must watch for all ""normies"" of the world...",jerz-12268,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beginning with the perspective of a county clerk who's one desire is to secure your vote no matter WHO you vote for, you are taken on a journey starting with her experience. A free and fair election is the single most important right we have in this country and this documentary is one of the most intriguing and inciteful films that explains the fraud that has been implemented in our elections making them neither free nor fair. Election transparency is a must and electronic voting machines provide nothing but a cloak for the corrupt to select the candidates of their choice. Watch it, share it, watch it again.",False
9,10,Well Worth a Look,scottbulger-50451,n/a,16/08/2025,"These are the movies the American people should be watching. Not the BS on most of the networks.Anyone can look at the information presented here objectively and see that we have a serious problem with our voting system.Who is ultimately in control of our country's destiny? It certainly doesn't appear to be the people.Now we have a ""vaccine"" that is useless- zero efficacy and doesn't stop transmission, but yet, they still press for everyone to get it. SAD, the sudden onsite of pediatric RSV, flu, myocarditis, and other indicators of a ""vaccine"" gone bad.Now there is evidence of self assembling graphene oxide nanobots in the ""vaccine"". What are these? Are they self-activated bio-transmitters or some other nefarious device?The results of the 2020 election will haunt the US forever. There is no course of action to remedy this other than to get out and vote out the people that were selected to their current offices- without the machines- same day voting only on Electiion Day with paper ballots counted by midnight on the same night.",False
10,10,No Evidence To Present To A Court?,linda_nitzschke,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see one reviewer here doesn't understand what actual ""evidence"" (that could be presented to a court) is; Selection Code has plenty of proof, but if one is blinded by ideology, it matters not how much evidence is presented since ""None is so blind as he who will not see."" Most court cases concerning voting irregularities were thrown out due to process concerns, such as ""lack of standing,"" etc., and most often that was erroneous, as well. Because of the courts fear of taking up the cases, they never got to the point of ""Discovery,"" where the REAL proof would have been presented. Then, add in how we witnessed the Left's rioting during the ""Summer of Love,"" etc., no courts WANTED to get involved (have you not heard of the man who showed up in Justice Kavanaugh's neighborhood with instruments ready to use to murder the Justice (and probably his family?) It is also against the law to demonstrate outside the supreme court justices' homes, but when it occurred over the Roe v. Wade ruling of late, our DOJ did nothing to prosecute the offenders or put a stop to it...so just imagine what could have happened to ANYONE who were to involve themselves in overturning even any one small part of the 2020 election!! And, if that isn't enough to convince anyone the election wasn't legit...just ask yourself why the Left is working so dang hard to keep Trump from running again in 2024 if he was so easily beaten in 2020! One would think the dems are a wee bit concerned about the amount of fraud the 2024 election would take to overcome Trump the next time...esp. Now after the raid on his home...and they are wondering how the heck they'll be able to pull the steal off again now that one heck of a lot more eyes will be watching...eyes that are a lot more aware of just how these things can be stolen and so know exactly what to watch for. There are even going to be tailgate parties at drop boxes all night long to keep the 2000 Mules thing from happening again, too.Sorry I went off on a bit of a tangent here, but there was one reviewer here who seemed to have not even watched this movie (or maybe was incapable of understanding it), and I felt it needed to be addressed in order to support of the excellence of this movie ""Selection Code.""",False

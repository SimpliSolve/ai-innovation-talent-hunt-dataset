1,7,The architecture of the human being,MiguelAReina,n/a,17/08/2025,"The shots of the buildings designed by Alvar Aalto are accompanied by people, representing the concept of architecture as an experience of the human being. It is an ambitious documentary that devoutly shows the work of one of the world's great architects. And also highlights the work of Aino Aalto as a woman who was never in the shadow of her husband. An interesting approach to the architecture of the soul.",False
2,1,The buildings seems secondary,tucuento,n/a,17/08/2025,"Aalto is one of the most prominent of the architects of the 20th century, if he wasn't this film has no point. Nonetheless, the film is about his letters, the importance of his wives (something never denied by no critic, Aino was crucial to develop his style, and the furniture was almost more of her than his, Elsa was an Aalto's student, and her presence was determinant to the late works of Aalto, but his style was already developed and Elsa always was an extensi√≥n of him, a good one, but a disciple first and after an assistant, talking about the professional performance), and some of the social relations of Aalto. The best of the film are the sequences where we can see Aalto's work, so the credits goes to the architect. The director seems to have no real knowledge on architecture, which it's ok, she is making a movie, not a building, but she interviewed and have the contribution of several experts, but she thinks it is pointless tell the viewer who's talking in off at every moment. It is a very weak documentary, and will not contribute at all to knowing anything about Aaalto's work, and I do not mean just Aalvar, also Aino and Elsa. Disappointing.",False

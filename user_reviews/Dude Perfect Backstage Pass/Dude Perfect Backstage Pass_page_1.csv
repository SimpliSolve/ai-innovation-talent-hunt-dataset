1,8,Very Good Documentary,jackg-65084,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good documentary and I highly recommend it. As a huge fan of DP, I think this was one of the best documentaries I've ever seen and I was surprised because it was a YouTube Original and I have not really seen anything YouTube Original before. I showed my grandma this and our whole family is strongly Christian Based and she didn't want it to end. She has no introduced my younger cousins to the channel and they watch it daily. I love this so much overall and it's totally worth a watch. Especially for a Christian family to watch all together on a fun Friday night movie night. Overall, 7.9/10.",False

1,9,Enjoyable and informative take on some of the planet's treasures,mformoviesandmore,n/a,16/08/2025,"Six episodes covers a lot of ground, but obviously can't cover the whole world. Plenty of scope here for a second season.Christopher Clark comes across as very knowledegable and engaged with his subjects. The dry style of delivery helps to ensure that he doesn't distract visually from the wonders on display, and they are certainly well displayed.There is, of course, the obligatory nod to 'Climate Change' which seems to pop up in such shows much the same way that movies in the '80s would have someone holding a can of Pepsi. Everyone has a needing for funding.Well worth the watch and hopefully there will be more.",False
2,3,History of men by men,yvmmulder,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like countless series about historical events, this is too focused on the ""great"" leaders (men) that did ""manly"" things (growing enormous egos exaggerating their successes, waging wars and making other work for him), told by a man. All the rest is, as usual, overlooked. It says something about Unesco as well, of course, for the choice of sites and the stories behind them, but it's getting a bit old to be honest. As a historian myself, I didn't finishing the first episode, there's nothing new about this pharao exaggerating his own worth. It's like drooling over Mar-a-Lago and once again uplift its self-centered owner..to me that's simply useless.Nevertheless, the images in the film are beautiful and it's nice to get an idea of these impressive places. But don't be fooled in thinking that this is the history of our planet; it's heavily selective in showing what it wants to show and tell.",False

1,7,Bjorn (and more) Again,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gods of Tennis is pushing it a bit but there's little doubt that the three pairs of tennis players who fill up the three programmes in this BBC eve-of,-Wimbledon series are amongst the greatest of modern the day.The six champions profiled are in programme one, Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King, two prominent Americans who fought against the different prejudices on an off court and in the next two programmes, the classic rivalries between in the men's game, Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe and Chris Evert-Lloyd and Martina Navratilova.All three programmes are more glossy magazine than proper book in style and content but include classic match footage and interviews (some archival obviously) although h could have done without the comments of one or two of the so-called ""expert"" journalists and commentators and especially from celebrity rent-a-quote fans.Could the series have included other great names and / or rivalries in its run, well I guess Boris Becker would have been unavailable to discuss his rivalry with Stefan Edberg and it was strange to see great names like Jimmy Connors, Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf and the Williams sisters almost completely sidelined.Still for fans of the game who don't think that Djokovic couldn't lace Borg's boots or that Martina would have blown away any of the 2023 ladies contenders, this series made for a nice walloe down memory lane, although don't expect anything much in the way of depth.",False

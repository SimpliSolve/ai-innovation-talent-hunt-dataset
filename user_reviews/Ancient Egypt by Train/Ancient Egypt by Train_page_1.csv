1,6,Great show,sja-awesome,n/a,15/08/2025,Very interesting and fun series to watch. I quite like the host and her enthusiasm and clear love of Egyptian history and artifacts and the culture. I do think it's interesting that there is trains there and they were the second place in the world to get trains built and have a railway. Seeing some of the sites from the train is also really fun but it's a shame that there's too many buildings there now to see the pyramids from the train. Their craftsmen is amazing and the carving she gets of Isis is just stunning! The only thing I don't like is that they're still promoting that idea that the pyramids were tombs for the Pharaohs when there's absolutely no proof of that at all. There's never been a bodies found in any of the three great pyramids. The Kings chamber has absolutely no hieroglyphics no burial inscriptions no send off to the afterlife just an empty box. It's pretty clear to anyone with any knowledge of the Egyptians that this was not correct at all and definitely not the place the king would lie to go to the afterlife.,False

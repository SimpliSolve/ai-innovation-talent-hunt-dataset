1,9,"If there was no video footage, no one would believe it happened",quasi1111,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's just that crazy. If this was the plot to a film you'd probably have critics saying the plot was too far-fetched for the film to be enjoyable.The happenings uncovered by these two fearless Danish men are- quite literally at times- unbelievable, and it's that precisely that makes this such an enthralling and jaw-dropping watch.Truly seismic and really hope it gets the recognition it deserves.",False
2,9,An unbelievable story,OostAs,n/a,16/08/2025,"A inside look in Nort Korea's desperate attempts to make money on international drug and weapons deals.
The lack of scrutiny on the part of the North Korean officials in verifying the identity of the mole and especially the actor makes it hard to believe this really happened. But it seem to be real events that we see unfolding judging on the endless amount of footage of the meetings and Brugger's history of documentary making.
It's more thrumming than any Bond movie.",False
3,9,"Horrifying, thrilling, impressive!",william-eugensson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some parts of the project is really mind boggling. You need to watch this documentary! The guts of Mr james and the Mole is just terrific. Some of the best reveals in a non-fictional film peice I have seen. Also, a great depiction of North Korea and how they deal in the west.",False
4,10,Mind Blowing!,mf2812,n/a,16/08/2025,I honestly can't get my head around anyone who thinks this is worthy of anything under 8. Folk saying about bad directorship or anything along those lines are thick as s##t! It's more an expose than a typical documentary but that's because it had so many hidden cameras. What were you expecting? Some beautiful cinematography?! This guy spent 10 years of his life on the line and people are giving it 1 star. Unbelievable. For anyone with half a brain I fully recommend this. Stunning.,False
5,10,Reality beats fiction,Bessamo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once again Mads Brügger demonstrates how reality beats fiction. I the beginning I found it too constructed, with a debriefing and the instructors voice over. But as the story unfolded, I have to agree that the narrated style worked well. Then I just watched in amazement and disbelief.",False
6,10,I still can't 100% believe that was non fiction,nickjackson-40726,n/a,16/08/2025,"I rarely tend to review on here, and maybe I'll reflect on this review having posted during yet another moment of midweek lockdown malaise, but my initial reaction is that I can't recall ever watching a documentary with such a mixture of incredulity and respect for the 2 protagonists. Apart from them demonstrating serious cohones, the director has produced an important 2 hours, during which I sat mostly open mouthed.",False
7,10,Amazing effort,marcusnyegaard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey pulled the greatest prank ever to surface the earth. The victim? Alejandro. I genuinely laughed my *** off, when he tells the mole about Mads Brügger and how he can tell sarcasm and when something is off.",True
8,10,This is the Most Incredible Documentary I've Ever Watched!,ashley-elson-191-924693,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a critic. All I can say is, if you want to see an undercover spy operation with real footage, watch this!The adrenalin you feel is real. Imagine the adrenalin and fear you'd have felt if you were the one doing it for 10 years straight.Absolutely incredible bravery and commitment from Ulrich & Mr James - who is the most incredible person I've ever seen at work!No spoilers - just watch it and you'll see for yourself. You couldn't make it up!",False
9,10,A really great documentary about corruption and power! A MUST SEE!,freddy_at_home,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must say I enjoyed this documentary very much. Exciting to learn about North Korea and how it all works, going around the system and international laws. It's like ""I can't believe"" how easy that sounds. If I had some million Euro or Dollars, I could be part of a lot of shady stuff. It's just very interesting.They got so much info, video and photos, I'm impressed. They really did a great job, all involved. I found the ""Mr. James"" guy especially exciting. He did the part like an award winning actor. He looked the part, had the right part and skillset. Impressive!Also the retired chef, such a natural calm, kinda geeky and ""boring"" guy, living his life, just being undercover for so long. Doing all that. That dude is a lot tougher than he looks. Respect!This is ABSOLUTELY worth a watch! Great from beginning to end 10/10",False
10,7,Is it all true?,osvaldoantunes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good history with a mind blowing plot... sometimes a hard to believe it's all true, and that facts really happened as they are being told. But it's worth watching even without having that much clarity, for the boldness of the movie makers and the footage recorded. As everything else regarding North Korea, it's hard to fact check. So basically you have to put some faith on the storytellers and believe that what they're saying it's true and unfolded the way they show.",False
11,10,Another masterpiece from Mads Brügger,mikkelzib,n/a,16/08/2025,"Easily the beat documentary, I've ever watched. Was tied to the screen though the whole thing - in pure disbelief.",False
12,7,Trolling Mr. Kim,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The North Korean government is brutal, murderous, and yet has a handful of foreign lackeys who support its aims. This peculiar documentary covers the attempts of a retired Danish chef and a convicted drug dealer to investigate these networks through undercover infiltration, an absurdly dangerous thing to do, but also, something that appears in many ways more akin to trolling than journalism. Although it's clear from the start that they made it out alive, some elements of the story leave an awkward taste in the mouth: some Ugandan villagers are promised a new hospital, and threatened with eviction, as part of a fabricated scheme that appears to be spiralling out of control through the protagonists' love of the game. It's as if George Smiley was playing for laughs. The story is fun to watch mostly because it's so weird; but I'm not sure it reflects quite as well on its heroes as they might think. That it doesn't reflect well on North Korea either goes without saying.",False
13,4,Sloppy plot,chris-impens,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf this were a movie it would be criticised for its sloppy plot. We are to believe that North Korea enters into negotiations with a former criminal who had to invent on the spot a company name for his firm when asked for it. A North Korean delegation travels to Europe to meet him, there to find out to their surprise that the man had visited their country the week before. North Korea's man in Europe, a Spaniard, demonstrates a bug device to the Mole while he (the mole) is actually carrying a hidden microphone and camera. Glad to have miraculously escaped, he gets rid of his equipment in broad daylight, next to his car, filmed by - yes, by whom? Many times I wondered who was filming. Smart equipment apparently, because hidden cameras may change angles to get a better view. In the end I didn't know what to think of it.",True
14,10,"Amazing stuff, once more Walraff Brügger",OJT,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mads Brügger is better than ever when he uses others as walraff mole to uncover the nasty secrets of North Korea and their disiples.
I was tied to the screen for every second of this, and if you ever thought that the North Korean regime was up to any good, you'll learn better from this.
This is very important work, and kudos to the two moles.
Fantastic work, and important work for world human community.",False
15,10,Amazing,cmathiassendk,n/a,16/08/2025,What an absolute amazing story! A must see. The documentary covers everything you already suspectet to be true. And now you Can see and hear it with your own eyes. You can't make this up...,False
16,10,"Seems like fiction, but is ""edge of seat"" real",kim_engman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mads Brügger has a nag for getting us, as viewers, feeling immersed in his documentaries. You literally sit at the edge of your seat.
His ""victims"" in them, often seem clown-like and involuntary comedians as Mads Brügger slowly but steadily spins his web around a sometimes pre-defined narrative.
In the case of ""The Mole"", Mads Brügger and his two enormously brave, key accomplices, did not have a story from the outset, but instead saw the narrative develop over the span of an incredible 10 years!
What patience from Mads Brügger!
What courage from Ulrich Larsen, a young pensioner that did something very few of us will ever get to do; Create a historic legacy. His wife will surely forgive him (see the end)!
And what incredible forgiveness for all past sins we feel from watching Mr. James (an ex-French Foreign Legionary and convicted cocain-dealer to the rich and famous). He's a damn, perfect fit for the role as Mr. James!
As of a few days after release, already the UN have asked all three to bear witness before UN Security Council. What higher achievement could you ask for?",False
17,10,Super interesting and exciting film,friendshipjohn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just watched the first episode of this documentary film on the Dutch TV network NPO and fell immediately in love with it. It is a super interesting film to me. Like some other reviews said, ""reality beats the fiction"", I also have the same feeling. I like the way the documentary is made, without passing judgements (no one can stay absolutely impartial, but i think this movie did a good job), only recording what happened. I think the director also did a great job in making this into a very interesting and exciting real-life thriller. I understand that some people doubt the authenticity of this film, (well, it is common that people doubt about everything, toch?). I can only tell from my own experience. I was born and grew up in China, we heard quite often of the stories of our neighbour and one of our best buddies (if we have any)--North Korea. And during my study of international relations at the university, I did some research and wrote an article about the North Korea, plus what i have heard from my parents and what i watched on news and other documentaries, I personally found the story quite convincing and authentic. And last but not least, the mole, and the rest of the film team, is so daring of making this film happen. I would definetely recommend this film to you.",False
18,10,This seems to have hit a nerve.,theredmare,n/a,16/08/2025,"I needn't go over the story again here, it's utterly gripping, but I am just posting this review to say that *every single account* that has reviewed this documentary as propaganda and fiction has been created in October 2020 and this was their first or unique contribution to imdb. I checked because I am naturally suspicious and I also immediately noticed an unnatural amount of thumbs down on positive reviews, for a documentary that highly rated.
Draw your own conclusions.",False
19,10,Mads Brügger - Someone we all should be proud of,danielstorm1993,n/a,16/08/2025,Once again an amazing documentary from Mads Brügger - North Koreas best friend.,False
20,7,Is Mads Brügger the Michael Moore of Denmark?,ashleyannkennedy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough for this one to have the impact Brügger wanted it to have on me (for example, Alejandro, being confined to Spain and deprived of his income from the North Korean government, had no incentive to be anything other than an actor). It was also slow-paced and part 2 was a bore; I would have preferred a piece that slanted more on the human condition aspect of the mole who'd sacrificed so much just for 15 minutes of fame, rather than whatever charade Brügger was trying to construct. Cold Case Hammersjold was very similar; when Brügger hits a wall, he makes do with the footage that he has, but is it the truth he is after? He seems to be a producer that cares more about the end than the means. 6.5 rounded up only because it fleshes out how the North Koreans exploit those around them and deal in illicit goods. I would not really say it was worth my two hours of attention.",False
21,10,One of the best documentaries ever,fabiokeller,n/a,16/08/2025,Even if the movie was fiction it would be a must-watch. Considering the fact that it is true makes it just outstandingly great. This is the kind of movie that can change the world.,False
22,1,boring undocumentary,howboutthisone_huh,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI couldn't make it even half way before I had to tag out. It was either that or break my tv from frustration. Lets say that they flipped the story around and NK produced this, then it might be interesting but it's not. It's not a documentary. It's not a mokumentary. It's not a docudrama either so what is it. It's obviously fake. There's no way they could produce camera shots in documentary style as they happen but it's not a recreation. For some reason, the producers of this ilk think that the audience for this are too dumb to recognize it's not an actual documentary of real events as they occur. Judging by the comments though it's obvious there's a lot of people that are that feeble minded so maybe they're right. I just don't like to be lied to nor lumped in with the mutes who can't tell 2D life from 3D life. So it's one star for lying and one star for bad camera work and one star for the annoying narrator and one star for silly writing and one star for just being boring.",True
23,10,Chilling,emilie_frost,n/a,16/08/2025,Fascinating and chilling. Best documentary I have seen in a long time.,False
24,10,Just wow.,klaramarieclemmensen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Left me speechless afterwards. This is one of those times where reality is crazier than fiction. I don't wanna spoil anything, but if you wanna see a spy, in action with hidden cameras infiltrating one of the most closed of countries in the world, then this is for you.",False
25,10,A Fantastic and dangerous effort!,MrMoovie,n/a,16/08/2025,The Mole and Mr James. Talk about keeping your cool!!! Easily 2 of the most confident guys in the world. Mixing with some of the world's most powerful and corrupt individuals and filming it the entire time. My heart was in my mouth for almost 2 hours straight. Loved how Mr James part in the documentary organically took a path of it's own. Easily one of the best documentaries ever made and a monumental 10 year effort by all!,False

1,10,"Beautiful cinematography, compelling documentary with solutions on how to live with fire",ralph-56787,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every summer we see big wildfires burning in the West, and communities deeply impacted.We are told that the problem is in the forest, and that we need to do more to manage our forest. Or we are told we just need more air tanker and firefighters to put out the fires.I wonder is this even possible? How are the forests doing after fire? What does the best available research tell us about what works to keep homes and communities safe? What do I need to do to keep my insurance? How do we live with more fire on the land? What can I do to protect my home? How is changing weather driving big fires?Elemental answers all of my questions and more. I gave me a deeper understanding of fire and hope about what I could do to better prepare my home for fire.This beautiful film is good medicine for the West, as clearly explains what we can all do right now to support our firefighters and protect our communities.",False
2,5,A massive blind spot,sladler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Features harrowing firsthand accounts and footage of what it's like to be caught in a wildfire, and a bunch of beautifully stark aerial shots.The movie was mostly scientifically rigorous with no shortage of expert interviews, although some of these were a little dry or repetitive. Indigenous tribes are heavily featured in the less scientifically rigorous portions.There is one massive blindspot - the film doesn't once mention the widespread impact wildfires have on air quality. Maybe because this would go against the film's 'wildfires are actually good' narrative? Estimates sadly peg premature deaths caused by wildfire smoke particulates at 3000-9000 per year in the US - far more than are killed by heat or flames. How can a documentary on learning to live with wildfires not address this?",False

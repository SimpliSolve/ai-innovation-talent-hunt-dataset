1,10,A Beautiful and meaningful Documentary,rickyroee,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a surprisingly meaningful and artful personal documentary. The way it was put together is outstanding. It is unique because it feels like life. Taking you from the painful things to the joyous things and back again. All the stuff we leave behind and that live on past us. I have never seen that captured in quite this way. It made me think about a lot of things and made me want to call my mother!I laughed and cried many times. Sometimes both at the same time!The film goes by fast but it is a very enjoyable warm loving watch. Thank you to the filmmakers for helping me think about my own losses and stuff and all the love Along the way.,False
2,5,Coulda been better,holarsch,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile this documentary had an interesting theme and their were many many emotional moments, it didn't deliver all that I had expected when I first started watching it. The initial scenes and flashbacks gave a nice background into the cinematographer's mother, father, and the fil maker. However, in spite of the emotional flashbacks it starts to get tedious and repetitive. Was there no editor who could have done lots of selective elimination of many many unnecessary segments. I was left with the feeling that this adopted little child was going to wind up with more emotional issues than she or her mother ever presented with. I see the entire film as a looming tragedy that might have presented in an Ancient Greek Tragedy. The original idea went off the tracks and tedium dominated.",True

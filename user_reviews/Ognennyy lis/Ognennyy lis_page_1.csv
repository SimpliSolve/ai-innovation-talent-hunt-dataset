1,10,Fascinating,straycat-m,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film is magnificent! Amazing views of the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, the nature of Kamchatka and unique documentary filming that lasted almost three years.It is impossible to stage the behavior of wild animals, so the story is authentic and very beautiful. The main characters do not act - they live.The film can be watched without knowing Russian - the love story of a brave fox named Veter (Wind) and his girlfriend, a fox named Lava, is understandable without words. You will certainly worry about the fate of the fox cubs and the whole family. An hour and a half flies by - you just enjoy the natural beauty of Kamchatka and watch its inhabitants.",True
2,9,"Just life, as it is",cholmony,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Fire Fox"" is a call to preserve wildlife. Through the story of foxes (and not only them), the fragility of the balance of ecosystems is vividly apparent.The filmmakers, Dmitry and Anna Shpilenok, spent three years in the harsh conditions of Kamchatka and captured several hundred hours of footages. They observed foxes, bears, and other inhabitants of the reserve using long-focus optics, drones, and camera traps, regardless of weather conditions. All movements, sounds, and physics of events in the film have been preserved. The movie features drone aerial shots, macro shots of fox fur, blizzards, close-ups of autumn landscapes, and much more.Initially, it was assumed that another pair of foxes would be the protagonists. After all, it's commonly believed that only the strongest animals survive and reproduce in the wild. But while humans make assumptions, nature has its own plans, and the story of these two foxes unfolds somewhat differently from what most of us might expect.The slender, timid fox named Wind (indeed, he's like ""wind"") will end up alone but will still survive, grow up, start a family, and leave behind offspring. Why? Perhaps there were no other foxes around? Maybe Wind had a unique scent? Or maybe he knew some beautiful calming signals unknown to other males? It remains a mystery.The story is told in the first person, through the protagonist's monologue, without excessive infantilism or distortion. Kamchatka foxes exhibit complex patterns of behavior and survival. For instance, a fox den like the one shown in this film cannot be seen anywhere else: with elevation changes, labyrinths, varying widths, and depths. When a bear tries to reach the fox, the fox retreats slightly, teasing him-never running away but staying just out of reach, forcing the bear to dig, search, and eventually tire and leave.The Kamchatka landscape, which is portrayed as an integral character in the film, is depicted with striking honesty and sharpness. Together with changing weather, wind, and seasons, there's a sense of complete immersion, even in 2D. This feeling is particularly strong when watching on a big screen.The film will be valuable for anyone studying or loving foxes, canines, bears, birds (or simply wildlife). The body language of the animals is captured logically and flawlessly. Zero embellishments. Just life, as it is.",False

1,8,Entertaining but egotistical,wxprdhz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Serene Williams is, undoubtedly, one of the best to have ever played tennis. Sone might it's warranted for her to say, in effect, the only person that can beat me is me. However, at times she seems almost disrespectful to those players who have faced her. If she ever loses it's because of illness, injury etc (for example, losing to Sharapova at Wimbledon is given scant mention) but there are players who could and did beat her, admittedly it was rare, but at times it feels they were regarded with little respect (it was because she was playing poorly for sone reason and not because her opponent was simply better on that day). Still, that's just my perspective and in no way diminishes her exceptional achievements or exceptional talent.",False
2,10,A True Icon,vinerjay,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely floored at anyone who thinks this documentary isn't magnificent. The story Serena's come up, the emotional toil of having to accept defeating your best sister and best friend in the biggest moments of your career and overcoming tragedy while becoming the most iconic female athlete of all time is truly a pleasure to watch.All Millennial viewers will appreciate the time capsule clips that contain Stuart Scott and Linda Cohn, which represents the golden era of ESPN at a time when sports media was launching into 24/7 content coverage that sports fan's consume today.Ultimately, anyone that find this documentary to be anything other than beautiful is choosing to not appreciate the greatness of what this truly is: a phenomenal sport's documentary that highlights the career of one of the top five athletes of the 21st century.",False

1,8,It's a good story and well directed,Erik_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't know anything about the guy that founded the music school that this is about. It seems the guy has changed the lives of some people from Afghanistan, for the better.It seems a bit exploitive, but that isn't always a net negative. The documentary is well done and entertaining.What was most shocking was seeing kids wearing masks, after everything they already suffered. These kids were the lucky ones that made it out of Afghanistan. After what Joe Biden did, these kids still had to suffer political tyranny from Western countries.As far as the music is concerned; it sounded good. I don't know how talented the group really is in comparison to other professionals, but that isn't was the movie was about, anyway.They were able to escape, make music, and survive.",False
2,9,Communication issue,luismcdbrito,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of the main characteristics of human kind is his social nature and the ability to express communication in different forms.In this documentary we see shortly that the people in charge in Afghanistan are engaging in a total blockage of communication, all ways for peace and shared power.This blockage could be made to avoid outburst on order but it reveals an inability to understand communication through sounds.Inferior humans controlling the majority.The next step of human evolution depends on how we evolve our communication skills and GOD didn't guide us into this power sickness:
""If you are hit on the left face offer the other"".This is not a submission or forgiveness.The words are to guide.Don't hate and your road to peace will be easier.",False

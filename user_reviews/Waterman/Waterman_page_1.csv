1,9,Emotional and Inspiring!,inkleybritton,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am not a familiar with the surfer life. I am mountain man through and through, yet Waterman tells the compelling story of the surfer icon Duke Kahanamoku that makes you want to pick up surfing as a hobby. This documentary touches on Duke's humble and loving character and how embodied the spirit of Aloha.After the film was finished, I was able to meet with director Isaac Halasima and ask him a few questions about the movie. His main goal of this documentary was to inspire others to achieve their aspirations and never give up on them just as Duke did. Duke in a lot of ways was Hawaii's Superman. So Isaac made sure to depict him in some of the shots like Zach Snyder does so perfect in Man of Steel.It was a very nice and emotional experience and I highly recommend this documentary!",False
2,10,Duke's Rise To Glory,timeblank,n/a,15/08/2025,"In Hawaii, I see Duke Kahanamoku's Statues in Waikiki and across the islands. I knew he was a legendary surfer, however I was thrilled to hear his story on how he rose to glory and how his aloha spirit shined on for many years after his death.Jason Mamoa did an excellent job with the narration of Waterman. It is unfair to see Duke going through race segregation and financial issues. But seeing his resilience and love, made me like Duke even more. Especially how he rescued 8 people from a capsized boat and to his surprise he was loved by Hawaii and the world. What an honor to see his legacy of surfing and aloha live on. Great documentary movie!",False

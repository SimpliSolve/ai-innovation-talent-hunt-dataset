1,7,Boris Becker Thrives When He Survives,KinoBuff2021,n/a,17/08/2025,"This two-part series adds more to Boris Becker and his almost never-ending scandalous life as perspectives from him and those around him add their views on Boris' life. Its a bit cinematic as it retains a mix of interviews, archival footage, and fantasy-like breaks in time.Its pretty good. Boris is shown as someone in a battle against the world even when things were presumably going his way. Elements of spaghetti westerns such music, screen titles, and camera shots are used throughout the film(s). Blues music specifically, the song ""Boom Boom"" by John Lee Hooker adds character to Boris' tales of survival on and off the court.If you love tennis the many faces and references will make you feel your at home. If you are more unfamiliar with tennis (like myself) this doc provides enough drama and explanation of details that you will feel more than welcome to sit back and watch the life of a legend. Either way give it a watch.",False
2,10,An insightful examination of the psychology of tennis and life,rebutler-78525,n/a,17/08/2025,"This captivating film takes a deep look at the life and career of Boris Becker... his meteoric career and successes, and his downfall. It is a psychological analysis of what it takes to be a champion, and how those very characteristics that can lead to greatness in sports, and the public adulation that comes from that greatness, can lead to a life filled with challenges, struggles and hardship. A great film for tennis fans, but also fascinating for those interested in examining the human condition.Boris made a lot of mistakes in his life, but part of his charm is that he accepts these poor choices and recounts how he has learned from them. The Director, writer and narrator, Alex Gibney, acknowledges that not all of Boris' accounts should be accepted at face value. But you get the sense that Boris is a good person, who is trying to make sense of his failures, and striving to learn from them. Highly recommend!",False

This well-crafted and engaging series provides an insightful look into the life and career of this outgoing yet enigmatic sports personality, who was famously coached by the legendary Ion Tiriac.One of the standout features of this documentary is its overall tone.

4,10,"Great sports documentary, teaches a lot about life",fboom-02083,n/a,17/08/2025,"Everyone makes mistakes, if anyone says no it would be a plain lie. Boris Becker was the most popular Tennis player and arguably the most popular sportsman in the world at a time in late 80s. His craze was extraordinary and talent unbelievable. He inspired countless future champions to take up Tennis as a profession, his story was made for a super dramatic movie. The best part of the documentary is that it doesn't try to glorify Becker, it doesn't want to prove Becker a great guy with no faults of his own. It takes both the negatives and positives in consideration and sew everything into a great story being told. It may inspire you, make you learn about what not to do and what to do, it surely can entertain you. It is surely one of the greatest documentaries and human stories ever told.",False
5,10,A likeable dodgy geezer with a heart of gold?,anxiousgayhorseonketamine,n/a,17/08/2025,"Watched boom boom last night and I was a fan of Boris Becker before but now I simply worship him.The way the documentary is put together is really totally brilliant it shows all the comedic facets of the tennis player ; especially off court.His life is a really quality soap opera with many characters starts with Romanian gangster-looking Ion Tiriac who might be straight as an arrow but has that look about him of a guy you would not want to mess around with. His first wife Barbara stupendously beautiful elegant classy and walked away with $14 million of his money and now lives the life of Riley/Rilette in Florida you can really feel that the love between these two will never go away; but then as a bit of R&R Boris in his infinite wisdom decided to go and fertilise a Russian waitress in a ; wait for this; Japanese restaurant in London named Nobu you really could not make this stuff up apparently he only had one session in a cupboard although he says it was not a cupboard but clearly it probably was a cupboard and she got in touch with him eight months later to say guess who's going to be a daddy again?? You could not script this stuff and get away with it...But when Boris is around totally feasible a bit like the Boris around the UK for awhile maybe there is something in the name Boris which gives you carte blanche to act as a clown and entertainer wherever you are.Then he took with a I think American woman who had more curves than Nurburgring Nordschleife and Interlagos combinedyou do not get to see her interviewed in this documentary we do get to see a lot of Barbara who is extremely loquacious About her former husband and father of her children and gives insights practically as informative as what Boris can provide us withThere are other ancillary characters like Nick Bollettieri who sadly passed away recently and is credited at the end of the filmThe entire story of the two court cases the one in Germany where they did try to bang him up for 3 1/2 years and the one in the UK where he finally got given two years in 2022 served eight months and he's now back in Munich are to my way of seeing things a massive blot on the collective of the Western nations.This man provided us with so much joy for so long starting in 1985 going all the way into the 90s it seems very very petty to hassle him over what is really in today's money a petty amount petty amounts nothing like what the real gangsters of Finance steal from us year in year out .... and get away withAlready had the example of Björn Borg who could never transfer from being a tennis star to being a citizen with businesses he had no idea how to run; so now if you add Boris to this story you already have all the elements to educate those future champions and to make sure number one they do not go off the rails once they finished their careers in their mid20s who else finishes a career in their mid 20s nobody is who and also to ensure that their financial matters are dealt with by people who are not there to rip them off which is clearly what happened here the man clearly has a heart of gold would give you the shirt off his back and yes you can see that he has a twisted side : the coughing technique he developed when playing against John McEnroe tells us that although he does pretend to be quite the angel Boris is everything but and basically somebody who could come up with trickery to capsize John McEnroe could run a few circles around a few people any day of the week and did quite clearly ....I would not be surprised if he still had millions stashed away somewhere that nobody knows about but maybe not; in any case and I will reiterate this I think society cannot apply the rules of the normal citizen onto somebody who left school at 15 to become a worldwide icon well away from the normal lives of normal citizens and then turn round later on in their 30s 50s and 60s and expect them to be just like you and I and Ronald Belcher three doors away from your abode ... not a serious way to deal with folks who entertained you until you cried and laughed ,,,, as i said earlier : pettyThis Documentary excellently made humorous almost all the time the scenes connected with the Japanese restaurant and the images of food to express sexual desire were astounding highly highly recommended to lovers of the gameThere is much footage and interviews with Björn Borg as well who also made a pigs dinner of his earnings once he left the circuit they really are a pair of dimwits when taken off the court and quite frankly they do have a propensity for spending way beyond their means I think maybe Boris has now understood that time will tell but he really was living like an Oil Sheik without the means to back it up I seem to remember that Björn Borg did the same as well anyway a superb treat for sports lovers and people who simply like a good story.",False
6,2,extremely annoying & boring documentary by APPLE,sm-138,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's absolutely astonishing to me what kind of poorly produced & executed documentary APPLE delivered with this production: full of cliches, poorly executed, full of annoying sequences. Maybe the worst is the mimicry by the sound department / music composers for this documentary of Ennio Morricone's so called The Spaghetti Westerns Music. I mean: come on - if you can't afford to buy the rights for the original tunes, for god sake don't deliver such a terrible ripp-off !The whole story-telling wrapped up around the ""high noon duellists"" idea is a complete cliche, and working really really BAD.I have much much more issues with this documentary, but before this will get too long, I wrap it up short ...I don't have anything to say here about the life of Boris Becker, but you won't find here anything new and enlightening what was not already covered by German boulevard / yellow press.Embarrassing product.",False
7,4,Very disappointing Show,Bfeins5110,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI did not learn anything new about Boris Becker and this series glorifies a once talented man who has turned into self pitying person who looks far older than his years. It shows how a someone with a limited education but extraordinary athletic skills can burn bright for a short period and then self destruct because of his limitations. He learned from
his advisors to move to Monaco from his homeland to escape from paying taxes. Twice he was caught by authorities for hiding assets, in the US and in the U. K. He was punished and instead of learning from these lessons he blames Celebrity rather than himself. A very sad story.",True

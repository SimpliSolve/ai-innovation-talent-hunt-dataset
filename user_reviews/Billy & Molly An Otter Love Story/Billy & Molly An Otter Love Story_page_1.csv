1,8,I never expected to care this much about an Otter!,abirzenith,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been an animal lover all my life, so when I saw the title I was immediately drawn to it. However, I was not expecting to be hit as hard as I was through this documentary.I have had many interactions with animals in my life, as someone who has worked as a rescuer for cats and dogs. So I could understand right away what Billy felt, even though he did not have the right training or knowledge, I KNEW what he felt right away. I could relate to the love, the dread that comes with loving an animal. Caring for it. Your life starts revolving around it. The documentary showcases the relationship between them masterfully.The cross between how you take care of a wild animal, and how much help you should really give them is a very complex question. This becomes a very important topic in the documentary as it goes on and in my opinion is a natural evolution any animal lover should have towards a semi-wild animal like this.Give it a watch, it is adorable, emotional and lovely.",False
2,9,Surprise hit! Beautifully shot and compelling true story.,athornell-00377,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do love most animals. Looking at them anyway. I would care for one under the right circumstances.Billy is the human. Molly is the otter.Billy cares for a young otter he names Molly. She grows dependent on him, and becomes friendly with him. She becomes independent and self sufficient over time.National Geographic is known for picturesque photography of wildlife and nature. Occasionally they produce wildlife films. I have seen a few. This ranks up there in their top 5 or 10.It may get a 10 from me if I feel compelled to watch again. I just finished watching it before writing this. It is very good. Great pacing, beautifully shot, almost each scene is a beautiful photo.Narrated well. The pacing is slow, but as soon as we see close ups of the otter, your joy and excitement will pick up.Billy, his wife, and the poor dog, who is starving for attention, are the supporting characters. You feel for Billy, but the main star is Mollie the otter.Again a surprise magical movie that is a documentary stylized as a story. Which it is. Enjoy. This is for all ages.",False
3,9,STUNNING AND REMARKABLE!!!,Sunsphxsuns,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Billy & Molly: An Otter Love Story,"" is arguably one of the most life-affirming films of 2024. Think of the Academy Award-winning documentary, ""My Octopus Teacher"" (2020), except one of the principal characters is a cuddly female Otter.In brief, Billy & Molly is a true story about a married, childless man, ""Billy,"" and the beautiful bond he develops with a young recently orphaned Otter, whom he names, ""Molly."" Billy's love for Molly grows nearly exponentially as the film unfolds. Some might say Billy is overly obsessed with Molly. But I think it's far bigger than that.Man and Nature have always shared a very dense and complex relationship, but Billy and Molly's connection is unusually pure and simple. Basically, Molly needs Billy to survive, yet, as their mutual trust develops, Billy suddenly discovers how much he actually needs Molly too. Their unique connection reflects a universal theme that surely will resonate with anyone who has a genuine respect and admiration for nature, and an understanding of our own important role as the default ""Custodians of Planet Earth.""To quote Charlie Hamilton James, the brilliant director and director of photography, ""We've got a happy story. My hope is that people walk out with a smile on their face, and they're enlightened in some way, and for a few brief moments in this current world, they can smile and be happy.""No spoilers here as usual, but I will reveal that Billy and Molly was filmed entirely in Scotland's Shetland Islands, and the striking cinematography is stunningly stark yet nakedly beautiful.",False
4,10,Amazing 10/10! Best Wildlife Documentary of 2024.,mdennis-64490,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely brilliant film, it had everything, warmth, tears, laughter and heart loving joy.From National Geographic and Silverback Films, Billy & Molly: An Otter Love Story is a heart-warming story of love between a wild otter and a man set in the remote Scottish islands of Shetland.The documentary follows Billy, a salt-of-the-earth philosopher and Molly, a half-drowned, starving young female otter that Billy stumbles on one rainy evening in the Scottish subarctic. From there, an unlikely relationship begins that eventually saves them both.The storyline with the wild & rough Shetland landscape and breathtaking wildlife cinematography, 'Billy & Molly' is one of the best wildlife films of 2024.Amazing 10/10!",False
5,10,The Unlikely Story of a Man Who Fathers a Wild Otter in the Lower Half of the Arctic.,gregorybmowery,n/a,16/08/2025,"BILLY & MOLLY is an enthralling documentary about the unlike relationship between a retired older man who is living in retirement the lower half of the Arctic of the Shetland Islands, who is out in his boat one day and comes across a young orphaned river otter. Within days, Billy finds the hungry, out-of-her depth river otter who is out of her depth in the larger Shetland Islands and the rough sea water nearby. He begins to feed her and a bond ensues. Narrated by Billy & his wife, we see the Molly as she comes of age and learn to depend on Billy. Molly has tapped into a source of profound emotional attachment for this enchanting creature. He eventually builds Molly a house. Then one day, a male Otter comes calling and Molly disappears. Somewhat dismayed Billy learns to accept her disappearance, until one day she returns and in need of some fatherly support. There is never a false step in this emotionally involving documentary, which shows three distinct species interacting, all of them emotionally stirring. Molly is a compellingly sweet-natured creature, playful, charming, and Billy becomes the father he never quite managed to be in life. This is story shows how we connect deeply with the creatures that we encounter in life. Molly is pure joy and you can see the profound affect she has on Billy's life. But Billy's generosity is compelling, as is his wife's. You will not soon forget this lovely film. Kudos to National Geographic and their partners for creating something so pure and and heart-expanding.",False
6,10,So heartwarming,mcguiremorgan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love otters. LOVE them. So when my friend told me about this movie, I cleared my schedule and watched it that same night. It is such a heartwarming story - so beautifully shot, and beautifully told. I cry at anything involving animals and this was no exception - I cried for basically the whole last hour. Mostly happy tears, but still, just be warned that you might need tissues. The cinematography alone deserves an award, the landscapes are incredible and the scenes captured are truly breathtaking. I've never been to that part of Scotland but I immediately want to plan a trip there. If I happen to meet and fall in love with an otter, then so be it!",False
7,10,A movie that's good for the soul,kismetkat,n/a,16/08/2025,"This lovingly shot documentary about a man who helps a young otter washed up on his boat ramp on Shetland Island is the most tranquil and beautiful movie experience I've ever had. Narrated by the couple who aided the otter, this film not only tells the story of two people and an adorable otter, it also showcases the stunning scenery of the Shetlands with superb cinematography. The score also deserves a mention.Watching this movie was a beautiful experience. I could feel peace and calm descend over me as I watched the narrative of Billy and Molly unfold. In these turbulent times this is the balm, the respite I needed.",False
8,6,"Beautiful Cinematography But it Highlights The Flaws of ""Animal Lovers""",williamstemarie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ugh, I know I'm going to sound like a total Scrooge here , but this kind of stuff kind of rubs me the wrong way. People like Billy become obsessed with animals for their own amusement and how they make them feel, and it doesn't serve the animal or the person very well. I am sure it strained his relationship with his wife. It seems the fricken dog or his wife wasn't good enough I guess. I give credit to his wife. She is a very understanding and patient woman to indulge in all this, and in my eyes she was the only one actually trying to do what was best for Molly. If you find yourself building otter homes, look within.",False
9,10,shetland in my heart...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter watching this flick , a meltdown of love between human and the wildlife wilderness of them treeless islands over there, just over the pond from my own coastal norwayi envy you a lot for having such nice surroundings, still living by the seaweed miself, being hunkered down by seagulls that took the coronapandemic to colonize my neighbouring islets, and i wish for all its worth that there had been an otter or two on my premises too...just to regulate the gulls abit.Its a film about a ''stranded'' otter that comes in touch with a stranded human, and like a swing with a wand makes him wake up by listening to the cry for help from the wild. I dont know which nouns, adjectives or verbs to use to utter my sheer delight watching this movie, its almost like a flood of tears bursting when watching the nature unfold like theyve managed in this outlet of pictorial beauty.So if your snot and tear switch easily toggles on , if your in love with the nature as a whole, or if youve just lost a dear pet (like ive just had) have a look at this 8th wonder of the world of wildlife, human interaction and some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world, bundled together with light ,dark and shadow, narrated in a most comfortingled way and without a nick of a brag, tuned in with a musical score that almost feels as natural as nature itself...and it all happens in natures own pace and speed...so thank you for sharing this otterfilled story, that made a grumpy old mans heart melt away. I cannot recommend this film enough.",True
10,10,"A wonderful, emotional and somewhat philosophical film",keller-20652,n/a,16/08/2025,"A mind craft of directing, underwater photography and a drone, in bright colors like Shetland has never seen before. Also the humans in the movie Billy and his wife, who are both also the narrators in the background of the events, with philosophical thoughts about life, love, the connection to the OTTER, Billy's devotion and tenderness, as that he never had children, heartwarming and heartbreaking in equal measure. This film deserves more nominations and exposure. Get the tissues ready. I personally empathized with Billy and his feeling of jealousy when Molly moved away from his grasp to hook up with a male OTTER. That's exactly how I felt with my cat, who disappeared for two days and broke my heart, until he came home.",False
11,3,"""Hallmark-y"" and that's notNotNOT",ablbodyed-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA compliment! I know I'm going against the grain here, but I found this manipulative and barely (just barely) avoiding sanctimony. I'll set the stage for my viewing this. It has been my queue for over two months and I had no expectations about it. I watch much too much TV: a part of which is at least three or four nature shows a week, and I am usually satisfied by them, and often moved to tears. I started to watch this and got about 10 minutes into it and asked myself ""Why am I watching this?"" So I came to this site and looked at the page for this, saw the incredibly high review numbers, read the headlines (I never read reviews before I watch something, so my response is genuine to me) and decided I needed to give this my time. I regret that decision. I found it cloying, annoying, and with a great deal of aren't-we-wonderfulness. The annoying part was Billy with his grinning face; the cloying was the narration; the aren't-we-wonderfulness was everything else. I gave it a three because of the cinematography which WAS nice. But then that brings up an issue that still bothers me. We are observers from the very beginning of the relationship: the crab-on-the-pier-is-more-work-than-it's-worth scene. I want to know how and why they got cameras and a whole production team to the Shetlands before they knew what the story was going to be. There's something dishonest about the whole thing. BTW: the dog was the best character in the film (and I'm a completely devoted car-person). I could imagine him thinking ""What about me? I'm smarted than that effing otter"". Anyway that's my take.",True
12,10,A delightful story!,dsuda-73903,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a wonderful story this was, I'm so glad I ran across this. Absolutely something that you can watch with your kids.This heartwarming story will take you on a journey of a lost otter, who finds a new friend. This was so wonderfully done, part documentary, and part story. No surprises, no ugliness, just pure joy.If this is what National Geographic looks like on Disney, I love it. I'm hoping that there's more stories like this that can come to light.Through the process, you also learn a bit about otters and realize that we should be soaking in the beauty of nature around us. Probably something that we forget, quite often given our hectic daily lives.",False
13,10,Perfect...almost,coffeegirljlh,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFollowing the life of a man and woman with a dog that move to Shetland Islands in Scotland who meet a new friend that becomes family.This is such a fantastically made documentary with great story and filming. It hits all the feels in you and leaves you satisfied but wanting more at the same time. Molly was so lucky to have Billy and Susan help her out in her early life so that she got a better chance to survive. It's pretty clear that she didn't have the best chance of survival on her own.I wish it were longer and showed more of Jade as well. I hope there's another one made to update Mollys life as well as Billy, Susan and Jade through the years, that would be perfect.",True
14,10,Absolutely beautiful and heartwarming,parkerhollander,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWow, this movie was beautiful. This is the first time I have cried in over 10 years.This movie is a heartwarming tale of a man befriending a wild animal. Billy is a gentle soul who finds a sweet otter who needs his help. Billy quickly befriends the otter and names her Molly. We see Billy and Molly bond, but Billy takes the responsible approach of teaching her to fend for herself. Molly becomes reliant but still keeps her bond with Billy. Billy clearly thinks of her as part of the family and raises her like a daughter. He has to walk the thin line of teaching self reliance but also wants to shelter her from the cruel world. He does a wonderful job raising her and teaching her to be a strong, independent creature who still has a playful soul.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs an uplifting tale.",True
15,8,Billy & Molly: A Heartwarming Tale of Otter Love,markthepig-94874,n/a,16/08/2025,"Billy & Molly: An Otter Love Story is a beautifully crafted film that captures the essence of love, loss, and the enduring bond between two creatures.The cinematography is breathtaking, with slow-motion shots that showcase the serene beauty of their natural surroundings. The film's visuals are a feast for the eyes.The story is both heartwarming and poignant, exploring themes of love, loss, and the importance of letting go.

16,10,A love story and it was simply beautiful,wwtpjspz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've been dying to watch this been checking for ages, and it was supposed to be on Disney according to google search but it kept saying not in your region. If from UK? Anyway I got hold of it *wink*
I will purchase it when available though.What an absolutely beautiful film, what a beautiful kind couple Billy & Susan are one in a million.We loved the friendship you had ' you needed her as much as she needed you' everything happens for a reason.

17,10,This is the SWEETEST documentary!!,ChristyGuinn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh my, this was just the sweetest!! If you need a break from the chaos that is our world, grab a tissue and give this a watch. Aside from Billy living in an absolutely amazing place (albeit wet and cold) with picturesque views and wildlife he has a very sweet and understanding wife. He is the kindest of men I swear. Always knew he had a wee hole in his heart, but I bet he never believed it would be a baby otter who filled it. In a world where things seem to be falling apart daily, where we see so much disgust and hate for our fellow humans and of course animals, this is a much needed ray of sunshine, hope, love and understanding. I'm so glad I stopped to give this a shot. I laughed and cried. You can feel the love these two had for one another, Mary being so supportive and patient with her husband. The respect they have for one another as well as animals was beautiful to see. I loved this.",False
18,4,"Painful, Horrible, but Visually Beautiful Slog",Erik_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"Completely and totally amazingly and beautifully shot. This story is told not by the narration, but by the videographers. They told the story.The story is a story of an insane couple living in the Shetland Islands who have little respect or understanding for wildlife, but they try. They do whatever makes them happy and feel good. It's the same story of every wacko ""Nature Activist"" that's ever lived, except these people don't care to push their insanity on others; they were likely approached by the wackos, and then NatGeo saw dollar signs.Yes, it took me a very long time to finish this documentary, but I survived it, eventually.If you are in the mood for watching the domestication of wildlife by ignorant old people, you will love this. I have to admit, watching this kind of destruction for the beniget of selfish human emotion, is a little bit entertaining.",False
19,10,Beautifully shot family film,leighmpepin,n/a,16/08/2025,"The whole family loved this film. It's beautifully shot and a lovely story. Perfect for a cold, winter's night.As a Shetlander by birth it was so lovely to see the island brought to the big screen in such a loving way. The cinematography was also excellent and the shots of the sky and the water are stunning.The main star is of course the otter and it was nice to see so many great shots as well as to understand more about one of our native animals.Overall, it's nice to think that you can make a loving, heart warming film like this about a simple story that the whole family can enjoy together.",False

22,9,Absolutely adored Billy and Molly: A layered story of animal-human connection,lindsay-krassnitzer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was a beautiful film, in so many ways. Of course the scenery of the Shetland Islands is utterly stunning. The titular Otter - Molly - is just adorable. The bond between the slightly gruff middle-aged Billy and the adorable Molly is super-sweet and tugs the heartstrings.*** SPOILERS AHEAD***But the interesting aspects of the film for me that elevated it beyond cute, were two-fold. The first being the point where Billy realises that too much human intervention is not a good thing and Molly needs to learn to be an independent otter or she'll come to harm, resulting in him changing tack, pulling back a bit and teaching her independence skills. This was wonderful self-awareness and putting the needs of the ultimately wild animal first.Inextricably linked to the first aspect, the second interesting aspect was the realisation in Billy that his relationship with Molly was filling a need in him that he was previously unaware of. That being the need to nurture and selflessly care for another. And he realises that he needs Molly more than Molly needs him. He realises that he's been using Molly to fill this emotional need in him and this is a profound moment where he recognises he needs to take a step back for both of their benefit.Watching the relationship unfold, evolve, mature with reflection and self-awareness rather than Billy making this adorable animal a dependent part-domesticated pet was a wonderful aspect of the movie. It's unclear whether Molly continues to visit Billy from time to time but I hope she does, maintaining her little safe house when she needs it.A glorious docu-movie, well worth watching.",True
23,9,Where in Shetland,ronnyblotty,n/a,16/08/2025,"I lived in Shetland for 17 years, when watching I was trying to make out where in Shetland, Im wondering if its Whalsay or Walls. Iv been looking up but it wont show where location in Shetland. Only 2 weeks ago jan Bevington died , the owner of The Seal Sanctury in Hillswick, the most notherly part of Shetland, and the most northly pub in UK.

24,10,"A Heartfelt Tale of Love, Nature, and Letting Go",gmxvspp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Billy and Molly is a tender and visually stunning story that feels both intimate and universal. This heartwarming tale of an older couple finding an unexpected connection with nature touches on themes of compassion, resilience, and the delicate balance between nurturing and letting go.The story unfolds on the ruggedly beautiful coast of Northern England, where Billy and Molly have moved to embrace a quieter life by the sea. Their peaceful routine is interrupted when an abandoned, malnourished otter appears on their dock. What follows is Billy's quiet yet determined effort to nurse the creature back to health with love, care, and resourcefulness. The film takes us on a journey of patient, responsible stewardship, as Billy remains mindful that his ultimate goal is the otter's independence in the wild.Visually, the film is nothing short of breathtaking. Sweeping shots of the coastline, shimmering ocean waves, and serene landscapes are seamlessly woven with charming, playful footage of the otter. The cinematography captures the raw beauty of nature, immersing the viewer in the couple's world and emphasizing the powerful bond between humans and wildlife.What truly elevates Billy and Molly is the poignant narration by Molly, the wife, who brings the story to life with her gentle, honest perspective. Her voice carries warmth and wisdom, narrating the events with a balance of love and realism. Her words mirror the emotional journey of the couple-joy in small victories, heartache in moments of struggle, and deep respect for the otter's wild spirit.The film's pacing mirrors the rhythm of life by the sea-unhurried yet purposeful. This gives the viewer time to savor its beauty while reflecting on its deeper messages. The story never veers into sentimentality, grounding its emotional core in authenticity and respect for the natural world.Billy and Molly is a cinematic gem, blending stunning visuals with heartfelt storytelling. It serves as a poignant reminder of the connections we share with the world around us and the selfless acts of love that allow those we care for to thrive independently. A must-watch for nature lovers, animal enthusiasts, and anyone who believes in the quiet power of compassion.",False

1,10,Beautiful Film,sandrasweeney-87702,n/a,16/08/2025,The stories of the three players after they retired is beautifully told and Local Heroes is a very moving film. I highly recommend watching and the setting of the film using music and news from the 1970's works very well and remind you on just what a different world we live in today and how footballers back then had very different motivations to making it in the professional game. The production goes deep into the lives of the players who have told their stories with an honesty you don't see if documentaries about players today which makes a very refreshing change and makes you very nostalgic for the game as it once was. Well done to all concerned in making this.,False
2,9,Local Heroes telling their story - and what a story,Jamonfirst,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough I've lived in Nottingham for over 30 years, I'm not originally from the area or a massive Forest or even football fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Viv, Garry and Tony come across as lovely down to earth people, all with glints in their eyes, even in sometimes difficult days. Great to see Martin O' Neill and Kevin Keegan too, could listen to them for hours.And of course the back drop is Forest in the late 70's, Cloughy and the rise from the second division to winning the European Cup. Boys own stuff.Very well put together and gripped me throughout, a combination of local interest, nostalgic memories, human drama and footballing feats that likely won't ever be repeated.Well done John Warrington.",True

1,9,Harrowing,MikeyB1793,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary about a 13 year old girl who was gang-raped by three men.The father wants to have legal action against the rapists who live in the same village. Most in the villagers are opposed to this - and do not want to have outside investigators involved. Their solution is for the girl to marry one of the rapists and get on with her life. Such is the moral code in rural India.The girl and her family are having none of this and get assistance from a gender rights group in India. They pursue the case and assist the family in getting legal processes against the three rapists. Eventually they do succeed, despite many obstacles in the girl's community.This is harrowing film showing us the many road-blocks that exist in India for gender equality.",False
2,9,Needs to be seen,isaacsundaralingam,n/a,16/08/2025,"We've seen people lose their minds over the term 'rape culture'. Most question how there could ever be a culture where rape isn't frowned upon. 'Does anyone really think rape is okay? People just exaggerate' they say. Well, Nisha Pahuja's ""To Kill a Tiger"" single-handedly shuts that question down with a thoroughly documented case of an entire culture's willful obliviousness to rape.Powerful and unrelenting in its messaging, the movie follows the case of a father seeking justice for the gang rape of his 13-year old daughter - a rather unique situation where a father in rural India is willing to stand by his daughter's search for justice, instead of marrying her off to one of her three rapists (as we're told, is custom in the village). Not only does it lay bare the mental and societal toll on the family having to fight against their own townsfolk, but it also highlights the dire need for education and societal change.It is a movie that tackles that which we know to be obvious and drills it further into our heads as to why it needs to be obvious in contrast to the many who don't think it so. Intense, resolute and most importantly educational, ""To Kill a Tiger"" is a documentary that needs to be seen by as many people as possible.",False
3,8,"Important doc, nuff said",jordondave-28085,n/a,16/08/2025,"(2022) To Kill A Tiger
(In Bengali with English subtitles)
DOCUMENTARYI've seen brief descriptions about the protests that occurred as a result of assaults that were happening all over India on news stations and so forth, but this documentary provides the full gist of the event that triggered it! On April 9, 2017 three young men, Kapil Munda, Iswar Munda and Lungru Munda of a single village gang raped a 13 year old underage girl, Kiran. Because the village itself was ""impoverished""- impoverished in terms of uneducated, the custom that used to happen if a young girl was raped is the perfect example of 'victim blaming' that she was bringing shame to her family, and that both the daughter and her father be been blamed for allowing the rape to happen in the first place. In the old ways, the way impoverished villagers used to handle it if a young lady were to be assaulted or raped, is that that victim herself would have to be married away to her rapist, since she would either be defined as marked by that person or that she was chosen (whatever that means). ""Let us villagers handle this!"" many of the them have said, ""Why invite outsiders or city police authorities into our problems!"". This is the old type of thinking mentality this small village of Bero, Jharkhand have reacted. As a matter of fact, majority of the victim's neighbors felt so threatened by this kind of exposure that both the father, Ranjit; the mother, Jaganti, and their 13 year old daughter, Karim lives were eventually threatened when actual charges were brought to the perpetrators. The villagers then attempt to discourage the film maker, Nisha Pahujato by means of threats, all she wanted to do was document the entire course of events, showcasing the toll and peer pressure that occurred if the father pursued charges in the city. So much so, Nisha Pahuja was unable to film in the very village that it happened anymore as she had to consider first her personal safety. Ranjit's daughter, Karim herself even had to stay and live with the lady who was documenting her, which was how loud the uproar became. It had pointed toward the end how many unreported assaults that happen in India, part of the reason why this documentary is so important.",False
4,10,Incredible and uplifting story about fighting for justice,achillesperry,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film treats a horribly tragic subject with honesty and respect. It is remarkable that the filmmakers just happened to be there on the day the original rape occurred. But it was a stroke of brilliance that cause them to follow the story closely for many years. What an incredible tale of an unimaginably determined girl and her family, seemingly battling all of India to get justice.Some people may dread the idea of a film that starts with the rape of a 13 year old girl. And I understand that. I had trepidations. But I marveled at how the Nisha Patel managed to turn a tragic story into one of empowerment and hope. This is a must-see.",True
5,8,Bravery Amidst Silence: Confronting Injustice and Societal Complicity in To Kill a Tiger,ciniro,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching 'To Kill a Tiger,' I am both moved and outraged. The documentary showcases not just the bravery and persistence of Ranjit and his family in seeking justice but also casts a harsh light on the broader failings of Indian society and its political framework. It is distressing to see a community and its leaders perpetuate and condone such regressive attitudes towards sexual assault, prioritizing reputation over human dignity and justice. The film does an exemplary job of laying bare the systemic issues that allow such injustices to persist, questioning the role of societal norms and political complicity in the oppression of the vulnerable. While it is a tribute to one family's unyielding spirit, it also serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for cultural and political reforms in India. 'To Kill a Tiger' is not only a documentary; it's a call to action, challenging viewers to reflect on their own values and the societal structures that either uphold or undermine justice. Essential viewing for those who advocate for a more equitable and humane world.",False
6,n/a,This world has never been a safe place for women,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is so amazing and shows the reality of what's it like to be a victim and survivor of sexual violence. India needs to have a change in the way they think about victims and survivors of sexual violence. To blame a young child for what happened to her is disgusting and appaling. Men need to change. Men need to change everywhere but the sad thing is they won't and never will. They are disgusting and vile and need to be stopped. I am so proud of the the young girl in this documentary. She is so brave and courageous. I hope safety and and protection for her and her family. I hope she has a bright future.,False
7,7,Disturbing But Riveting,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"According to official estimates, a woman in India is raped every 20 minutes, and roughly 90% of those incidents go unreported, despite strengthened legal protections that have been put into place. Police investigations seldom achieve much, either, especially since residents in many communities (particularly in rural areas) prefer to handle such episodes among themselves without outside official intervention, a means to avoid bringing undue attention to such troubling circumstances and the attendant shame that accompanies them. However, in 2017 in eastern India, a courageous father whose 13-year-old daughter was brutally assaulted and subsequently beaten by three men chose to pursue the matter legally in court, despite opposition from village residents, who proposed that the young girl simply marry one of the rapists to dispense with the incident. Their inspiring journey in fighting back provides the basis for this Oscar-nominated documentary from writer-director Nisha Pahuja. It effectively chronicles their pursuit of justice despite these oppressive odds, including death threats and ongoing intimidation, as well as antagonism against the film crew in documenting this often-inflammatory tale. The film sensitively depicts how this experience personally affected father, daughter and the rest of their family as they held firm in their resolve to see their way through this painful ordeal. It also outlines the many uphill challenges they faced in combatting a convoluted, inept, excessively burdened bureaucracy and a range of archaic, widely sanctioned, misogynistic social conventions. Fortunately, they had ample support from organizations and individuals helping them to make their case, an effort that resulted in a landmark judicial decision with far-reaching implications that sent shockwaves throughout the country. The story is well told, despite a slight tendency to become somewhat redundant at times in the picture's second half. That aside, though, ""To Kill a Tiger"" is a riveting yet disturbing release that shines an exceedingly bright light on a troubling issue, one that's raised early on in the film in a news report sound bite about this incident in which the narrator rhetorically poses the question, ""Is there something innately wrong with this country?"" That's a powerful observation about a potently alarming subject, one that's raised to a new level of awareness by this formidable cinematic release, currently available for streaming on Netflix.",False
8,8,"An important issue, but I wonder about documentary ethics",steiner-sam,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a documentary on the pursuit of justice for the gang rape of a 13-year-girl in rural Jharkhand, India in 2017. It follows the efforts of Kiran's (a pseudonym) father, Ranjit, to pursue a criminal conviction of the three local teenagers who raped her, including her first cousin. The family receives considerable support from the Srijan Foundation, a non-profit NGO established in 2001 to work directly with local communities on poverty and gender justice. The Foundation appeared to facilitate the remarkable filming by Nisha Pajuja.What is most remarkable in the film is the scenes in which village members, both male and female, try to blame the victim and the victim's family and insist that Kiran should marry one of the rapists and that the village conflict should be settled within the village. The society's honor culture insists this is the only way to remove the ""stain"" on Kiran's family. Ranjit appears to waver under pressure from time to time. Still, Kiran's persistence and Srijan Foundation's encouragement allow what seems to be an apparent victory, though appeals of the verdict were still outstanding in 2022.""To Kill a Tiger"" presents an important issue. I do wonder about some documentary ethics. Did the villagers give informed consent to the filming of their sometimes inflammatory statements? What was the impact of the camera's presence on what people said? The village leader's comments after the conviction seemed made-for-camera. And we don't really know the long-term impact of Kiran's family after the cameras have left. These questions nag at me despite a powerful presentation.",False
9,10,Tremendous,declanrafferty-51673,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAbsolutely incredible journey of a girl that has been violently raped and a family willing to fight for justice no matter the consequences. As a father of girls how could you not feel for the family in such a harrowing situation. A dad (ranjit) fighting to keep a village from killing his family through various threats and a general culture of sexual violence against girls while fighting for his daughters life. He almost gives up half way due to the unbelievable pressure on his family's shoulders but his daughters courage spurs him on to the end. Not a perfect man but a good man. Many a person could learn the bravery and integrity of ranjit, his wife and his daughter.Tremendous.",True
10,9,A father's legal crusade to get justice for his daughter,madanmarwah,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie is set in a small sleepy village in Jharkhand near Ranchi. One morning the villagers wake up to the shocking news that a 13 year old girl of the village has been brutally raped by three boys of the village. The father who is a poor farmer decides to pursue the case legally to get justice for his daughter. Most of the villagers specially women folk want to hush up the case and get the girl married to one of the boys. This is however not acceptable to the girl, the mother and the father. A local NGO and the state agencies turn counselors and advisors.Director Nisha Pahuja has certainly made an outstanding documentary feature which missed getting an Oscar. The entire legal process of getting justice has many obstacles and the movie shows this with great detail and sensitivity. Through the many artistically framed close ups we get to see and feel the helplessness, anger and agony of the girl and her parents. There are many moving sequences particularly how she is made to memorise her statement by the father and the coolness with which she gets ready for the D day. Really some good story telling which keeps you riveted. The movie throws up some uncomfortable questions and tends to shake up the viewer.It is heartening to see that 26 producers ( including some well known celebrities) have chipped in to support this timely ,topical and Oscar worthy project which has a universal appeal. It needs to be seen by all.",False
11,8,Outstanding documentary on life in rural India,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""To Kill A Tiger"" (2022 release from India; 127 min) opens, we are introduced to Ranjit, a father living with his family in remote Jharkhand, India. We learn that his 13 yo daughter was raped by 3 young men, and at his daughter's urging, he decides to file a law suit against the 3 men. This leads to major tensions within the village... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: the horrible events took place in 2017, and then the film makers team up with the family and with a local women's rights nonprofit. This was filmed over a long, long time as the case worked itself through the Indian legal system. More importantly, we get great insight as to how the remote village where this happened reacts. Let's just say that this does not go well, and I'm being mild. I found myself astonished, if not infuriated, how the villagers act in all this, literally as if it is the 13 yo's fault for being raped. There are no words. Aside from the moral outrage, we get a true picture of what life in rural India is really like on a day-to-day basis. People living on scraps of food, and not knowing how they'll get by a week or a month from now. The MAGA extremists who can't stop whining and complaining on a daily basis how terrible life has become in the US should take a look at this movie, and then drop to their knees and thank their lucky stars they live here and how privileged they are to live here. All that aside, kudos to the 13 yo girl for her (and her parents') bravery to stand up, despite all of the pressures and barriers.""To Kill A Tiger"" premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival but it didn't get shown in the US until the summer of 2023, reason why it wasn't eligible for Best Documentary Oscar consideration until this most recently cycle. Indeed it was nominated. It's currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. ""To Kill A Tiger"" is now streaming on Netflix, where I caught it last night. If you have any interest what life in rural India is like, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
12,9,A harrowing view of societal power,kkmy-07184,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a very hard documentary to watch; the normalisation of gang rape within certain societies leaves you feeling very upset and frustrated - wanting to cry out and offer help.Following the burden that the family have to endure, and the repercussions they face by pursuing the case through a legal matter leaves you feeling hopeless. For anyone from a developed nation is left is shock that there are endless threats and fears that follow the victim and her family.It is a beautifully filmed and documented case of a truly awful situation. I watched the dubbed version, and the voice overs helped to capture the seriousness of the discussion, when they took place.You're left baffled after hearing certain opinions, and how they downplay what happened, and what the resolution is.Do not shy away from watching it - no matter how difficult it may become to watch. It is incredibly important to realise what happens in other parts of the world.I came out of the film feeling very ashamed of being of Indian descent - of it becoming a running joke amongst my friends of how Indians say hello with rape firstly, then a handshake second.",True
13,8,"Powerful Storytelling, Unspoken Truths",samabc-31952,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shocking statistics reveal that globally, 35% of women have faced sexual abuse, but only 40% seek help, and a mere 10% report to law enforcement. Moreover, 33% of women who are raped contemplate suicide. In the US, a rape occurs every 1-2 minutes, while in India, it happens every 18-20 minutes (Ref: worldpopulationreview)
The alarming reality is that most cases in India go unreported, masking the country's true magnitude of sexual crimes, including acid attacks, gang rapes, and rapes of minors. Recent heinous incidents, such as the rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl by 7 men, including a priest and police officers, and the gang rape and murder of a young woman from a lower caste, leave me wondering... How did I muster the courage to watch this film and review it? The stark truth is that India faces an epidemic of unspeakable crimes! And it is about time we confront this dark reality head-on.This film explores the issue of sexual violence in India, specifically the gang rape of a 13-year old young woman in the state of Jharkhand. The film follows the survivor's journey as she alongside her father navigates the legal system and seeks justice.The film also delves into the societal and cultural factors that contribute to sexual violence in India. Instead of recognizing that rape is always a fault of the perpetrator, and never the result of the victim's actions or characteristics, it is appalling that how victim-blaming mentality still serves to perpetuate rape culture and further traumatizes and silences the survivors.Simple yet powerful storytelling and poignant narrative! Tackling a delicate topic with compassion and care, the film sheds light on the heart-wrenching realities of sexual violence and its devastating impact on especially minor victims. It demands attention and action.Watch heart-wrenching, powerful Oscar-nominated documentary from India.",False
14,8,Very goid,maxswtldy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary follows the case of a 13 year old girl gang raped in her village. Her parents are in full support of her and want to get justice for their daughter being violated. It's important to note, a father's support in such cases is very far as women are held accountable for their own assaults. Such events bring shame and dishonor in her and her family. This father is rejecting old traditions and is fighting for his baby girl. It's harrowing to see them endure the lack of compassion from some of the people in their village. One particular older woman really is making my blood boil. She's HORRID!!!! I'm writing this review before it has even finished. She made me that mad.",True
15,10,Extraordinary doc,wisewebwoman,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt the end of this documentary, I wondered why it didn't get the Oscar.The film making is extraordinary on every level, telling this horrific story of the gang rape of a thirteen year old girl in India woth respect and care.Misogyny is a way of life in rural India and the condemnation of rape victims is par for the course. In fact rape victims are encouraged and urged to marry their rapists to protect their honour.Ranjit and his daughter Kiran fight for justice all the way to the courts in spite of threats from the villagers who side with the rapists.Ranjit's love for his daughter shines through, he supports her every inch of her steadfast and courageous way, the look in his eyes is heart breaking at times, he conveys so much devotion and respect, never doubting her for one minute.Co-incidentally, the film makers happened to be there at the time of this terrible act and were able to follow the story through from beginning to end over a period of years.Not to be missed. Uplifting in its final resolution and Kiran was so brave to come forward and reveal her identity to help others in her country who are cowed by the onslaught of further victimization.10/10.",True
16,10,Infuriating and gratifying at the same time,micahthebarber,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was amazing. To see a father AND MOTHER stand up for their 13 year old daughter after she was gang raped and made to feel as though she and the family had the burden of shame to wear instead of the rapists, by the community around her was absolutely mind blowing and infuriating. I found myself screaming at the tv. The ""leaders"" of the village the family lives in, should be fired and ran out of town. Along with anyone who thinks a 13 year old girl, asked for it, or anyone who thinks boys only attack/rape a girl bc the girl made him do it. This thinking is disgusting and the fact any of these people can think this is acceptable is truly unbelievable and unacceptable. ESPECIALLY someone who is supposed to look over the village. The two men in charge are every cuss word you can think of. I know I called them every thing I could think of. Back to the storyline, this story was very hard to watch but I'm so glad I did. I have always been so saddened by places who hold females with such little regard. This needs to change. This young lady and her family were so brave to come forward with this and fight against everyone and everything fighting against them. I absolutely recommend everyone watches this and I plan on looking up if there is anyway I can help this family or any other in need. They had to live in this community while being harassed. We need to help these people be relocated and with jobs so they don't have to endure this after they have been through so much already.",False
17,8,An eye opener about rural India over rape victims,UmeshAditya,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA very sensitive Oscar nominated documentary based on sexual gang rape violence on a 13 year old minor girl by a group of 3 grown up men in a village of a Jharkhand. This documentary will leave you shocked how the entire village thinks the girl has to marry one among the rapists and close the entire case without ever going to police. But as an unprecedented stand, the father and family stands as a support to the girl though entire family lives in extreme poverty. But entire village corners the family and mounts pressure to take back the case and when entire family gets into the fear, there comes a rural NGO as a support to the family guiding them. This is truly an eye opener on rural India's perspective on such cases. It's said every 20 minutes one girl gets raped in India and 90% of them don't even get reported. It leaves one contented to see how all 3 victims finally get penalized for 25 years each. Kudos to the entire team for this creation. Available in all languages in Netflix. But this could have been shorter. My ratings 8/10.",True

His decision to support his daughter is virtually unheard of, and his journey is unprecedented.The initial introduction already made my heart ache, and the father's initial testimony hurt so much. A painful documentary, men, and women too, not all, but the vast majority, think that if a woman is raped, she provoked it, and marrying him solves everything, honor, corrects the ""mistake"" of the ""boys"", disgusting.

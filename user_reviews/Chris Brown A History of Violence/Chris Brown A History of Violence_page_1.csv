1,1,Important topic. Sadly dishonored,bruscar,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThe topic that is addressed is incredibly important. Does Chris Brown deserved to be called out and arrested? Yes. Unequivocally? Hell yes. Is the topic something that needs a messenger, to drag us out of denial? YES! These are not the people to do it. Presented so poorly, I hope some one who works in the industry sees that and does it right. This was a movie that thought it was a TV show.Perhaps I would have given them a pass due to the vital subject matter, until they said that they were respecting Rihanna's privacy by not showing the photographs of her assault. Then in the next segment, suggested that people should Google it.That single sentence and it showed a vile disregard for the women whose unbelievable courage made them willing to publicly accuse their abuser. They used them and their pain, because it was for a good cause. Yes, the cause is good. You are not.",True
2,1,Racially Motivated and Flawed,baskinjason,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerInvestigation Discovery's Chris Brown documentary falls short of delivering a balanced, factual account and instead indulges in sensationalized storytelling. This production capitalizes on trauma, choosing emotional manipulation over objectivity. The filmmakers miss the opportunity to provide a nuanced perspective, compromising the documentary's credibility and its value as a serious piece of journalism.The documentary irresponsibly rehashes Chantel's 2019 allegations against Chris Brown, which were thoroughly debunked by credible outlets like Rolling Stone and TMZ. Miami Police and Ariel Mitchell, the accuser's own lawyer, confirmed there was no credible evidence to move forward with charges. Despite this, the documentary clings to these discredited claims, raising concerns about the motivations behind its creation.Baseless Accusations with No Court ProceedingsEven more troubling is the inclusion of other accusations that never made it to court due to a lack of evidence. The absence of any judicial follow-up on these accusations suggests they were deemed unworthy of prosecution. This key context is glaringly omitted, which not only distorts the narrative but also calls into question the documentary's intent.Selective Moral OutrageThe filmmakers go to great lengths to scrutinize Brown while ignoring similar allegations against other public figures. This selective moral outrage smacks of a deliberate agenda, rendering the documentary's moral position insincere and its messaging skewed. The decision to hyper-focus on Brown, while sidestepping similar or even more serious accusations against others, ultimately undermines the documentary's integrity.Documentary Shortcomings1. Lack of Context: The documentary glosses over Brown's artistic evolution, philanthropic work, and personal growth, focusing only on negative aspects.2. Sensationalism: Overly dramatic music and editing techniques are used to evoke emotional responses, further distorting the viewer's perspective.3. Cherry-Picked Facts: By presenting only select details that fit a specific narrative, the documentary misrepresents the full scope of Chris Brown's story.In conclusion, this documentary serves as a stark reminder of how modern media can manipulate narratives for views rather than truth. By choosing to overlook important facts and focus on debunked claims, it fails both as a work of journalism and as a balanced portrayal of its subject.",True
3,2,Child he told this story,romeovision2002,n/a,17/08/2025,"No shade! This story is not new. We have a whole felon in the biggest job on earth running a Nonblack house but here we go trying to continue to persecute Chris Brown! I am so tired of this narrative! I am surprised that the rating is as high as it is! Rihanna has forgiven him. They even had dates afterward. Let's face it. Chris Brown is a charmer! However, he is allowed redemption. How long must he be persecuted? It just gets annoying to see this narrative repeat and repeat continuously. I also hate how when the narrators talk like they were there. You were not there. You could do a whole story praising Chris Brown too! My hope is that the 19 year old Chris Brown has matured over 16 years since this happened! I really wish they would stop rehashing the narrative over and over again! This man has gone on to sell millions of records and has broken James Brown's records.",False
4,3,Lacking,codygdietrich,n/a,17/08/2025,"In this documentary where they claim it is up to the media to hold celebrities accountable and bring facts to light to prevent them from being treated differently they mention that Chris Brown did a tribute to Michael Jackson, commenting that they thought it was inappropriate for someone accused of domestic violence giving a tribute to the Prince of Pop never mentioning that Michael Jackson was accused of child molestation. The first time P Diddy is mentioned there is no reference to the video of him beating his girlfriend or that he was arrested for human trafficking, the second time he is mentioned there is a small comment made about it lasting no more than maybe 30 seconds. Where is the media calling out those celebrities as the documentary claims the media should be doing.The one anonymous accuser of Chris Brown was a part of the documentary. During that section they cite a report saying only 10% of sexual assault charges are false. I looked up that report, it is only discussing female reports of sexual assault at one college, very limited study. A report is considered false if after an investigation there is a lack of evidence it happened, or there is evidence the accuser is lying. The anonymous accuser on the documentary had the DA never fail charges against Chris Brown because of lack of evidence and her personal attorney for a civil lawsuit dropped her and her case after it was discovered she was withholding text messages she sent to Chris Brown saying she wanted to have a relationship with him. So there were two investigations that both ended at the same conclusion: there is inadequate evidence for it to hold up in court. That seems to be the very standard of the study as to what qualifies as a false accusation, can't be sure though since they cite the study and never explain it.Anything regarding sexual assault and domestic violence is a complex subject the understanding around which is still changing and developing. This documentary doesn't spend the time to discuss the details and criteria of the definitions and different studies and situations and making necessary connections. I don't feel sexual abuse and domestic violence is a subject a documentary should be made with unexplained facts and cliff notes, take the time to give the full details or don't bother.",False
5,10,Amazing Documentary,jayfromzeway,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerSPOILERS (although its all public information) This is the second documentary I am watching with Scaachi Koul and it was fantastic. I want to say that every review on here is most likely from the perspective or opinion of a fan. The facts are Chris Brown is a serial violent offender. He has money and thats why he isn't in jail for life. He also gaslights and manipulates the public into believing he is this sweet and innocent boy. He broke the window of his mom's car. He broke the window on Good Morning America and he also breaks many peoples faces. Anyway they highlight all these points in the documentary and also talk about how he isn't really remorseful of any of these actions. He goes on social media and defends or jokes about his actions. Don't be a sheep and accept him for who he is, a violent criminal.Lastly this documentary was not racially motivated as one suggests. In fact, most of the interviewed are BIPOC.",True
6,1,Domestic Violence is Serious - This is a Joke,bisstoo,n/a,17/08/2025,"The fact that they spent their time on this horrible documentary when he is at the height of his career speaks to the true intentions of the producers. Why didn't they spend time on Rhianna for her toxic and abusive behavior that started his downfall? He's already owned his. She hasn't admitted hers. She just cried victim although she was the instigator. This is why they don't take people seriously when they scream equality or abuse. He is at his prime. He's owned his mistakes. He's paid his debts. Move on. At this point, the only toxic people we see are the producers of this crazy film. Move on.",False
7,1,One sided,chosenone-12859,n/a,17/08/2025,"This movie is very one-sided, most of the witnesses they have seem really sketchy. This seems like a documentary just to sabotage his career because he is successful. These women here all seem like groupies. There's no backstory about what made him take these actions. No one just acts out for no reason, although that is no excuse. We need the whole story. This seems like a smear campaign. It was said that Brianna put hands on him first, although it is not OK for me to hit a woman this information should have been added because they are making it seem like he just started beating her for no reason. This seems like they are out to get Chris and this particular documentary. Very disappointing that people are putting this type of smear campaign out, shame on HBO Max.",False
8,1,"If this documentary was true, he would serve life in prison!",fatlumkabashi,n/a,17/08/2025,"If this documentary was true, he would serve life in prison. He had plenty years of probation which would automatically send him to prison.It's just accusations nothing else, he even sued some of the girls, some girls have been exposed lying by TMZ and his team.This just contains lies and the and goal is to make him look bad.Chris has moved on, with his kids and sells out arena's they try to get in between all of that and try to portray something his is not.There is worse people/celebrities out there that no one talks about it gets sweept under the rug.The inconsistency is absurd........",False
9,1,Unnecessary,melaniejakki,n/a,17/08/2025,"Just simply not needed.I feel like people know his story. He has been heavily criticised and even ban from countries and award shows and so on because of his history. Maybe they should do a documentary of the history of violence of politicians? People who have committed crimes yet have power in government.Also the information provided has been discredited already. So they're just repeating stuff that has been discredited, debunked, and disproven even in a court setting. Documentaries should be balanced, and if they present an accusation they should present all the proof that refutes the accusation. This Documentary doesn't. It's just biased and one sided.",False
10,2,Biased attempt,jozm-70746,n/a,17/08/2025,"There are two sides to every story. People can wake up and decide to find a way to destroy someone that's how evil the world is right now, the documentary is nothing but a biased attempt to ruin a young successful man, i hope everyone who watches this will see through it. It also got one to think that maybe the young man is about to be on something that the powers that be are actually not happy with. And if it's a blessing that he got be dragged to actually shine even more than they anticipated . Until then we got watch attempts like this ""documentary"" not only fail but expose intentions behind media.",False
11,10,Informative and Important,fionaalberici,n/a,17/08/2025,"Chris Brown is a man who should no longer have a career and yet is still selling out stadiums and possibly harming more people. After he beat Rhianna I knew I would never look at him the same. He is a hateful person who will apologize with no sincerity so that he can continue to make money and fuel his ego.I am happy this documentary exists so that more people can be reminded of who this man is. When someone shows you who they are believe them. He is a charming master manipulator and I hope this will help more people who are victims feels less alone, and hopefully protect people from him in the future.",False
12,1,Sonny Hostin production yuck.,Badlands1,n/a,17/08/2025,"The last half of this so-called documentary is a Sunny Hostin interview with all the other bitter, masculine ladies.

13,1,"Absolutely ridiculous ""docu""",menzolimbeek,n/a,17/08/2025,"A lot of black youth have had a run in with the law. But to make a whole documentary about it is just milking it way too far. This man's dedication has brought him to superstar level and he imploys and support so many others people. It's a multimillion dollar business he set up. Leave that man alone and his mistakes in the past. We all made mistakes and learned from it. This documentary, is ridiculous.A lot of black youth have had a run in with the law.

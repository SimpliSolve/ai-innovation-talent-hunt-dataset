Jon Stewart is incredible and John Feal is an incredible inspiration and an incredible person, they both are. I'm very glad I got the chance to see this. I had only heard bits and pieces about the situation in Congress before this and seen clips on YouTube. I'm not a New Yorker, but I thank the makers anyway for making this documentary and a very big thank you to any and all of the activists who help the 9/11 responders.",False

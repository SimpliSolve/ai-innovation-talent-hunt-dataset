1,7,the grinding gears of ACLU,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. The American Civil Liberties Union has been around since 1920. That's 100 years of striving to be the stewards of our nation's liberties. Eli B Despres, Josh Kriegman, and Elyse Steinberg are the three credited directors who bring us a behind-the-curtain look at the dedicated and hard-working ACLU attorneys in the New York office.The film picks up on January 27, 2017, just seven days after President Trump's inauguration and subsequent immigration order, also known as the ""Muslim ban."" We are shown a sea of volunteer attorneys set up to assist affected immigrants - especially those seeking asylum. The basic premise of the movie is to provide a glimpse of the challenges faced by the ACLU against the Trump administration.Since there have been approximately 140 lawsuits filed since this President took office, the filmmakers wisely focus on four specific cases, along with the assigned attorneys: Garza v Hargan, which involves the right to an abortion for an immigrant minor; Stone v Trump, the administrations military ban of transgenders; Department of Commerce v New York, dealing with the ""citizenship"" question proposed for the U.S. census; and Ms. L vs ICE, a family separation case tied to a child taken from her mother at the border.The cases are presented in an easy-to-follow manner, and we get to know each of the attorneys and their individual challenges, both with their specific case and their own personal or family life. Each of the attorneys provide their unique ""tour"" of the ACLU offices, and we quickly understand how they are focused on their own specialties, rather than the organization as a whole. One of them remarks that there are more tattoos and piercings present than at the DOJ, which underscores not just the age difference, but also the attitudes of these crusaders.A very brief history of the ACLU informs us that their mission dictates they support civil rights for all, which means not just the 1967 interracial marriage of Richard and Mildred Loving, but also the Charlottesville Rally which resulted in the death of Heather Heyer. In keeping with protecting 'everyone's rights', the organization has even defended the rights of Nazis. Still, it's obvious where the organization stands when Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court is discussed ... the attorneys admit it will make their jobs that much more difficult.Despite attorney Lee Gelernt's middle-age struggles with technology (somehow the dude can't keep his cell phone charged), the dedication and commitment of these folks is on full display (they even celebrate with ""train wine""). Court cases, by definition, have two sides, and since we aren't allowed in the actual courtroom to witness the cases being presented, this film focuses on one side. Because of that, it often plays like a fundraising or recruiting video for the ACLU. Still, the behind-the-scenes view of what these attorneys go through to fight for liberty is fascinating and worthwhile.",False
2,8,Heroes One and All...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,For as long as there's been injustice there's been incredible people fighting to right those wrongs and this is an excellent example of the brilliant folk at ACLU doing just that to get justice for all. Absolute heroes!,False
3,10,"A ""Must Watch"" for Everyone Who Cares About Civil Rights in America",dhubin,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an excellent documentary. It juggles masterfully four recent ACLU cases, never losing the narrative thread of any of them. It is an important documentary exploring in a serious way issues great significance. And it manages to do that with moments of humor and poignant emotion.",False
4,10,Amazing!,nnazsoysal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Such a powerful movie that really demonstrates the advocacy of the ACLU. It's well done, interesting, and super empowering. Definitely worth a watch.",False
5,10,So inspiring,annagdlf,n/a,15/08/2025,I already knew the work at the ACLU was important but this really confirmed that for me. Not only seeing the behind the scenes of all these major court cases but getting to see who it affects and the lives that were changed was incredible!,False
6,1,We'll See How Long This Lasts,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,15/08/2025,"An horrifically unfair and ridiculous telling of what they've pretended happened vs actual occurrences.Remember, the ACLU has also decided to stop fighting for the civil liberties of American women, it was only a matter of time before they stopped fighting for actual born/raised American citizens.This rubbish needs to finally face critical pushback and not just idolization from inside the echo chamber-this was not well done, well represented, or full of factual data to support frivolous claims - but because they've filled the virtue signaling bingo card- just look at these 8-10 star reviews pour in!!! I'm stunned it wasn't given an Oscar.",False
7,10,Amazing!,elisabethmurley,n/a,15/08/2025,It was incredible. The work of the lawyers and their colleagues truly inspired me.,False
8,1,Critical Reviews of this ACLU movie have been deleted numerous times.,Kamandi73,n/a,15/08/2025,"This review has been deleted nine times now. Several others critical of the ACLU's Fight movie have also been deleted. Only the reviews posted by their own employees are still active. Apparently criticism of bad ACLU propaganda movies are not allowed by Google, which owns IMDb.The Fight is a totally left-wing movie that does not even try to give any honest viewpoint to why the United States and all other nations have borders and immigration policies.Instead, the Fight advocates for open borders, and no control over who comes into the USA. This is a very dangerous and irresponsible point of view.",False
9,10,VIRTUE AND HONOR EEKS OUT VICTORY OVER IGNORANCE 1% for Dissent,Lawsonk-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you ACLU. I cannot imagine the rights they want to trample on.
If you are not for the civil rights for the people you don't agree with, you are not for human rights at all. The ACLU director said it most correctly when he said that if we didn't let the racist supremacists have a voice than Trumpets would not let Antifa have a say, or they might even say *you* can't express your opinion.That ICE men and women, even those without children can sleep at night with children apart from their loving parents is surreal. This lack of caring that no parent would choose for their own but don't think twice about taking *your* child away is testament to how low our education system has sunk. Does anyone think that idea is a stretch? You have to really train and indoctrinate people for years to remove their caring for others. You have to strip away Sundays from the moral teachings of church and give the day to the NFL. War will not end until men stop going to war. No Justice, no Peace. Rev. Lawson said at the John Lewis funeral says these ACLU legal eagles need our help keeping the horrid policies front and center. Nice movie, get more help, become a taxing entity, 1% for dissent . Wilson of DC",False
10,10,Powerful & Inspiring,highdobb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm glad there was a documentary crew capturing these moments as they happened. I can only think that this should be a series (perhaps a sequel of ""The Fight Continues""??!) because the onslaught of unjustness continues. It's inspiring to see people stand up to these legal systems and the executive branch; lending a voice to the powerless. Thank you ACLU for all you do and especially for everyone you do it for-we the people.",False
11,1,This isn't about civil rights.,epomero,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie isn't about a fight against injustice, it is about promoting a backwards ideology. Obama separated families at the border, crickets. Trump enforces the same rule, ""An attack on civil rights!"". These are overly privileged idiots spouting nonsense like it is profound and wise for 90 minutes. Of course it has a perfect score on RT.",False
12,1,Disappointed,killerindrag,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI gave this documentary 1 Star, not because I think it is poorly constructed; although I do feel it could have been much more powerful if it had more substance into both the lawyers represented in it, and also the subjects.But because I vehemently disagree with the ACLU representing groups whom use hate speech; arguing that everyone is protected under the 1st amendment.I strongly oppose defense of any speech or rhetoric that dehumanizes someone based on the color of their skin.I support the right to free speech, but not at the expense of demonizing and demoralizing other ethnicities for no reason.I think the ACLU is partially responsible and complicit in what happened in Charlottesville in 2017, and subsequently should shoulder partial blame in the death of a protester during those events.Words matter, and the context of those words carry real world implications and consequences.Because of that; I feel the ACLU was reckless and irresponsible for its defense of hate speech, and should re-evaluate whom it chooses to represent and what the wider spectrum results could be in correlation to choices in their clients actions.",True

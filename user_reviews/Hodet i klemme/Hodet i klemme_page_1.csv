1,9,They dare and they win us all,dakjets,n/a,15/08/2025,"A mixture of documentary and social drama about the Norwegian national wrestling team and their road to the Olympics. Could it be interesting? The answer is yes.This series closely follows various athletes. We get insight into not only how hard they work to achieve their sporting goals, but also drama in their private lives. We see men who support each other, who dare to tell about painful experiences and personal tragedies in an environment known for its macho world. This series is very good at conveying the human challenges these athletes have in combination with how tough it is to become the best in their sport. What it costs that they have to give up. I think this series is so educational and inviting for everyone. And everyone involved deserves credit for daring to stand up and share everything that they do.",False

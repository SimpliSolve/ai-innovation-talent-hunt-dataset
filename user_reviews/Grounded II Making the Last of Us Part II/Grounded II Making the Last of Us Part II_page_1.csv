1,10,LOVED it 👏🏻,spookedgamer,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great and insightful look at the excruciatingly difficult task of bringing one of the best sequels in history to life. It was awesome being able to see behind the scenes of how much work and sacrifice went into making this masterpiece.Especially loved getting to see the mo-cap scenes as they play out in the game, and the negativity that came with the eventual release, some of which was quite heartbreaking.This is my favorite game of all time and a truly exceptional documentary. Absolutely lost it at the end tease from Neil of a Part III... 🙌🏻🌿
If you loved playing through this game and experiencing the emotional journey it puts you through, you owe yourself to check this out!",False
2,10,I watched 15 minutes and i knew that this was a 10/10 documentary,furlangabriel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is really good documentarie i was shocked with the most stuff, and it is so explained and detailed.As a naughty dog fan i think we needed this documentary to fullifil our hole from the last of us part 2 ending.And in the end it tells us that there will be the last of us part 3 so this is a dream come true. We got the the last of us hbo series last year. It had mixed revievs but it was good. Because there is the story we didnt see in the The last of us part 1 and now we have this documentary. And it is long so we could understand the process of making the whole part 2. But the thing that we need hear more about is that there is the last of us part 3 coming out some year.",True

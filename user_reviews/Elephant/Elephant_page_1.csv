1,6,Fantastic cinematography,charlick,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film was great, let down by some weird type of Johnny Morris narration, to be honest I lasted 15 minutes before it became unbearable. I'm gobsmacked they went for that style.",False
2,8,Excellent Family Fun,amani-preston,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just love this very moving family story. Elephant's Narrator brings this story to life beautifully and grabs your attention. Also, the cinematography is spectacular.",False
3,8,What a fun way to learn about Elephants,ladynstreet,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Duchess of Sussex was absolutely brilliant narrating the scenes in this movie. Her tone was just right and made the movie a fun learning experience.
Her voice is quite engaging and suitable. This movie is suitable for both adults and kids",False
4,n/a,Perfect tone for a familial entertainment,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The visuals were spectacular and the narrator's voice was so soothing and engaging.Following the journey of little jomo and his family was like drinking a hot cocktail of different types of emotions.
From sadness to laughter then fear.
Definitely perfect to spread awareness about those magnificent creatures.",False
5,7,Verbiage is not for small children.,Mliss49,n/a,16/08/2025,The photography is excellent! I would have liked to hear Morgan Freeman as the narrative person. Megan's' voice is more for cartoons. It's to sing song for a documentary.,False
6,9,Great Family Friendly Flick,mflanagan-17400,n/a,16/08/2025,"Engaging nature doc perfect for all ages. The story is captivating and well written. Music was excellent and helped the narrative. Narration was engaging, pitch perfect, and added to the story of these beautiful elephants.Most of the negative reviews are from people who have something to say about Meghan, the narrator of this film. I would ask yourself if someone creates an account to try and shame the narrator of a nature doc meant for children, what does that say about them?",False
7,7,Magnificent Landscape and Inspirational Tale,Mysterygeneration,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary's breathtaking images are its strongest point. With expansive panoramas, close-ups of the elephants, and stunning aerial images, the filmmakers portray the majesty of the Kalahari. Seeing the herd survive the hostile landscape-from dealing with dust storms to fighting for limited supplies-is both breathtaking and gripping.The film, which is narrated by Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, takes a heartwarming tone, emphasizing the close ties and tenacity of the elephant family in the face of hardship. For families searching for a wildlife documentary that highlights the wonder and beauty of the animal kingdom, this makes it an excellent option.On the other hand, those who are looking for a more in-depth look may find ""Elephant"" lacking. The majority of the film is focused on the herd's emotional journey and its visuals, with no technical explanation of elephant behavior or the particular hazards that they confront in the area. The conservation message is conveyed, but it's subtle and doesn't have the same depth or impact as other environmental films.",False
8,9,Delightful and Educational Documentary,gina-112,n/a,16/08/2025,"I learned a great deal about the Kalahari elephant herd from this documentary. I was unaware of the 8 month annual migration to ensure ongoing access to food and water, the matriarchal leadership within the herd and had forgotten about the long gestation period for elephants. I was immersed the story of Gaia, Shani and Jomo's journey. The cinematography was gorgeous and captivating. The production was also excellent. The narration captured the right tone for a family oriented story. The seriousness, the playfulness and the triumphs were skillfully conveyed by the narrator's voice. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Elephant."" I encourage others to watch with their families and transport yourselves to the world of the Okavango River Delta in Botswana.",False
9,10,Mesmerizing,wzc327,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a wonderful story of Shani, her calf Jomo and the herd of Kalahari Elephants as they make their seasonal journeys.
It is engaging, emotional, and a treat for the whole family.",False

11,1,This well-filmed documentary needed a more capable narrator,fizzysuccess,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narrator simply lacks the range of depth and tonality to truly compliment this cinematography.
The filming was superb and the storytelling excellent.
But it was let down by the underwhelming voiceover, which feels like it was chosen for who she is, rather than how skilled she is.As for the tons of bogus 10 star reviews from her PR camp...that's quite laughable at once again attempting to control the narrative.",False
12,10,Great Family Watch,slloyd-05377,n/a,16/08/2025,This new Disney Nature documentary is really interesting. It has a great blend of education & entertainment. My family & I throughly enjoyed it.,False

16,4,Better seen than heard,TheLittleSongbird,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love Disney, have done ever since seeing 'Cinderella' at two or three years old. Love nature documentaries, especially the landmark ones of David Attenborough (i.e. 'Planet Earth', 'Blue Planet'). Love elephants, a love as lifelong as my love for Disney ever since seeing 'Dumbo' for the first time. So no pre-conceived bias. Was a bit nervous, seeing that it was narrated by Meghan Markle (don't despise her as much as most do), who has a voice that does not sound right for documentaries.Really do have to agree with those that didn't care for 'Elephant', after watching it on Disney Plus, and do agree completely with the criticisms that have been summed up very well already (though am going to aim to be a little kinder). There are many fine documentaries that don't have Attenborough's name on them, but 'Elephant' is not one of them. As far as the DisneyNature documentaries go, this is among the weakest. It is actually one of the better looking ones, but audibly it is another story.'Elephant' does have good things and they are going to be begun with. Visually, it looks amazing and it is the production values that are by far the best thing about it. The scenery is enough to take the breath away, something that is obvious from the very beginning. That is enhanced by the photography, which is of cinematic quality and quite dazzling to watch.The elephants themselves look majestic and are rootable. Jomo is utterly adorable and there were enough times where it was easy to invest in his antics. The first ten minutes are quite cute.As aforementioned however, audibly 'Elephant' is another story. The music tries far too hard to be epic and too much of a film score, and it ends up being far too loud and over-orchestrated. Found 'Elephant' to be too over-dramatised, too sentimental and most of the moments intended to be playful came over as very cheesy and forced. Didn't feel an awful lot of emotion, any attempts didn't come over as sincere and is instead too cutesy.Will agree with those that say that the narration fares worst. And it is not just Markle's far too over-eager, at times patronising and too Disney Singalong Song delivery. Actually still am very fond of most of the Disney Singalong Song videos but that approach was just wrong here, this needed a voice of authority, of soothing quality and gravitas like Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones or Jeremy Irons for males and Glenn Close, Cate Blanchett or Meryl Streep for females that was trying too hard to appeal to younger audiences. But also the actual writing itself, which is very cookie-cutter, melodramatic, quite cheesy (especially the attempts to be playful and the breaking the fourth wall-like moments) and doesn't say anything illuminating or educational. Instead going for over-dramatic storytelling over facts, when there have been documentaries that have expertly balanced both. Some cute moments aside, there is a playing too safe feel here and there is not really ever a set piece that wows.Concluding, disappointing. 4/10",False

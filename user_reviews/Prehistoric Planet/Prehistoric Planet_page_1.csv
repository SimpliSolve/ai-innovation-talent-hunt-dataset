1,9,Absolutely gorgeous!!,frobrojkt,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a forever fan of dinosaurs and actually paid for a majority of my college degree by doing paleoart for the geology department at my university. As a Paleoartist, I can truthfully say that this is one of the most beautiful and awe inspiring shows I have seen in a while. Everything from the movements to the colorations, to the perfect placement of filaments on the dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals is incredible !! I am blown away by the attention to detail.Now for a little critique. Part of a Paleoartist job is to make educated guesses about what prehistoric life may have looked like. So, I understand firsthand what it means to get a little creative and loose with some of the interpretation of the fossil evidence. That being said I do feel that some of the interpretations seem to take creative license a little too far.With paleoart, you do the best you can with the info you have .. then 10 years later they uncover more data and prove your art needs updating. I mean, look at the appearance of a spinosaurus even from 2005- now. So I guess In conclusion, I love love love this show. Is it 100% correct ?? Probably not, but it's beautiful to behold. This is a Paleoartist's dream come true.",False
2,8,Planet Earth with Dinosaurs,ethomas274,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was advertised as Planet Earth with Dinosaurs, and, that's what we got. It's nice to get truth in advertising for once. I just wish the series itself was longer (only 5 episodes?) and the behind-the-scenes looks were more in-depth. I wanted to hear more about the science behind how they knew all this stuff. Overall, really well done.",False
3,9,A grandiose experience and a breath of fresh air,jurassiczilla-95192,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is a LOT to say about Prehistoric Planet, a dream come true for avid enthusiasts of prehistoric life such as myself, with a beautifully bombastic score, absolutely incredible special effects, and of course, narration from Sir David Attenborough himself, what is there not to love?This is one of the very few pieces of media where I was absolutely wowed, the cgi is absolutely masterful as I was sometimes left wondering what is actually real or not. This series truly shows that close scientific backing and communication does indeed pay off as you can truly believe that you are in fact watching real animals, moreso when they are put in very unique situations that modern animals experience but haven't really been done with prehistoric animals before such as the Velociraptors hunting pterosaurs on the cliff, which evokes the iconic Snow Leopard hunt from Planet Earth, and the Triceratops herd venturing into caves to lick minerals much like Elephants do today. I much appreciate this series showcasing and even giving the spotlight to relatively unkown and obscure organisms.Now here are the negatives. Some animals and locales are not named or elaborated upon, which may make context for some of the sequences confusing to viewers who aren't well-versed with Cretaceous lore. Some sequences feel a bit rushed and shoe-horned in which I think is especially prevelant in the Freshwater episode. The worlds also sometimes feel empty, as there is a noticeable lack of ambient creatures in some sequences. Finally a little nitpick of mine was not showing what otherwise would have been fantastic sequences such as the T.rex bringing down a Triceratops.Overall, I'm confident in saying that Prehistoric Planet is one of the most impressive and groundbreaking pieces of dinosaur media ever, and I hope this series helps to spark new interest in creating fresh portrayls of the magnificent animals that came before us.",False
4,10,Simply one if the best things I've ever watched,topherdrewpg,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're reading this, consider this review a 10/10 and don't even bother reading the rest! Go watch this now! :)Every element of this show is perfect. Sir David Attenborough is a wizard at narration. The cinematography is mind-blowing. The CGI effects are so seamless, I couldn't believe it. The score is brilliant, beautiful, moving.One of the greatest documentaries of all time has begun.",False
5,10,ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!!,HarrySmooth,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have ALWAYS LOVED Dinosaurs, ever since I can remember, and at 65 that's a Pretty long while! And THIS, WOW, THIS, is one of the most AMAZING Things I have EVER seen!Hell, I'll take THIS over ANY of the ""Jurassic Park"" movies ANY DAY! The CG is FLAWLESS! And of Course they could not have picked. Finer Narrator than "" David Attenborough"" (spelling? ) he was absolutely PERFECT for this!This is a GEM for the entire family to enjoy! You will NEVER find a better Documentary on Dinosaurs ANYWHERE!I wouldn't be surprised at all if they made this documentary mandatory watching in elementary schools in junior high's and even high school for students interested in prehistoric animals! If you have children this is a MUST SEE for them! My Gtandson is only 2 and he's GLUED to it!You won't be sorry! .... WATCH!",False
6,10,Worth Every Minute Of Your Time,Sunsphxsuns,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you enjoyed the 2002 BBC primetime programs, Walking with Dinosaurs and Walking with Prehistoric Beasts, then you're going to LOVE this new 2022 Apple TV series, Prehistoric Planet, convincingly narrated by David Attenborough.Let's be clear - Prehistoric Planet is a combination of state-of-the-art imaging technology and speculation. Since human beings were not around to actually witness and document the appearance and activities of dinosaurs, series like these need to utilize a certain amount of ""discretionary imagination."" And that's OK, because unless we someday discover a way to grow living dinosaurs from DNA (as in Jurassic Park), we'll simply have to rely on fossilized skeletons to help us form a reasonable picture of what dinosaurs must have looked like 66 million years ago. And as Attenborough explains, Prehistoric Planet leverages what Paleontologists have learned about dinosaurs thus far. Case in point, in the 1993 film, Jurassic Park, Velociraptors looked much different than the ones portrayed in this 2022 series. These Velociraptors have broad tails and feathers!What I like about Prehistoric Planet is that we get to see these extinct creatures behaving like genuine animals, and not terrible monsters. These dinosaurs protect their young from predators, a behavior seen in higher life forms such as dolphins and elephants. And more so, we get to have a deeper understanding of why dinosaurs were able to flourish and thrive virtually unabated for millions of years. Perhaps we Homo Sapiens can learn a few things about adaptation and survival from our very distant cousins.As usual no spoilers here, but I will reveal that ""Iron Man"" director Jon Favreau wanted the production to have the look and feel of a theatrical blockbuster, with an educational component woven throughout it.",False
7,10,Incredible!!,Pagalala,n/a,15/08/2025,Is there anything better than settling in with a cup of tea and a nature show narrated by David Attenborough?!??? YES. Yes there is.A DINOSAUR nature show narrated by David Attenborough.'Nuf said.,False
8,10,Looks like they went back in time to film this!,TheDevilsNotetaker,n/a,15/08/2025,Game changer- utterly incredible.CGI is so good its like real life.They tried to make it seem like they actually went back in time to film the dinos up close and personal.True game changer in documentary filmmaking.,False
9,10,Brilliant as ever,Sankirna,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved the first episode!It has the same high quality information and commentary we have come to expect from Sir. David Attenborough now combined with stunning visuals in 4K Dolby Vision quality. The dinosaurs look beautiful as they are but what steals the show for me is the extremely realistic animations. A perfect time for the release as well considering the new Jurassic World movie is coming out soon. Overall, 10/10 from me.",False
10,7,I'm no paleontologist but.....,philrealdeal,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all, this show is totally worth a watch. It's absolutely beautiful and of course, Attenborough delivers.To me though, I feel like there were so many liberties that were taken with dinosaurs for the sake of drama. Did Dino's REALLY live in the arctic year round? Was there REALLY a mini-migration of pterosaurs from a cliff to the mainland? Were some pterosaurs REALLY posing as females to get a mate? Do we really know all of these things or is apple trying to just make an interesting show?If these things are true, great. Power to it. But it made me question some of it. That's all.",False
11,10,The next walking with dinosaurs series .,gabethedinosaur,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDavid Attenborough is making dinosaurs more exciting after 23 years since Kenneth Branagh narrated dinosaurs. The filming and animatronics , and effects and real locations is fantastic than ever before. It felt like the blue planet and walking with dinosaurs all mixed together. I can't for more episodes this week. I have a feeling this is gonna be the next Apple plus series in bbc history.",True
12,6,"Very pretty CGI, no science",Coconut-Tea,n/a,15/08/2025,"The dinosaurs look absolutely stunning.However, that's it. You just watch dinosaurs going on about their life. There are no scientific explanations that you actually desire in documentations, no in-depth going about why the airsacks are there, why they supposedly behaved like that, etc. Nothing.You could take the narration completely away and you would lose nothing - Attenborough literally just tells what's happening on screen.Older dinosaur documentaries have me much better informed.",False
13,3,"slow with forced, made up drama...",greenreigns,n/a,15/08/2025,"It looks good but so did Jurassic Park 30 years ago... Every episode was slow on information and packed with forced drama in an attempt to hold viewers attention, which shouldn't have been needed. How about you tell us more facts that we actually know to be true and less staging every scene with made up drama. It seemed like it was made for kids because they'll get sucked right into their plight. Worse yet when trying to add drama they didn't even show a real fight. The fights between animals of that scale would have been jaw dropping and terrifying. There could have been so many more dinosaurs in the show too. Basically for 5 hours of time it was pretty underwhelming...",False
14,9,Finally a worthy spiritual successor to Walking with Dinosaurs after 23 years,tibovl,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'll keep it short:
The visuals are nearly perfectly photorealistic, especially the animations deserve all the praise they can get. On top of that the sound design is really strong. Both are extra supported by an amazing soundtrack.The documentary style is pleasant to watch but the hopping from one short story to the next doesn't leave the same impact as when we'd follow one dinosaur for a longer time.The accuracy of certain scenes is questionable. Some speculation is easily passed of as fact.These two tiny points keep this series from being a 10 for me. But it is still an incredible series, one that I'll surely revisit many times in the coming years. I hope it does well because even though the first season hasn't fully finished airing, I already want a second one.",False
15,9,Amazing Spectacle,Ben-Morr,n/a,15/08/2025,"The production and animation quality is top notch. The stories told are moving, funny, surprising, informative. Felt like I traveled back in time. The extra features -- 5 or 6 short videos -- which show ""the science behind the stories"" is also worth a look.",False
16,9,Dinosaurs are back!,afrohnhoefer,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am basing this little review off the first episode alone; it looks amazing. All of the animals behave in believable ways, and it's cool to see many creatures that we never have before. Although not explicitly spelled out for any slow audience members, it's clear alot of research and (very well educated) guesswork went into the series. There is a section to explain the science of some of the claims presented in the show, for anyone who has a hard time believing what their seeing as well. 9/10 CGI is choppy every once in a while when ocean creatures breach the water surface.",False
17,10,Breathtaking !!!,Syed_Abuthahir,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Docuseries at it's next level. It's Breathtaking with its astonishing Computer graphics. You literally feel like you are watching a real life Dinasours Documentary. Quality of detail at it's peek. Who would have thought that we are going to travel back 66 Million Years and Experience the world of Dinasours Never Before...A must watch one, please recommend to your friends and family too.",False
18,10,Absolutely remarkable,punpz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a masterpiece. If you're reading these reviews, debating whether to watch this or not, just don't hesitate. This dinosaur documentary is one of the best nature documentaries I've ever seen. The animated beasts are so well done, so inspirational.Well done BBC, Apple and Sir David.Having watched just the first episode we can all say this is a huge step forward in the right direction and we can all agree that this kind of work is rare.10/10 for me.",False
19,10,Stunning visuals weaved with a compelling story,nakul-mohan4491,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was expecting a visual treat from this show looking at the trailers, and it was indeed better than expected. You forget that you are watching CGI and what makes the forgetting even easier are the short stories attached to the characters i.e the dinosaurs. A mother protecting a child, a bird's first dangerous flight. Very interesting stories that hook you to the episode. And the voice of David Attenborough is what binds it all together into a very engaging watch.",False
20,6,A gorgeous and illuminating trip back to the late Cretaceous period,tinytots2,n/a,15/08/2025,"A significant technical accomplishment, Prehistoric Planet is a vivid reimagination and recreation of the world that existed 66 million years ago. Presented in a manner similar to other nature documentaries like Planet Earth, dinosaurs and their contemporaries are realistically brought to life. With story snippets across habitats and seasons, the perennial struggle for survival is ever the focus, be that in the quest for food, the search for a mate, the rearing of one's young, or the threat posed by predators. Apart from the mesmerizing nature of the content, praise is also due to the phenomenal camerawork, captivating visual effects, immersive sound creation and mixing, and erudite narration. All of these aspects combine together seamlessly to provide a unique audiovisual feast through its depiction of a popular bygone era.While the show made for an absorbing watch, I would have wished for a lot more emphasis to be given to the scientific evidence and theories that supported and gave credence to the presented material. The 5-minute videos were far too short to provide adequate reasoning and justification, especially as they also attempted to relate prehistoric observations to modern-day animal behaviours of which there was a notable lack within the episodes. The series' organization on the basis of habitats also felt suboptimal since the same lifeforms were often revisited; it might have been more beneficial to either focus episodes on important genera/classes (like Tyrannosaurus and Pterosaurs) or use seasonal/behavioural/temporal classifications. Lastly, very little clarity was given to the geographical and environmental differences between the modern and prehistoric worlds and there wasn't even a passing reference to the event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs and the consequent far-reaching impacts on Earth's ecology.While I personally view Prehistoric Planet more critically, it is still an astounding achievement that also has significant educational value. Lovers of natural history as well as dinosaur aficionados are certain to be fascinated and entranced by this show.",False
21,10,The ultimate paleoart,julieshotmail,n/a,15/08/2025,"Paleoart is artistic work that attempts to depict prehistoric life according to scientific evidence. ""Prehistoric Planet"" is the ultimate convergence of stunning images, hyper-realistic computer animation and sound effects, beautiful soundtrack, and the most fitting voice for narration. If you enjoy dinosaurs, this 5-episode series is about as good as it gets. No ""Jurassic Park"" movies can hold a candle to it. In the movies, dinosaurs still feel artificial and are frequently portrayed as lightning-quick monsters. In this show, they are very diverse, beautiful animals just living and getting through their day. Of course they have to eat and the requisite hunting for prey is depicted. Those scenes can still tug at your heartstrings, including the giant herbivore effortlessly knocking down an equally giant tree for food, which is a testament as to how outstandingly well-made this series is. One consolation after you witness any prey being brutally attacked is that you can breathe a sigh of relief remembering that these scenes are all just made up!",False
22,7,"Amazing visuals, but I would have preferred it done differently",ryan-beauchesne,n/a,15/08/2025,"You cannot fault the visuals, it truly is amazing. And the probable life-like stories they tell around the animals are good, but there's something about this series that leaves you feeling too skeptical to really immerse yourself, and I believe I know why.I would have much preferred that with each introduction of the animals, they give some brief examples of HOW they knew, or came to deduct, certain traits about that animals. For example, tell us that they knew so-and-so-osaur probably laid eggs in volcanic creators because maybe fossilized eggs were found in them... and that they had feathers because they found imprints in fossils.. and that they might have done this mating dance based on their decorative horns and that birds today also do this. Essentially, help us understand what is based in scientific deduction and what is just pure assumption. Because unless you're a dinosaur expert, you're often just left feeling this might all be made up, and it sort of ruins the realism you're trying to feel for this...That's my 2 cents.",False
23,5,"Visually stunning, yet devoid of any character",jeffharcourt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although this show is visually stunning, it is absolutely boring. No action or drama. I think this is a missed opportunity to display some of the most fascinating creatures to ever have walked the planet. In one episode the highlight is a dinosaur scratching his back on a tree!This show had so much potential yet dropped the ball at the start line.Disappointed.",False
24,10,Absurdly good.,chanunnaki,n/a,15/08/2025,The level of realism in the modelling and animation had me frequently forgetting that what I was watching on screen wasn't real. This show is truly a remarkable achievement that managed to illicit within me a child-like wonder.Simply WOW!,False
25,10,Best paleo documentary ever made,joelax-08682,n/a,15/08/2025,This is an absolutely fantastic documentary and the amount of work put into it to make it so realistic is incredible. I love seeing feathered dinosaurs on screen as is but the fact they act like real animals rather than movie monsters like in the Jurassic movies makes me so happy. Plus seeing Tyrannosaurus rex showing parental behavior is a highlight as we rarely see this angle on the tyrant lizard king.,False

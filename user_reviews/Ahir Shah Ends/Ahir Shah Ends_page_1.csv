1,8,Absolutely riveting and enlightening.,dhavalincredible-45853,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ahir Shah is Definitely a far more enlightened British Indian than Rishi Sunak ðŸ˜…. What an absolutely tightly written set of one hour that takes you through the state that UK is in and a second generation immigrant experience from very objective and philosophically sound perspective.I am not Brit but surely related to it a lot as my sister is a British citizen of Gujarati ethnicity, sure sometimes you feel that he is going to fast but that is just his style and you get used to it. Overall great to see British comedy scene being studded with gems from all part of the ""Commonwealth"" and Ahir Shah is surely the Kohinoor!",False
2,4,Comedy in the style of shouting and overreacting,jesse-greathouse,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being a U. S. citizen, I do not understand a lot of what Ahir Shah jokes about in this comedy special because a large portion of it centers around the specifics of the political and social landscape of the United Kingdom.From the jokes I did understand, it seems like the audience he is performing for is a bit overly enthusiastic because they chuckled a lot at things that seemed only mildly funny.This being the only performance I have seen of Ahir Shah, makes it seem like his particular brand of humor relies on him shouting and being visually agitated over the things he is saying. It's his outrageous reaction to the things he's saying, which makes it funny, rather than the actual things he's saying, which is really only mildly humorous.I gave it a chance but it didn't land on me all that well, your milage may vary. If you enjoy boisterous, extremely frenzied reactions then you may enjoy this.",False
3,10,Absolute must watch for everyone,crmathew,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, as Americans half the stuff he talks about British politics may not make sense but doesn't take a genius to figure out what he is referring to. But the substance in this very cohesively written, very beautifully executed set is the storytelling of Ahir Shah about his Nanaji and Nanima. I never write reviews but made an account to write this because it was so wholesome and gave the message of hope in these days of despair. He narrates the story to point out that today is a lot better than our yesterdays our previous generations had to deal with, and to give us hope that our tomorrow's if we just try and not give up from the despair. He acknowledges the naivety of this notion but doesn't want to be anything but naive for that hope. Any parent who is wondering what world we are leaving for our children, any immigrant who ever felt like they just want to ""get to go without saying"", anyone depressed about the state of affairs today must watch this for the wholesome content. Ahir Shah's delivery is unique and can sometimes be hard to keep up with but just give it a chance and you'll probably walk away with tears (happy ones) in your eyes like I did.",False

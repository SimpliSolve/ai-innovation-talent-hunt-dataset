1,5,"It's an ok show, but doesn't live up to its hype",aliciamornat,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not a hater of Chiara, in fact I think she's a really interesting woman, so I was expecting a lot. And I ended up being a bit disappointed.And don't get me wrong, the show isn't bad, there are some heartwarming moments like the birth of Vittoria, but for the most part I found it a bit repetitive. I especially feel there was a huge lack of honesty, especially from Chiara and her family. Their life is color pink, every single angle of their life is perfect and they never let go. They never fight, they have always everything under control, they always look splendid... we see no struggle from their side. And I don't think anyone's life is that perfect. At certain points it seems as if the show only revolved around Fede having trouble opening up about his struggles and Chiara not knowing how to solve it because her life is too happy for her to relate and trying to convince the viewer her life is a new level of perfection, in a way that looks so out of touch with reality.In conclusion, the show is ok at most moments, it's great if you don't have anything else to watch and you wanna watch something entertaining, light and funny. But I just feel like this show had a lot of potential and they just didn't go for it.",True
2,7,"not bad,but...",bhyqbzpmk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very light, cute and fun series. But honestly I expected more. More exclusive things, more everyday life, more background. It seems to me a little too high and not in the middle of real life.",False
3,7,Entertaining but have mixed feelings,fphhhh,n/a,16/08/2025,I really find it real and funny but I was really surprised at how their differences are a problem. She really doesn't accept that he is a private person who likes to stay at home and forces him to do things. He seems so tired that he doesn't discuss and just obeys to have a stress free life. I must also say that she acts as if she was extroverted but in fact I have a feeling that she is scared to be alone and needs all the time 1000 people around her. His parents are really nice but her family looks fake. I really like Chiara and Fedez and hope they will sort it out. I also think it's nice to see the reality : everyone has the same problems at the end.,False
4,n/a,Congratulations Chiara and Fedez!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"My daughter has been a follower of Chiara since the times of The Blonde Salad. I am not a follower (I don't have an Instagram account) but I admire Chiara's entrepreneurial success. Last night with my daughter I saw all five episodes of The Ferragnez. Congratulations Chiara and Fedez! In The Ferragnez your millions of followers see what usually does not appear in Instagram posts, you show yourself fragile and vulnerable and you allow your viewers to identify with you. You give your fans the possibility of being able to see you behind the scenes, to see your happiness but also your tears and to dream with you.",False
5,7,Its a cute tv show,brubrumor-01318,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am definitely in the vibe of reality shows. From the kardashians, to selling sunsets to the ferragnez I hope more similar shows come up. The brightside of the show is definitely leone and I wish we couldve seen more of him! The downside def the sanremo focus, soo boring. The family is very cute, I really like chiaras sisters and luca is super nice with vale and I like seeing the whole family together. I love fedez grandma, too! This is a nice tv show with good family values! Lets hope for more seasons!",False
6,10,Great show about a great family,annacusma,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching the first five episodes and I am pleasantly surprised about this show! I follow both Fede and Chiara on Instagram and I thought I already know everything about them but this show let us see them in a more vulnerable light. The therapy session between Federico and Chiara are really powerful, as well as their life with Lell√≤ and Vittoria. Can't wait for the last episodes!",False
7,7,Mettersi a nudo,stefaniarubini,n/a,16/08/2025,"I appreciated the commitment of both them in getting naked. I admire Chiara's enthusiasm, her lightness, her ability to surround herself with people with whom she shares experiences, goals and who give her back positive feeling for new life. Federico's sincerity, his sensitivity and depth, the ability to enter into intimacy with himself, the fragility oh his defending himself from other people with so much strenght and conviction came to me powerful. I loved little Leo, such a sweet and happy baby.",False
8,1,What a massive waste of time,lauretta-73047,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm only posting this because Chiara keeps mobilising her millions of followers to leave a good review and I don't think this series deserves the light of day. It's a self-indulgent piece of work and I hope a fake one too, with her husband seemingly hating the life she wants for them and her perennially oblivious to everything but what she wants. If the point of the series was to show ""how different they are"" I think the only takeaway is that they shouldn't even be together - there's no love in what you see and it speaks volumes about their overly commercialised life and relationship. I honestly feel sad for everyone involved.",False
9,10,Great!,jixncskx,n/a,16/08/2025,I just finished watching the first 5 episodes and all I can say is that I got emotional since the first one. I love this family and thanks to this series i understood that they are 100% relatable since they have problems too and a normal relationship just like others families and people. The parts that i loved the most are those of the therapists in which they talk and I got emotional while they were crying and watching at each other with so much love. I always thought that I am more relatable to Chiara but now I know that I'm exactly like Fede and I really love the way he is since I can understand him and I love the way Chiara is always there for him (and he's too for her). Honestly at first I thought it would be the typical boring show about every day life but I couldn't be happier that I watched it and that I discovered intimate things about them. I love you guys!,False
10,1,Non-sense,ruth-20253,n/a,16/08/2025,The series shows how deep our society has fallen down. Non-sense + Capitalism + Self-promotion without intelligence. It is a complete waste of time and a disgrace to European culture.,False
11,9,"Fun, relatable and honest",gmatassa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love the ferragnez, follow them on Instagram and truly believe they are fantastic and proud Italian ambassadors! The series is a fun and relatable glimpse into a multi-million follower family and I love it!!! Honestly I'm super proud of how Chiara and fedez raise my country's profile nationally and internationally and can't wait to see the final 3 episodes!!! Leo true star of the show!! üòçüòçüòç",False
12,1,Fedez....please RUN!,ingagorelovasimplewine,n/a,16/08/2025,Chiara is just bossy and not a boss. She pretends to be something that she is not. In the show you can see how shallow and silly she is.Fedez is a real person in chains...surrounded by these Chiara's fake friends.Leo is the cutest.I hope Amazon is done with her and her ego.,False
13,10,Highly suggested,filfiora,n/a,16/08/2025,Super in love with this new serie about the most special Italian family.Chiara and Federico are the perfect modern family and it's really a pleasure to get to know about their bond better.I'm a fan!,False
14,4,Have to change my previous rating,chiaramasseglia,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was 6. Enjoyable, nice, fun, but I think it only shows Chiara's wish and desire to show up 100% of her private life. She does it 24/7, she continued with her ""Unposted"", and here we are.Her husband doesn't seem comfortable with that, but she doesn't seem to care.The most private things about their lives - even those which should be kept private - are shown.I would feel uncomfortable too. But she is ""the boss babe"".And after the last 3 I watched, I believe even more it's all about her.After all, it's ""FERRAGNez'",False
15,10,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!,francasavasi,n/a,16/08/2025,"WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE SERIES, I THOUGT: IS THERE ANYTHING WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FERRAGNEZ?DEFINITELY YES!I CRIED, LAUGHED AND APPRECIATE THE COURAGE TO SHOW YOURSELF FOR WHAT YOU ARE WITH ALL YOUR FEARS, DOUBT, ANXIETIES THROUGH THE CONVERSATION WITH THE THERAPIST.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",False
16,1,Why,tatyba,n/a,16/08/2025,"I find quite difficult to understand the reasons behind all this. Was truly necessary a series when, honestly, we already see so much, too much about them on Instagram and everywhere? Someone could actually tell me that there were scenes that we didn't see before. True: private scenes that, in my opinion, should have remained in that way: private.What I saw from the first 5 episodes is that ""The Ferragnez"" aren't at all the great couple that they're so hardly trying to pretend to be on Instagram. A lonely, introverted person who constantly fights with the world and with himself from one side and a stressful, bossy (not boss, bossy) person from the other side, unable to stay alone (therefor the circus that follows them everywhere as she said ""When he want to stay by himself"" so she's not left alone) and unable probably to understand other people point of views or maybe even feelings: I was left really irritated by her comment about the ""Useless problems"" of Fedez during the therapy. It seems to me that it has just showed us how everything turns around Chiara: I'm quite curious to know why they're always surrounded by her family and her friends, who here as well seems only to have the part to let us know what a fantastic person she is (please spare us the part when her sister and her boyfriend are eating together in their house and are talking about Chiara and Fedez), and we didn't see any of Fedez's friends, except Luis.Positive note? Fedez's parent seems to be quite normal people, compared to all the rest there around.",False
17,10,Highly suggested!,fran8994,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched all the five episodes and absolutely loved the serie. Very entertaining but also full of personal moments, I appreciated a lot the honesty of their couple therapy and absolutely love Fedez, it tourned out to be my fave character.I love this family and the ferragnez serie is highly recommented if you want to know more about them all!Can't wait for the last three episodes.",False
18,1,Absolute trash,giordanagls,n/a,16/08/2025,"I tried this as I thought it would be an easy watch. This is once again all about showcasing how rich they are - It has zero essence and it shows Chiara the way she is, superficial, insecure and always looking for validation from others which she puts before anything and anyone else. I got to the second episode and I couldn't finish it. Absolute trash.",False
19,10,Super suggested!,tropeaangelo,n/a,16/08/2025,Very well thought out and inspiring as it is very realistic.Gives a really good perspective from the inside of the Ferragnez family!Loved it!Highly suggested!,False
20,1,TOTAL GARBAGE,efitomazou,n/a,16/08/2025,"I trully wonder who rates this show with 10 stars! Oh yes! Proud Italian followers who were urged and invited from their Instagram goddess to write a positive review...This show is for idiots..Because only an idiot would consider as role model an empty,vain,money and fame hungry,self centered and bossy Instagram influencer. This woman's goal in life is to become the next European Kardashian and is dragging her ( also silly and vain) sisters and her poor husband and child to follow her path. I saw her friend looking at her with big eyes as if she is God's gift to Earth,i saw a child who grows up believing it is natural to being filmed and photographed EVERY SINGLE TIME...I saw her husband struggling to maintain his sanity and personality .. I saw Italians( like sister Valentina) who DOT NOT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK ENGLISH in year 2021 yet they are considered successfull enterpreneurs...A garbage series for air headed viewers.",False
21,4,#freeFedez,alflaylawlayla,n/a,16/08/2025,"Terrible show, such self-celebratory! I felt bad for Fedez the whole time. Chiara is living in her own world with unicorns and rainbows. The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars is because I found somehow ""interesting"" the therapy part. The rest is only a continuation of their Instagram stories, nothing new.",False
22,8,"Yes it's staged, but so is all of reality TV",boulosgia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pretty good for reality TV, excited for the remaining episodes. Chiara and Fedez are more hilarious than anticipated, Leo is the star of the show though! He's adorable!",False
23,2,A big no,roccaalice,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping to see more exclusive contents but honestly everything that they proposed was already seen in theirs Instagram stories. The only interesting part was the therapy session.Overall very boring, Fedez was the only ""real"" person in the show, along with his parents, who seem to live in this world and not in the fairy world like Chiara's family.For me it's a big no.",False
24,10,Amazing!,frankkelcz,n/a,16/08/2025,What a pleasure seeing the inner life of this particularly successful family! The interweaving conversations featuring the psychologist with the extraordinary couple of Chiara and Fedez along with other exchanges between members of the family and their friends go a long way toward building an authentic real-life relationship. I've found myself telling my friends in various geographies to watch this show. Well done!,False
25,1,True waste of time,chiaraeheheh,n/a,16/08/2025,It is probably entertaining for teenagers.. I'd rather what a replay of 'keeping up with the Kardashians'.Watching the episodes is like watching their Instagram for 40+ mins.,False

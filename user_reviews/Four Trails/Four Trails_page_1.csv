1,8,Pretty Hong Kong documentary,ryanmo-35178,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a relative less known movie. I used to go hiking a bit and some places shown in the movie were seen! So it is good to take a look on that. This is a documentary about how people to try to complete the longest 4 trails in Hong Kong in 3 days! That is around 300km! It was filmed in 2021 and the tenth anniversary of the competition, while several famous runners were filmed.With the progress of the competition, it is found that they have so so enthusiastic about the event, as they could not sleep and need to find food/drinks themselves, some participants even said they have illusion! It is a bit dangerous actually, but seeing
the beautiful scenes and the spirit of the participants made this movie good.",True

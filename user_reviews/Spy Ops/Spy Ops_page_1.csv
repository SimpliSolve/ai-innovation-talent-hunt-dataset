1,7,History : learnt,spirosmavronas,n/a,15/08/2025,The show is a documentary of USA invations to countries where the authorities interfere with the USA governments interests (The main reason of the invation is always explained and not passed by). As a documentary I feel it succeeds it's goal of passing information .On the other hand the really juicy story parts are usually not as flowered as I would wish. The structure and the narrative of the show feel very familiar maybe sometimes so familiar that I just let it play on the background . It is a good show to learn some history but nothing exceptional nothing new . One last thing I want to point to the pros is that I appreciate the interviews of people of the enemy side.,False
2,6,Will we never learn from history,ronaldsonphil,n/a,15/08/2025,Episode 1 relating to the war in Afghanistan was difficult to watch without getting angry about the sheer incompetence of the US militaryAfter less than a few months of expert attack on the evil Taliban in conjunction with the wonderful local resistance the USA military allowed the Taliban to simply run from Kabul and started idiot celebrations.The correct approach would have been to capture and immediately execute all of those evil Taliban members so the people of Afghanistan could finally have the peace they deserveWhat a disgrace after 20 years and being defeated by a bunch of thugs given all our military might.,False
3,3,One of the biggest snoozefests I've ever seen.,watsonjames-15182,n/a,15/08/2025,"It takes a lot of hard work to make a docuseries with such interesting subject matter so dull and un-engaging.For a start, there was just way too much waffling. We don't need to know every single movement of every single player in the show. And we especially don't need it to stray into conspiracy thinking like one or two episodes did. It honestly felt like they had so much material, but they didn't know what to do with it, so they just threw it all together in the hope it would be somehow interesting.It definitely didn't help that the episodes were a bit disjointed and hard to follow, and the music was immensely grating. But above all, it managed to be a perfect example of the kind of shoddy, half-hearted documentaries that Netflix seems to churn out every month.",False
4,1,Just silly,Xavier_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt opens with a former intelligence officer repeatedly saying the CIA knew about a terrorist plot prior to 9/11 and then repeatedly telling everyone about it.That may actually be true as there was some talk of exercises before hand regarding planes as weapons.However, after that it's all blaming others in attempt to discredit everyone except themselves.Not that interesting actually. It's all the official narrative; story so nothing new that hasn't been on CNN or MSNBC.I'm guessing this was produced to provide support for the government and it's 3 letter agencies, especially since the 25 year anniversary is coming up soon, and the 2024 election.And especially since the Alaska WT7 data has now for been released for ages without any debunking.If you still think CNN and the news media is still honest and reliable then this series for you including a complete lack of supporting documents.This should be in the Fiction category.",True
5,1,Classical American Propanda,ozguryilmaz955,n/a,15/08/2025,"This series is a type of classical CIA and American propaganda. People talking in the series say ""We interrupted people's history because there was no freedom, but when we came freedom came."" It's a big lie. How can a American feel sad after supporting Taliban against URSS? US struggled against Taliban after that. They knew that how these Taliban people were. Taliban is against freedoms, music, games, technology. But how did you back on them? And do you want us to believe these lies? I don't like these types of propaganda movies. But I know streaming companies are loving the idea of ""fake"" freedom. Suggestion: Don't what I did and don't spend your hours please.",False
6,2,I have to admit ...,otarisv,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have to admit that I have started watching this series because I knew it was going to be rubbish. That's mostly going by a myriad of docu-nonsense about police investigations, army operations, organized criminal gangs, etc.So I was not expecting much. I definitely was not expecting that it would take approximately 14 minutes to turn it off!There was a mention on US Army in one of the reviews. All state armies are incompetent, some less perhaps. But if I fart loudly enough I'm pretty sure them super marines will call an air support which, given that Tom Cruise has retired (hopefully), will annihilate a target, ie, probably a cow farm, probably in a different country.But that's funny bit. The unfunny bit is an admission that Bin Laden, al Qaeda and Taleban where actively monitored before 9/11. We knew that but it was annoying that one of the guys was almost boasting about it. Ands yet they have still managed 9/11, and then some! How that incompetence compares with that of an Army!Also, they had $3mio yet couldn't hire a proper helicopter. Or perhaps they didn't need to, except for padding time in the ""docu"". Love comments like ""not sure if we can make it"" and ""turn back"". And pilots, obviously non-Americans, have obviously no clue how to fly that machine over those mountains.",True

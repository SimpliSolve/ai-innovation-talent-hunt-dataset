1,8,Fresh,Gatita75,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was positively surprised. I liked the way this doc was made, there was no interviewing the close network of hers, telling how great she is blaa,blaa blaa( like in many biographic docs nowadays),instead there was voiceover of her, her brother &some old associates.I learned something new from this icon, like her early days in New York in the late 70's and early 80's. This film focused a lot on that era ,and included nice footage from those days. I didn't know she was that musical playing instruments. Very driven and active young lady.Also interesting part on the film was about her sexuality , her style and performance and the loathing and hatred she had to endure in the early days, aswell as later on, during Erotica times. Kind of interesting reminder how it was back then, comparing today.... How double standard it was, and still somewhat is .Also for younger viewers, a climpse of the history of the woman who started the revolution on sexual equality she was a huge role model for female artists to come . She really engouraged feminine boldnes if not arrogance. She had and has balls! This film kept me interested the whole hour and a half.",False
2,9,what i like...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMost of all by this documentary is the sheer sinceerness and head over heels guts that madonna always have spread around herself for nearly 50 years now, its use of historical archive footage and media clips,and i shall not tie myself up, other than admitting that i loved madonna as a teen and, her ferociously smittening dance music and her spandau ballet amongst the pure and the moralists, and whenever i hear a little prayer...im lost in tears . Ive never seen ms ciccone on a life stage, but that would be the most frozen moment in a tramps life if so should ever happen, but my spouce would never raid a ticket for that, thats for sure...ive seen many socalled stories how madonna became madonna, and this one is the most pure from the heart and , but how about the rest...i hope well get that soon.A recommend of this show if your deep in it , thinks the grumpy old man.",True
3,4,No reflection of her wonderful voice,stargirl-01424,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought the film was all about exploitation of her projection of sexuality. There wasn't any mention of her wonderful voice over the decades or her charitable work. It was almost pornographic in places. Sometimes, artists are encouraged to be something they may not necessarily want. Madonna is a true singing talent and that is what the film should have been about.What about showing her skills with musical instruments and not showing other items of her body.As an artiste she is worth far more than was being depicted in the film.Was this a film for voyeurs? If so it should not have been entitled Madonna.",False

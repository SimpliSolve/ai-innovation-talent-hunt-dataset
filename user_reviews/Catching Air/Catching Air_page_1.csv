1,5,Talentless fun,ginjaninja-43907,n/a,16/08/2025,To me the point of air guitar was to make it appear as though you actually look like you knew how to play guitar. None of the contestants actually looked the part. Thay would go from appearing to be holding the guitar to not. Not one. I thought they all looked ridiculous. It was a fun little documentary but I wouldn't recommend it.To me the point of air guitar was to make it appear as though you actually look like you knew how to play guitar.

2,1,Air Guitarbage,efyouceekay,n/a,16/08/2025,"Air guitar is not a sport, it is not an art form, it is not even a hobby. It is a pathetic attempt to mimic the skills and charisma of real musicians, without any of the talent or effort required. The air guitarists in the documentary are delusional, narcissistic and obnoxious. They dress up in ridiculous costumes, adopt lame stage names and perform exaggerated gestures that have nothing to do with the music they are pretending to play. They claim to be promoting world peace and harmony through their air guitar performances, but they are actually just feeding their own egos and seeking attention.Catching Air is a documentary that fails to capture the essence of rock n' roll, and instead exposes the emptiness and futility of air guitar. It is a film that should be avoided by anyone who respects music, art, and intelligence.",False

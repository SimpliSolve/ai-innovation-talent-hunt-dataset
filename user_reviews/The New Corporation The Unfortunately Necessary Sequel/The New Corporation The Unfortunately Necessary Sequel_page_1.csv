1,6,Enlightening but quite biased and unfocused,kaideneve,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a well-produced documentary that starts off quite informatively by calling out how corporations use various methods to reinforce the narrative that they are socially responsible and helping the planet while simultaneously putting profits before anything. Great point made about how banks (JP Morgan is called out specifically) responsible for the 2008 crisis fancied themselves as ""saviours"" in the fallout by investing in a place like Detroit, where they stand to make a bundle either way. It also makes good points about corporate tax evasion and influence of their money in politics.It really only tells one side of the story in most cases it studies however, which is a strongly socialist perspective. I'm not saying that's wrong as I myself support certain socialist ideas, but it's worth noting the politics of those being interviewed is overwhelmingly left-wing. As a result, it's more of a one-sided conversation, which is quite disappointing and a bit preachy to the viewer. As with any contemporary media these days, it also had to throw in a jab at Trump supporters because apparently they all support corporate greed and blame their struggles on minorities.My biggest qualm is that in the last half or so it jumps from topic to topic, mostly socialist talking points, that are essentially unrelated to corporations aside from the Australian coal company. It's like I was watching a completely different documentary and it felt more like disorganized propaganda at that point.First half, 7.5/10. Second half, 3/10. I really wish they would have gone into more depth on a couple of topics as opposed to just briefly giving left-leaning viewpoints on a cherry-picked assortment of social, economic, and political topics. It was reasonably interesting overall though, so it gets a 6.",False
2,8,"Trigger Warning for ""Socialism"" (apparently?)",kahnwiley-839-496081,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm amazed by the number of reviewers who were surprised to find ""socialist"" or ""left-leaning"" commentators being interviewed for this documentary--especially those reviewers who mention the original documentary favorably. Since the thesis of the documentary is (essentially) that corporations are dangerous, I'm not sure who else they expected to be interviewed. The film features some of the same interviewees from the first film: Robert Reich, Naomi Klein, Noam Chomsky, Vandana Shiva, and so on. It does also feature a couple corporate representatives, but not the number that were featured in the longer and more in-depth first documentary.As the film indicates with clips from Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Milton Friedman, since the 1970's, a market-based neoliberal philosophy has come to dominate political dialogue to the point that de-regulation is a central mantra of conservatives the world over (not to mention most centrist liberals). I would challenge these reviewers who demand a more ""fair and balanced"" presentation to scour the internet for a mainstream right-wing politician, thinker or activist that is strongly against corporate consolidation of power. You won't find one. It would be difficult, but not impossible, do do so within the mainstream centrists (Democrats in the US, or liberal parties in other countries), as well.On the other hand, if the demand is to present these interviews alongside those who speak on behalf of the corporation, we certainly don't need further examples of that: our lives are inundated with constant pro-corporate messages, whether explicitly in advertising, or implicitly in the various privatized systems we have to navigate on an everyday basis--you are reading this review on a website that has been owned by Amazon since 1998. The pro-corporate perspective is also represented in the first film, which is more broadly about the history of corporations and their general methods of operation; this ""sequel"" feels more like an addendum or appendix than something to be viewed in a vacuum. In other words, if you haven't seen the first film, you should watch that first, as it is certainly still relevant and revealing.Chris Hedges is correct that it is hard to view the complex of issues presented currently without feeling a deep sense of despair. I think that is why the second half of the film, which I see here derided by others, is both important, and ironically the subject of such angst. We are at an impasse and many of us feel powerless to counteract global forces that seem to be spiraling toward inevitable destruction. To present this documentary without some iota of hope would not only be depressing, it would be irresponsible. In the internet age, where raising someone's ire is the surest way to generate traffic, and therefore revenue, we should take at least some time to focus on the causes that bring us together, not just the ones that piss us all off.",False
3,6,The unfortunately (un)necessary sequel,entourage2223,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching the corporation (2003) before this sequel, I'm not sure how these two documentaries can be comparable to each other. One describes in depth what corporations are and how they have impacted the world, while this new film doesn't speak of corporations almost at all.We all know from the first film what corporations have done, and other documentaries have informed us of the culmination of what happens in a society that is now corporate controlled. I'm talking about the financial crisis movies that have shown what corps can do with their power. As well as the social dilemma, and Edward Snowden docs which highlight what corporations are doing which is mining our information. Finally climate docs which highlight how unchecked stripping of resources destroys ecosystems.This documentary however is basically an overview of what we know and what has been released previously, while also giving an overview of recent historical uprisings/protests.Overall I really don't think this doc was as informative and crucial as the first. We all know by now that corps control the world, and that the gap between the haves and the have nots is widening. This doesn't give much insight as to the change that is suggested throughout. Intense capitalism and intense socialism are the current state of affairs, and will be until there is a state which doesn't value competition between anyone, at all.Only a certain amount of $ and collectivism can do that. So all out socialism can only work through a manifestation of current capitalism to suit the collective. Those with the most power are the only ones that can do this, so siding against the corps (which seems to be the message here) isn't going to do any good, imho.Ricky Meffe review.

4,9,Necessary watch,jellopuke,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to now how we got here and the terrible road we're headed down, watch this. If you're blinded by ideology and don't come away with something, then you're a lost cause. If not, this should galvanize you at least somewhat.",False
5,7,Fake reviewers here,virginiacottrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't normally write feedback on fake reviews but these are so obvious its not funny. To name democrats and in particular to call ""Kshama Sawant a socialist, but an evil one at that""...... is ridiculous. A right wing opinion that brings politics into a review of a movie/documentary is not right.Now I will watch this and review it properly.",False
6,10,A Very Good Follow-Up,bobbydeekhakeh-98441,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, it has a center-left ""bias.""But given that corporations are only endlessly supported by the right, that should have been obvious!",False
7,7,"Radical socialists? LOL - Nah, this film pulls too many punches",bnitcamela,n/a,16/08/2025,"90% of the negative reviewers either didn't watch the movie or came into it with a decidedly anti-socialism (a word that they couldn't define in real world terms) bent and pro-capitalism mindset.For one thing, the movie is OK. Points out how big banks and corporations have taken to hiding behind the ""social justice"" messages they've cribbed from whatever actual movement is convenient for them at a given time. They don't pick the best interview subjects (we've all heard Bernie ""Sheepdog"" Sanders and AOC's (correct) spiels before). They could have sought out people like Howie Hawkins or other less-well-known advocates for *actual* socialism and for reining in the power that these organizations exercise over our government through dark money, lobbying, insider-trading and outright bribery.Nobody including negative reviewers cares to point out how ""crony capitalism"" and ""corporate capitalism"" are any different from each other because they haven't done the homework or read authors like Michael Hudson or seen movies like ""The Wobblies"" about the IWW. If they had, they'd know what the ""Overton Window"" is and that it was in fact ""radical left-wing socialists"" who are responsible for the end of child labor and the 8 hour work day among many other things including the New Deal which - unlike the bailouts of too-big-to-jail banks in 2008 - bailed out the American working class and set up bulwarks against monopolistic, unethical corporate practices. The Republicans starting with Reagan and continuing through Democrats like Clinton systematically tore down as much of that as they could on behalf of their financial/corporate masters (buy bye Glass-Steagall!!! Hello NAFTA!!!) and in the same time period the Overton Window has intentionally been shifted to the right with even Starbucks baristas forming unions portrayed as ""radical leftists"" trying to bring down capitalism (also, why do people insist on capitalizing that word as though it's a proper noun? I'll tell you - the consistent, constant propaganda paid for by the big banks/corps and unwittingly consumed and absorbed by the would-be working class).Take away the Overton Window and there's absolutely zero ""left-wing"" or ""radical left"" to this film. Anyone who called Obama a leftist should not be trusted to objectively review it. All in all, the Necessary Sequel is a bit of a let-down from the previous movie, but worth watching if you can do so with an open mind (something far too many of my closed-minded ""conservative"" friends think they have, but really don't, thanks to YouTube influencers and the like).",False
8,6,Unfortunately have to echo other reviewers' disappointment,vithiet,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really liked the original The Corporation, so I was excited about this follow up. However, as many have mentioned this sequel is less of a documentary and more of a socialist propaganda; even if you agree with everything that is said and presented here (and as a left leaning person myself, I totally do), it offers very little in terms of an actual unbiased look at corporations like the first film did. In the end worth the watch if you are on the left side of the political spectrum, but know that it might end up just being another piece of your echo chamber.",False
9,3,Some superb passages but the latter half is half-baked.,bobby007,n/a,16/08/2025,"Starts off well for the first hour, in that it's a continuation of the brilliance of the first film. And had it stuck to that it would be fine. But then it weaves into an unsubtle tirade against people who believe in the nation state as a safety mechanism, but sees them as reactionary against the financial collapse of the last four decades. Maybe they don't like their children being told that there are 100 genders, as the BBC recently put on their website for children.It makes a bit of a comeback when looking at Spanish home evictions but then goes into radical climate change, with some commentators mentioning identity politics, which is a form of racism. It also doesn't differentiate between capitalism and Crony Corporate Capitalism. The former being responsible for the largest lifting of poverty in history, the latter- a horrendous crime against civilization.Overall superb for an hour and then defused and unfocused.",False
10,7,"Poignant, but unuanced/unfocussed in places",Grimrikk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Quite an interesting documentary to watch, it does highlight the state of affairs with crony-capitalism and how it's making us point fingers at each other, rather than a bunch of massive global corporations which are reaping huge profits off the back of our taxes and simultaneously lowing our standards of living. We've been sold out by people in our governments, and will be worked to death to fund what amounts to corporate socialism.It does lose focus at points, and repeats in a few places but overall I did enjoy watching it.",False
11,3,Recap.,newsound,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some blood-boiling moments, but basically a recap of the last 5 years. You would think as a Canadian production this doc would be more in focus and have an actual point.",False
12,6,biased yet interesting,mbrcf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though I'm totally on the capitalism-hating boundwagon, it's still hard to rate this film as a documentary regarding an unbiased, neutral look at a relative subject. Being essentially an open love letter to Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and all socialist activists in the west world, and likewise zealously bashing and pounding on Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc, this film shouldn't be sorted as a documentary.How this film works, however, is regarded as an essay film which theorises certain attributes towards the ""giant"" corporations and their devastating and deadly effects on the present world, just ""for a few dollars more"". In this standpoint, the film is a wholesome and comprehensive work for it points out several pitfalls and valid issues within those corporations, builds up a hypothesis to generalize their conducts, and in the final third part arrives at a fully fleshed-out solution.If you are looking for a documentary presenting or representing facts and realities, then this film is likely to disappoint. But if you are looking for a totally biased explanation and analysis of our modern universe, then this is definitely something to consider.",False
13,7,A good but imperfect sequel,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"A sequel to a 2003 documentary I first saw back in high school, the 17 years between that film and its sequel has certainly given The New Corporation a great deal of material to cover in its 106-minute runtime. It argues that corporations have become sneakier and more fake-friendly since the 2010s, seeing as tides have changed a little, and the blatant disregard for human lives isn't something they're able to get away with as easily (the 2003 original spent almost 2.5 hours diagnosing the corporation as a psychopath, or at least saying the concept of a corporation would be a psychopath if it were a person).With a great deal of topics and issues to tackle, The New Corporation is worryingly scattershot at first. It doesn't always feel like it has much of a reason for existing in its opening scenes, and feels underwhelming and a little tired as a result. It does considerably pick up steam at a point, and thankfully became very interesting after its shaky start. It takes some complicated, difficult ideas and explains them very well; certainly in a more competent and understandable way than some YouTube videos I've seen on issues surrounding capitalism and corporate influence on politics.I feel like it reverts to the messiness of the opening scenes in its closing scenes, unfortunately. It covers some 2020 events that are important issues, but doesn't always do the best job at linking them to issues surrounding corporations (there should be documentaries about the George Floyd protests, but maybe not this documentary - there are some loose connections to the main issues of The New Corporation, but it's not as relevant as some of the other things discussed).It does also let a few politicians off the hook, but the fact it often comes back to ""the system doesn't work; we need a new system"" makes the criticisms of conservatives feel less pro-centre-left and more just against the system that lets conservative parties do damage. Others may feel differently, though; that's to be expected when politics enter into a documentary, but I don't think they could've avoided getting political altogether here.",False
14,6,"Informational, but analysis is a little off",The_Mucker,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an informational documentary that gives quite a few facts. However, the analysis and corrolation of the information is not exactly right. Much of their argument regarding causation is incorrect. Nobody in this documentary discusses how corporations actually work and they barely touch how the government collusion with corporations is the crux of the main problem of today's society. If you listen to these people, you would think that corporation are all evil and they will make money at everybody's expense. But nobody in this doc understands that businesses that do not collude with the government (and are not saved by the government when they make huge mistakes) actually survive by adjusting to the consumers' wants and needs.I do agree that the corps are defiantely feeding into the narcissism. A market society is part of the intrusion of personal data... and this is where government is colluding with the big business vs what government is supposed to do (which is protect their citizen).Should highly successful companies pay more to their employees? Should CEOs make less money if their company is highly successful? It is an interesting issue to consider.There are some individuals on the doc that are socialists. There is a socialist agenda to this movie. If you are going to watch this, make sure to take notes and research the data yourself. Analyze the information and understand the corrolations. It does take some serious effort, but I think you willbe better off.",True
15,5,An Unfortunate Disappointment,ryanpersaud-59415,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe original The Corporation was a fantastic documentary with a killer concept. This films starts off by investigating the NEW corporation, by looking at corporate social responsibility and woke corporate advertising. It felt like a perfect place to pick up, as the Corporation tries to ""rehabilitate"" its image. I remember thinking "" I can't wait till we get to talk about big Tech and corporate personalities on on social media etc ""And then. The movie becomes socialist propaganda. I don't say this as a rabid right winger, but the movie barely discusses its subject matter. We don't get an investigation into the ""institutions of its time,"" but a call to action to vote for Socialists. It just doesn't really feel like a sequel and it abandons the most interesting aspect of its narrative a quarter if a way through. Very disappointed.",True
16,7,Obvious bias with hidden messages,xplosivemetal,n/a,16/08/2025,I watched this after seeing a few minutes half way through the film. It ended up being a lot more biased than I thought however if you piece it all together there are some serious hidden messages. You really need to watch this with an open mind and think outside of the box 😉,False
17,1,The unfortunately biased socialist sequel,buggsi,n/a,16/08/2025,"The original The Corporation (2003) was a great eye-opening documentary that I rewatched many times. In this sequel, the premise continues where The Corporation left off, underligning how corporations cut corners to boost profits at the expense of human lives, privacy and safety. But suddenly, the narrative shifts into a left-wing socialist propaganda: CNN and MSNBC headlines, anti-Trump sentiment, pro-Bernie Sanders, AOC speeches, Greta Thunberg, social justice nuts and other political bs like climate change, tax the rich, blame the ""whiteness"" and even George Floyd! What the hell does George Floyd have anything to do with corporations??? Totally unrelated topic. The documentary loses focus and becomes a political discourse. I was going to give it a 10/10, but it became a shit show tool for socialism. Very disappointing.",False
18,2,Camouflaged Hypocrisy,RodMartinJr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary covers some important ground on the inevitable evils of ALL Publicly-Traded corporations, but too easily glosses over the differences between the public and the private varieties. Conflating free market capitalism with toxic, crony capitalism is not only wrong, it's dishonest in the extreme.This film does the same thing it accuses the big, public corporations of doing -- using Appeals to Emotion to sell ideas that are themselves false.Take minimum wage, for instance. Thomas Sowell, once a Marxist and a junior employee at the Department of Labor in the federal government, found out the hard way that Big Government, like Big Corporations, DO NOT CARE about the people they serve. Sowell, like some doe-eyed school boy, wanted to test the hypothesis that minimum wage was doing some good for the poor. To his dismay, the government bureaucrats panicked at the idea that their prized cash cow could be jeopardized by this young upstart. They didn't care whether or not minimum wage worked. They only wanted continuity for their cushy jobs.Minimum wage betrays the basic tenet upon which civilization and prosperity are built: ADDING VALUE. Rewarding value added is the cornerstone of all aspects of civilization and commerce. Rewarding an employee just because they are there, no matter what value they add, is anti-civilization, anti-human and anti-logic.Bravo, Thomas Sowell! An underrated scholar because the Leftist Media views him as a threat. He speaks on the level of his white counterparts and pokes holes in their faulty logic! The Left prefers the ""victim class"" to stay being victims.Caring about the environment is a good thing and needs to be much more than a corporate PR trick. This is one of the good points of this film, elevating it from a ""1"" to a ""2."" But what this film entirely missed is that the ""climate change"" alarm ""movement"" was created by Biggest Oil Rockefellers and their UN front man, the late Maurice Strong (alumnus of Canadian Big Oil). Oh, the irony! The makes of this film and the movement they cozy up to are being played by the Globalist-Leftist Owners of the Big Corporations. This is 5D Chess at its most Machiavellian.What the loopy, ""we care"" crowd completely miss is that Global Warming in an ongoing Ice Age is a good thing; quite the opposite of their narrative. In fact, we currently live in the MOST PROSPEROUS period in human history, partly because of the increased warmth, increased CO2 as well as the technology. The Big Corporate NEWS media is complicit in this false propaganda. That the ""we care"" crowd distrust Big Corporations is a good thing; but then they get their views, beliefs and science from the very same Big Corporations! Groan!People need to become aware of the things mentioned in this film, but they need to go further. They need to become critically self-aware (which the makers of this film did NOT do). Thus, this film is more propaganda than illumination. Yet, don't throw out the baby with the foul bath water.ALL publicly-traded corporations are, by law, egregiously evil. They have to be. That is their nature. They would be breaking the law and their fiduciary duty if they did otherwise. Customers and the environment, as priorities, come in at a distant 6th and 7th place, after shareholders, top execs, real estate and equipment, intellectual properties and employees.One of the big flaws with this and most other similar documentaries is that they tell half of the story, which acts to polarize society, rather than healing society. By conflating the good with the bad, and glamorizing the False Solutions, they prove one of two things: Either, that they are logically incompetent, or that they are working for the common enemy of humanity -- those who would divide us along opposing half-truths.",False
19,3,"More like the ""Confused, Hypocritical and Unnecessary Sequel""",bertorecuerza,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this documentary, my thoughts were summed up well by the reviews written by @bobby007 and @RodMartinJrThis documentary seems to confuse the point it is trying to make. Highly slanted as one would expect, but then basically loses all credibility, by fighting itself. As @bobby007 said, the first hour is good and raises good points. It starts off talking about the World Economic Forum and Klaus Schwab and their evils...and then glorifies Bernie Sanders and Alexandra Ocasio Cortez and obviously wants you to vote socialist. They even still seem to give a little credibility to Greta Thunberg in one short clip.And if you don't know why this all would be hypocritical, look at what the WEF is actually trying to do and the socialist (downright totalitarian communist rhetoric) being dropped by Klaus Schwab. And then look into his father and see where he gets it from. They are basically trying to sell you on the nicer side of the same coin. Instead of actually wanting to give the power back to the citizens, they want to take the power from the corporations, give it to a bigger government , but give a higher minimum wage that you'll have to pay back in taxes.",False

Well produced but totally and utterly biased.Problem after problem is presented from wealth equality, racism, climate change, corona virus, privatization of every industry, Islamaphobia, Homophobia but like all of these myopic views, these are all caused by corporations that have a connection to all right wing politics and the culmination of the whole thing gets down to Trump being the anti christ and it is all caused by the middle aged white male.In the end what started off as having some merit turns into an anti Trump, white superiority rhetoric and little to do with corporations.",False

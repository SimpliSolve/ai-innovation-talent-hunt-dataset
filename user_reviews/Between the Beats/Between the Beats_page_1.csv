1,8,Delivered on Historical Insights,granite-44537,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI liked it.I never attended a rave but did dance in gay SF nightclubs and beach bonfire circles under the full moon. In my experience, the open-hearted vibe described by the ravers and DJs interviewed could also be found ""in the air"" of some clubs and bonfire circles even without the drugs and the 2 a.m. Start times the raves were mostly known for.I haven't been to Burning Man but knew it existed first as a wicker-man burn at Baker Beach. This documentary mentions the name Black Rock as originally a point on the beach, before the Burn was moved from Baker Beach to the desert, Black Rock desert / playa.Thank you to the makers of the movie and those who shared their stories in the interviews; it filled in many gaps for me of all that was going on during that special time in the SF Bay Area.",True
2,10,"Raver from 1991. I identify as ""light and motion""",BradypauljasonGamble,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary perfectly captures the spirit of the Rave scene. Excellent film footage of dancers cutting loose and feeling the music, and I miss that. Stirred emotions I rarely fell going out now. Gave me goose bumps and almost brought tears multiple times. I remember, I know, I feel the music and the music feels me. Luckily I met a girl 28 years ago who also knows and made her my wife. We still go out occasionally and dance. The interviews clearly articulated the feelings and spirituality of what was happening on the dance floor caused by the music, the vibrations of the dancers and the DJ's. ""Did the party go off"". In the beginning there was House and I know where the house is. Lots of love.",False
3,n/a,Each generation little different but ever so much more special than the last.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust the current generation remembering their personal golden years through a very narrow lens.Hearing that opening about how this replaces that which gave way to this then this then that and now us...
A tired childs cry of ME is the most ME thats ever MEd anywhere as an US. Yet they are all the same generational counterculture drug fueled movements of their own day.The main themes that often go hand in hand with such groups like unstable atypical upbringing or trauma abuse buried this and that and of course heavy escapism and substance use. Foundational themes in the explosion or perhaps rather natural displacement of the old by the new. The new latest disco cocaine fueled party scene today the digital dance rave music scene often populated with heavy sex and drugs abuse.Seeing the old adult personalities who were in heart and soul remembering only the shiny more mainstream positive aspects is no less silly than any movement viewed at a distance back through the decades into the past.Id say its either your thing or it isn't but the genre and documentary bring nothing new to the table whatsoever and little insight as nothing has changed and this is quite old news retold by the now doubly old often adult versions or more of those who lived it in their prime years.I hope someone at least made a buck off it.",True

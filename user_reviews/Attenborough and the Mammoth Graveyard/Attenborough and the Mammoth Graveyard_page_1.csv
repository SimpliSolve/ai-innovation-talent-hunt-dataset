1,7,No Bones About It...,owen-watts,n/a,16/08/2025,"Essentially a Digging for Britain episode with Attenborough in it which gives it a strange sort of magic. A nice enough documentary and good to see the combination of paleo and archaeo at work, but it's given a strange melancholic edge with the ""before"" and ""after"" (or should that be ""during"") vibe of filming. Attenborough is sprightly, cheeky and bounding about the place in the 2019 segment but (logically) withdrawn in the second and replaced with the chirpy Prof Ben Garrod. Our very own living fossil is moving into history, right in front of our eyes.",False
2,9,Wonderful interesting programme,bsconsulting,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent programme that made what could be a dry subject come to life with human interest and reconstructions. Attenborough is always an enthusiastic and charismatic presenter, and the co-presenter also did a great job.",False
3,9,"Attenborough and BBC, is a wild combination.",drshyamsonecha,n/a,16/08/2025,"They make it so be beautifully interesting that even if you have zero knowledge of the field, you'll just sit for those 59 minutes, might even blink less just to catch amazing cinematographics.",False
4,9,A Mammoth so Close to Us!,vzaidman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent documentary about the excavation of a site where a Mammoth was found and later a whole range of flora and fauna.I liked the infographics around different types of species and periods. This is a great introduction to pre-history.Also the specialists interviewed in the film explain the different aspects of the site in a clear manner.I think this is an inspiring movie for children to watch-
Both because they should know what great things lie in the ground, sometimes just next to their homes, and because they should know that we proper education they can one day participate in this trilling uncovering of the past.",False

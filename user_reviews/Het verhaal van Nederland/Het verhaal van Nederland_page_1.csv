1,9,Very good,markvanwasbeek,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show details the history of the Netherlands ofcourse. But it's done in an original way. Story teller Daan Schuurmans tells the story as he walks into historical scenes, blending the story telling with the situations as they are played out. For a Dutch production it looks like it has a high production value, which helps a lot in historical scenes. A must see for kids in school, or someone who is interested to learn about Dutch history.",False

3,1,Rather very disappointing,Alexander_Stukenberg,n/a,15/08/2025,Here the maker miss the chance to tell the story of the Netherlands - but it end up in endless love stories though each episode.The explanations of the historians are good but could be longer / cut out the scenery shoots of the Netherlands that are way to long.,False

10,10,You will love this film!,natalienixon,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is an exquisite, honest, and heartwarming depiction stuttering and a tender look into the lives of those who stutter. As someone who has worked with several individuals who stutter I am so grateful for projects like this that raise awareness and bring knowledge and first hand perspective to this issue. It's amazing to see the effect that places like Camp Say can have on the lives of kids and teens, many of whom have never met another person who stutters. This film is full of beautiful stories of struggle, self-confidence, friendship, and the kind of compassion we should all be showing each other when it comes to our differences. I highly encourage everyone to watch it.",False
11,10,Excellent film,stracey-39377,n/a,17/08/2025,I saw this movie with my son as part of his virtual summer camp. We were both moved to happy tears.

12,10,A Must Watch,wwd-98559,n/a,17/08/2025,"Ryan Gielen has created a beautiful work to understand the lives of young people who stutter. If you stutter or not, this film is for you. We're all different and have our own life struggles. Ryan's film powerfully tells the story of one struggle, but has an important message for how we should treat all those around us.",False
13,10,Amazing,grandcandy,n/a,17/08/2025,Such a moving and heartfelt movie. Everyone should watch this movie to get a new perspective on what others go through when they have a stutter or a loved one who stutters. Eye opening,False
14,10,NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS,sanders-donny,n/a,17/08/2025,Blown away by this film honestly. Hearing these kids stories took me back to my childhood. I stutter and I know how kids can be cruel. I always wished my stutter would go away. I never met another person that stutters until after college and I felt so alone with my stutter for so long. The empowerment and family support this camp gives these kids is something I never experienced or could have ever imagined.,False
15,10,Wonderful movie!!,choirguy-21745,n/a,17/08/2025,"I've had the privilege to see this movie twice and I would gladly watch it again!!! It is such a powerful and touching movie. A MUST for any school teacher who has, or may have, students who stutter! As a choir teacher, I understand how singing can be so helpful for those who stutter but to realize the depth of how these young adults and children are made to feel can be heartbreaking at times. Thank you for an exceptional movie!!!",False
16,10,Such an important message for kids and adults alike!,wgabagat,n/a,17/08/2025,"As a parent and a speech language pathologist, this film really touched my heart and brought up questions I've sometimes struggled with over my 15 years working with students. I've been so fortunate to work with many families who, like in this film, have come to accept their children for who they are and who don't see stuttering as something that needs to be ""fixed."" At the same time, I can also understand the perspective of parents who want their child to be a fluent speaker. The individual stories that were shared in this film were so inspiring (I cried both times that I watched it) and were voices that we don't often get to, but clearly need to hear. In the end, I didn't think this film was about stuttering. To me, the underlying messages of acceptance, authenticity and connection really stood out. I am hopeful that this film will help start and guide more conversations among parents, families, SLPs, and peers on how the individuals who stutter feel and the importance of what they have to say versus how they communicate it. Thank you so much for this beautiful film! I can't wait for everyone to see this!",False
17,10,Spectacular,shiranisrael,n/a,17/08/2025,"Cried my eyes out.
Such an important message to carry out to people who stutter, their families and SLPs.",False
18,10,A MUST SEE!,genise-54319,n/a,17/08/2025,"Incredibly touching documentary that gets to the HEART of stuttering: courage, connections, support and acceptance. As a Speech-Language Pathologist, I feel this is a very powerful film that our schools and communities at large should see.",False

1,7,"It's a slow burn, but it has some great moments",katedejonge,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's Coming is a true documentary about a mother who believes her home is haunted. If you're into paranormal investigation shows, be warned that this is not your usual fare. There are no teams of people wandering around in the dark, freaking out over every thump and shadow. This film shows the raw anxiety and exhaustion of a mother who has never felt like she could speak about the things she sees, and now she's afraid that something bad is trying to take her son. There are no special effects, but things DO happen on camera. If you have patience, it's really worth watching.The use of an XBox Kinect camera to scan for spirits was brilliant. Now I need to find one to add to my kit!",False
2,3,I'm a huge paranormal fan. This is just awful.,durbry,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't know where to begin. There's not really any evidence to speak of. Then a 'psychic' shows up and doesn't really do anything other then saging, and giving a few tired tropes. Then a couple shows up to do a clearing, mentioning that's there's possession, although that was never talked about.I honestly don't know how this got good reviews.I watch a lot of paranormal shows, and have done investigations as well. This was just not worth the $5 I paid to watch it.The family talks about seeing a dark shadow, and hearing noises. The boy called the Spirit 'Kitty'. It's just dull and uninteresting.",True

1,8,"Under stars and billowing clouds, a world away",evening1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSome 28,000 indigenous people inhabit the rainforest between Venezuela and Brazil, and their survival depends on outsiders respecting the eons-old gathering place.This stunning documentary introduces a people who live communally amidst nature -- lowering racks of bananas from trees, hunting peccary, and taking their rest in hammocks, all within the glow of crackling fires.For untold generations, the Yanomami were self-sustaining, but in the mid-1970s, governments opened their territory to miners who have pillaged the soil, polluted the rivers, and brought disease to a people who turn to shamans for cures.""We emerged from the vulva of Mother Earth, and are therefore her children,"" we're told. ""Before you raided our lands, we lived well!""Life has a different pace where stone mountains pierce clouds that can empty themselves ferociously. The film begins with a band of Yanomami of all ages walking through greenery and calls of nature, carrying spears, arrows, and even a rifle. How long it takes them to reach the camera testifies to the otherworldly cadence of this existence.An old man admits that he speaks to the film crew out of hope that they can halt the destruction.""Will you defend my grandchildren?"" he asks.Two men squat on the ground, rocking in a hypnotic chant. What is it about? Very little is explained in this narration-less production, and perhaps that's good. The viewer's own eyes and ears will find their truth.I first heard about the Yanomami in the 1970s as an undergraduate at Penn State, when, as a reporter for the student newspaper, I interviewed Napoleon Chagnon, an anthropologist who studied the people as an adopted ""nephew.""Almost 50 years later, I was fortunate to view this film at New York's Museum of Modern Art, where co-director Gabriela Carneiro da Cunha said she isn't ""a fan of guilt,"" but rather hopes that the non-indigenous will ""work together with them.""Let's hope so. May timeless, precious cultures thrive!",True

1,10,Inspiring & Authentic,superbiagt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although the subject is deep, the tone of voice is so warm, authentic and inspiring. The plot has twists and is not predictable. If you're into artsy intimate documentaries, you will dig this one.We're in 2022 and yet discussing social normative issues such as the necessity of marriage, social pressure over relationships and kids, all over the world. Freeing ourselves needs a new perspective and this documentary absolutely contributes to this phenomenon.Technically, I love the music and sound design. I had chance to talk with the crew about their sound process. I know they worked with different types of cameras and sound recorders and yet it's almost impossible to feel that. Very professionally edited...",False
2,9,Expecting a Grain of Sand.,yigitzehra-59408,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn her film, Akdag depicts the social prejudices against an unmarried woman who becomes pregnant, the difficulties a woman faces in a patriarchal society, and the disappointments she experiences, but also shows the support she receives from those around during this process. In this way, she reevaluates the definition of the institution of family and shows the contradictions in the idealised definition in society. Akdag tells, writes and shoots her own story and thus, in a way, owns her own life.I would like to share one of my favourite dialogues from the film When I look back, I want to say many things to this little girl. Don't feel sorry for anything. Life is beautiful in spite of everything. Don't believe people who say tears are weakness. Cherish the moments. Spend time with your family. Have real friends. Dance, laugh, love. Live without fear. Listen. Feel. Fall in love. Know how to give up. And pursue it passionately.",True

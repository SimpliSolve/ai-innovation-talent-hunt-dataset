1,n/a,Puts a smile on your face,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This might not be the most dramatic or moving surf docu (like kissed by god or momentum generation) nor the best big wave surf movie (riding giants) but if you like surfing - do watch it. Laura's personality and the great editing and music make this a worthwhile watch. I especially enjoyed some more background on the right in WA. Good length too, rather than trying to stretch it out to 90 or 100min. Hats off to Laura both for the surfing and the movie producing skills.",False

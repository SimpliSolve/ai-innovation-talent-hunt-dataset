1,6,Kevin Hart was unwatchable,JAS0NTURNER,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerLove a good roast...but Kevin Hart seemed to be coming from the wrong place. Instead of cleverly telling jokes he just skipped to easy laughs. I suggest watching it with your remote ready to fast forward anytime you see Kevin's face.Also having Kim Kardashian up there was strange. She did a good reading the jokes that were given to her but if you think of the fact that she took a professionals spot...it gets depressing.Tom was a good sport but man oh man his family took a few hits. I know it's fair game but it seemed like the talent ran out of other things to make fun of...because they kept coming back to his ex wife and kids.,True
2,6,Inconsistent At Best,mchl88,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like most roasts it was inconsistent. There were some hysterical moments and some boring moments. The professional comics were all pretty good with Nikki Glaser and Jeffrey Ross really standing out. The athletes were ok too with some of them (Julian Edelman and Drew Bledsoe) being surprisingly funny. Ben Affleck was a complete waste of time (what's he so angry about?). Brady's closing was solid!You can't watch something like this if you're easily offended. As Kevin Hart said in his intro, sometimes you just have to make the uncomfortable comfortable. Not everyone can do that or even wants to and that's ok. But for those who think offending everyone means offending no one, you'd probably enjoy this, especially if Netflix releases a 90 minute edit of the best momentsIf you watched it, what are your thoughts?",False
3,7,Some great stuff but WAY too long,lmt_is_me,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere were many good and bad things about this roast. More good than bad. I agree with some of the other reviews but think some people don't know what is roast is about. Let's separate the good and the bad.GoodTom Brady appears to have a sense of humorKevin Hart is pretty funny but were their timing issues?Drew made me laugh. Some of the other football guys were pretty funny.Nicki is incredibly funny. Thank god she was there.Bill B there was pretty funny and he can take a good joke at his expense.MehTom certainly felt some ire with Jeff's jokes. Remember they are just jokes. Don't sign up for a roast if you are going to say ""Don't say that again"".Way too long. I love roasts but geez an actual beef roast cooks faster than this roast.This is a tough one. I don't think people should joke about Aaron at all. I know I have heard that everything is okay to joke about if you are a comedian. Here I found it was not funny. But talking with some friends, they found it hilariousWas the only reason Kim K was there to make black dick jokes? Having her there (and also she was booed so much) seemed out of place but perhaps that is just me.I wonder why Lisa Lampanelli was not there. She is amazing at roasting. Where was Anthony Jeselnik? You know Martha Stewart savagely roasted Justin Bieber. She would have been amazing too.",True
4,10,Hopefully The First Of Many Netflix Roasts,baritoneastoria,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was an absolutely superb live, sold out show on Netflix, first aired on May 5, 2024. I just finished watching it for the first time, and it won't be the last. I highly recommend this roast for all football fans, comedy fans and/or roast fans. I don't even like football and I LOVED it!Excellent production here, it looked spectacular, cool graphics, with a great variety of guests (comedians, football players, actors, etc.) Many of the jokes were killers and the show was uncensored, with plenty of time, nothing rushed.Kevin Hart did a decent job hosting. Nikki Glaser and Tony Hinchcliffe absolutely killed!!! They should get Tony to host the next Netflix Roast.",False
5,10,"Jeff Ross was right, Brady isn't a chicken",akjunkmail,n/a,16/08/2025,"The world needs more roasts and more of this kind of comedy.Seeing some people trying to bash this because of one or two specific moments they ""didn't like"" shows how sensitive people can be. It's a 3 hour live program where you have big names on the stage with jokes hitting left and right. No comedy will have a 100% hit rate for 100% of people, but that's just comedy. If you expect all comedy to be funny all of the time then you don't understand comedy.The whole roast harkens back to the CC roasts of old times which feels so refreshing to see in the world of PC and disproportionate negative reactions to any and all kinds of jokes.Props to Netflix for setting this up and having a real gem of a roast. Hoping this opens the door up for more of these kind of roasts in the future.",False
6,n/a,Lame,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Roasts, as they've been done for the last 15 years or so, are pale imitations of the roasts of days past.Today they're simply how nasty can you be using the most vile language delivered by someone that probably has no idea who they're roasting.Roasters having no relationship, friend or otherwise, with Tom compete to see who's the funniest with jokes that have no personalization other than to be raunchy, nasty attacks.Monologues with no substance other than sophomoric humor befitting middle school playground.I recall the roast of William Shatner with the same disdain for the pitiful (and despicable) line up of talking heads with nothing to offer than filth.What happened to well thought out insults that are funny, snarky, personal... all while still being delivered as a friendly poke in the eye by friends and colleagues? Sad testament to what the current generation considers funny.",False
7,7,Roasting a goat,d_penn,n/a,16/08/2025,"So like every Roast, there were some good and bad moments. I enjoy Kevin Hart, and loved his laughing at the really good zingers that were thrown at him.Nikki Glaser, Sam Jay, Drew Bledsow, and Julian Edelman ROCKED the Roast! Tony Hinchcliffe had some moments, as did Bill Belichick!Rest was really hit and miss with some moments that were so cringeworthy you could see Tom Brady's uncomfortableness, especially during Gronks piece. Even Kevin commented he was on something besides liquor.Not the BEST roast I've ever seen, but not the worst either..Definitely raunchy but I love it. Tom was kinda weak but it's acceptable.",False
8,9,People forget what roasts are...,kcitraro,n/a,16/08/2025,"There seems to be a bunch of purists on here who seem confused about what roasts are about. They are meant to offend and get in the gutter. If it's not for you? Why did you watch it? And better yet, why write a review based on your own biases? This is exactly what the world needs once in a while. A no holds barred roast that leaves no one left unoffended. We should all be able to laugh at ourselves and each other once in a while. I loved this show! I hope they do other people too. There are many others in a long list that we celebrate hating universally. This show is like a hall pass from political correctness. Nearly a perfect show. Just a few slow duds like Kim K or Randy Ross. Otherwise a 10!",False
9,6,Decent roast but skip the first ten minutes of Kevin Hart.,ray_pink,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOverall there were some high points to this roast especially Nikki who smashed it but Kevin Hart is absolutely awful makes it all about him, Are we not bored of this guy laughing more at his own jokes than anyone else? Truly awul comedian and the joke about him being the Rocks fleshlight was the only good thing about him being there. Shame Tom had to go to Jeff Ross in the middle also. Decent but way better roasts out there! Save yourself time and just watch the highlights on YouTube easily shave off a good hour of drivel! Most of the people on the stage didn't even get roasted too many people for a roast in my opinion and it just tends to fall flat most of the time.",True
10,9,Great comedy,cfadjuster,n/a,16/08/2025,My dad and I watched and he was saying comedy is back. Little did he know comedy I has been back and is in its hayday now! From start to finish the comedians and football players sets were top notch. Joke written by the players and actors and jokes written for them hit every step of the way. Nikki Glaser and Tony Bunch life were the best but Gronk and Edlemen were funny as hell. It was nice to see Bill Belichick in there being a good sport and Robert Kraft speaking so highly of the man the myth the legend THE GOAT Tom Brady. He was such a good sport listening all night while getting absolutely roasted!,False
11,6,Kevin hart falls flat,haydenbrown-24374,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan of comedy roasts, I eagerly tuned in to the Tom Brady Roast, hoping for an evening of sharp wit and hilarious jabs. While the roast delivered some memorable moments thanks to the incomparable Jeff Ross, it was unfortunately overshadowed by the lackluster hosting of Kevin Hart.Jeff Ross, known as the Roastmaster General, brought his A-game to the stage, delivering one blistering insult after another with his trademark razor-sharp humor. His timing was impeccable, and his ability to riff off the other roasters ensured that there was never a dull moment.However, the same cannot be said for Kevin Hart, whose hosting duties fell short of expectations. While Hart has found success in the entertainment industry, his performance as the host of the Tom Brady Roast left much to be desired. His jokes felt forced, his delivery was often grating, and his constant attempts to steal the spotlight grew tiresome quickly.One can't help but wonder how someone like Kevin Hart rose to fame in the comedy world. While humor is subjective, his style seems to rely more on volume and energy than genuine wit or cleverness. In a lineup of seasoned comedians, his presence felt out of place and ultimately detracted from the overall enjoyment of the event.In conclusion, the Tom Brady Roast had its moments of brilliance thanks to Jeff Ross and the talented roster of roasters, but Kevin Hart's subpar hosting detracted from what could have been a truly unforgettable evening.",False
12,10,Legendary Night!!,davidalvaradoreal,n/a,16/08/2025,"So fun watching this live, I absolutely plan to watch again. Brady is a legend for doing this; he's mostly a good sport but you can tell some of the jokes really hit close to home.I've never thought Kevin Hart was the funniest person, but he really did his job well keeping things moving and focusing on the funny. You have to know what a Host's job is to get why he was actually really good. He opened with strong jokes, presented himself as a target, clapped back when hit, and didn't make things awkward in a meta sense by pointing out the jokes/roasters that bombed.I've watched all the CC roasts, and of course if you spend weeks editing only the very best moments it will be a ""sharper"" product, but this event felt authentic and organic.Admittedly I'm a Patriots fan who knew every one of the deep references, but I give it a 10/10.",False
13,6,way too long,sometimelater,n/a,16/08/2025,"Huge mistake to not edit this bloated piece of vain garbage into an hour. Venue was way too big, absolutely zero charm. Felt like it was being broadcast from the moon. Oh, let's do it in an arena, bigger is better. Just total lameness. Having a 5'3"" attention pig was a mistake. Has a single person ever laughed at kevin hart? The walmart of stand up. Most jokes just so dumb and pointless, high school level roast, fitting for a QB. The constant repetition was painful, same dumb joke over and over. Must have been torture to attend. I can't imagine how boring it must've been live, and how bad the audio was. Killed all charm with bigness. A valid empty nothing. No wonder he regretted it, production flawed, likely due to greed.",False
14,2,WOAT - Tasteless and not funny,drjgardner,n/a,16/08/2025,"This may be the WOAT (Worst of all time). I can't recall a worse roast. First of all, it isn't funny. Not only is it not funny, the excessive cursing and screaming by Kevin Hart is simply gross. I'm not sure what happened to Kevin Hart - he used to be funny. The opening bit by Jeff Ross was humorless, and talk with less funny than he usually is. The ""roasts"" by the FB players may show the effects of years of being hit - not funny at all. The only one who was really funny was Nikki Glaser. Yes, she was a bit raunchy, but she was funny and that's what mattered - especially in such a humorless show. Avoid this one. It's not merely a waste of time, it's tasteless.",False
15,10,Best Roast Ever! 10/10,zephangilani,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not a sports fan, but the Roast of Tom Brady on Netflix was ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL. The event, featuring stars like Kevin Hart, Jeff Ross, Tom Segura, and Nikki Glaser, was a laughter riot from start to finish. Hart brought his A-game with energetic hosting and sharp dark humor. Glaser, first time ever seeing her but she came out like a machine gun with her biting wit. The highlight for me was Ron Burgundy's hilarious special appearance, adding to the night's entertainment. My wife and I laughed non-stop-it's a must-watch for anyone looking for non-stop humor and a fun evening!This roast took me back to when it was okay to laugh at things. Thank you Netflix.",True
16,9,The Roast Is BACK Baby!,papaconstantopoulos,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up watching these roasts on Comedy Central cable TV, and despite knowing next to nothing about the characters on stage, I loved nearly every roast through the kills and spills as its own unique form of comedy. Now, it's been 5 years, and after years of watching Netflix and YouTube internet comedy grow into its own, I can certifiably say The Roast series is back on top of the comedy world with this one.They packed so much gold into one (Netflix!) (live?!) presentation that I don't even know where to start. Not even a football fan, but I am a huge comedy nut, and who hasn't heard some great Brady jabs over the years. I used to be a big Kevin Hart hater, but honestly he got it figured out with this one. Segura & Bert I just can't handle for a second, and Glaser oh my god I wanted not to laugh so bad that I was actually crying by the end of her segment.If you even know just 2 or 3 people on that stage, I can guarantee you will walk away from this recording with your sides in outer orbit. Downright hilarious :)",False
17,6,Some big laughs,pfpgssx,n/a,16/08/2025,"There were several big laughs. Tom was a good sport, but what else could he do? I thought it was in very poor taste to bring up Giselle alleged cheating and calling Tom a bad dad. Even if they're jokes. He has kids for crying out loud. They don't need to see that, ever. So many comedians throw the f word around so much now it has little impact anymore. It's just lame, boring, and cheap when overused. It doesn't make anyone cool to say f this and f that repeatedly. I'm sorry Tom did this and wonder why he agreed to it. His family doesn't deserve this crap. Do better Netflix. Have some higher standards.",False
18,10,Massively exceeded expectations,adamobrien-75789,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI came into this expecting to hate this, and even when trying to remain as subjective as possible, I find it hard to shake that preconceived notion from my current viewing.Kevin Hart delivered strongly as a host. He punched hard and consistently without ever crossing the line (despite what Tom might say).The roasters were a mixed bag but generally the jokes hit. The NFL roasters could be expected to not be top tier comedians and generally they didn't deliver. On a side note I found Peyton Manning on other roasts to be genuinely hilarious.Seeing real comedians kill Bert was also heart warming. It's good to see you can't slip into comedy and be respected by your peers.Thoroughly enjoyable generally and exceeding expectations.",True
19,6,Some great passes but not to touch down,paudieconnolly,n/a,16/08/2025,Kevin Hart opened the show with amazing energy Kevin Hart brings everything to get the crowd going . When I seen the running time I feared there may be strong Moments and big gaps In between. Like a game of American football there was a great plays but a lot of downtime between plays . The greatest anchorman of all time Ron burgundy makes an appearance But the biggest play of the night must've come from Nikki Glaser with easily the best that I have seen her do on a roast Or even has a stand up by far her greatest moment. An easy watch With entertaining moments and great to see roasts back and people are taking themselves so seriously.,False
20,10,As good or better than past roasts,bwaters-87761,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis brings back memories of previous roasts, especially reminded me of roasters like Greg Giraldo, Anthony Jeselnik, Amy Schumer, Sarah Silverman, etc.The comedians and athletes did a great job of roasting Tom Brady. My top three were Nikki Glaser, Tony Hinchcliffe, and Andrew Schulz, who were incredible and reminiscent of the comedian roasters I listed above.Sure, there were parts I didn't like, I don't know that any show or movie that exists where I liked 100% of them, but that wouldn't make me give less of a star. For example, I wouldn't give movies like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas less of a score because some small parts were a little slow, because as a whole, they were incredible.That's the same reason I'm giving this a 10. Because as a whole, all three hours, were amazing. While some parts were a little slow and i wanted to fast forward but couldn't since it was live, I haven't laughed that hard at anything in a long time.A couple of people who got on stage were dull and one special guest Ben Affleck was particularly angry, but I couldn't believe how funny it was. It was just like back when Greg Giraldo was ripping into everyone without mercy. I actually think now Nikki Glaser could give him a run for his money, and that's saying something.",True
21,6,I have not seen a roast before now,Erik_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was interesting. From my understanding, a roast is supposed to be some sort of real camaraderie, banter and jokes from your colleagues and friends.This was obviously very staged and contrived.I no nothing about football or most of the people in the event, so some of the jokes didn't land with me, but most of the jokes weren't football related anThey did seem to make fun of each other, but what I found most entertaining was just how uncomfortable all these famous people were at having to smile and pretend laugh for hours straight.That's a real feat.Maybe that's what a roast is supposed to be?I was able to watch it all the way through, but only because I've already seen everything that I want to watch.",False
22,10,Killer Comedy Live- It really is the best roast ever.,zdcayson,n/a,16/08/2025,Kevin Hart is a spectacular MC. His improvisation and stage management skills keep it grounded. This was raw and refreshingly killer comedy with the gloves off. More of this please! This is the best comedy work anyone has done in a decade. Make this a thang. We need more of it. This should be a regular jam for comedians. Nikki Glaser destroyed everyone. Stop hating on Jeff Ross. He's the best at his niche. No one owns him.The comedy sets were razor sharp. Gronkowski stole the show as the biggest target and a wild card. So hilarious. It also had a real kind drama of reuniting the key dynasty members. What a gem.,False
23,7,Good roast for an awful human being,irial29,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bradys's total lack of imagination, flat punchlines, cringeworthy egocentric riffs and infuriatingly poor stage presence are the hallmarks of this self serving egomaniac's failed propaganda project.Luckily there is a competent supporting cast.Chalk this up to yet another failure of Tom Brady's, who has consistently underperformed at every one of life's challenges aside from playing the role of QB in the first act of his athletic profession.This serves a poignant reminder as to why having access to money and a camera does not make for good entertainment.Regardless of this failed attempt, Tom Brady will remain one of the most despised athletes in history.",False
24,1,A Disgrace!,DJM26,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not clever. Not funny. Just profane, obnoxious and trying way-too-hard to be shocking. These people don't know how to roast. I've never thought Kevin Hart was funny in anything-including those commercials. Where were all the people who know how to roast? Well the GOAT, Don Rickles, is dead. But we still have Billy Crystal, Ray Romano, Jerry Seinfeld, Craig Ferguson, Ricky Gervais and Letterman. People who could actually pull off a roast AND be funny!This show was cringeworthy, it was so bad. Did Affleck destroy what was left of his sorry career?!I read that Brady's ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, was complaining about the gutter-level of the show. I don't much like her, so I thought she was just being her usual mean-spirited self. Then I watched it and I sided with her 100%!Garbage!",False
25,10,Absolute Must See,MovieMan312,n/a,16/08/2025,"Definitely the greatest roast of all time. So many great jokes and moments throughout. I'm actually surprised they were able to sustain a 3 hour show without it ever getting too boring. As with any live event show there are ebbs and flows in energy but there was never a truly boring moment that made me want to turn it off or fast forward. Kevin Hart did a great job of sensing when it was time to move on and captained the ship with precision. Everyone had great joke to contribute, and I was especially surprised by the non-comics. Of course some of their jokes were no where near the level of Tony Hinchcliff, Andrew Shulz or Nikki Glazer (who all absolutely CRUSHED), but the others definitely had their moments. It was an amazing event with lots of warm moments and genuine displays of friendship, old beefs being squashed, and great comedy. Hands down the best roast I've ever watched. So glad they made this. Anyone giving a review below an 8 is either a hater, deaf, blind, humorless, or all four. It's an absolute solid 9, near perfect. Befitting of the Brady brand. Well done.",False

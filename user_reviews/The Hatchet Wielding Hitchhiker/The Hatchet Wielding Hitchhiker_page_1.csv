1,6,More like a confession from people who crossed paths with him,ajbarm,n/a,15/08/2025,"It seems like an unintentional documentary on how the kid could have been rescued or helped with many chances to do so but all the people he kept crossing paths with only saw how they could benefit from him or cast him aside when they were done with their intents for him. Fairly crazy to look at these many people just act as if they don't know what they are doing, fairly mesmerizing, really. The pattern just keeps repeating from different people and even from the same people he crosses more than once, noone wants to see past themselves and face the reality that is in front of them basically screaming for help. What a sad society.",False
2,5,So this is difficult for me to review as a documentary,orcinussr,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNormally, with a documentary you try to review the actual film more than the subject matter (which I understand is counterintuitive) even though with a documentary the subject is essentially 90 percent of the film - but in this case I can't get past the subject which is of course ""Kai"" and maybe moreso, the people who chose to interact with him - He's branded a hero for acting quickly, and rather impulsively but nonetheless effectively - now bear in mind that in the cold opening we learn that he goes from being lauded as a hero to the polar opposite and this is the point of the documentary. But as I watch I quickly become disgusted by two things, the first being how all these people with zero knowledge or experience of Kai, attempt to glom onto him for, essentially, financial gain - comments are made willy nilly about how he can be rich and famous or how everyone wants to be famous but this kids got 'it' and this one newscaster begins to lead the charge to, allegedly, aid Kai navigate these waters - as his abnormal psychometry begins to become apparent however, they quickly start to attempt to distance themselves from him - and the whole time I'm thinking to myself 'is anyone going to even attempt to help him, or get to know him or try and learn about his background and upbringing - does anyone care any further than how his viral fame can help them?? "" it's horrifying! From Kimmel personally handing him 500 dollars no questions asked to people implying that his claims about his childhood are too far fetched to be true - why are we watching a young man, slip between the cracks in real time? In plain sight? In broad daylight? Why?? I'm actually dumbstruck by how humans behave in this film - from trying to D ride off of him to disavowing and discarding him - never to once offer him to see a Dr or any wellness.. Ugh.. Sorry I can't go on -",True
3,6,A Sad Cautionary Tale,tuggyb,n/a,15/08/2025,"On the surface, this doc charts the viral popularity of Kai, but really it's about the insidious, predatory nature of parasites who deliberately ignored his VERY obvious mental illness to exploit him for their own gain. The warning signs were there from the minute the cameras started rolling - this is a deeply unwell young man who seems unable to parse reality from delusion, and his story inevitably ends in violence. But hey, he gets clicks so the Kardashian producers want to give him a reality TV show. He looks uncomfortable, like a caged animal in a zoo, but I want a selfie to show my friends. Most of the interviews are industry people detailing the various ways they tried to profit off of him while ignoring glaringly obvious red flags, with few if any showing remorse or even self-awareness. This doc also borders on exploitative, but it has value as a satire of our celebrity-obsessed culture and flippant attitude towards mental illness. I'm just not sure that was the goal.",False
4,6,An Interesting Story That Lacks Depth,MadValkyrie,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having never heard of Kai before this documentary, I was really interested in hearing his story. Through interviews with news reporters and television producers, we get a picture painted of a young homeless man with a hippie-esque mentality who became a hero through seemingly justified violence. But as Kai's story progresses, we come to see that he is a more unbalanced and unpredictable person than was originally thought. When police and family are interviewed, we truly begin to see behind the veil of Kai's homeless hippie hero persona.While this documentary starts off well with lengthy, balanced coverage of Kai's rise to fame vis social media, it falls flat when addressing the crime he is currently imprisoned for. The murder of Joseph Galfy almost seems like an afterthought compared to the build up of Kai's meteoric rise through the majority of the film. Many documentaries covering crimes and convictions of this nature feature interviews with psychologists and legal specialists to better illustrate the antagonist's clinical mental state and history but little is done to showcase this, save for limited interviews with his mother and cousin.While the story is interesting, this execution of this documentary fails to give a fully balanced look at the entirety of Kai's rise and fall, leaving you saying ""Wait, that's the end?"".",False
5,6,What would you do?,brud-br,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTragic and sad story about downfall of internet celebrity Kai the Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker. The guy who in the span of 3 months went from being a hero and appearing as a guest on Jimmy Kimmel to murdering a guy in Jersey for no apparent reason.The film doesn't bring anything new. They don't delve deep into his background although they interviewed his mother. Not his father tho, with whom he spent most of his childhood.The cheap drama music effects are annoying because those plot points aren't that dramatic.Also, Kai clearly suffers from some kind of mental illness or illnesses and authors just casually mention it here and there. His father said Kai suffered from mental illness most of his teens until he eloped.I would appreciate if they made points about mental illness being a real problem in today's society especially among homeless instead of polarizing Kai as either a saint or murderer.",True
6,6,The creators profited off someone's mental health issue...,madmaywebdesign,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI give it 6 stars because it shares a story... a story the producers of this film created by making this film!! Sadly it ruined the kids life. As for the documentary, everyone is labeling him as a hero, which you can make up your own mind, he saved life at the end of the day. However as the documentary progresses there are many people interacting with him and clearly he has mental health issues. Not ONCE is there mention of this nor does anyone attempt to get him help. Instead they search for ways to profit off him. It is just a spiral of events that perpetuated his unhealthy behaviors. He was completely exploited and the media, and especially the producers of this documentary, are to blame for the following events. It is clear to viewers that he needed help from the first 5 mins of the documentary but they chose to exploit him vs help him. So for that reason I give 1 star for the documentary BUT I will give it a 6 so people will watch and be aware of the injustice. The creators of this documentary were careless with a human life and could have help prevent the outcome!!!! But I guess that wouldn't sell would it? I hope people rally behind him after watching this and get his sentence reduced and move him to a mental health facility. This kid does NOT belong in prison.",True
7,6,Sad end to an amazing story,debbieannwalker-40287,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI hate the way journos and filmmakers and reality TV producers climb out of their deep dark coffins and pretty much ruin someone's life. Yes Kai has his demons but I can't stop thinking that if that 'sports' journalist (notice how much better he looks now than in 2013 I call that cashing in) had let Kai go on his way that day and live his life then what played out over the 3 months just would not have happened. And once a kardashian producer gets involved I say start running and quick. Not one of them tried to get him help and then go even further to say his abuse story was over the top like WTF are these people on about how do they know did they live his childhood life? I am appalled about the treatment of him and I think his case needs looking into he needs psychiatric help. Its a shame, I wish I'd not watched it.",True
8,n/a,Monsters all of them... no not Kai.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat do you get when you cross a mentally unhealthy transient with wealthy, gold digging and clueless people who want to exploit them?Kai was never a hero. Shame on the newscaster. Shame on the reality tv producer. This kid needed mental health care, not a surfboard or to be interviewed. If the newscaster really cared about Kai, he would've got him help, not connected him with other media resources.What was never asked is how many other people did Kai kill before the media turned him into a celebrity?This story makes me very sad because he could've gotten help. The mother was not convincing.",True
9,7,Not what I was expecting. At all.,garyprosser1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI put this on expecting your run-of-the-mill Netflix documentary about a crazed killer who hitched lifts and killed the good Samaritans who picked him up. What I found instead was a bizarre story of new-found instant celebrity, of the media building up someone who didn't go looking for fame, wasn't ready when fame found him and couldn't cope.Would Kai have ended up where he did if he'd never been in the spotlight? That's something we'll never know but as the program wears on, one gets the feeling that this is a guy who had been through a lot in his life, who had known instability of various kinds (both personal and situational), and who couldn't cope with the way his life went. How this manifested, no-one could have foreseen.THWH is unlike any story you or I have ever heard and is at various times funny, sad and shocking. It's a well made doc that fully deserves an hour or so of your time.",True
10,3,Why didn't anyone help him?,christinarivers,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is heartbreaking and deeply disturbing to watch, but certainly not in the ways that it was intended to be. It was clear from the get-go that Kai was delusional and needed psychological help. Instead, the media sharks descended upon him and took advantage of him because they thought they could make money off of him.What if they had looked at him as a human being with a horrendous childhood who was desperately in need of help, instead of only seeing him as their next cash cow? Would things have ended differently? They had an opportunity to really make a difference in this kid's life and they squandered it.This isn't an indictment of Kai so much as it is an indictment of the bloodthirsty media who exploited him. And this documentary doesn't even have the self awareness to see that. Shame on every single person who chose to ignore the warning signs because they were so focused on the dollar signs! Disgusting!",False
11,6,elephant in the room,marlealyons,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is so disturbing. My focus for this review is on the mother. Yes the ""powers"" of media, took advantage of this young man and then dropped him at the first sign of trouble. One look at this ""mother"" tells you the true story. The mere fact that when she was informed of his arrest for murder, she smirked and gave a chuckle , enough said. Abuse. It's very clear all the way through this documentary that Kai was sexually abused at one point is his life. With a detached abusive mother and no support, his mental health is not surprising. Everyone ignored this kid. His suffering is obvious. He's muti-generational Canadian First Nation, already at a disadvantage.There is mention of how good this lawyer ""gentleman"" was.... no talk of really how much a predator this lawyer was. The murder of him was not ok for sure but for Kai to rot in prison as the sole perpetrator in this disastrous life is not the answer. The depiction of Kai's life in this film is deeply disturbing. He didn't stand a chance.",False
12,2,Painful Watch,pkchuwithaprtyhat,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary did not achieve what it set out to do. Instead of making an interesting documentary about viral sensation turned murderer, it instead managed to give a window into the merciless media exploitation, woeful mental health awareness and support, and broken criminal justice system in the USA. Its becomes an unintentional meta-documentary about this exploitation, an exploitation it participates in.The first third consists of people in news and TV, execs, Kardashian producers, Jimmy Kimmel, etc. Summarizing Kai's rise to fame. These people cannot fathom that someone wouldn't want to be rich and famous. Therefore they completely misunderstand Kai's clear anti-rich anti-hollywood messsage (p*ssing on the walk of fame) and instead characterize him as dangerous and unstable. They talk about how hes clearly alcoholic and uses a lot of weed; the way the entice him to sign a contract is by promising a truck of weed to him. Despite Kai clearly needing some mental support and care they just see dollar signs.The person who first interviews Kai (and his cameraman) are then revealed to have heard him sit on the curb and talk about his mental health, troubled upbringing, history of abuse. They exclaim their disbelief and talk about how they chose to ignore it, excluding it from the coverage. Everything these people say drips with their own monetary and career interest and no concern for Kai or his wellbeing.Kai's childhood is explored briefly, but his claims of neglect and abuse are not ultimately proven or disproven. His mom, who is his alleged abuser, gets the last word for some reason as we move on without stopping to see if Kai maybe could have had a better chance at life, and how his foster care and ultimate homelessness (or home-freeness) came about. Next a man who met him at a bar says he overheard Kai saying that he spiked the weed in the car which caused the accident that launched him to fame - but the toxicology report completely refutes that... So what is the point?We move into the murder case and despite Kai's claim of being r*ped, we only hear the investigators discuss the wounds and evidence of the murder itself. His story is given no credence, no word if Kai's claims are true or not. Why would this old lawyer have a 20 year old in his house in the first place? Its fishy and the only people to speak on the old mans character are his neighbours - dodgy.The documentary ends on the depressing note that Kai is in a maximum security prison for 57 years. The documentary leaves no room for us to question this - though the man he fought off in the car accident gets 9 years in a mental health institution - something i guess was out of the question for Kai.Coming out of a troubled home and childhood, out onto the streets living life his own way, Kai was thrust into this media frenzy of exploitation and chose to walk away from it while also literally p*ssing on the industry. He is one of many people to fall outside of the cruel system in the USA - no one caring for him, not getting proper support for his mental health and wellbeing, no one believing him, and the justice system doing what it does best - protecting wealthy white men. The documentary just capitalizes on this exploitation by handing money to everyone involved and not giving Kai's story a fair run on the screen.",True
13,6,A Tale of Exploitation,Katerinabobinafofina,n/a,15/08/2025,"The whole movie is told from the perspective of the people that want to exploit this poor guy.Regardless of whether or not the murder that put him in jail was self-defense, this guy deserved better than the people around him attempting to exploit him for their own gain. I think the only one that truly cares about him is Jessob. Thank you Jessob.It's actually surprising how many people in this documentary describe wanting to 'make him famous' and in the same breath call him 'mentally unstable' and don't even put two and two together that it's disgusting. They don't even get it... still after almost 10 years!",False
14,6,The quick rise and fall of an internet sensation,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""The Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker"" (2023 release; 85 min) opens, it is ""February 1, 2013"" and there is a bizarre scene in Fresno when a deranged/racist driver goes after a black woman. The driver's passenger, a young man named Kai, intervenes and saves the woman from a very dangerous situation, while along the way wielding a hatchet against the driver. A subsequent interview with a local TV reporter causes an immediate internet sensation and puts into motion a series of unexpected developments for Kai... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from director Colette Camden (""The Rise of the Anti-Vaxx Movement""). Here Camden looks back as the meteoric rise and subsequent equally fast fall of the internet sensation that was Kai Lawrence, a seemingly happy-go-lucky 'cool dude', oozing with charm. Then it turns out that there is much more to this guy... Let me state upfront that I had never heard of this guy before. But as the documentary makes clear, for a while after the infamous TV interview, he was hotter than hot, and pursued by many different people, all eager to cash in on this new internet sensation. All claim to be simply ""rooting for this young man"" but in reality all have other motives as well. This is not to excuse Kai's behavior of course. It absolutely blows the mind that the events relayed in the documentary played out over a period of not even 4 months. In the end, this human interest story makes for okay viewing but really nothing more than that.""The Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker"" premiered on Netflix earlier this week, and Netflix recommended it to me based on my viewing habits. I just saw it last night and this makes for quick viewing. If you are interested in a human interest story involving the quick rose and even faster fall of an internet sensation, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
15,7,I would definitely recommend,doriangray-34752,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a sad story, and the saddest part of it is how I think he's telling the truth. He's been abused as a child. His mother was laughing when talking about hearing that he's murdered someone. N I personally think it's very very clear that his mother was lying about his childhood and how she ""locked him in his room for short periods of time, he's a little guy - sounds like a stranger - n he needed protection"". Even tho his cousin did somehow confirm the abuse. Then she sends him to a boys home, where almost definitely he was abused there too. But what can we expect from the system but to try n finish the deal as fast as possible with total disregard to MOTIVE? Mental health? This is a guy with history of losing control and getting violent in the face of abuse. We don't hear about him attacking anyone that wasn't in the process of abuse? The cops based their claim he's lying on how he embraced the man then went back to his home, which doesn't go hand in hand with the rape story, but it actually does. If read about abuse victims, the abuse comes from someone that claims the abuse is a form of affection. A form of a connection. Then when facing a homeless night on the streets and nobody else to turn to, it happens. Very often actually. The docu should've focused more on the trial. Why was the murder victim in his underwear? And when his neighbors say he's not a strong man, well he wouldn't have needed much strength against a drugged victim, would he? Usually the cops look - or claim to look - for who, how, why. Nope not in this case. Or most cases with abuse of young people, the corrupt system tries to swipe it fast under the rug. And that judge is a moron.",True
16,7,Added Details,ramrphat,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie added details I didn't know I needed to know. I do usually want to know what happens to ""viral sensations,"" but I never considered this guy. Bro, why were these people pressed to make him into ""something?"" Like, maybe talk to him before pressing forward with your plans. This guy obviously had his own problems and giving him whatever he wants just opened Pandora's Box. He needs help, but he also needed to help himself. Trying to make a reality show around him was not the way. If he liked being ""home free,"" fine. There are plenty that actually want help that don't like being ""home free.""",False
17,7,Kai reminds me of some hippy kids I grew up with.,bey_kitty,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHe has some screws loose that's for sure. Something evil about Kai that I can't describe. He seems like the kind of guy that could just snap at any moment in the blink of an eye. Kai Kai Kai snapping in the blink of an eye. I am not a person like that! You think that I am? I don't give a crap about what you think!!!!! Solid watch though, I think Kai was probably desperate for money and decided to sleep with the old man, but then regretted it so he killed him. Screw loose! The guy who was in the band that opened for Kai seems like a real loser eh? Cringed me out really. Fuuuuuck smmmaaaaaaash smaaaash samaaaaash.",True
18,1,Exploitation in a meta way (eye-roll),donnanz-37673,n/a,15/08/2025,"A guy with mental health issues acts on impulse.Media folk recognise the opportunity to exploit his seeming 'quirkiness', and line their own pockets.The vacuous and self-serving people around him exploit him to make a quick buck, and as soon as his ACTUAL psych issues show, they back off and instead offer commentary on how they never really believed his schtick.Caleb was a guy who was living his life in his 'own reality', who was then thrust into the cult of celebrity. This doc is a sad indictment of the mental health system in the States, along with exposing the repulsive heart of media exploitation. Especially that initial reporter who is still trading on the suffering of others.The whole thing is simply gross.",False
19,8,Sad reality of overnight fame,nwg3,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a great documentary and a very sad story. Kai seemed to have that it factor and a knack around the camera but underneath there was so much pain and hurt. It was sad to me how everyone rode his coattails on the way up but were nowhere to be found when he fell down hard. It is a cautionary tale for sure. Today we see so many viral videos that garner a few moments of fame and right there behind them are people trying to capitalize on it. From the corn kid, island boys, bhad babie, and the list goes on and on. It usually doesn't end well. We should be helping these individuals instead of exploiting them.The film was well put together and storyline is insane. Hoping Kai has a chance to turn things around in the future.",False
20,7,Narratively driven instead of accurate adaptation,apelkmans,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMedia outlets were quick to take credit for the highs of the film but I feel like the internet/ younger generation is the only reason this took off.... I feel like this was the beginning part of the shift to Vine and TikTok. Traditional media would never address this shift.This is a precursor to showing how traditional media out lets can't leave something for what it is. They race to turn this guy into a Cash Cow and a Hero without doing any due diligence to see what the guy is like. Under the pressure of finding the next chase cow these people skip steps that must be followed by any company to hire a new employee.This documentary does a good job in showing the thought process behind these media outlets un intentionally, but I'm certain conversations and actions of hiding ugly things their stars do is normal business. Until it can be no longer hidden, then they throw them under the bus and make money from that too.",True
21,3,Shallow and morally reprehensible.,tupkczavvn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Everyone who came into contact with this vulnerable, profoundly unwell man should be ashamed of themselves. How did any of these blood-suckers think participating in this documentary was a good idea? If I participated in the exploitation of this young man, you better bet I would hide that fact from the world until the day I died. The unbridled glee that all these media figures have when recalling their time with Kai is disgusting. There is no self-reflection. No sense of responsibility. No question of what kind of role they played in Kai's downward spiral. NOTHING. They just cared about how they can monetize his existence and enable his dysfunctional behavior. If all of that doesn't sound stomach-turning enough, there is also an overwhelming amount of stigma and disdain for unhoused people. Half of this documentary is remarkably tone-deaf exploitation and the other half is your standard, unreliable Copaganda garbage. I almost turned it off as soon as the East Cost cops show up. Everyone was so quick to embrace Kai as a Meme Hero and then immediately wash their hands of him. Shame on you, random Fresno Nobody Sports Reporter for riding a mentally ill man's coattails to a career you don't deserve.",False
22,n/a,Sad story,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerI've never heard of Kai before but I was very sad to see what happened at the end. You can clearly see even his own mom is not on his side. She giggles during an interview about his son's murder investigation. There is definitely something is wrong from the very beginning of his life. I hope he gets the mental help he needs and somehow recovers from this.At the beginning of the documentary everyone acts like he is a prophet and on the second part he becomes pure evil. The whole thing leaves you with tons of questions.I think the analogy in the documentary was spot on about him being a crushed stone instead turning into a gem. It was so sad to see what could have happened to him and what actually happened to him..,True
23,7,All is not what it seems dude,Bigweight66,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kai become somewhat famous, when he was first was called -The Hatchet Wielding Hitchhiker: It is an interesting story that travels in one direction, then takes a sharp turn.Kai is a happy drifter who prevents a women, from being assaulted by a big guy.

24,7,"Well-paced, compelling documentary for those not familiar with Kai's story",julieshotmail,n/a,15/08/2025,"This Netflix documentary has a great hook just from its title. Something with ""hatchet,"" ""wielding,"" and ""hitchhiker"" is bound to lure viewers in, so it is no surprise that as of today, its third day of release, this is ranked number one on Netflix. For viewers not familiar with Kai, the narrative here successfully weaves the story of how a random person catapults to fame in a matter of days and then spirals downward at the same speed, winding up in what has to be one of life's worst predicaments. The storytelling is delivered through good editing, visuals, stock footage, and candid interviews. One criticism is the somewhat rushed and abrupt ending, as if 57 years in prison is nothing to balk at. That part alone warrants its own chapter and deserves further exploration to complete this whole picture.",False

Why did they rethink he didn't have ID nor tried to get one? They didn't even try to get the man he beat side of the story or the women. Even with all he's done they still refuse to give his victims respect and act like he's the victim. This is why so many serial killers can stay hidden so long.

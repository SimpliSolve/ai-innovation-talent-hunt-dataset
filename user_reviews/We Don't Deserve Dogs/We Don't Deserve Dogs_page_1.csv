1,8,Mellon collies and the infinite sadness.,davidpetrison,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a collection of interviews and stories from dog owners and admirers about the dogs in their communities or the pets that have changed their lives. The mood of the film aligns with its title - this is all very, very sad. Sad stories, sad people, and sad circumstances that brought dogs into their lives.The music is relentlessly somber, a constant collage of string instruments playing sustained whole notes, reminiscent of Philip Glass composing his version of Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber. Interestingly, the actual composer is a former child actor, one of the Little Rascals from the 1990s movie - an odd detail.About 80% of the film is not in English. It's a beautifully filmed, albeit somewhat amateur, travelogue that captures glimpses of how dogs are perceived in various cultures. Some of the countries featured include Chile, Peru, Uganda, Pakistan, Romania, Vietnam, and Scotland. I had to look this up, as the segments aren't separated by headings or on-screen text.The film might have been aiming for the tone of Kedi, the 2016 documentary about Istanbul's street cats. In that film, we see how cats bring meaning to people's lives, often serving as community mascots. They're respected and cared for, but no one person takes sole responsibility for them.The opening story, set in Santiago, Chile, echoes this concept. It features a dog named Dr. Coffee who lives a dual life. Everyone in the neighborhood knows him and will often ask, ""Have you seen Coffee today?"" He moves freely, vanishing and reappearing days later. Eventually, one resident learns that the hospital nearby knows him by a different name - he has a room there and stays for days at a time. Coffee isn't like a typical dog; he doesn't crave pets and affection. His version of companionship is simply sitting quietly with kind people.In Uganda, survivors of violent trauma are given dogs as a form of emotional support. One woman names her dog PTSD to reflect the emotional weight she's working through. The belief is that a dog provides unconditional love, free from hate or judgment. The group dog-training sessions, where dozens of new dog owners learn how to care for their companions, are striking in their simplicity and warmth.In Pakistan, a self-described tomboy finds a dog on the street with a paralyzed leg, covered in maggots, and left to die. Despite many people telling her to give the dog away once he recovered, she refused. Some people in Pakistan believe that having a dog in the house will prevent God from accepting you into heaven. She rejects that belief, instead seeing the dog's presence in her life as part of God's plan. Her story is one of quiet defiance and compassion.Not all the stories are tragic. In Chile, a therapy dog named Patron brings joy to residents of a retirement home. During an exercise session, Patron is told to ""find the yellow ball,"" which he does effortlessly. The residents marvel at his ability to distinguish colors. One participant remarks, ""If a dog comes up and hugs you, then it is a hugging dog, and you can hug it."" This gentle wisdom encapsulates the joy dogs bring - they accept us for who we are.However, the film doesn't shy away from difficult realities. In Vietnam, the dog meat trade is addressed. A restaurant owner recounts how his father introduced him to the practice as a child. While he acknowledges that dog meat consumption has declined, he continues to serve it as long as there is demand. This segment is sobering, forcing viewers to confront how cultural norms shape our perceptions of animals. It made me wonder about the conditions of dog meat farms and, by extension, the treatment of all farm animals. Should I view them all as dogs? It's a thought that lingered with me.While the film's tone leans toward the morose, it remains gentle in its approach. Dog lovers will appreciate the celebration of the bond between humans and animals, as long as they're prepared for the emotional weight of the stories. Ultimately, We Don't Deserve Dogs serves as a poignant reminder of the kindness and joy that dogs bring to our lives.7.5/10.",False
2,7,A Touching Dog Documentary (with the exception of one part),hoffoliv,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary was very touching. It made me smile and tear up at times. We truly don't deserve dogs. They give so much of themselves to humans, and we humans don't always treat them with kindness. I truly think the part where it discusses and even shows the dog meat market could have been left out. It felt too out of place for this type of documentary. I do understand that not every culture sees dogs as companions, and it's important to educate yourself on that. But that part almost ruined this documentary for me. Overall, I do think it's worth a watch, especially curled up on the couch with your dog. Just skip the part about the dog meat market though.",True
3,10,"Travelogue with dogs, touches on some disturbing things",dunnc-92822,n/a,16/08/2025,"I highly recommend this film. It will take you to Europe, Africa, Asia, North and South America and show you how people of different cultures relate to dogs.Do we, as humans, deserve to have dogs in our lives? Depending on where you go, dogs give emotional support, herd sheep, find rare truffles, or hang out in pubs. Some cultures pamper ""community"" dogs; others neglect strays.Other reviews have criticized this film unfairly due to a segment filmed in Vietnam, where some people view dogs as livestock - as a food source. This is presented realistically but not for shock value. We do not see the moment a dog is slaughtered for food, but we do see a carcass and meat being prepared. The film reveals a puzzling duality; in Vietnam, people view some dogs as beloved pets, but ""native"" dogs as a source of food. If you are especially disturbed that some people in Asia eat dog meat, then what does that say about people who eat beef (taboo in India), pork (taboo in the Middle East), chicken, goat, deer, etc.? There are people who have an affinity for each of these animals and wouldn't dream of them ending up on the dinner table.Dog meat is not the only disturbing theme in this film. Even more heartbreaking is a segment in Uganda, in which people who survived the atrocities of war, only to be shunned in peacetime. Dogs helped them heal and re-integrate into society.What I took away from this film is that dogs are a gift to humanity, and it is up to us to treat them well. I gave my pups extra treats and belly rubs after seeing ""We Don't Deserve Dogs.""",False
4,10,A beautiful documentary,cinemagirl1357,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this film fascinating - I loved seeing the way humans and their dogs interact in such different ways all around the world.Some of the stories are heartwarming (I loved the story of Chino the street dog!), and others are heartbreaking, like the stories of former child soldiers in Uganda who use dogs as emotional support animals.As others have noted, the filmmakers do include a scene that examines the culture of dog meat preparation in Vietnam. Whilst the scene is challenging to watch, I think it was handled delicately, and appreciate its inclusion in the film.With beautiful cinematography and a lovely score, the film is a wonderful celebration of the love between humans and dogs. It made me cry - in the best possible way.",False
5,1,What is wrong with the producers?,rdpinr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe were watching this with our two children, even helping them to understand how dogs were helping to heal the emotional damages caused by war horrors.Then, from out of nowhere, comes a segment regarding dog meat! As parents, we were completely blindsided, and couldn't get to the remote fast enough.Later, I went back to see how that story progressed. After seeing the images used, I was 10 times as grateful that we shut the movie down as quickly as we did.If you want to make a documentary about the dog meat industry, fine. I would probably even be interested in seeing it. But don't stick something like that in the middle of feel-good, heartwarming stories about dogs. That segment, ESPECIALLY the images, are NOT suitable for children!",True
6,5,It lost 5 stars for the ending...,greekalymnian,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLike others have stated, there was a segment about people killing dogs in Vietnam for dog meat. After watching so many heartwarming stories about how different cultures embrace dogs and love on them, this felt completely out of left field. Whether it's a reality or not, it didn't belong in this film. This was not expected, and the only reason I gave it 5 stars was because of this. The rest of the documentary was genuine and compassionate up until the ending. Although no animal cruelty was shown, they do show a dog waiting in a wired crate to be slaughtered and then marinated and it's dead body put onto a bike. That alone made me want to turn it off. Whether that part was trying to tell us that ""we don't deserve dogs"" or not, it could have been left out. If you are an animal lover as big as I am, I would say to at least skip the part where they get to Vietnam. Overall, eh. The ending honestly ruined it for me. And we truly do not deserve dogs. They are innocent, precious magical little beings that we must cherish and protect always.",True
7,1,Dog in wire..waiting to be SLAUGHTERED!!! DO NOT WATCH!!DISGUSTING!!! Shame on you!,cfw-60017,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tell me that you can ""stomach"" watching a poor dog in a wire cage waiting for its death for the sake of $$
And you are trying to show us the humanity/beauty of dogs to the viewing public???This is disgusting!!!I hope PETA torments the directors and anyone involved in this atrocity of a film.",False
8,1,Needlessly disturbing,jkarlsson-27037,n/a,16/08/2025,"What the heck? This film needed a warning at the beginning. I am perplexed at the choices the filmmaker made and I've seen other docs on the exact same material create films that are infinitely better. It felt like they were trying to do too many things and I would have liked more depth and fewer segments. Beyond anything else, I CAN'T GET PAST the segment on the slaughter and eating if dogs in Vietnam. Even the people in the doc said it was becoming less and less popular. Not sure why it was included. Seemed thematically unessecary and overly macabre. They must have known the audience attracted to these types of stories and then they basically slap the audience in the face with a practice that is greatly diminishing globally. Even without that part, the doc was lacking structure or meaning, was fairly mediocre. A few segments were captivating but they did not save the film. One star is one too many.",False
9,1,Deceptive Title/Marketing,torivt65,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe don't deserve dogs, that is very true. But the title and clips I saw for this movie (and 95% of the movie itself) promote the wonder of dogs. Then, right near the end, totally off-tone and theme a dog is shown in a cage and then the dead carcass and the butchering process from afar. This felt very deceptive and out of place with the rest of the film and therefore I would never watch another documentary by these writers.",True
10,n/a,Contains explicit scenes dog carnage,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI thought the film was going to be thoughtful and brilliant until the unecessary part where a dog is chained while watching its killer prepare to kill and marinate it. The film starts with dogs helping others recover from life traumas in Africa. Tragic and beautiful. Then it moves on to other countries and continents with similar themes A dead dog was shown after being intentionally killed for food. The dog is shown chained in a cage watching the killer pepare to kill him. Of course most of us know that these killings occur, but this wasn't necessary here! I was sickened and nauseated by this scene. Definitely do not watch with children. I can't get that scene out of my head.",True
11,1,Don't watch!!! The kill and eat a dog...,yadigovea,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerEverything was fine until the end; when they show you a dog In a cage a then... a man kill it in his backyard and go out to sell his meat... I mean wtf!! Being a movie that celebrates the connection between humans and dogs out of no where they chose to kill the dog... it is very graphic about it.,True
12,1,They kill a dog for meat!,josereneprince,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWTF! At the end they have a dog in a cage and kill him for meat. You will see the dog with open chest in a motorcycle! Awfull piece of media, my children is crying!!!",True
13,1,they included DOG MURDERERS,mylittlehein,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe tail end of the video which was otherwise very nice, chose to include vietnamese scumbags murdering dogs, pouring boiling water on STILL ALIVE dogs to remove their fur while the dog right there in the recording, screamed in pain. DISGUSTING. I can't even believe people have the (*^*&%&*$## GALL to make videos with this content, acting like it's a wholesome documentary and including asian dog murderers when the ENTIRE PLANET hates that. I'm the most furious and disgusted I have ever been since watching the horrific documentary Earthlings from the 2000s, it seems asia is still as backward and sick as it was 20 years ago.",True

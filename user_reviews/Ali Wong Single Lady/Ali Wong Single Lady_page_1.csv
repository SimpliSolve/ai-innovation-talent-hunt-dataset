1,5,"A tedious, self-indulgent hour",pillowtrot,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a long-time fan of Ali Wong's standup, so I was excited to see her latest routine. This is far and away not her best work at all. It was nothing more than an entire hour devoted to her divorce, and telling the audience (repeatedly) that she's rich and successful, and how she deserves men who can gratify her properly with oral sex. OK, fine for a short while, but move on. I'm not complaining about the raunchy humor; you expect that from Ali Wong. Just be more imaginative with it. Move on to other topics. That used to be what was appealing about Ali: her talent for observational humor. It's almost entirely missing here.",False
2,5,The next Amy Schummer?,Sir Gerry,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a fan of Ali's, not the biggest, I admit, but I've watched all her specials and some other stuff on youtube, but gotta say that, after this one, I am reconsidering my fandom. Sporadically funny, this new one finds her proud on being a single woman again, and ready to mingle. Good for her, the problem is, about 90% of the special revolves around her newfound ""power"", and as a 2024 empowered woman, she just boasts her sexual freedom. Still no problem there, but, while I'm not a prude, I'm not also a fan of over the top crudeness and vulgarity. I think that is the crutch of the unfunny. What's with modern women and their desire to talk like truck drivers, or worse? The special also cannot hide her feminist views (of course, it's Netflix) and I wonder if a man could get away with all that she said, were the roles reversed? Not a terrible special, somewhat funny, I found myself fast forwarding some of the most vulgar stuff. Let's hope she doesn't turn into the new Amy Schummer, who can only make 'jokes' about her V.",True
3,6,I'd give this a kind 6 out of 10.,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't really know what to say broadly beyond saying that this is fine, but not as funny as the previous Ali Wong specials I remember watching. She really just sticks to the one topic the entire time, and I'm always down for the concept album equivalent of a standup special, but this one wore out its welcome at a point.It's just about getting back into the dating scene after a divorce and going through some short-term relationships. On and on and on. I'd complain if a male comedian did the same and just talked about dates with women for an hour nonstop.I also don't find comedians - regardless of gender - bragging about wealth very appealing because I don't like hearing anyone bragging about wealth. I don't like the idea that it should be something one's proud of, let alone people saying it and then expecting cheers or laughs. Anyway, there were some decently funny parts for sure, and it's entertaining enough, but also a bit underwhelming.The only interesting observation I can really offer concerns wondering whether this is a standup special with product placement? She references My Octopus Teacher, The Last Airbender, and Squid Game, which are all available on Netflix, and this special is on Netflix. So it makes me wonder. I don't really want to think about Netflix being a brand while I'm watching standup, but it could also be a coincidence. There are references to non-Netflix properties, too, admittedly (like E. T and Ferris Bueller's Day Off).",False
4,7,"Ali Wong is still brash and bold, but this new special is a bit lazy...",mdw0526,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a longtime fan of Ali Wong, I enjoyed her previous Netflix specials, ""Baby Cobra"", ""Hard Knock Wife"", and ""Don Wong"", and her award-winning performance in the black comedy ""Beef"" with Steven Yeun. She's always excelled at balancing raunchy humor with biting social commentary and while I love some vulgarity as much as anyone when it serves a larger comedic goal, her latest special, ""Single Lady"", feels like a missed opportunity. Exploring post-divorce life and re-entry into the dating world has potential, but the material becomes repetitive quickly. After initial laughs at her escapades, we felt like we were being hit over the head with the same punchline again and again. That said, Wong's stage presence remains undeniable; she's as brash, unapologetic, and charismatic as ever, commanding attention with bold delivery and great comic timing. However, lazy writing and lack of fresher material results in fewer chuckles and chortles than I expected, and it's missing the sharpness and originality that made her previous specials so captivating.",False
5,7,"Not Her Best, But Still Doable",AJx91,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tldr; Single Lady feels underdeveloped and repetitive, lacking the polish and humor of Ali's previous specials.My rating might be slightly higher because I am a massive fan of Ali's work. So, if you gave this a 5 or 6, it would be understandable and fair.Without giving out her bits. She had one bit she kept doing over and over and tried to play it up at one point because it was not getting the reaction she wanted. Instead, she should have moved on from the bit and started talking about other stuff.She should have pushed this off for another year to add more variety to ""Single Lady"" (2024) and give it more practice. ""Don Wong"" (2022) had more time to develop and was better.Maybe if this were her first special, people would have liked it more. However, Single Lady is put into a situation where it is going to be compared to her past work, and ""Baby Cobra"" (2016) + ""Hard Knock Wife"" (2018) was just funnier. Those are tough acts to follow.You will notice some reviewers saying that Single Lady is nasty and not funny, but Ali always liked making nasty jokes. Yet people did not mind her previous special's nastiness because they were LMFAO.P. S.And yes, the title is a play on words. Fly me out Ali!",False
6,7,funny,Chloesean-5,n/a,16/08/2025,"**Ali Wong's *Single Lady* - A Fierce, Unfiltered Comedy Triumph**Ali Wong's stand-up material on singlehood-particularly in her 2022 special *Don Wong*-is a hilarious, no-holds-barred exploration of independence, desire, and societal hypocrisy. Known for her brash delivery and fearless honesty, Wong dissects modern relationships with razor-sharp wit, making her one of the most distinctive voices in comedy today.### **Strengths**
1. **Bold & Unapologetic** - Wong's comedy thrives on taboo-breaking honesty. She openly mocks double standards in dating, marriage, and female sexuality, delivering punchlines with audacious flair. Her jokes about infidelity, power dynamics, and the absurdity of monogamy are both shocking and refreshing.2. **Relatable Social Commentary** - Whether ranting about the pressures on women to marry or the freedoms (and pitfalls) of single life, Wong's material resonates. Her bit on the ""cool girl"" facade-and why it's exhausting-is a standout.3. **Masterful Delivery** - Wong's physical comedy (wild facial expressions, exaggerated gestures) elevates every joke. Even at her most vulgar, her timing and energy keep the audience hooked.### **Weaknesses****Slightly Repetitive Themes** - Fans of *Baby Cobra* or *Hard Knock Wife* might notice overlaps in topics (marital strife, gender roles). While still funny, some bits lack the freshness of her earlier work.**Privilege Creep** - As Wong's fame grows, her jokes about wealth and Hollywood life feel less grounded than her scrappy, pre-fame humor.Ali Wong's *Single Lady* material (especially in *Don Wong*) is a riotous, thought-provoking take on autonomy and modern love. While not as groundbreaking as her debut, it cements her status as a comedy icon-unafraid to offend, challenge.(*Note: If referring to a specific project titled ""Single Lady,"" clarify-Wong's most recent Netflix special is* Don Wong, *which heavily features single-life themes.*)",False
7,2,Horrific,TerribleMovie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ali Wong's arrogance is on full display in this special. She's no longer able to rely on her pregnancy for comedy, so she shows us who she really is: the female Beavis and Butthead. Ali sees life as a series of men to bone and throw away. She spends the entire hour ranting about boning men: old men, young men, asian men, white men. She never talks about anything else, except how she's a millionaire. You could hear the audience lose interest as she jumps from one hookup to the next, all ending with her leaving the men because they didn't bone her the way she wanted. Ali never shows us who she really is. It feels like watching a cartoon character performing standup comedy. She's the female Beavis and Butthead: her only goal in life is to score.",False
8,9,"""A women's trash is another women's trained trash"" - pure gold",jwxujerry,n/a,16/08/2025,"She is divorced for two years, and she is back at it on stage.She is unapologetic. She is being her financially-independent, Asian American, divorced-mama self. She is unapologetically slutty, because why not?She is unfiltered and uninhibited. She is ""dirty"". She is 40 and she thinks it's the golden age - to get a divorce.She is pure Asian American. That is - somewhat Asian and somewhat American. And she is very proud.She is loud, she is noisy, she is expressive, and she acts, and acts well, like a Golden Globe winner.She is sarcastic, and she speaks of so much truth that middle-aged people who have gone through marriages can relate to.She is brilliant. She is charming. She grabbed the audience like no other. Her jokes and stories are hers. And ours too.She is the one and only Ali Wong.",False
9,3,We get it... she's a millionaire divorcee,oneflychicken,n/a,16/08/2025,"This special is the female equivalent of an entire special of d*** jokes. Smart d*** jokes, but still... low-hanging fruit.Honestly, the aim of this is off. I love Ali Wong and I want to love this special, but it's hard to watch-even cringy, at times. The amount of strange flexing and bragging trying to land as jokes is more obnoxious than funny. More manifesto than engaging.Comedy is a matter of taste. I get that. But if you're like me, you want more from a stand-up special than shock lines and a peek into the world of a rich, successful divorcee and her sexual play-by-play of middle-aged dating. This might be what others find entertaining, but for me, it's proof that no matter how smart and well-written ones jokes are, d*** jokes are still d*** jokes an an entire special of them feels like an easy way to get laughs. It feels cheap from any comic-no matter the gender.Both my partner and I checked out mentally about a third of the way through.The wrap up might be the most weirdly forced ending of a standup special that I've ever seen. Like, was she trying to save herself by injecting a touch of humility and vulnerability in the last hundred yards? I don't think it works.I left this special disappointed and confused by how I was supposed to feel. Once the shock wears off, I'm left with nothing.",False
10,10,I was out on a walk when i listened,mhtannous,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was laughing so hard for so long, I know they neighbors were worried about me.This was classic Wong. If you've liked her earlier stuff, you will like this.As to the other commenters, this is comedy. People are dragging down the score here with BS moral commentary, or complaining that it's crass, shocking, and vulgar.If you don't want crass and vulgar, watch hallmark channel.Someone else commented that she was self indulgent and talking about her money and status.Hell yeah she did. I just think this commenter is intimidated by powerful women who know what they want. They are just projecting their own inadequacies onto Ali.Thanks Ali for delivering this single mom in her forties, a full hour of belly laughs.I am undoubtedly her demographic. If you aren't, watch a comedian that will talk about things you can relate too.",False
11,4,Too much dicked down...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I stumble upon this 2024 Netflix comedy special from Ali Wong, I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch it.While I do find Ali Wong to be a good comedian, I have to say that I found this 2024 comedy special to be a bit generic. It was primarily below the belt material, and that just feels so 1990s. Yeah, I do actually prefer comedy with an intellectual twist to it. Comedy should be more than genitalia and sex jokes. And there was a bit too much of self-glorification, as to her being an Emmy winner and her riches, that was just a tad too tacky and corny, as if she is so much more than everyone else because she is on TV.Ali Wong does have great on-screen charisma and presence, as she has in each of her shows. She feels very much naturally at home on the screen, and she sets up her jokes nicely and delivers them equally nicely as well.Watchable for sure, but the contents of the jokes were just not particularly impressive. I like comedy to be more than below the belt jokes. And this was basically almost just an hour of Ali Wong talking about how many men she has been with since her divorce, and how she perceives sex as a very casual thing.""Ali Wong: Single Lady"" was really a disappointing performance in my opinion and she doesn't really portray herself in a good way here.My rating of ""Ali Wong: Single Lady"" lands on a four out of ten stars.",False
12,1,Absolute and literal trash,J0SCH,n/a,16/08/2025,"Was a huge fan of her first special, her second one was decent, but this was horrendous: sixty minutes of an unfunny rant about how desperate she is to get laid in full vulgar detail with nothing funny about it. Nothing clever, nothing funny, just nauseating vulgarity in a failed bid at entertainment. Save the time and skip, or at least give it 10 minutes and give up like everyone else I know who attempted to watch, including many comedy fans and women and/or Asians who otherwise deeply supported her. It seems like she went from clever to clever/raunchy to full raunch with nothing clever at all.",False
13,8,Wow a tough crowd,vovers1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kudos to Ali Wong for changing it up and getting right down in your face. Yes it is crass, vulgar, shocking and stays on the dirt track right down in the gutter except for the last crack at the end where Ali admitted to being in a new relationship and a stable divorce after this riotous celebration of being the single lady.What she wasn't was mysoginist not too prejudiced beyond the admitted faults not overwhelmingly lusting about her obvious and well earned success. As so many of her male colleagues tend to be.It will be very interesting to see where Ali can go next. Meanwhile I might just watch this show again while I'm waiting.Watch it with open ears and no kids in the house.",False
14,1,Angry Crass Is Horrible,katharineshowalter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Okay, I get it. Ali Wong wants oral sex--and she's a millionaire. That about sums about this special about a millionaire divorcee who wants more out of life, specifically, oral sex. Boo hoo.Frankly, after the way she talked about her husband in the last two specials, I'm not surprised Wong got divorced. Her first special was very good, the second less so. Her observations then were funny, shockingly crass (in a good way), and her absurd asides and silly physicality were bonuses.In this special, the material of which is no deeper than a talk show appearance, all we get are dating stories that are crass but not funny and that make her seem mean-spirited, bitter, and snobby. This stories might've seemed hilarious during brunch with the other millionaire girls, but here they come off as clunky and embarrassing.It seems Wong is aware that the material is lacking, as here she pushes her physicality, but now it feels artificial and forced. In the first special, her large pregnant belly was a great sight gag. Here, she wears an unattractive nightgown/mumu thing, which is mildly interesting, but not enough for her to lampshade it several times.",False
15,8,One of the best female stand-up comedians.,deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"I read a lot of harsh reviews for Ali's recent show and honestly I don't get why. I thought her new stand-up comedy was of the same level as her previous ones and those I loved them all as well. I find Ali very funny, yes maybe a bit too raw for the prudes but I'm not a prude, on the contrary, it can't be raw enough. That's what I think is funny so if you like that as well you can't go wrong with Single Lady. She classifies herself as a six but to me she's a ten. She has everything for her, good-looking, petite, hot, and very funny. I'm already looking forward to her next show which can't come quickly enough.",False
16,2,Was looking forward to this....,cawingcrow,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is just not funny. I have enjoyed watching Ali's videos in the past, but this is just painful. Not funny at all. She seems to be very bitter and not very happy. This doesn't make for good comic material. It seems like very lazy writing. She goes on and about men, using them, disrespecting them and expecting them to be a certain way. If she was a man and she did the same spiel it would create a huge uproar. She may be a millionaire, but she should probably work on her investments and forget about comedy. Well, spacing doesn't work so I am going to use up the last bit with just a bunch of garbage. Kind of like the show.",False
17,2,"As a fan, I was disappointed",ainsleeasokan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was excited to hear material about her life and her views post-divorce since it's titled Single Lady, but really, it was just an hour of her talking about hookups. I was waiting for the moment when she would use the hookup material to pivot into something else, but that never happened. We stayed on the same topic and I also lost interest midway because of that.I did like the throwback to her previous theme of trapping men, and in Baby Cobra when she brought it up, she ended the show with a smart, plot twist of a punchline to tie it all together. I was waiting for a similar payoff with this one, but it ended with no punchline whatsoever.I love Ali Wong's material, but this one really missed the mark for me.",True
18,1,This was a disaster,rmmil,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, never laughed once. Never even cracked a smile, actually. Thats reason enough to rate this poorly.My guess is that Ali had absolutely no one that she bounced this material off of before she did it, because I believe anyone who cared about her would have told her it was a mistake.The special began with Ali talking about being rich and famous and accomplished and that she used men as sex objects. Great? That's fine material for a lot of women standup comedians nowadays so no big deal there. The problem? It never evolved into ANYTHING else!The entire set was Ali going from one short term BF encounter to another. And another. And another. She apparently doesn't get enough oral sex. Okay? You're ""rich"", right? Maybe just hire escorts, cut out the monotony of having to get to know someone at all. Problem solved.I actually enjoyed Ali Wong as a standup in general and as an actress before this. Now? I will go out of my way to avoid her in anything. She came off like a woman Matt Rife (and just as annoying).",False
19,3,"Oh Ali, where did you go wrong?",Lolarobot,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ali Wong's latest Netflix special unfortunately falls short of expectations, presenting a series of crude jokes that feel more like a reliance on shock value than genuine humor. As a 40-year-old woman with a child, I found the constant focus on sexual themes not only tiresome but also disheartening.It seems as if Wong, despite her talent, leans heavily on sex jokes, which can be seen as a limiting representation of women in comedy. This approach feels outdated and misogynistic, perpetuating the stereotype that female comedians can only discuss their bodies or sexual experiences.While I appreciate all forms of comedy, it's frustrating when women comedians fail to explore a broader range of topics. Comedy should reflect diverse experiences, and I believe that a good comedian can connect with audiences on various levels beyond sexual innuendo.Wong has the potential to do better, and I hope to see her embrace a wider array of subjects in the future. This special was a missed opportunity to showcase her talents in a more empowering and nuanced way.",False
20,3,A lover of laughter,infantcoale,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed her other specials and her new Netflix series ""Beef."" I loved them and laughed so much I watched them several times with other people. I'm beyond disappointed of the new special. I couldn't even finish watching it. I got no enjoyment watching it. It was literally her talking about having sex with a bunch of men since her divorce. It started extremely raunchy and didn't have any sense of depth in her comedy. I'm not sure what audience she is trying to relate to but it was extremely disturbing to hear all her sexual desires and experiences in almost every joke. While some jokes were okay she still deviated back to being raunchy. I'm not saying she is a pervert but the skit was definitely perverted. I understand the whole single, proud, independent woman mind set but this performance is very extreme. I'm a lover of comedy and love when a comedian can incorporate some sense of depth and intellect in the humor. My opinion but this one doesn't have it. I only gave three stars because her other specials were good.",False
21,4,Congrats...I guess,dmahoney46,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure what Ali Wong was going for here besides letting everyone know she's had a post-divorce sexual awakening...and has made her way through an apparently healthy lot of guys sexually before settling down. Great? You go girl? Bedding guys between the ages of 25 and 60 with details, and then bagging on guys from the Midwest who consume dairy products. Um, okay? You really burned him there. At one point she called herself a Chinese girl...only to refer to herself later as a Vietnamese girl. Not sure what she meant to go for with this stand-up routine...but comedy and laughter were not the result.",False
22,5,I feel sorry for her child.,sylkestardust,n/a,16/08/2025,"Imagine being a forty year old adult woman having a child and embarrasing yourself and your family in talking about your promiscuous post divorce relationships in such detail.Even if it is fiction.In what universe do you think that your child won't be bullied in school even if it's a private school?Have a little class.The problem with this type of ""humor"" is that it is just cheap, crass devoid of any intelligence.It is zero uplifting, it is not inspiring it is exactly nothing.Is this how you want to be remembered by your child?I get it, sex sells, but were you thát broke that you had to stoop this low?Lengo en el culo ahorita?Wow.Just gross.",False
23,4,warning for men,petersjoelen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stand up comedy is not easy but if you as a woman center your entire show around your divorce (which you are supposedly very proud of) and where the audience reacts very enthusiastically (how bizarre), and then almost exclusively make sex jokes about your new boyfriends (made up or not), then I wonder what is wrong with your personality.It is only about sex and most of the jokes are not funny either, at some point you have heard enough vulgar jokes and you desperately wonder if she can also talk about something else, that is really funnyAli Wong shows her very bad side here, because she can see it as entertainment but I think her children will not be able to see the humor in it.If women still wonder why fewer and fewer men want to marry, you should watch this show, then the answer is very clear.",False

1,1,Drivel -,sparrish2,n/a,16/08/2025,Not a documentary. I tried - I really tried. But unwatchable. Full of 1/2 facts and some made up stuff. I liked Jane Goodall so I gave it 2 stars vs 1. Otherwise - drivel.Released right before an election. Not an accident. This is a 90 minute democratic party commercial.Hillary is so pandering. Fake smile throughout. Chelsea is actually better as an actor. This is not a documentary - this is acting.It dances around and just gives glimpses of each story. Never really tells the story. And it is only one sided. Each woman has a tale of woe. This fails to mention that most of the woman shown were born into money or had a hand up - by a man. This is just male bashing fiction. There are many good stories of people who actually did work their own way to the top. But don't look here.If you have leaves to rake - do that.,False
2,1,shameful,snoozemeejmode,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is incredibly gutsy that the same women who championed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act has an episode focusing on mass/wrongful incarceration. The role she (and her husband) had in creating mass incarceration and promoting institutionalized racism was not acknowledged whatsoever.Kim Kardashian? Lying about getting tons of plastic surgery procedures has been a real step forward for women! Well, I suppose it is gutsy to build a career off of an adult film you sold and lied about for years.Apparently the reason people dislike Amy Schumer is because she is a woman? Maybe it's because she is an insanely obnoxious joke thief.Hillary tells the same stories she has been telling for years and shamelessly panders to her guests. It is unsettling to witness the forcefulness of Hillary attempting to come across as relatable.This show is so embarrassing.",False
3,10,This series is begging for bad reviews from people who didn't watch it,SoundsOKtoMe,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is nothing more threatening to a misogynist than an empowered woman, and every episode highlights several of them. This series could be considered misogynist bait... it's about strong, intelligent, driven women and is hosted by one of the most reviled (by thin-skinned misogynists) and loved women in the world and her daughter.Hillary and Chelsea do a decent job with the interviews, meetings and mini-adventures. There's a lot of fluff, no "" hard-hitting"" journalism, but this series introduced me to a lot of interesting women I may never have otherwise heard of. Worth the watch, even if just for that.",False
4,1,Women Should be Angry,wznnwkhj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let's be clear: this isn't docuseries about the power of women as they actively pursue making people and the world a better place, it's just superficial celebrities talking from a script about problems and issues they don't really live in the world of.Don't tell me these are the best women Apple TV could find. Where are the trailblazers in the military, the stay at home mom, the organ donor, the firefighter, the woman who volunteers at food banks and a doctor? Legitimately would have been interested to hear stories from exceptional women, not these lot.And please, don't let young women think these are the best examples they can live up to.",False
5,n/a,A cross-generational TV sensation,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have nothing but good things to say about this series. And in fact I hope we get a continuation with another season. Hillary and Chelsea are so vulnerable, inspirational, and warm in this incredibly eye-opening and moving series. Hillary opens up in Waze I've never seen her before. Chelsea proves herself to be an incredibly powerful and important figure in culture. I really love the fact that they included Symone, as there are so many different versions of GUTSY women. My favorite were some of the unknown storytellers and heroes as their stories were inspiring and different than anything out there. What Hillary and Chelsea managed to do in this series was allow the world to understand the power and beauty and being a gutsy woman. I wanted more.",False
6,10,Push through your discomfort,HelloBlockbuster,n/a,16/08/2025,"I almost shied away from watching this because of the poor reviews. Listen, some of this was absolutely scripted-to a point. Meaning, they had talking points to hit on but it wasn't a line-for-line scripted show. My guess is the majority of negative comments are from cisgender-hetero-males (or females who have been in a world with them, indoctrinated). Woke? You say it like it's a bad thing. I'd rather be aware of differences in experiences than with my head in the ground like a privileged ostrich.Ignore the haters, give it a shot-with an open mind and heart. Uncomfortable? Push through it. That's where growth happens.",False
7,1,Cherry Picks Information. Horrible Docu Series,gcanders1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big fan of many of the women in this series; however, it's all fluff. Jane Goodall is one of the reasons I became a teacher, but this just idolizes her and doesn't touch on any of the negative aspects of her career or negative effects she had on science, local communities, and the animals themselves. It looks like it's all that way. I'm all for celebrating women for their accomplishments, but a true documentary series needs to be unbiased. It all plays out like a Lifetime Christmas drama. I'm excited about the Goldie Hawn portion. She is remarkable and most likely the only person on this series without controversy or things they need to cover up. Hillary is a bit obtuse as to how she comes off. She's very unlikeable. I realize she's trying to make a contribution, but this is as boring as an awards banquet and only flatters the subject with things we already know. This series offers no new information and puts the subjects on pedestals. I guess it might be something to watch with very young young children, or maybe a primary school classroom, it I was expecting something more. Sadly, this is pretty much something you can have running in the background while doing something else. If you want better representation of these women, pick up their biographies. This show is bland and self-serving. Now, if she got someone like Michael Moore involved, that might correct what's wrong with this show.",False
8,8,Very Empowering Show That Highlights Known And Unknown Women Heroes,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gutsy is a documentary series worth the watch! It's a very empowering show for women that highlights household-name heroes and well as several unrecognized heroes.Gutsy follows former first lady Hillary Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, as they meet ""gutsy"" women and answer the question: what it means to be ""gutsy"". They share the interesting and inspiring stories of admirable women throughout eight episodes.The documentary is based on The New York Times' best-selling book, The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite stories of Courage and Resilience, authored by Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. Some of the episodes include Gutsy Women Have the Last Laugh, Gutsy Women Refuse Hate, and Gutsy Women Seek Justice. Other topics explored include women being rebellious, taking leaps of faith, exhibiting their strengths and motherhood. It's fascinating to hear stories about people you didn't know outside of movies and shows, or even at all. Some of the interviewees include Dr. Jane Goodall, Gloria Steinem, Megan Thee Stallion, Goldie Hawn, Amy Schumer, Kate Hudson, Wanda Sykes, along with many more accomplished women. Hillary and Chelsea Clinton are such natural hosts and make it easy to enjoy watching them.The main messages are to be ""gutsy"" and to not let your hard times define you. There is profanity, and mature topics are discussed.I give Gutsy 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This movie comes out on Apple TV+ September 9, 2022.By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!",False
9,1,Absolutely horrible like they are,skpn123,n/a,16/08/2025,"The list of women chosen are all very predictable and ho-hum and I was not able to identify any honesty, any authenticity, in fact anything but stereotypical woke xxx including laughable warnings of 'vast right wing conspiracies' to destroy the planet - what sort of hobbits do they think we are? We have seen the events of the past 15 years....I love celebrations of a diversity of women, cheering on their accomplishments, but a true documentary interview needs to be unbiased.Overall, a total self indulgent and disturbing yawn from beginning to end with glaring gaps in fact. If that is supposed to be inspirational we are going to need a lot of help from the Higher Power and I don't mean the Woke global leaders.....",False
10,1,"""Ignore negative reviews!!!"" Hah, hard to do when that's all there is!",justincelano-777-479350,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is painful to watch. Hillary creates a show called Gutsy, about ""gutsy"" woman dancing, and then orchestrates herself being interviewed about being ""gutsy,"" by another ""gutsy"" woman... Wow. That's a lot of guts. I feel bad for Jane Goodall, she actually has guts, the rest claim it. This show is proof that good people don't go around claiming how good they are, they're just good, courageous people, don't claim courage, they just have it, generous people just give selflessly, and ""gutsy"" people people don't make shows called ""Gutsy."" And apparently the Clinton's don't make shows worth watching.",False
11,1,Such Obvious Condescension,maryodawn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly, we couldn't make it through the first installment of this leftist condescending drivel. The Clinton women are such patronizing phonies, and that makes them impossible to watch.Looking at the list of their 'Gutsy' choices is like reading a sheet of the most horrible examples of women human beings in our country. They must have had to work extra hard to choose such a group of Godless, shameless, and extraordinarily narcissistic women who actually do not elevate our society but rather contribute to our downfall and destruction.Save your life and save your time - stay away from this horror!",False
12,10,LOVED this series.,tylerperry-17995,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ignore the bad reviews, they are bots. This show brought such a great collective of women from around the world. Conservatives, liberals, American or not will love this show. I learned so much about native people, women comedians, celebrities or not, politicians, activists, hate crime survivors, and icons. This show needs a season 2. Hillary and Chelsea prove they are here to stay and show the world brave and powerful women. And the reviews just show that they are doing the GUTSY work. Being GUTSY comes with the pressure and criticism. Thank you for this!!!My favorites: Gloria Steinem, Kate Hudson, Negin, and the wedding official. That was so vulnerable.",False
13,10,Ignore negative reviews!!!!,paulat111,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPlease ignore the negative reviews. Watch a few episodes. I binge watched all the shows. At the end I felt something I haven't felt in YEARS. HOPE!!! Yes, there are celebrities that are a tad annoying. But they are also a tad inspiring. The MOST inspiring are the non-famous, REAL women! Non-celebrity women that fought for everything they have! They are still forging ahead but also listening to the younger generations. I think Chelsea and Hillary did an amazing job with their research and interviews. I enjoyed every second of this series! Thank you to Chelsea, Hillary and all the women who have and are fighting for equality and fairness!",True
14,10,Insightful Inspiring Series,rkeilitz-19-537915,n/a,16/08/2025,"I truly do not understand all the negative hateful comments and reviews I have read about this series unless they are either bots or just people playing the political card against the Clintons.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and daughter Chelsea embark on a thought-provoking journey to speak with pioneering women artists, activists, community leaders, and everyday heroes showing courage, determination, and spirit. I loved every minute of each segment and it taught me how to love my mother even more now that she is gone.I do hope that Hillary and Chelsea will continue their journey of seeking out more gutsy women with a second series to follow.",False
15,8,I'm glad I gave it a chance.,sparilis,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was a bit skeptical before I watched this. I thought it was going to be preachy, and cringy, and I'd get a headache from rolling my eyes too much. Turned out not to be the case at all. Don't misunderstand - this show is by no means riveting, ""must-see TV"", but it is a good show. The conversations between Hillary, Chelsea, and their guests are warm, intimate, and engaging. The style of the show is very relaxed and casual. It reminds me a lot of 'Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee'. Maybe that's because the topic was comedians? I don't know. I'll keep watching to find out. So far, however, so good. Give it a chance.",False
16,10,MAGICAL AND GUTSY WOMEN UNITE!,jenmuc,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film is edited masterfully and tells a rousing and moving story that enraptures viewers from the first frame. One of the most unique parts of is that we see Hillary speaking in all stages of her journey - hearing Hillary's voice is one of the most compelling aspects of the film, and it adds many endearing, bittersweet, and motivating moments. And what a journey. I especially love the scenes where Hillary and Chelsea telling their stories with Mariska.GUTSY is a SHOW about perseverance. Even though watching Hillary go through the relearning process is difficult for viewers, it is also empowering - it shows us that the human spirit, when set on achieving something, will achieve it... and how! Today, she is giving speeches, lobbying for change, and at the forefront of one of America's hottest discussions: the gun debate.Was surprised with Kim k and meg. Loved them.",False
17,10,Excellent Content,Rusty-28885,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series of interviews covered historical and current change makers - women - who have and are still bringing progress on so many fronts - in legal, medical, and social arenas. They spent time with women who have been pushing the envelope for decades along with those who are new to the front lines of progress. They included black leaders, indigenous leaders, LGBTQ leaders, and other minorities. It was inspiring. It made me hopeful. In an era when the voice of a fraction of extremists is given a megaphone and so much influence via social media and the 24 hour news cycle (I see the onslaught of negativity from this bunch in the reviews here) this is a reminder that there are good people out there who are working hard to bring progress and justice and they aren't giving up. It makes me want to find more ways to contribute. I'm grateful for this and I hope there will be more to come from these two!",False
18,10,Honest review from an actual viewer,DonnaAnnWard1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The bad reviews seem to be from Hillary haters who didn't see the show.It's a real joy to watch a beautiful mother/daughter relationship that most of us first caught glimpses of thirty years ago. Their deep thinking and keen listening provide a wide platform for strong, ground-breaking, intelligent women, many of whom are not widely known. The household names that are included open themselves up in relaxed, very personal ways.All the women in the series have tremendous stories that are told with smarts and great senses of humor. The variety of professions and lifestyles represented by these gutsy women make for bold, genuinely interesting choices. Kudos to the producers for embracing diversity.A nice added element of fun are the unscripted Hillary and Chelsea moments. They are unabashedly themselves as they try new things, comfortable with being novices putting their full trust in the gutsy women who guide them. Their interspersed one-on-one conversations show what a life of self-reflection and love can bring to one's self and one's relationships with the world.The series also offers rare insight into the personal lives of a First Lady and Daughter years after they've left White House. Chelsea as a working mother and Hillary as a retired grandmother reflecting on their lives puts a human face on who most viewers knew as a child and elected official.Overall a it's a great show, very solid. Skip the Right Wing noise and enjoy this A+ doc series.",False
19,10,Excellent content!,vxtfkhvg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm 3 episodes in and love the content of Gutdy Women already - it's masterfully produced and touches on a wide range of important topics. The women featured are true heroes, and every episode looks at a given topic through multiple lenses.It's a joy to see HRC and her daughter Chelsea jointly facilitating these discussions. I didn't know much about Chelsea and, after only being a few episodes in, really admire her - she's far more humble and funny than I was expecting (dare I say, I would actually want her to be my friend!!).Overall, I feel inspired and energized after each episode (my boyfriend did too!!). Highly recommend giving it a watch!",False
20,10,Outstanding series!,utahman-23203,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very hard hitting and well thought out series that hits on many issues of the day, especially from the perspective of women.Those who are triggered and threatened by smart, empowered women may not enjoy the series.As a man watching this with my wife, I see this as an educational opportunity for your children. But be aware that difficult topics are explored. Hillary and Chelsea give voice to many wonderful women from all walks of life who are doing wonderful things to make our world a better place to be for everyone.There are much needed reminders and new information presented. Some of the stories are difficult to hear but necessary. We can't run from the truth.Forget the negative reviews from the haters. Give it a watch and you won't be disappointed.",False
21,10,I enjoyed it!,chelsmcmanus,n/a,16/08/2025,"The coming together of strong women for this series is amazing. What's not to hate about women from all walks of life coming together to share their stories and personal experiences? Someone mentioned in another review that everyone in the show is privileged, which just isn't true.It is definitely more feel good than a hard hitting docuseries, but I think that was the draw for me. Women lifting other women up is what we need more of. I'd say give it a try and you'll be pleasantly surprised. And if it's not your cup of tea, then that's fair.My only critique is the length of their conversations. I would've liked to see longer conversations with each person, although I understand the want to talk to many different women about their experiences which lends to some getting cut short.",False
22,9,"Honest, entertaining, informative",ekehoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very interesting show. I love how they made sure to have big names, but also really focused on individuals who really are working to make their communities better. Lots of people I had never heard of, and am now helping to amplify. I didn't expect to like Kim K, but hearing her talk normally about the law, and about what she is doing, is actually impressive and I see her differently now. Learning about these women. Is it a scripted series? Parts, of course, are scripted. But the actual warmth between Hilary and Chelsea when they are together, when they talk to others, really is natural and fun. One thing that stuck with me was when Chelsea said that she doesn't remember a time when she wasn't hated, from when she was a child. Really informative, really interesting, and I'm hoping for more seasons.",False
23,10,Enlightening docuseries,krnrns,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this series very moving and informing. The relationship between mother and daughter is so genuinely sweet. This was definitely a learning experience. Personally, I enjoy exploring other peoples lives. Some of the stories were heartbreaking, but it was wonderful to see them persevere and succeed. The human diversity was what really piqued my interest...bouncing around the nation and parts of the world was visually appealing and inspiring. I would recommend this series to anyone that has an opened mind and willing to separate Hillary, a woman/mother from the politician. Certainly worth watching.",False
24,10,Uplifting,mcquisk-59863,n/a,16/08/2025,One of the best shows I've watched in awhile celebrating Influential women. Hope they do several more seasons.ignore the negative reviews and give this show a chance. It's uplifting and has a great message especially for young women. Women can do anything if given the opportunity. This show highlights groundbreaking women and the generation of today and tomorrow has those opportunities. Thank you Hilary and Chelsea for showing us and giving these women the opportunity to see what they've done for us. I learned quite a bit that I didn't know about this history of these incredible women. I hope to see more!,False
25,10,Really great series! Please ignore the negative reviews.,krazyku-51685,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such a refreshing series! I am fully enjoying the people being interviewed along with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton. This series is insightful, informative, fun and beautifully shot. The stories are engaging and inspiring. I'm going to bet that the negative reviews are from people who automatically dislike Hillary Clinton and likely have not watched the show. But please just watch the show. It is empowering for women. It brings me hope for a better America and a better world. Women are badass. We get stuff done. We are strong. We are resilient. This is a show about that. It's too bad that some men are too limited in themselves and their thinking.",False

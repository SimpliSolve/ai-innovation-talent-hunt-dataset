1,6,"An interesting and important topic, but doesn't need to be a feature length film",ogyad,n/a,16/08/2025,"For the first 20 mins I was fully engaged, the footage and stories are very moving. The reactions of the victims to their own battering was intense. However, the film gets repetitive, as the same ideas and themes are only reinforced, but not developed. It is difficult to go into depth with political theory in film form; I personally believe film can only be used as a tool to agitate but not educate. The film references Weber throughout but I also recommend Charles Tilly's ""Do states make wars?"".This film would be better as a short doc uploaded to YouTube so more people could see what's going on in France.",False

1,9,How horny is that then?,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - if you are fluent in German you may recognize the saying I am using in my summary headline. Which is also a riff on the title of this documentary. Which is really good - actually a bit too short for my taste. Would have liked to see even more. And while this is structured and well edited, it does jump a few timesStill the 3 episodes have themes to them and they make sense and show how Viva became a household name ... and how the fall of the music industry broke it. We all were wondering why MTV stopped showing music videos ... but it made sense for them. The shows made more money - than showing videos that many may not have been interested in anymore anyway.You get to see the moderators from day one ... and also those that came later on. A lot of great talent - and nothing is being left out. Controversies are being tackled ... head on or however you would describe it.Niels Ruf seemed to generate a lot of publicity, but it also looks like he didn't play a role, but actually was really mean in private too. Not cool obviously and just one example of many. There was quite the diversity and that is a topic too. A lot of PoC, not Germans showing stuff ... woke and representation ... even before it was ""invented"". A lot of goodies here ... again there could be a lot more ... I want to talk to all of the people who were involved in making Viva what it was ... I also would have loved to be part of that family ... they seemed to have the grandest of time ... and that did translate on screen and into our living rooms ...",False

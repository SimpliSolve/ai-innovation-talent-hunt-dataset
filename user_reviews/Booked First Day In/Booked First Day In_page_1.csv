1,10,Interesting,pinksunshine-73990,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found all of the different stories very interesting. I hated that I had to keep reading the entire show cause they kept flashing words up there. I watch tv, so I don't have to read, but yeah I need more seasons and also, if the show would tell us how much time they actually got, and how much bail they ended up getting, that would be much more interesting instead of the generic ""if"" scenarios. I have to sit here writing and writing apparently lol good grief. Well y'all need more episodes. Chop chop chop. We want more. I like jail shows for some reason and this hit the spot for entertainment. Bring on the new season.",False
2,2,Why?,NullUnit,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the words of every Police officer ever...Move along.....
Nothing to see here......
Move along......
Disperse people.There's nothing to see.Move along......What an absolutely uneventful show.Nothing happens.You see people talking about why they were arrested.. then see them on the phone trying to make bail... then see some being released.. that's the show. There's no ""action"", no ""drama"", no ""intrigue"". Nothing to warrant a television show.Some may be thinking this is similar to that show ""Jail"".. but it's not. Things actually happened on ""Jail"" episodes..NOTHING ever happens in this series.. at least nothing up to episode 8...A&E airs it wisely immediately following 60 Days In.. so it's easy to just let the channel run... but why anyone would specifically tune in for this bore-fest is a mystery to me.",False

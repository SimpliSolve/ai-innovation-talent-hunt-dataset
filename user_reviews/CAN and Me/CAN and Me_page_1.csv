1,5,Misleading title and bio,lucreciagarino,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a CAN documentary.This should be called ""me me and me, keyboard player from can"" .Footage close to null, can't blame you for that, if there's ni footage there's no footage. In some way this wants to be Moonage daydream.Its mostly the guy and his partner in life telling the stories, I mean great story great musician. I was glad to learn more about his path and his methods, it would have been better if the movie fully focused on that.By the name I thought this movie was from an outsiders perspective, that could have been the lady, full focus on her pov, but no , whats the focus really?? Me my lady my career and can?CAN part was about a quarter of the film.",False

1,8,I mostly enjoyed it,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hannah Gadsby returns with a third Netflix special that starts good and ends great. While her first special is best remembered for being a serious affair, and her second increased the quantity of jokes (Gadsby herself acknowledged she'd unpacked most of her trauma in her first big special), with Something Special, I feel like Gadsby just revolutionised ""my wife"" comedy (which itself is a generally tired type of standup that I tend not to like).To elaborate, it's a pet peeve of mine when stand-up comedians rely too heavily on jokes about their wives (mostly men, but I've also seen female comedians who make much of their routine about partners), and that there seem to be increasingly fewer ways to make these jokes funny. They're not always inherently unfunny, but it's a type of joke you start to recognize (and get tired of) after watching a decent number of standup specials.Here, Gadsby's show largely revolves around the last few (mostly positive) years of her life, particularly how she came to be married. Her jokes aren't at the expense of her partner; they're more just funny and endearing observations. The endearing part makes up for the fact that the material isn't always laugh-out-loud funny. It's a little more subdued, but it's consistent and doesn't often miss. It also builds up to an excellent ending that made me appreciate the special as a whole much more.If there's one complaint, it's that things grind to a halt whenever Gadsby mentions ""editing out"" jokes that don't hit. I feel like comedians should take a failed joke in stride, lampshade its failure in a funny way, or actually edit it out and not let the imperfection show. I know I've seen other comedians lately do this kind of reference when something doesn't hit with the audience, and I think it's starting to hurt specials. It's confusing, because I remember her second special had some better meta-observations about the nature of standup, but here, they just feel like (very occasional) awkward bloopers.But this is largely a very good special, and expertly subverts and puts a positive/wholesome spin on the tired ""complain about my wife for an hour"" style of standup special. From now on, anyone else who wants to base a comedy special primarily around their significant other has to make sure it's at least as good as this.",False
2,2,Poor show by Hannah,chirox,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the outset I'll make it clear that I'm not a big stand up fan but my wife really likes Hannah Gadsby's offerings so I agreed to give it a try. It was far from 'Something Special', literally didn't even grin once but I guess I'm not her target audience. My wife wasn't laughing either for most of it, she did have the odd snigger here and there and I asked her if she thought ti was good, her reply was 'it's okay, not her best work'.I think some comics miss the boat a little by appealing to a very narrow fan base, super narrow in Gadsby's case, she pretty much had me thinking 'I don't think she likes me even though we've never met' within 10 minutes.",False
3,9,It is what it promises to be - a feel good show,frank-340-831830,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hannah jokes that we are owed a feel good show after previously making us laugh and cry - and the show delivers on this promise.Like most good stand up - it felt short and left you wanting more. Like most good stand up - stories linked into other stories, and stories about telling stories were also a pleasure.And that is just it - laugh or cry, Hannah tells stories, facts, truths in the type of way that makes us feel we could all be successful comics telling the nuances of our lives - but Hannah nails it.You wont have your heart wrenched like Nanette - but you will be entertained and this is ""something special""",False
4,3,Not funny,doispedoidoi,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched both Nanette and Douglas (Hannah's previous Netflix specials), and I enjoyed parts of each show. I found myself laughing at the Art jokes quite a lot. Even some of the lesbian jokes were fun, but they also get tired fast.But this special, was like watching paint dry! It was more like a chore.There was a joke that got a chuckle out, but I forgot which one it was.I don't get why she is repeating how good she is as a storyteller and how bad her wife is at telling stories. I got it the first time, it doesn't become funnier if you say if a bunch of times.The jokes are very mild and boring, definitely not worthy of such a large audience. But maybe I just didn't get it?",False
5,10,Really fun to share in Hannah's joy,alexsthomas-29075,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoyed Nanette and Douglas, so I was quite easy to win over. However I can find (understandably) that comedians with one or two strong specials can struggle to live up to their previous work, or delivery more of the same. With all of Gadsby's specials I have found they have their own unique tone and message.I enjoyed the celebration of a relationship from start to present. I write about love in my own work and worry I come off as overly sentimental and boring so I found something special to be a lesson in how to talk about your partner in a way that people can relate to.I also always get a lot from Gadsby's observations about being autistic, and that they explain their experiences in a way anyone can relate to.Is it funny? Yes, I laughed a lot and find the special has re-watch value. Will you find it funny? I don't know but you will enjoy the performance and story.",False
6,1,Overindulgent and funny at all,munagenikis,n/a,15/08/2025,"I always found Gadsby super witty and edgy, but this one is so put on it fails to be counted as comedy. Gadsby definitely lost her edge here, telling ""normal"" jokes something she really doesn't have an advantage in. And all the name dropping is so tedious. I couldn't even follow the storyline of her meeting with Jody Foster, among others. She sounded as if she is not convinced of her own jokes, which makes sense. The tone is flat and monotonous, it's as if she is banking on her fans liking her that she is not bothered to put in the effort. It really doesn't work when the comedy is entirely 100% about you! You're interesting but not THAT interesting. Sorry Hannah thumbs down for me for this one.",False
7,10,My favourite comedian in action,summersun-93200,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is now the third special from Hannah Gadsby, and one I love as much as the two earlier ones. While Nanette broke my heart, Douglas was just pure joy of connecting with a fellow autistic mind, and no we have Something Special, which, indeed, is something special.Hannah has the ability to build her comedy on laughing at her own peculiarities all the while being just the charming witty person she is. She tells the story of proposing her now wife, Jenno, and turns the story into a heart-warming comedy show without insulting anyone, without laughing at less-fortunare people, and without being problematic. And, this is pure perfection.Also very relatable for someone like me, autistic and queer.",False
8,10,Banana Crackers!,seekermar,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHannah is the only comedian who makes me laugh from beginning to end. Nanett took me by surprise and made me laugh. Until it made me cry, like so many other people too. Douglass was a diamond of comedic storytelling. She is clever and her endings are always spot on. Something special is spot on as well. I'm a Christian and I found her gentle poking fun of my religion at the beginning to be funny. I also related so hard to her wife's confusion over Aussie sports and the meters joke was spot on. I already have banana crackers had me laughing so hard. I don't want to spoil too much of the special so I'll just say that it's a romantic comedy...or is it.",True
9,1,Comedy? lol,realityinmind,n/a,15/08/2025,"If this was described as ""a person walking around on stage talking about boring mundane day-to-day things that are not funny"" then I would laugh and be like ""are you serious? I gotta watch this"". But it was described as a ""comedy special"", so I watched this thinking that someone was going to tell jokes and I was going to laugh.Not only did I not laugh, but the audience didn't laugh either. There is one joke about the color blue.... wow, it was like watching that one lady back in 2016 who said ""wiped the hard drive? Like, with a cloth?"", which is essentially when the word ""cringe"" was invented in pop culture. The entire audience of this special looked at each other with a weird look on their faces thinking ""Is this funny? Am I supposed to laugh?""I hope that analogy gives you an idea of what you can expect to feel when you watch this thing. It is beyond dry. And I don't mean dry like the Office, but dry like static cling in your laundry. You are going to get electrocuted when you stand up from your couch to turn off the tv.How did this person manage to secure a Netflix special? I just don't get it. I highly doubt you will either.",False
10,4,Meh.,jp-206,n/a,15/08/2025,"I ""got"" Nanette and I really enjoyed ""Douglas"" but I don't know what the hell this was suppose to be. Yay, she got married, completely happy for her on that. I'm happy for her wife as well. That's wonderful. But the rest of it didn't land anywhere near humorous for me. I found it repetitive, morbid, and banal at best. She sounds liked she was trying way too hard for this special; the previous two felt quite organic and true to herself. This felt like a pop star was making an album to meet a record company contract and the only important thing was to fulfill that contract. I maybe snickered once. Ok, it was a chuckle but the rest of it was dismal. So disappointing.",False
11,1,Surely this violates the trade description act?,Jouford,n/a,15/08/2025,"Call me old fashioned; but I generally like some comedy in my comedy specials. I honestly don't know what this even was, but it wasn't comedy.I've seen a lot of criticism thrown Hannah's way, and I've never bothered to confirm whether or not it's justified, so I decided to watch Something Special.The criticism is justified.This wasn't so much much a comedy special as it was a long whinge; about how hard Hannah - and women in general.- have had it in life. At no point does she explain how or why she's oppressed. She just throws it out there and uses the victimhood as a way to solicit laughs - a task at which she fails massively. I didn't even manage a smile during this show. I just sat scratching my head, wondering why it is this woman's shows get such high ratings.It's truly a mystery to me.",False

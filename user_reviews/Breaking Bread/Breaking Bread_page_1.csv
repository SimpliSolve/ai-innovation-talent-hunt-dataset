1,10,Perfect antidote to being a COVID Pandemic funk!,melanie-95514,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is a breath of fresh air if you have been indoors and alone too much during the pandemic, as positivity exudes throughout Breaking Bread on so many levels other than food. Oh, yes, the food is tantalizing, but you can also taste and smell the exquisite positive people and their connection to each other and how they have successfully made meaning from adversity, barriers, limitations, and the ancestors who make their debut and mark their presence and power in this movie. And, if that isn't enough and you have also been following the migration patterns and are seeking a new destination to call home, the landscape like the food is nourishingly palatable, specifically, Haifa will be within your radar and on your menu. The first thing I did upon returning home after seeing the movie last night was to soak a cup of organic garbanzo beans to make hummus: one metaphor in the movie -- ""hummus has no borders."" Loved Breaking Bread. There isn't a touch of Hollywood to it. The love and connections are simple, real, and authentic,",False

1,9,A stylish call to action,sven-imdb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hesitated somewhat to watch this film because i was afraid it would be depressing. Not so. This stylish documentary is a call to action. We get to see fascinating clips from six different researchers, including raw, personal footage from the ISS that alone is reason enough to watch it. The six scientists offer their view of the situation the planet is in and manage to create a compelling call to action. I particularly liked the contributions by Alexander Gerst, Sylvia Earle and Matthieu Ricard. The underwater shots were also very enjoyable. This film will ruminate through your brain for a while after you watched it. Recommended.",False

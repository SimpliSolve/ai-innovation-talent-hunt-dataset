1,9,"Stunning, mesmerizing, magical.",laura-saaristo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can higly recommend this film if you want to watch something relaxing and beautiful - skip it if you don't like slow paced, serene films that isn't filled with action. But if you are looking for a break of all the hassle and noise in your life, you're in for a treat.The shooting is beyond anything I've ever seen before, I was in awe the entire time. The score music is perfect and carries the story amazingly throughout the film. The voice of Peter Franz√©n is calm and relaxing and he is a great choice for narrator. I also enjoyed the mystical stories about Lapland and it's nature. All in all - I loved it!",False

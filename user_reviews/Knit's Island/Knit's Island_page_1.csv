1,5,"""We are like weird ethernet friends""",evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe closest I have come to online gaming is playing Scrabble on my laptop, so this was foreign terrain to me.I had difficulty getting my bearings for quite awhile, till I realized I didn't have to take the shootings or killings seriously because these were game characters doing ""whatever the f---"" they wanted.The notion that I also was encountering the personae of game players was lost on me till members of my film group addressed this aspect of the film. I'm sure if I re-viewed it, I'd find more to understand and appreciate.Although I didn't like ""Knit's Island"" enough to invest another 90 minutes, I did find enough to capture my interest.Much of what is relatable in the film pertains to nature, and I enjoyed the pristine pines, glassy waters, firmament full of stars, and flits of butterflies.And people doing breast stroke across the sky -- now, that's a thing of beauty!",True

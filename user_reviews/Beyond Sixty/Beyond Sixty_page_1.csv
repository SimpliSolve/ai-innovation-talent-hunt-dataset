2,10,The Beyond Sixty Project is a revolutionary documentary and a must-see for all!,support-08554,n/a,16/08/2025,"This highly inspirational documentary film by Melissa Davey follows the lives of ten women who continue to follow their passions well beyond what is considered ""retirement age"" in the US. Davey seamlessly weaves together the stories of these brilliant, strong, courageous, fun, spirited women, giving us a glimpse into the myriad possibilities we can look forward to in our later years if we create them. We can also see that their attitudes do not comply with society's typical view on the aging process. Davey prompts us to see beyond the cultural obsession with youth and dares us to look at the third act of our lives. The women in this film and Davey herself have proven that women in their 60's and beyond have more than resilience and relevance; they have the wisdom to help guide us in a better direction, at a time when their knowledge and know-how is what we desperately need in this world.",False

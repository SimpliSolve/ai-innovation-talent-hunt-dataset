1,9,Great Stand-up with a horrible audience,sub-80,n/a,16/08/2025,Bill Burr quality Stand up in a beautiful location but with the most horrible audience. Just shows how much Bill Burr is a professional to continue with all the stupid 'Yeah or Woo' shouts that generated regardless of the content.,False
2,9,Back and in fine form,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Comedian Bill Burr performs a stand-up routine at Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Colorado in 2021.I set my expectations a bit low before watching this. I'm a big Bill Burr fan but his last TV special was the awful Friends Who Kill. Admittedly it was a multi-comedian event and he was just the host but even his segment felt forced and far below his usual standard.I needn't have worried. Back in his element - performing alone and with an hour or so to comment on and rant about anything he likes - Bill Burr is fantastic. The humour is un-PC and irreverent, not just going where the serially offended fascists don't want comedians to go but also pointing out the stupidity and lack of balance in their views.It's not just anti-woke, there's also some hilarious observations on family life and life in general. This all done in Burr's inimitable intense, over-the-top fashion.Excellent show.",False
3,8,What you would expect from Bill Burr,lilong-10201,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you were a fan you will not be disappointed. From silly jokes to politics, there might be a few hit or miss but overall it's a strong special. Bill has been diving into deeper personal issues since Paper Tiger and it truly shows he's growing not only as a comedian but as a person.",False
4,9,The best Bill Burr standup,geekoutmetal,n/a,16/08/2025,"This definitely takes the cake.Its so well written and delivered and shows why both Burr and Chapelle are standup icons taking no prisoners on the stage today.It's hard to not to laugh at what Bill talks about cause if you're honest with yourself and been through some things and seen a bit more than the average Joe or Josephine, well you would understand and laugh too, cause he makes it all too real and funny at the same time.",False
5,8,Solid set by Bill,cimorellisteve,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not his best special but still much better than most. Not every subject is completely PC but that's why he always gives you a solid performance. Need comedians to get close to that ""line"" What's great is he finishes really strong.",False
6,7,Comeback,AfricanBro,n/a,16/08/2025,"After ""friends who kill"" I had ridiculously low expectations for this so much that I almost didn't watch it. The first 15 minutes, maybe more, weren't all that but eventually it gets better, if you're a Bill Burr fan that is because it's his usual anger-fueled, unfiltered harangue type comedy he's known for, so it gets better as it goes. I don't think it's his best work but after friends who kill the bar was pretty low. In my opinion Paper Tiger is his best work and it'll always be one of my favorite specials so I always watch his latest specials with that in mind. This was still good though, my favorite was his bit on feminism and how women are better, and his interaction with kitchen or tv with his daughter. As bill burr has mentioned on several occasions previously he's not a well read man but I love how he always tries to make his argument reasonable or make sense logically, I love it when comedians say something that's politically incorrect but can make you think ""well he's not wrong though"". This is him going back to the bill burr we love, ranting about everything he thinks is silly with the world. It's a bit meh at the beginning and maybe I just feel that way because he went on topics such as the woke agenda and Covid which have been tuckered out by every other comedian recently that it feels like a cheap shot to me even if it's good; but the other ¾ of the show was a solid 7 if this is your type of humor.",False
7,9,Burr in top Form,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bill Burr gets better and better. 2nd, probably, only to Chappelle in the stand up game he shines in this mega show. He tackles to pandemic, woke culture, relationships and more with his biting humor. He is a great and engaging talent and this show is super funny.",False
8,7,It's ok,inacan-90-894261,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a good standup set, doesn't compare to ""you people are all the same"" as it lacks a bit of the ire that he had years ago. It's solid, entertaining, it will offend but also make you think and it goes by quickly enough. My wife was laughing hard at some points but ultimately fell asleep during the ""family life"" segment.",False
9,8,"In His Groove, Again",nebohr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBill Burr really shouldn't give inspirational talks. We're not sure but we think the man doesn't even know the meaning of the word ""inspirational"". Bill is in top form this go round and he's done so much research for this special. Did you know crazy people are great in bed?He tells about his first trip on mushrooms and it's a bit sad.He talks about his dysfunctional family. His anger issues. His plan to murder his father. His newfound sobriety and his four and a half year old life coach.Glad to see you back, Bill.",True
10,6,An alright standup special,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a decent enough stand-up special. I often find Bill Burr entertaining without ever loving his specials, as he tackles topics that are kind of tired in a way that's usually amusing, thankfully, but never hilarious (not to me at least). Topics like gender, being in your 40s/50s, the ""struggles"" of fame, politics, cancel culture, the difficulties of being a comedian in current times- all those sorts of things.I do like how he rides a line of being almost too much of an angry middle-aged comedian, but dials it back just after that he never goes too far. It ties into the whole making jokes out of ordinary topics thing, and while Burr is better than 90% of the comedians who tackle those topics in a way that's unbearable to watch, he's not quite among the few that can spin that stuff miraculously into gold; more like very listenable and sometimes amusing bronze.",False
11,10,Maybe the funniest Burr stand up yet.,J-odishaw,n/a,16/08/2025,I have always been a fan of the way Bill straddles both sides of the issues. Poking fun at the lunatics of the world. I have laughed at maybe 3 stand up sets ever as hard as I did here.,False
12,6,Disappointing,roxlerookie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge fan of the guy, but this special was weak. He's getting mature, he's married and a dad, he's working on his own issues and trauma. Good for him, but it means he's ranting less, and his growth story is not delivered in an overly funny way. Not that his previous gems were only due to his anger, but this just felt a bit boring. None of the usual Bill Burr magic. Maybe staying home for two years didn't help with testing out routines in clubs and finding new material. A lot of recycled topics, jokes that when you know his previous works, felt stale.",False
13,4,it's ok. really.,ldere-74111,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just ok. Hits on all the typical hot button controversial but not so unique topics. Nothing shocking, some bits were amusing.Definitely not as good as his older stuff.I think the fact the audience cheered and clapped more than they laughed wasn't positive. It's supposed to be a comedy show, not a preaching.",False
14,10,masterpiece,bobbubsullivan,n/a,16/08/2025,This special is by far his best to date. I have loved everyone if his specials . This special has me laughing from the entire time.. Bill Burr and Dave Chappelle are two of the best all time comedians.. Thank you Bill for exceeding my expectations in this special ... I thought it would be 2nd only to the closer .. I honestly feel the closer and live at the red rock are the two best standup comedy specials all time . I hope they inspire more and more artists to keep freedom of artistic expression alive for generations to come.... No one compares to these two masters of their craft.,False
15,10,Funny and sophisticated as always.,kasabatunik,n/a,16/08/2025,"When you listen to his take on woke culture, the abortion debate, and many subjects he's been telling on this show, you cannot stop thinking how brilliant and funny this guy is. It's so good to see that His unique delivery of the jokes and bravery is still the same. He didn't disappoint.",False
16,7,Bill Burr is at it again in a lovely place.,deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bill Burr is a stand-up comedian that I always liked to watch performing on stage. This time he performs at Red Rocks, a lovely place for a show. It was a good show, funny like always, but it wasn't his best show. Bill Burr is a born raconteur with a good, a bit sarcastic, sense of humour. I didn't really agree about his mask policy but everybody is entitled to his opinion. To me the so called pandemic was just a farce, a bit more than six millions dead (well that's their numbers) in more than three years is just ridiculously low for a pandemic. When you know we get daily 250000 new humans we can't really talk about a devastating disease. Also his vision of our planet being overpopulated, which I totally agree with, is a bit rich coming from a man with two kids himself, so there he should just avoid that topic if I were him. That said the rest was what I expected from him, good moments, clever jokes, a pleasant stand-up comedy evening.",False
17,9,Bill Burr gets it,birdsonthings,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bill Burr is one of my top favorite comedians. He's up there with Richard Pryor, Dave Chappelle, George Carlin, Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, etc...You can just feel his anger, understandably. There's not one of his specials I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. He's bold, offensive, hilarious. And he really digs deep into tough topics, unapologetically. I think that's my favorite part of his comedy style. He just does not give a fk about offending people.",False
18,7,Bill Burr tapes a stand up special in place of therapy,jaredlemin,n/a,16/08/2025,"There was a time in my life where I thought Bill Burr was really funny. I'm not sure if his humor changed, if I changed, or if it has something to do with all the things we have learned about him over the years. Either way he now has this ""get off my lawn"" persona for me that just feels tired more often than it feels funny. I still think he is funny and the venue is beautiful so I can't go below a 6, but take the audience's laughter away and this could feel like an uncomfortable therapy session at times that I don't really want to be in. It doesn't help that it just feels like he is yelling at you for over an hour. As I'm finishing the review he did give me a few laughs at the end which makes me feel better leaving this special with an above average rating despite my changing feelings on Burr as a comedian. Okay the end was so good I brought the rating up to a 7 now. He really comes through in the end.",False
19,8,The truth has been spoken,ronaldmpofu,n/a,16/08/2025,"This wasn't even comedy but just facts . Funny as hell haha but too honest for cancel culture to handle . That right there is art , expressing of opinions that are supposed to be simple and true but in this world we live in , Bill Burr could be punished for his artistic expression of how he views the world . It's worth a watch.",False
20,6,Ol billy no booze,jrking-95177,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bit of comedy here from a member of the top 5 club.This one ranks somewhere in the middle of all his specials imo.Had a few chuckles here and there but was generally entertained to watch the whole special.You may enjoy this comedy special if you like the topics of covid, abortion or lesbians lol.",False
21,9,Nails it!,Top_Dawg_Critic,n/a,16/08/2025,Bill Burr at his best! Legit 100% nails every aspect of today's times! Going to be watching this over and over again! It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.,False
22,6,Ok but his best,Morpheus640,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGay guys are happy and lesbians are miserable ?? Really bill . That's so cliched and been done a million times before ... but after a low key start there was quite a few laughs in the middle for me .Streets ahead of that rubbish bill burr introduces effort and I would recommend if a die hard fan. Not sure it would bring new fans in. Impressive place to do stand up tho 👍 .. The crowd were ok apart from
The usual morons shouting out inane drivel that bill dealt with well 6/10.",True
23,4,Subpar for Burr,wilhelmdanielg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Huge bill Burr fan, but this special just picks at low-hanging fruit that's been done a million times. It's not offensive or thought-provoking, it's just kind of boring. A couple laughs here and there but nowhere near as good as his other specials.",False
24,9,"Proud of You Bill, thanks for another!",markawood-54581,n/a,16/08/2025,"Props to the wardrobe manager for making Bill look like Dr. Evil, you obviously know ""FASHION"" as Dr. Evil would say.Keep sober brother. Keep us laughing. You stay happy. Keep your family safe.God bless less from one to another from the other 5th (<=>).Love you man. Keep up the great work.",False
25,10,Bill is the Best,johnfishpollard-58874,n/a,16/08/2025,"I give Ol' Billy Paprika Pube's special 9 Gringo Papi's, rounded up to a 10. I love how Bill makes fun of a group on one side of a debate, alienating that group and making the other side happy, then immediately comes back with the other viewpoint flipping the script. He also subtly makes fun of the group he's currently supporting in each of his rants keeping everyone off balance. He is a master of his craft and hilarious at the same time.",False

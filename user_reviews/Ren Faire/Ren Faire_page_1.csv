1,8,"If I had been a festival goer, it'd never go again",notoriousvic-44206,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe way George treated Jeffery, he is a disgusting old man. You can see it a mile away, George is a power hungry lunatic. I hate watching a man lose his whole life because the man ""Pissed you off"", it is a disgusting.Anyone who has ever been fired, felt for Jeffery while this old lunatic lives in a gaudy castle, listening to Enya & trying to marry a woman on a dating app. I hope nothing good happens to the old lunatic.Well done to the filmmakers, you brought emotion to this. I cannot listen to this old lunatic talk ever again. The man demanded loyalty & then crapped all over the old man's life. George ðŸ–•",True
2,7,The World We Live in,jarrodcorne,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was absolutely amazing. While it centers around a Renaissance fair, it's actually a deeper exploration of how businesses, corporations, and the world are currently being run. If you haven't seen this series, I highly encourage you to watch it. Then take a hard look at the outdated, expired individuals running the world today and compare the two.This documentary is a wake-up call. As someone who personally knows an individual like George Coulam, I can tell you Lance Oppenheim framed him perfectly. From an outsider's perspective, George's legacy seems structurally sound, and he could even be seen as a hero. But all it takes is one dinner with him at Olive Garden to realize he's the villain, and his legacy will crumble like a house of cards.",False
3,10,A Surprisingly Deep Dive (and Why the 10-Star Rating is Justified),begelmanmark,n/a,16/08/2025,"Look, I get it. ""Ren Faire"" on HBO might not be what everyone expected. If you were looking for a lighthearted romp through a historical reenactment festival, you might be surprised by the show's focus on the drama behind the scenes. But here's the thing: that's exactly why this series deserves a resounding 10 stars.Ren Faire isn't afraid to delve into the fascinating - and often hilarious - world of power struggles, ambition, and the sheer audacity of running a massive themed event. Director Lance Oppenheim crafts a story that's addictive and thought-provoking. It's like ""Succession"" meets ""Game of Thrones,"" but set against the backdrop of turkey legs and jugglers.Here's the thing I've noticed: some reviews seem to be coming from folks expecting a fluffy documentary about their local Ren Faire. But Ren Faire is about the Texas Renaissance Festival, a massive, multi-million dollar operation. It's a unique beast, and Oppenheim captures its essence perfectly.Yes, the series is funny. You'll be chuckling at the outrageous personalities and the sheer absurdity of some situations. But there's also a surprising amount of heart here. You see the dedication of the people who pour their lives into this event, the camaraderie between performers, and the genuine passion that fuels the whole thing.So, if you're looking for something different, something that will surprise you and keep you hooked, then Ren Faire is absolutely worth your time. Don't be swayed by negativity based on misconceptions. This is a well-made, entertaining, and surprisingly insightful documentary that deserves its place among the best. Trust me, this one's a ten.",False
4,n/a,Stylized yet Feels Off,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Todays documentaries always seem to have this fancy presentation about them and frankly artificial feel.They all require a film filter, heavy editing and overly dramatic music.Although this one is well shot and looks great, I can't help but feel misled by the whole thing.The story is presented like a movie with deliberate scenes that show each of the people as if it were some drama. And it begs the question, why wasn't this simply filmed as such?I say this because it seems fake overall, as if the story doesn't have the weight it's presented throughout the three episodes.It boards on being simply a reality tv show with a stronger budget.I wish we saw more of the fair itself too! The inner workings, the shows, fellow actors and vendors.Their thoughts on the whole matter and their jobs. But instead it was about management and their ""king.""
Personally I felt that would've been a better choice for a theme here.The fair seems to be more of a background than anything else. For three hour long episodes, it felt like a bait and switch.George is the center of all this and boy is he probably one of the worst bosses you could have. Abusive, narcissistic, sexist and most of all, deranged! The way he talks to people and then claim he's some martyr. He really is alone in all of this.Clearly past his prime, he seeks out a successor in his three top employees. It turns into a wannabe Succession, minus the razor sharp dialogue and acting.A few players enter the game, only one will win. You can probably guess who it will be with the first outing and again I wonder why this was three episodes instead of two. I think George just liked the power play and using others for his own amusement. Sad individual.It certainly kept me intrigued and the pace was steady. Yet it felt extra all around, filler that could've been more concentrated.Again, the moments of almost fourth wall breaking where we see a dream like scenario of some of these people imagining things or hearing voices. It should've been a film. Just take the story that happened and turn it into a movie. Clearly these takes were set up and the people in on it. It was hard to take seriously.I really thought this was a mockumentary, because of how absurd things were getting by the end.Things end with a whimper and you're not surprised at the outcome for any of these folks here.The whole thing is a fluff piece and I felt that this was a waste of time. Documentaries used to have a more traditional way of being shown
More classy back in the day. Now it's made for the mainstream and spoon feeds you everythingI dare say this is a faux film about a true story. That's the best way I can describe it. Fascinating, yet frustrating.You may like it more than I, but I don't recommend.5 for the presentation and music. 2 for everything else.",False
5,10,Great Docu-Drama,winslow-39442,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this docu-drama is specific to this particular renaissance fair, I found Ren Faire to be fascinating, interesting, and thought provoking.As for the first episode, the cinematography is incredible, and the director's ability to film the festival, its audience, its family of workers, and then the main storyline of succession with George, Jeff, and Louie is balanced and well-done. George and this Ren Faire are intertwined as it is George who created this particular fair and continues to rule.After watching the first episode, I plan on going to one of these fairs because it is a world that seems, at least in this film, to be so inviting to everyone.",False
6,3,Poorly made (technically) and over produced (story wise),orcinussr,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's crapola! Basically the filmmakers are attempting to draw the viewer into the lives of these characters and to do so they take someone like Jeff, for instance, and they direct him - and if you don't see the issue with that then I can't help you - but imo, or even by definition, when you present a subject in a documentary, and you begin to say 'ok Jeff, recreate how you would leer up at Lou and his family - really glare at them with hate in your eyes' and you see a scene where the 'documentarians' capture a candid shot of Louis family entering a meeting with George, whist Jeff looks on, and you're then utilizing several cameras to show this, but have directed and produced several of the reaction shots - well then EVERYTHING else is now in question as to its authenticity - as to whether or not the 'documentarians' (in quotes for a reason) have suggested that they have this thread where someone wants to buy the fair whilst others lobby to retain it - perhaps that was done solely for the sake of 'good tv' because after all, everyone involved in the Fair would surely benefit from a successful documentary - it's free advertising (and half of them are already performers) - - you see what I mean? Also, the whispering device as well as other audio choices, again, in my opinion, are very poor choices - but you know, that's subjective - anyway, judge for yourselves of course but bear in mind what I've suggested please.AND POINT OF ORDER: IT'S DUBBED AS THE ORIGINAL RENFAIRE, BUT HE ADMITTEDLY STOLE THE IDEA FROM A FAIR HE ATTENDED IN SAN FRANCISCO IN THE 70s -Update: it's so transparent how outlined the storyline is - one character is fired before the 3 month off season (but coincidentally undergoes 'weight-loss surgery') then is rehired in the spring - ask yourself where did the audio come from - that entire plot line was engineered and manufactured - ie PRODUCEDAnd I haven't even touched upon the problematic issue of this being a glorified dating profile for some lecherous old coot who is looking to be a sugar daddy - no hyperbole - he wants to be 'a sugar daddy' to a natural breasted millennial (or younger) - it's offensive to me that he's essentially utilizing this platform in hopes of amplifying his profile - bleh!",False
7,9,3rd Tier Rennie Input,gaffneyshaven,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel deranged. I feel like we've just seen those segments of the Bible where it's just one person's story that wasn't witnessed by anyone else, suddenly before our eyes. And now we know how they kept all the tea underwraps: long live the king.Louie and Darla maintained a composure far above and beyond what was known among the TRFamily. Fairetriarchs who garnered natural respect and love from those around them we're doing so much more than we ever knew. And now we know. Now everyone knows. And as someone in our FB group has already said: This year ain't gonna be cheap. George knows what this will do for the Faire.Lift up thy pocketbooks, I guess.",False
8,1,What's the point?,stsorrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Starting off this documentary, we meet this eccentric old man and his quest to find a companion and to retire by selling the Texas Renaissance Festival. Over three hours later, we're still in the same boat... George still owns the festival and is looking for a gullible companion. So what was the point? If the point was to show the world what a power hungry and sex crazed POS George is, then I guess it succeeded.Don't expect to see any focus on the Ren Faire itself...this is nothing more than a behind the scenes look at this disgusting old man, his overly sensitive right hand man, an energy drink guzzling King wannabe, and a conniving vendor coordinator.Why anyone would want to work for this old man is beyond me, unless they believe that he's going to hand the reigns of power over to them eventually, making them as rich as he has become in his 80 something years.There is not a plot nor purpose to this documentary. I've wasted 3+ hours of my life watching this and I advise you to skip it.",False
9,n/a,the Pathos of Living the Dream,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure if the film makers are trying to paint a sympathetic portrait of a delusional megalomaniacal d-bag manchild or catering to whatever purse strings that funded it, but it's nothing more than a student film filled with fluffery and proselytizing by those seeking to gain some huge benefit by their dishonesty. I knew George for nigh on ten years and he's a creep, and I guess that's apparent, but nowhere is the mention of his child brides.More importantly, nowhere is the mention of Toon Town, where a number of participants live, some of them year round. I realize this is a focus on the owner, but his multi-million dollar business would be nothing without all the little people who make it work. But they're just peasants, so who cares? Either they weren't asked or wisely declined to be part of this boring, pointless stroking of egos debacle.And from the film's eventuality, one has to wonder if the entire thing wasn't a scam to push publicity and/or manipulate the players. There's an ironic phrase amongst people who work there who have realistic expectations about what the faires are like concerning the people who pathetically think of it as real life: living the dream. This film has the same pathos.",False
10,10,Sucession with Millions,henrylamb-98536,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really enjoyed this show. The start with its atmospheric elements to feel as if I'm being pulled into the world of this characters. King George was amazing and seeing him on screen was when the show hit its peak. The characters vying fruietless for the throne George will never give up was tragic. I think most of all was the arc that Jeff went through was amazing from naive General Manager to a more hardended and changed man in the last episode.Watch until the series completes with all the story arcs completed. In a sense like Succession, the King will never give up the power. That kind of power can't be purchased for any price.",True
11,10,A Fascinating Look into the Ren Faire Life,gesherman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ren Faire is a must watch for anyone who enjoys documentaries. Lance Oppenheim masterfully captures the chaos and vibrancy of the fair itself. From jousting knights to turkey leg vendors, the documentary brings the Renaissance Festival experience to life. But it's the human drama that truly captivates. We see the passion of the performers, the dedication of the staff, and the yearning for escape that drives many of the festival's patrons.Ren Faire is more than just a documentary about a Renaissance fair. It's a meditation on aging, legacy, and the power of creating a world of make-believe. I look forward to watching the rest of the series and you should too.",False
12,5,Actual ren faire patrons might wonder,Laurella3,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was worried this was going to be a ""mockumentary"" of Renaissance faires but it wasn't that, but maybe a bit so for some of the characters. That being said from the perspective of a woman who has been a long time patron of Renaissance Faires, this was so cringey but yet I watched the entire thing.. idk why honestly, I was hoping to feel some of the magic âœ¨ that I feel when I attend a renaissance festival- I think because the documentary was well done, I didn't feel like it was the waste of time that it probably was.I was looking forward to seeing that juxtaposition of real life versus Ren Faire fantasy (cue the Red Bull can pouring into the chalice), but that aspect really fell flat for me. It was mostly the story of the creepy old senile narcissist ""king,"" and who will take over next. I could not get over how horrible he was and felt terrible for everyone who had to work for him. Overall 5/10 a somewhat waste of time for me but gained an interesting perspective!",False
13,9,Well made,erickizaki,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe cinematography and music were well done, but very stylized. Some of it was a bit heavy handed and surreal so I can understand why some who would be expecting a documentary would be disappointed in something with Ari Aster Midsommar vibes. The insertion of imaginary things talking to characters is more like a movie than a documentary. It was definitely entertaining though.One has to feel sorry for Jeff and how the rest fo the employees were treated by George. The main character, George, is pretty despicable. He is a poster boy for unaccountable octogenarians who
cling to power well beyond their prime and horde all the wealth and opportunity for themselves. This is a problem in general for the country with these out of touch megalomaniacs.As someone who has gone to this Renfest in the past the backdrop and area was familiar. It will be interesting to see if the 2024 season will continue to be successful without George's previous general managers who did all the work.",True
14,1,Grossest boomer grandpa ever.,oengustheblack-49-200263,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who used to frequent ren faires, and worked at one for several years, I was hopeful this would cast ren faires in a good light. Sadly it begins by showcasing a sad, borderline crazy and sexually obsessed octogenarian trying to sell his business while simultaneously finding a romantic partner to have sex with who's 30-45 years old? The behind the back deal making by his underlings vying for on]wnershio of the Faire is almost as sad. I don't care how good this Faire is, I would never spend my money going to it. It is everything loathsome about America.Cinematically it reeks of a high-school production from the 90's with poorly filmed scenes, poor quality sound, and no real sense of where it's going or what story it's trying to tell.",True
15,10,I was glued to the screen,steve-54363-27951,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing and real joyful, and heartbreaking at times. I dont want to give spoilers, but go watch it. I set it to record but realized that I had reached the end. I binged watched it and will probably watch again. I wish there were more episodes. It is really good. There are twists and turns and heros and villians. Almost like the Ren Faire itself. The Texas Ren Faire is like no place else and it had been a big part of my life growing up. As a family we went every year. In high school I got to work a booth which was very cool. As an adult my husband and I had our wedding there. To see the inside workings and drama was very eye opening. The drama is still unfolding and I hope it has a happy ending.",False
16,5,Unpleasant docuseries about unlikeable people.,vandalz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ren Fairs have never had an appeal to me, so I'm probably not the audience for this mini series. Still, I like offbeat documentaries, so I gave it a shot. The premise is a power struggle for control of the biggest Renaissance Festival in the US, as the long-time owner looks to cash out, retire, and chase far younger women. So, a comedy, you may think. But no, although there are some (probably unintended) funny moments, it basically comes off as sad. If the retiring owner is really worth over 100M (as he claims on a dating site profile), why does he meet his prospective partners at Olive Garden? Other than the old guys search for a young woman with natural breasts, the funniest scene was when one of the people vying to take over the Ren Faire claims, with a straight face, that he washed out of Air Force pilot training because he flew aerobatics in an AF airplane that wasn't certified for aerobatics. Suuuuuuuuuure.Like I said, I'm probably not the intended audience, but at the end of the series, there literally was nobody from the series that I'd want to sit through dinner with.",False
17,2,Another reality show masquerading as a dcoumentary,lu_lou_belle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Creepy old guy just wants to sell his business find the love of his life at 85, and die when he has determined to go. Who will succeed, who will make it happen? Who wants to climb Little Finger's ladder all the way to the top of this nerd libertarian goldmine? It's just as dull as I hoped it wouldn't be, having known some fun independent characters who participate in these shows and have the courage to step out of big corporatism. This just isn't it. Creators of this are trying to make this Tiger King. Another dud for Max.Blah blah blah balh ball balk ballast blam balm bilk billing bushleague character count.",False
18,1,Creepy Gramdpa filmed on old Nokia phone.,angtardy,n/a,16/08/2025,"The grainy imagery and purposeful glitches just made this unbearable to watch early on.The lead says it's his goal is that he gets f'ed to death quite literally as he signs up for online dating.This is such a disgrace to Renaissance fairs that are a source of joy for so many. This is NOT what we would expect to see with a show titled Ren Faire.In a show titled Ren Faire, this guy should not be the focus as his story is no longer about the faire and somehow weirdly the videographers take crotch shots of this old man as he says this is what his life is about now.Texas Ren Faire is a multimillion dollar business. Honestly that side of things would be very interesting. This is not.",False
19,2,Pointless....,NullUnit,n/a,16/08/2025,"Starts and ends in the same place.... there's no revelation, no uncovered story, no mystery to solve, no interesting behind the scenes story.. there's no ""there"" there. Sure the producers/director, etc try and push some sort of drama with the soundtrack and editing... but there really is NONE.Complete and utter waste of time, unless you happen to be related to someone involved in the Faire or this doc. As a viewer.. it's utterly pointless.It is interesting that the poster art makes George look like a light-skinned black man.. he's not.. he's a pale, ghost-like, white man. In fact, I don't think there's a single black person anywhere in this three episode documentary.Absurd, aimless, fruitless, futile, impotent, inconsequential, ineffective, ineffectual, insignificant, irrelevant, meaningless, powerless, silly, stupid, trivial,
unnecessary, unproductive, useless, worthless, around in circles, going nowhere, in vicious circle, inane, nongermane, nonsensical, not pertinent, purportless..... is that your natural story line??? I touch plastic and it makes me sick.",False
20,3,Another hbo stretched beyond its point docuseries,ronhansen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this thinking it could be an interesting and cool story. How these fairs work and the behind the scenes dynamics. Unfortunately its another series hbo max stretched into 6 episodes when it could be told in 2. Lots of long drawn out boring scenes of nothing. We have an old king, looking for his old (or not so old) queen to go to the grave with. He owns the fair. We have two men competing to take over when the old king finally goes. One rich kid who takes his families money and tosses it down the drain but generally looks to work decently hard. The other an actor who wonders around the park apparently in charge of most of it. Couldn't really see much of what he is doing in the first episode as it was mostly just him and his wife nitpicking. I went in with high hopes, found myself looking at my kitchen thinking i need to unload my dishwasher after about 20 minutes. Ill watch the next episode to see if it gets better but so far i give it a 3 just for informing me this fair exists.",False

1,7,Sad But True,theognis-80821,n/a,16/08/2025,"Using cell phones, surveillance cameras, still photos and live action coverage, this excellent documentary recounts the horrifying 7.8 earthquake that killed about 60,000 people and produced over $150 billion in damage in Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023. Director Waad Al-Kateab does a fine job in interviewing both survivors and commenters for this Oscar-nominated film. Faulty construction receives much blame and slow government response is also criticized. One small girl survived after 150 hours under rubble. The focus is on the loss of life and family member's grief and survivor's guilt. ""There, but for the grace of God, go I.""",False

As individuals, we can control our behavior choices: how we interact with the world, how we treat strangers and our loved ones including family and friends. Mother Nature is completely out of our control. Death Without Mercy is a positive testament to the resilience and determination of individual people and communities responding to and attempting to overcome the tragic and emotional hardships of natural disaster. In contrast, it woefully reveals the lack of intervention by governments and humanitarian aid. Compassion and disaster relief are critical, no matter who and where you are.",False

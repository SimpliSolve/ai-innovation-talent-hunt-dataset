1,10,Chris Distafano's No Hitter aka 'Special Needs',genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe I can't even be remotely impartial because I love everything about Distefano's comedy: his stories, his energy. And in this special, he even does a bit of crowd work. But what you really watch him for is the storytelling and he crushes it as always. And maybe even outdoes previous stories of his Dad coming to his high school with a great story about being taken to Yankee Stadium.But don't waste your time reading my inane drivel. Just dial this special up and enjoy it. Besides, what better show is there to be watching right now? Another Marvel movie? Just watch this special and enjoy it.",False
2,2,Way Different From Past Shows in a Gross and Cringy Way,imdbfan-79490,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've been a fan for so long and I couldn't wait for this special. However, discussing masterb*ting while watching Disney Princesses was very cringe. Discussing putting a gun in his mouth, making fun of kids on the spectrum, and then of course going overboard with putting down Latino culture simply because his wife and kids are such. I can take and appreciate jokes that poke fun of a million things but these weren't funny, just gross and mean spirited with nothing humorous about them. Disappointed. Miss his earlier work. There were a few laughs and I loved his energy and enthusiasm but the actual content was so far removed from the hilarious and not over the top gross or cringe material of the past.",True
3,10,Chris Distefano's No Hitter aka 'Special Needs',genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe I can't be impartial because I absolutely love this guy's comedy, his personality and his energy. His storytelling is absolutely top notch and in this special he even does a little bit of crowd work which is hilarious but, what we really want to hear are more stories of his childhood and Father and he does NOT disappoint. The closing story about his Dad taling him to Yankee Stadium might even top the stories he has told about having his father show up at his school. But don't waste your time reading this drivel - just go watch the special I mean, do you have something better to watch? Like one of the 26 different Marvel movies that are out there right now?",False
4,1,What a jerk,marykshaw-20799,n/a,16/08/2025,"He says ""people without kids have no problems."" So people with infertility issues because of cancer, have no problems. What an inconsiderate jerk. There's funny and then there's cruel. What a close-minded, mean-spirited, violently disgusting human. Imagine if his daughter (heaven forbid) couldn't have kids because her uterus was removed due to cancer. He speaks often of how his daughters, or empanadas as he refers to them, and kids in general, are the only purpose in life. Imagine if his girls could t have kids, would he devalue them in such a callous and unconscionable way? Vile. What a cruel and short sided ""man."" He is funny. But this isn't.",False

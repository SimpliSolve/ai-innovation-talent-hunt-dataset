1,10,Insightful and Eye opening Documentary,sawhawk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just cannot believe with everything happening last year i.e. The pandemic, rioting, and presidential races, this war happened to such a peaceful group of people, and the whole world was silent about this war. I would go a step further and say the surface analysis would yield to viewers, ""oh, its just a war of lands"", but for a deep thinker viewer they would see that this was a campaign to ethnically cleanse the ethnic Christian Armenian population of Artsakh. This documentary deserves world renowned recognition, and I would like to thank Emile and Asko for bring these events of last year to light. Thank you for all your hard work and may Azerbaijan face their just punishment for their crimes.",False

3,10,Silence us but you will not break us,gayanevoskanyan,n/a,16/08/2025,"The plot of this documentary is to show and tell a story of a people who are resilience, who demonstrate strength, the show bravery despite of powerful enemies. This small insignificant nation who faced a very disproportionate and purposely orchestrated war by Azerbaijan did not stop fighting even though the whole purpose of this war was to ethnically cleanse Artsakh of its indigenous Armenians.Turkey and Azerbaijan may have silenced the world who had their hands over their mouths, ears and eyes as if the whole humanity went blind, deaf and mute but this war never broke us. Armenians find strength in their love for each other and country. This documentary presents just that. True masterpiece.Thank you.",False
4,10,Amazing documentary,Dr-Petrosyan,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to see a true side of war ""45 Days"" is the perfect documentary. Emotional, raw, heartbreaking film showing what a small Christian nation has been and still going through to survive.",False

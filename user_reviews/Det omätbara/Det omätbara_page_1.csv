1,10,Incredible low key celebration of importance,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis incredible documentary, by one of the best in Swedish documentary making, is definitely a very worthwhile and important piece, celebrating some of the most important players in our society - different care takers.Like few other films, this one delves deep into the truths and intimacy of it all, and showcases how hard and poignant it can be. Very excellently cut, very emotional, but also showcasing the connections between them all, very humour and the bright sides. Very beautifully written and paced indeed.The cinematography, cutting and editing is stellar, very beautifully and low key put together indeed.Overall, definitely a piece of stellar filmmaking, highly recommended, a very important and poignant watch!",True

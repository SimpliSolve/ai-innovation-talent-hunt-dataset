1,7,Sweet and simple documentary,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.While it's narrative isn't groundbreaking nor new, still the filmmakers behind Jesus Camp (which is one of the most disturbing documentaries ever), still manages to capture the sweet and simple life of students living in the arctic world of Norway at the traditional folk schools.Captured using gorgeously shot camerawork and interesting discussions, traditional folk high schools aren't discussed often and the documentary offers a good insight to Scandinavian folk schools with what they are like and how important they are for members in the North. Seeking to explore the challenges the students face and bringing a deeper connection to natural and the surroundings of their environment. I really appreciated many of the discussions and topics explored as I was really interested with the students journeys and what they are doing. Especially when they are with the dogs. I could watch them bond with dogs all day.Alongside with a good tone, it's structure is simple. Although it's simple structure does make the documentary at times drag as certain aspects aren't very new and the filmmakers didn't really have much creative outlets to take different directions. But otherwise, I appreciate this one a lot.If you love dogs, you are in for a treat.",False
2,10,Beautiful and Touching,dashtag1234,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stunning documentary that has a perfect balance between being emotional, heartwarming, and funny. Characters really resonate with you and you find yourself dying to go to the school throughout the movie. Very well edited and well paced, with incredible camera work that makes you fall in love with Norway.",False

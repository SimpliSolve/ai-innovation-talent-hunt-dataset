1,9,Great show beautiful design,jsetherickson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great addition to your watching if you like shows like Fixer Upper, Fixer to Fab or Home Town. The location is beautiful the finished houses are amazing and the interior design is stunning. The interior design is minimal, clean and modern but not boring or clinical feeling.It's also crazy how in Hawaii a dumpster fire of a house can still sell for a million or more. Where on the mainland that house would sell for 30k.The hosts are great as well. It's fun to watch them come up with ideas and interact throughout the project. Love the family aspect as well. What else can I say but just give me more!!!",False
2,8,I like this show,celticsfan-72909,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here's the thing, Hawaii can be a beautiful place, but a lot of it is old and run down, and costs a fortune to live there!You're not living in a nice home and driving nice vehicles unless you have a few million, that's fact!My wife's family is from there, and a lot still live on Oahu. Most of them live in Condos or town homes because they can't afford to buy a house. Her aunt and uncle have a home in St Louis heights. I've been there, I've seen it. The home is a dump like all the homes on this show. You're paying for the land, and the view, even on this show.This family spends over half a million to buy a run down piece of garbage, then has to pump in two hundred thousand, or more, to rebuild and renovate the home. Of course it's gonna sell for over a million, that's the way it works. If they don't sell it for that much, they'd be out of business.To the reviewer saying they're false advertising, I call bs. If a local doesn't have that kind of money, too bad, someone else does, and it's a business, not a charity. They have to take the highest offer.Anyway, I like the couple, and their design choices.Update 2/18/25 season 2 premiere. I'm glad to see a second season. We have family in pearl city, so episode 1 of season2 was interesting. Tristyn annd Kamohai are so cool I wanna be friends with them lol! Unfortunately we live in Las Vegas, and don't have the kind of coin to be a player there, but we can dream right?!",False
3,7,Money,jaabs,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like this show but I want to know what type of jobs do Hawaiian people have to afford these homes? They say many times they do the renovations for the local. And why does anyone pay almost a million dollars for these dumps.Most of the renovation designs are alright. I don't understand why anyone would put in a big beautiful kitchen island then ruin it with putting in a sink or stove top.The other design I'm not crazy about is wet bathrooms. Who wants to take a shower and get water all over the soaker tub, then have to clean the whole area? I guess with what you pay for the houses you hire a housekeeper.",False
4,10,Entertaining,azamora-11516,n/a,16/08/2025,My wife and I never heard of Renovation Aloha until yesterday (03-04-2024) and we absolutely love it. We love that they are family oriented. Renovation Aloha does not give you that fake or scripted feel like other renovation shows do but an authentic one which is a breath of fresh air.Renovation Aloha fix some of the worst house's in Hawaii and they turn them into beautiful modern family homes. What we enjoy about the show so far is that Renovation Aloha does not over exaggerate with extravagant and unnecessary accessories to home which makes them looks awkward. Renovation Aloha is our new favorite show.,False
5,10,Breath of fresh air in hgtv,grlym1,n/a,16/08/2025,"As background,....ice always loved hgtv type entertainment but in the past decade, tv personalities and personal life seems to be more important in the show than actually doing the diy. And showing how it's done is almost entirely absent.This show feels like a good compromise between old and new hgtv styles. I like the aura that the two main people have. The Hawaiian aspect of the show ads a flare that is not often seen on tv...which adds to the shows attraction. What really elevates the show to me is that the designs of the flips are actually something I would want to live in. Rather than most shows flamboyant takes if design that barely stay relevant the entire season they are aired in. I Ben hard situations in this show are positive yet real.The only cons I see are the awkward extended conversation scenes. But those could also be apart of why I like the show. It feels more real. Which only leaves the only real bad part which is small...is the horrific squeal chime pulled from the 1990's to emphasize something bad is happening.",False
6,6,Alohhhhhha!,jacegalloway,n/a,16/08/2025,"I lived on the gorgeous island of Oahu a gazillion years ago while my dad taught at the University. We moved from St. Louis to paradise and were lucky enough to live in a house in Monoa Valley. Everything was extremely expensive and at that time, there was no internet so we relied on the US Postal Service or long-distance phone calls. I remember my mom feeling very seculded there.It was a wonderful experience and I cherish those memories. Anytime I see a tv show or movie that is filmed in Hawaii, I try to watch so was very excited about this new home show. Hoping I'll see some familiar sights!",False
7,5,"Like all the others in HGTV, but the locations are more exotic.",carolarugg,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe scenery is lovely and the couple and their crew do a beautiful job. However, the woman needs to hush up, take a breath, let her husband and others speak! Dear Lord, she cuts people off when they're talking because she apparently knows more than anyone on the island. I wanted to scream at the tv, ""Shut up, shut up!!!""
That heartfelt criticism aside, it's amazing what we in the states would consider tear downs and what they go for on the islands. The episode I saw belonged to a hoarder, had horrendous water damage as well as rat and mice infestation, and the walls were filled with thousands of bees. I couldn't believe that they paid 1.1 million but sold it furnished for only 2.5 million.",True
8,1,You guys should not say you're selling to locals when you not,kaleihinulani,n/a,16/08/2025,"Okay. Born and raised on the windward side of Oahu. Usually I'm all for my local people but this is false advertising at its best. Do not advertise yourselves as locals trying to help other locals when you are not!! I know all 3 houses you sold from watching the first 3 episodes , not 1 of those families have Hawaiian blood pumping through their veins!The Kapehe street house in kahaluu could have easily went to a local family but instead you guys buy um and then like resell um for over million dollars! The owners of the Kapehe house sold it to you cheap cause your last name, did you guys even do the same while reviewing offers for this hale? Next time local families should watch who they selling to.",False
9,2,The Wife Needs To Shut Up!,rysmdptxng,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show would be great if the wife wasn't talking and acting like she's the smartest most knowledgeable person in Hawaii. She needs to take a breath and stop cutting people off and not allowing the individuals viewing their newly renovated houses to discover for themselves the houses layout and design, which in my opinion thought their design styles were okay but nothing special. Then finally throughout each episode you got the husband and wife repeat pretty much everything the other just said, and end up sounding like two freaking parrots going back and forth. I was done watching the show by episode 3. I don't recommend this show!",False
10,2,Stop with the couples and the same old format!!,boondocks176,n/a,16/08/2025,"And now I see there's yet another remodel show (Down Hone Fab) coming. ENOUGH!!! It's all the same old thing. Toss in another perky couple with building and ""design"" skills, stage a house with perfect touches and nothing feels any different. I don't watch any of these shows anymore because I've seen it all before. Where are the gardening shows that put the G in HGTV?? What about some DIY shows like they once had (design on a Dime)? Give us something to get excited about, not just more of the same in a different state with a different husband and wife team. Or maybe renovations that don't cost $100,000. Nobody I know has that kind of money sitting around.",False
11,n/a,situation,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please have her stop saying the word situation. It is overused and she misses it every time. When yshe can't think of a word, she uses a situation. Have the lines for the show edited more carefully and leave out these diffuse totally wrong words.She always says she doesn't want her children growing up badly, and I contend that starts with knowing the English language. And not slaughtering it.",False

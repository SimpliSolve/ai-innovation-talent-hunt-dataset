1,9,Seattle Mariners fan here,jimbarnard-22093,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes. Baseball will break your heart. Red Sox fans are so special they have their own ""nation!"" I completely get why Nexflix chose Boston over the other 29 cities/fanchises. Still, I am kinda proud that my Mariners got some screen time in game action. I like Boston, they are passonate about their team to such an extreme that it's easy to capture some heckling and other bad behavior. On the other side of it you've got a great coach in Boston that really knows his players and is such a savy communicator in both languages radiating that he cares and understands. THAT'S real, and THAT skill with people is worth watching in this series. What a fish bowl these baseball players swim in! Bottom line: I liked the series and recommend it!",False
2,7,Expected Much More & Better Than This,SDK7,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a former minor league player from the Red Sox organization. I've been a diehard Boston Red Sox fan since I played Little League, and will express this much: I'm slightly disappointed in the series.I think there's so much missing than what I was looking & hoping for. And perhaps you too?The series basically spotlights the same 3 or 4 players most of the time and 3 other people from the organization (that I won't mention) along with lots of media personalities and writers throughout the entire series. It was nice tho to see some of the fans perspective, along with the lifelong Diehard Sox Fans randomly included. And also a moment with 3 of the players on the Worcester Sox.But after a while, the series is too repetitive. It's unfortunate more of the players on the team weren't involved and spotlighted - especially a future Hall of Famer. Not sure if that was the particular players or the Red Sox higher-ups decisions or not...or the producers, editors and directors.I do know this much...according to the Red Sox, no one knew what the finished product & project looked like and what was going to appear in the series until it aired.The series production team spent 8 months with the Red Sox organization - interviewing & filming 1000's of hours of actual footage, then edited it down to nearly 8 hours for 8 episodes. And If this is the best they can come up with, I'm disappointed.I did enjoy all the footage of Fenway, glimpses of the city of Boston...and the live action at games...and some of the ""behind the scenes.""But for me, they missed lots of the human emotion that goes on within a team from February to September/October, and so much more of the players perspectives. And I can't believe more players on the team weren't a bigger part of the docuseries.Don't get me wrong...I've been excited to watch the series and been waiting a year for this, when it was first announced. I watched all 8 episodes in 3 days when it first airedI just think & feel the entire series could've been much better for the reasons I expressed above. Especially parts of the final 8th episode and the ending.",False
3,10,"Not a Sox fan, but a fan of this show",joshdavidson04,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great show! I really enjoyed not only seeing the baseball games and behind the scenes operations parts, but also the personal side for some of these players. It really gives you the full scope of what professional baseball is all about. If you're looking for in-depth game coverage or behind the scenes for all 162 games in a season, you'll be disappointed, but don't let that dissuade you from watching it. This is very well made and is a really enjoyable watch. I just wish it had more than eight episodes because I binged it all in one weekend. I think there are many more stories that could be told with a show like this.",False
4,4,Extremely disappointing,JellyCuboid,n/a,16/08/2025,"You send a film crew to follow a 162 game season and end up with eight 45 minute episodes that mostly don't even show the games or even training? Instead they focus on human interest stories and broader stories in baseball... which you didn't need to follow the team around for. We've already gotten plenty of coverage of that stuff via other media, like the struggles of international players and family life for ballplayers. The great moments are when we get to watch and listen to the dugout and clubhouse, and the players on the field, following the storylines of games and series. Unfortunately that comprises only a fraction of the show. What a waste of footage.",False

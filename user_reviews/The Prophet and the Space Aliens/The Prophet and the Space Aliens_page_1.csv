1,7,Mostly respectful look into a different kind of religion,eelen-seth,n/a,16/08/2025,"What is the difference between a cult and a religion? And why do some of us believe a man was able to part the sea in half to create a path, but can't believe the story about a man who received a prophecy from extraterrestrials? After receiving a mysterious invitation from the Raelians to accept a special recognition in the arts, filmmaker Yoav Shamir starts to ask these hard questions from an atheist-perspective and with his mentor, historian of religion Professor Daniel Boyarin, he interviews ""the messiah"" Rael and some of his followers, from Okinawa to France.When Claude Vorilhon first encounters a UFO in 1973, these aliens gave him the task of spreading an important message. Not much later he changed his name to Raël and established a science based religion, where love is central. Communities all over Asia, Europe and North America start to grow, and the Raelians' ""pleasure hospital"" in Burkina Faso was made to restore the damage inflicted by mutilation. Raël's left hand and bishop, Dr. Briggite Boisselier, explains how their religion believes humans are created from the DNA of aliens.Director Yoav narrates part of the film, which never becomes too distracting, since he mostly puts devoted believers in front of the camera, whose stories are quite humorous (and heartfelt) at times. When we visit Elohika, a Raelian village in the area of Burkina Faso, the villagers explain how coloured ribbons show their true sexual identity. Clearly inspired by the hanky code (a traditional form of signalling others what your sexual preferences and interests are in the way of color coding, mostly used by gay men in the '60s and '70s), we meet several African men and women living in harmony, sexually liberated and seemingly happy. Some have escaped the huge Islamic-community they felt oppressed in. Don't be fooled, this is not a sex cult. Raelians are all about freedom and love. Several people make this clear throughout the film, although the only people we constantly see naked on stage and fully throwing themselves at Maitreya (another name for this prophet) are women.The constant happiness all around him, starts to annoy Yoav and this makes him dig deeper into Claude's past, to reveal some details, although nothing's really shocking. This is when 'The Prophet and the Space Aliens' shows signs of wanting to uncover the truth behind a scam, but we never come to a satisfying conclusion. Nonetheless, the film leaves it up to the viewer what to believe and what not to, to then giving a final on-the-nose atheistic statement about religion being based on made up stories to comfort people in need of something to believe in.The Prophet and the Space Aliens is a mostly respectful look into a new religion most of us have never heard of, shedding light on many faith-based questions we actually don't know the answers to. They flirt with debunking a growing society based on the loyalty for one man, but never reach that level of sensationalism.(Screened as part of Doc Edge Festival)",False
2,8,An honest and balanced look at a new religious movement (NRM) in the making.,Photos3-D,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWho hasn't dream of seeing a documentary about Moses, Jesus or even Joseph Smith when they were alive.This documentary is a rare opportunity to have a look at a new religious movement (NRM) in the making. Students of religious studies will have a priceless document to study a NRM still alive and growing. We follow a typical day in the life of this modern day 'prophet' and leader of the world's biggest UFO religion.A good occasion to have one of the world's leading historians of religion, Prof. Daniel Boyarin, as his mentor and ask pertinent questions like : what is the difference between a religion and a cult ? How do religions start ? Is it the same today as in the past ?We have a look at the childhood of Rael and what he did before becoming a 'prophet' after is alleged 'Contact' with an extraterrestrial in December 1973.The 'Voyage to the planet of the Eternals' is well represented by a nice cartoon drawn by artist : Jörg Vogeltanz.The positive side of the movie is certainly the part about the Pleasure Hospital in Burkina Faso (Africa) where they offers clitoral restorative surgery to victims of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) absolutely free.The cinematographer was balanced in his treatment by allowing ex-followers or sceptics to have their word to say.The viewer is left with a question : 'What if it is true ?'I highly recommend this documentary to believers and non-believers alike. You will at least have an entertaining moment by discovering this 'other paradigm' of our reality.",True
3,6,Shows how people Can Be taken In By Con Artists!,darrenjamesfalcus,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am surprised that ""Rael"" Claude Vorilhon let this documentary movie see the light of day.This does not paint Mr Vorilhon in a very good light and someone who is a joke to most but laughing all the way to the bank by those stupid enough to put their trust in him.After watching this I came away feeling vindicated that this man is nothing more than the wannabe con man a lot of people take him to be!For someone claiming to be an alien contactee his story is very vague despite meeting them every day for a week in 1973 to get their message out to humanity.In all that time he couldn't trouble Elohim for one bit of physical evidence to take back to humanity to support his claims.You only have to look at Vorilhon's life story of failed pop star to intrepid racing car reporter and magazine owner, which was nothing but a rag by all accounts, to then take the ultimate leap in his quest for stardom by reinventing himself as a cult leader.Mr Vorilhon has done very well out of his venture being able to travel the world, indulge in his passion for racing cars, meet and have a bevy of young women fall at his feet like groupies, you have to hand it to him in that sense lolWithin his con artistry there is some good ideas about how humanity should live going forward, although these ideas were apparently stolen from the author Jean Sendy!There was also a programme in Africa to help the victims of female circumcision, whether most of that was for the camera, I guess we'll never know.All in all, I find this movement very suspect in its motives although they are not dangerous in my opinion with his deluded followers quite happy to indulge Claude's every whim.I just find it disturbing that in the 21st century people are ready to fall for the claims of a man who comes across as a very kitsch early 70's hippie with a Buck Rodgers style story and make it fly for a few idiots!",True
4,9,A deep conversation of the power and danger of religion,twogiantsstudio,n/a,16/08/2025,"Discusses the freedom, excess, and manipulation of religion but in a way that breaks down its intentions. Rael is a snake oil salesmen with his stories of visiting alien planets and using free love as a tool for recruitment and lustful pleasures. Yet the people that follow him have greatly improved their lives. This cult could turn into Waco or Jonestown and I hope it won't come to it. It's fascinating to watch this vestigial tail of the 60's New Wave movement branching out in the modern age. It's a cautionary documentary that doesn't tell you not to drink the Koolaid but to carefully observe and judge religious leaders on their true intentions. Great editing and superb locations with nothing held back or censored on the cult members",False

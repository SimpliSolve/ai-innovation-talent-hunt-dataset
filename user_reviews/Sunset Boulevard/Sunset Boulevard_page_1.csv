1,9,Welcome to the Hotel California on Sunset Blvd.,stjohn1253,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSunset Blvd. had to have influenced the Eagles classic hit, Hotel California. Parallels exist throughout, including the enchantment.Consider:1) A man compelled to stop for the night, as did Joe Gillis, whose face showed his puzzlement and hesitation upon viewing Norma Desmond's estate on Sunset Blvd: ""This could be Heaven, or this could be Hell.""2) ""Then she lit up a candle..."" Norma lit many.3) ""Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,"" as was Norma's, and, ""she got the Mercedes-Benz."" Only in Norma's case, the Isotta-Fraschini.4) ""She's got lots of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends."" Norma had gone through three husbands and lured Joe into an intimate friendship.5) ""How they danced in the courtyard..."" Joe and Norma danced in the great room.6) ""Some danced to remember"" (as did Norma); ""some danced to forget"" (as did Joe).7) ""So I called up the captain, 'Please bring me my wine.'"" Max Von Mayerling served as butler/wine captain.8) ""Pink champagne on ice."" Lots of champagne consumed in the film.9) ""We are all just prisoners here of our own device."" That's the theme of the movie! Every character is trapped in his and her own way.10) ""Last thing I remember, I was running for the door."" Joe did also to ""find the passage back to place I (he) was before.""11) Finally, ""You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave."" Precisely the fate of Joe.If this fine film didn't inspire other artists, I'd be very surprised. It adroitly captured the mood and seductiveness of Hollywood and California of the early '50s.",True
2,9,Another Billy Wilder masterpiece,FilmOtaku,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved, and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films.  It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life  when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady.  In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood.  Now, in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me  I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless.  There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film  the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven't seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.--Shelly",False
3,9,A film packed with unforgettable moments,Nazi_Fighter_David,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough at that time she hadn't appeared in a film for several years and wasn't to make one for several for several more, Gloria Swanson remained a presence in the Hollywood of the thirties, the only legendary silent star to sustain an image and continue to interest the film studios, which put her under contract and announced her to star in a series of projectsnone of which were realized While she wasn't to regain her former eminence until her celebrated comeback as Norma Desmond in Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard,"" a scathing satire on Hollywood and the self-delusions of its former heroes, she maintained her silent-screen image as the personification of glamor, and as such wasn't the initial choice for the role of the faded silent starLike many small people who achieve greatness, Swanson was a powerhouse of energy, vitality, ambition and shrewdness, untroubled by insight humor to slow down her paceThe key to her success, the charm of her personality, the glamor of her career and the secret of her survival was superbly captured by herself in one of the best autobiographies, Swanson on Swanson",True
4,n/a,"""Madam is the greatest star of all.""",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sunset Blvd. could be looked at as a thesis on what fame does to certain people.  For Norma Desmond, fame created a fantasy world that forever trapped her.  Living alone in that giant house on Sunset, save for her servant Max, Norma whiles away the hours planning her magnificent return. Her fame kept alive by fan letters, and her hope of return kindled by Joe Gillis.  For Norma, there is no other life than standing before cameras and acting out lives of characters that are larger than life.  Of course, no one knows who Norma Desmond is.  Gloria Swanson gives a magnificent performance. She runs from melancholy, to unbridled joy, to complete mental breakdown. William Holden is the ultimate cynic.  He plays Norma like a fiddle but gets ensnared in her web of decaying glory.  In the end, Joe pays the price for enduring Norma's insanity.  As she descends that staircase in the final scene, you can see that she is completely lost in her own world.  A world where no one grows old, where she is forever young, and where she is the greatest star of them all.  After all, stars never age.",False
5,10,A true Hollywood horror story,preppy-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite ""Salome"" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for ""Born Yesterday"" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical. A 10 all the way.""I am big--it's the pictures that got small"". ""All right Mr. deMille--I'm ready for my closeup"".",False
6,10,A popular opinion is to believe Joe is a cad BUT...,AlsExGal,n/a,15/08/2025,"... how would you feel if the sexes of the characters were reversed? Suppose it was a woman writer trying to break into Hollywood, completely broke who, due to a flat tire, wanders into that big mansion. Pretty much financially cornered, she agrees to a job reworking some old film star's (let's say John Gilbert lived) script and comeback vehicle and slowly, what independence she has is taken away - her things are moved from her apartment where she is behind on her rent into a room over the garage at the mansion, her host sits by and lets her car be repossessed, she is never paid the promised cash for her work, a bad rainstorm moves her from her room over the garage into a room in the main house where there are no locks on the doors and thus no privacy, and then the seduction. Who would be the cad then?So I think Wilder meant for the audience to sympathize with Joe. Sure he makes some questionable moral moves, but he is to some degree cornered. He would have to get a hand out from somebody to go back to his job that he hates at the copy desk in Ohio, and his pride wouldn't let him. Also, some say he becomes attracted to Norma. He at best is giving her pity sex and at worst duty sex. He looks either revolted or bored every time she touches him.There are just great performances and interesting characters all around. Unpopular opinion here - I never thought Gloria Swanson was a pretty woman, but she had such severe features that she could come across as an attractive yet unhinged woman for age 50 as Norma. Eric Von Stroheim as Max. He was a great director who lets his obsession with Norma delude them both. And then there is Betty Schaefer, the down to earth girl who does the 50s thing and gets engaged to a man the way you would buy a car - she picks something reliable and likeable and omits passion from the equation. And then she finds passion. There could have been a sequel noir with her married to the dull dutiful Artie when she begins to call the mailman by his first name. The postman would only have to ring once in her case. But I digress.This is also a great look at Hollywood and Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. It's too bad we don't have more actual films from Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. To me this is a perfect film.",False
7,10,The Hollywood Myth FOREVER Shattered !!!,Don-102,n/a,15/08/2025,"Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. ""Norma Desmond"" and ""Joe Gillis"" are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned ""10,000 midnights ago"". How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.The images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool, eyes wide open, looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard (""That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps."" says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naiveté combine to give us one of the most electrifying ""give and take"" between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even ""wax figures"" (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND, Zanuck, Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for ""ruining the industry"". The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma, who is quite insane, and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him, but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille, who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday, tries to set her straight, telling her pictures have ""changed"". They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate), and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that ""Valentino once danced on."" There is so much to discuss, but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING: 10 of 10",False
8,10,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,belikemichaeldotcom,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is such a great film on so many levels I can't really settle on where to begin.  It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film's history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson's career/real life cameos/DeMille's involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today's film writers should take note.  If that weren't enough, there's even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how, in the story, an aging, forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era).  What's interesting is that now, so many years later, we're looking back at her looking back.  To present day viewers, Gloria Swanson of the 1950's is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920's is especially captivating (and a little chilling, I might add). I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever, but we don't often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): ""...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces"", I'd like to also add that they ""didn't need movies; they had films.""They truly don't make them like this anymore. 10/10",False
9,10,Better Late Than Never,queenruejean,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although this movie was made 8 years before I was, I saw it for the first time yesterday and I was blown away! I have spent my life missing what has just become one of my favorite movies of all time.The acting was superb, the storyline riveting and the characters were people you could care about. Max was my personal favorite. There was a quiet, tragic dignity to him. I expected something to be revealed about him but was not prepared for the truth.I've always liked William Holden but my experience with Gloria Swanson was limited to her brief role in ""Airport 75"". I will now look for more movies by her. What an expressive face.It was fun to try to recognize some of the old time actors that were portraying themselves.An all around excellent movie. One I truly regret having waited this long to see. But it is definitely a case of better late than never.",False

11,7,Still great after all these years. A classic full of suspense!,michaelRokeefe,n/a,15/08/2025,"Director Billy Wilder probably at his best. Shot in black, white and shades of gray; the screen sparkles with the brilliance of the script and very good acting. William Holden plays a once successful script writer down on his luck. He finds himself at the mansion of an aging silent movie star played by Gloria Swanson. She was kind of spooky and a whole lot crazy. Her butler and former husband is played by Erich von Stroheim. A true classic worth watching again.",False
12,10,A very brave look at Hollywood when Hollywood was bullied by an absurd censorship.,Sara_Golfarbs_fate,n/a,15/08/2025,"Usually, Cinema is considered as the most delicate form of art because it has the biggest potential to become 'dated' one day. Once a movie thought as 'mind-blowing' can easily become a 'turkey' a decade later.This is not the case here. Sunset Boulevard still remains as one of the most eerie film in the cinema history and still a realistic depiction because of its reflection of Hollywood. It can give you the idea of the dream land's transformation into a nightmare.The film is about a troubled script writer 'Joe Gillis and a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond's weird relationship and the madness that surrounds them and the people around them. Don't wanna give much of the plot, on account the fact that it is a pure gem that should be invented without knowing nothing. But I can talk about the cinematic aspects of this movie.This movie has some very eerie moments because of using a great cinematography. The moments of burying the dead monkey and watching the old film of Norma Desmond are exquisitely presented. The movie has some one of the most innovative scripts of cinema and that is certainly justified by the unforgetable and memorable lines captured from the film. The directing is top-notch but who are we kidding it is Billy 'the great' Wilder. The end of the movie is one of the most chilling part of the movie and it can truly give you some nightmares about insanity. The narration of the movie by the head character was probably done by this movie at the first place and this influenced so many movies afterwards.One of the reasons that this movie is still not dated is because of its courage. The Hayes code was at its peak at the beginning of fifties which manipulates the producers to limit their bad thoughts on one subject, especially on Hollywood. The movie got 11 oscar nomination but only got 3 of them. Apparently, the reason was its harsh criticism on Hollywood.There are some arguements about Sunset Boulevard's genre. It is considered as the greatest film-noir of all time. I don't think it is a film-noir at all. For some aspects, the movie has some noirish elements such as the black and white German-expressionist cinematography and an 'on the edge of insanity', femme-fatale but these two are not enough to make a film-noir. I think this is a psyhcological drama with some horror(the end is horrifying for me) and with some very very dark comedy.Overall, This is truly a classic and one of the best movies of cinema history that will never lose its effects on cinema. Heavily influences American Beauty and Mulholland Drive, also making those movies a must see. 10/10",False
13,6,"A somewhat savage, somewhat sick peek behind the Hollywood curtain",Jonny_Numb,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Sunset Boulevard,"" Billy Wilder's barbed take on the Hollywood studio system during its heyday is by turns volatile, funny, suspenseful, and--at its core--more than a little creepy. By today's standards, this 1950 film still takes some relevant shots at an industry that seldom acknowledges its superficiality, but is also just as dated in other regards. Wilder takes a truly original concept, bending Film Noir, satire, comedy, and pathos in the telling of Joe Gillis (William Holden), a down-on-his-luck screenwriter (the repo men are threatening to take his car, for Pete's sake!), who winds up all but imprisoned in the lonely, secluded mansion of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a washed-up silent-film starlet harboring delusions of a comeback. When drafted to revise Desmond's self-scripted version of ""Salome,"" Joe becomes very aware of his unhinged provider, and quickly begins a collaboration with the young, rhinoplasty-friendly Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson). While Holden and Olson are--in the midst of this send-up--fresh-faced stars, ""Sunset Boulevard""'s axis of madness hinges squarely on Swanson's full-bore performance, a blend of incestuous sexuality and mid-life crisis (she makes Baby Jane seem warm and cuddly by comparison) that makes her advances on Holden genuinely unappealing. The performance is a bit more tricky than one might give credit--as a woman whose fame has declined, her sustained hunger for it fuels her delusion, therefore rendering Norma Desmond an actress who literally acts out her everyday reality, to the point where any semblance of humanity is absent (her actions and words possess the overt dramatics of a woman seeking the Best Actress Oscar). While the film is beautifully photographed and performed, the sheer ambition of the project is something of a flaw--with so many genres represented, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is problematic in synthesizing a coherent vision. But what is here is quite influential, and certainly worth a look.",False
14,4,"Great form, bad content",christophe92300,n/a,15/08/2025,"Here is again a huge disappointing « classic » compared to the raving critics it receives.On the form, there is not much to say, it is your typical Billy Wilder movie with a perfect mise-en-scène and photography (very good work on lighting).There is however a lot of criticisms to make about the content because even though the movie tackles quite effectively, with a cutting look, the Hollywood scene, its fallen stars and aspiring artists, the plot is horrendously unimpressive and extremely shallow.This pseudo romance between William Holden whose role is too bland, too unidimensional, and Gloria Swanson who overacts from start to finish, never captivates the viewer because this story lacks coherence and cohesion, not to mention the movie sometimes looks like a thriller, sometimes like a drama, sometimes a romance, it mixes up too much genres without really developing any of them which ultimately serves it badly.",False
15,n/a,Best Performance in Film History: Gloria Swanson,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe plot has been discussed at length in other comments.To me SUNSET BOULEVARD has it all. The comedy is sly, the drama is of epic proportions because it's not JUST a story about Hollywood or an aging actress. It's really about the giving up of dreams.Norma's dream of return, held to for 20 years, is ironic because Norma so closely parallels Gloria. That Norma cannot make a comeback in 1950 even with connections to DeMille is sad. The sadness is due to Norma's refusal to accept her aging or the politics of Hollywood that worship youth. It's ironic that Norma has no place in Hollywood (the parade has passed by) but DeMille is still working and in the scenes from Samson and Delilah we spot other old-timers like Henry Wilcoxon and Julia Faye--still working but not as STARS. The final irony here is that Gloria did make the comeback that Norma couldn't make.Norma has a thing about STARS.... she says at one point... ""the stars are ageless."" Well this is true in a filmic sense. I can still watch Gloria Swanson in THE LOVE OF SUNYA or MANHANDLED and yup, she is ageless. She is still twenty something. That screen image is forever held up like a bad mirror to the reality of being 50. On another occasion Norma says ""nobody leaves a STAR, that's what makes one a STAR."" True again, but it's not just Gillis who is leaving Norma, her fans have already left. Hence if one is left, one cannot be a STAR.Gillis also gives up his dream (temporarily) of being a writer, Max gives up his dream of directing, and even Betty gives up her dream of love with Gillis. Scary stuff.The film is also about LOVE. Look what these people have done for love: love of another person or love of fame or whatever. Max loves Norma. Norma loves Gillis. Gillis loves Norma and Betty. Betty loves Gillis and Artie. Artie loves Betty. And all of them love Hollywood.Everyone is crushed at the end of this film..... The scene of Max ""directing"" the scene as Norma descends the staircase is one of the all-time great scenes in a film. Norma's final speech, which sums up everything (""there is nothing else""), is devastating. Can she really be insane and make this lucid speech? If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her (a STAR)....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends (supposedly into madness) and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about ""being back"" and ""all those wonderful people out there in the dark"" (which of course includes us every time we watch the film).I cannot think of any other film (possibly CITIZEN KANE) that works on so many different levels. And Gloria Swanson gives the greatest performance in film history!",True
16,10,"""Mr. Wilder, I'm ready for my close-up""",jotix100,n/a,15/08/2025,"Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were about the best writing team in Hollywood for more than three decades. ""Sunset Boulevard"" shows the men at the pinnacle of their profession. Billy Wilder directed the film with his usual panache at this nostalgic look at a Hollywood that had faded almost a quarter of a century before. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.With the advent of the ""talkies"" a lot of film stars of the silent era lost their privileged positions as the most admired people in movies. When the new generation appeared in the scene, they were more accessible to the fans that flocked to see the new technique in the movies that came out. One of those movies stars, Norma Desmond, lives in the past as she never adapted to the new reality, which is evident in the way she stays out of the scene dwelling in her antiquated castle on Sunset Boulevard.Enter Joe Gillis, the man who never made it into the industry. As a writer, all his screen plays were rejected by the studio machinery because they were not what the heads of the production departments wanted to produce, or just were plain, not interested. Joe Gillis comes into the Desmond mansion by accident and it's an accident he encounters on his way out of it! Tbe egotistical Norma Desmond lives in the her palatial home with Max Von Mayerberg, the loyal servant, who was himself, somebody in the silent era. Norma falls for the young Gillis in ways she never expected, but as a desperate woman she wants to possess what she can't otherwise buy, even a man going through financial bad times the way Joe Gillis is.Billy Wilder got magnificent performances out of the three principals. William Holden had one of the best opportunities of his film career with Joe Gillis, a character he wasn't even scheduled to play, but which Montgomery Cliff handed to him in a silver platter when he refused to appear in the picture! Gloria Swanson, having experienced that old Hollywood, was a natural choice to play Norma, which was perhaps, the crowning role in her distinguished career. Erich Von Stroheim, the great director, himself, is absolutely wonderful as Von Mayerling.We see some of the silent era stars such as Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, Anne C. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, as well as Cecil B. DeMille, the director of Hollywood epics par excellence.The great musical score of Franz Waxman enhances the film. John Seitz black and white photography brings us back to that time. Ultimately, it's the genius of Billy Wilder that keeps things in balance showing a man who understood movies as perhaps the only one that could have directed the classic ""Sunset Boulevard"".",False
17,10,Absolute Perfection,Incalculacable,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sunset Blvd. is a terrifyingly realistic portrayal of a washed up movie silent screen star and her quest to rekindle her popularity... and a poor writer on the run from the police who gets involved with her. The story starts backwards: you see a man floating face down in the water, and so the story begins... how it all started.Norma Desmond is a character that you hate, love and feel sorry for all at the same time... she is very selfish, self absorbed and needy. But I felt a strong pang of sympathy when Norma talks about her script for Salome... how she has such high hopes about her comeback. She just wants to be loved again. I could not imagine anyone else playing Norma Desmond.. Gloria Swanson plays it to perfection. William Holden is great also - and I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it to me, but playing such a casual, nonchalant character such as he did against such a strong character of Norma is quite challenging. He did it wonderfully and delivered the lines with ease.After watching it the first time, I watched the bits I wasn't sure of - I was sure if I liked the lines the way they were delivered - and it grew on me. For example, I always imagined the magnificent last line delivered more slowly than Swanson did it... but as I watched it again, I began to like it more and more. Now that I have watched it twice, I cannot really find anything wrong with this movie. It has it all: drama, romance, two fantastic actors, comedy, emotions of sympathy, hate, greed, lust... I would say this one of the top 5 movies of all time, if not the top.After I saw this for the first time, there was a wonderful feeling as if I had just seen a special bit of movie history... and I was a part of that history. I don't know how to explain it, but it was a great feeling that cannot be described. This can appeal to all ages, from 12 and upward's I'd say!

18,8,"weird, bizarre, fascinating, great",rupie,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie deserves all the accolades it has gotten here, as well as ""Maltin's"" four stars. It certainly ranks up there as one of Hollywood's greatest achievements. Seeing it again only reinforces my opinion that William Holden was one of the truly great actors of the last [!] century. Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck. I don't know if the black & white was an economic or an artistic choice, but the film would never have been as effective in color. The opening shot - the floating, dead body of Joe Gillis, eyes wide open, shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is one of the great shots, and an unforgettable opener, matched perfectly by the unforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond. To have Cecil B. deMille actually play himself was an inspired touch. Throw in Eric von Stroheim and you have an unbeatable combination. Truly one the all-time must-see films, although I don't know how to classify it - film noir? black comedy? Hollywood fable ? horror story? psychodrama? Who cares; just see it.",True
19,9,"All right, Mr. DeMille",Boyo-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gloria Swanson must be commended for her bravery in taking a part which may or may not have echoed her own Hollywood career. William Holden took a role which required him to be a kept boy; and he's not the nicest guy in the world either. If this had been made with Mae West and Montgomery Clift, I would probably not be writing this and no one else would give a damn about this movie either.Both of them got Oscar nominations and I am sorry both lost. I am also sorry that ""All About Eve"" won Best Picture that year.  Of course ""Eve"" is a great movie, but its not this.This movie is part of our collective memory and most of the dialogue continues to be quoted even today. Thank God for whatever it was that brought Billy Wilder to Hollywood. I can't think of anyone who did such a wide variety of movies so well.And please, no remakes.",False
20,10,"""And must you chew gum?""",snow0r,n/a,15/08/2025,"It so happens that as I was watching Sunset Boulevard, I was chewing gum, and Gloria Swanson's clipped, derisive tone felt more like it was directed not at William Holden's washed up Joe Gillis in 1950, but at me, sitting on my couch in 2008. I didn't throw my gum away like Gillis does, but still, I did feel a little disconcerted. Norma Desmond knew I was chewing, and she didn't like it one bit.But this is part of Sunset Boulevard's charm. While it's a movie about the ways movies had changed, were continuing to change, and those they left behind, it also shows us how, in some ways, they've remained the same. Its references to the WGA, popcorn cinema, and the tragicomic nature of washed-up celebrity feel oddly contemporary while simultaneously being firmly rooted in the Fifties.While some of the period references to actors and directors went over my head - I'm no expert on the silent era - it didn't affect my enjoyment of them one bit. The fact that Wilder and his team were brave enough to include such comments gives the film a cool, relaxed feel even as the web that binds the characters draws ever-tighter.It's fantastically acted too. Holden is brilliant as the struggling everyman who quickly realises that he's gotten way more than he bargained for, and Swanson is pitch-perfect as the faded screen star whose grip on reality has crumbled far quicker than the walls of her mansion, right down to the wide roving eyes and claw-like hands. They're well-supported, especially by Erich von Stronheim's eerily restrained butler Max.Of course, great dialogue and performances are nothing without a plot to match. Despite the fact that the beginning reveals the end, Sunset Boulevard still manages to keep you hooked from the moment Holden sits at his desk for the first time right up until the movie's cruel, haunting, tragically human conclusion.Very rarely do ""old"" movies actually live up to their reputations, but I'm pleased to say that Sunset Boulevard does, and it's a credit to Wilder's team's ability that this noir-drama stands the test of time. A truly great film.",False
21,10,The Wild Roller-coaster of Fame,bkoganbing,n/a,15/08/2025,"In many ways Sunset Boulevard is like the reverse side of the coin of A Star Is Born. In that film we have young Vicki Lester going through all the travails and heartache before achieving her goal of movie stardom.Sunset Boulevard is the reverse. A Star Is Born has its tragic figure in Norman Maine who commits suicide rather than face being a has been. In Sunset Boulevard we have the character of Norma Desmond who has not taken that route. She lacks for nothing in the material world, she wisely saved and invested her money. But the acclaim of the audience is a drug she craves. She's been at the top on the celebrity roller-coaster and now is at the bottom.Into her life comes Joe Gillis quite accidentally. Fleeing from some repo men looking to take his car, Gillis drives into the garage of what he thinks is a deserted mansion. It looks pretty run down from the outside. Gillis compares it to the house of Miss Faversham from Great Expectations, little knowing how right he was.Billy Wilder was a casting genius though in some ways he fell into the cast he had. Gloria Swanson was not his first choice, he approached both Mary Pickford and Pola Negri for the Desmond role first. Gloria Swanson who actually had made the transition to sound well, but had gone on to stage and radio since her success in Music in the Air, drew from the experiences of many of her colleagues. At the time she was cast in Sunset Boulevard she had a radio show out of New York.Bill Holden was sheer serendipity. Originally Montgomery Clift was to do the part, but at the last minute he said no, feeling that this was to similar a part to the one he played in The Heiress. Wilder then went through the list of contract leading men at Paramount.Wilder saw something in Holden, God bless him. Holden had done a whole series of what he termed 'smiling Jim' roles. He was considered an amiable and non-threatening leading man. Although he had done well in a role as a psychotic killer in The Dark Past, Sunset Boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as an actor. An Academy Award nomination came with the acclaim.Nancy Olson and Erich Von Stroheim were nominated in the Best Supporting Player categories as was Swanson for Best Actress. Von Stroheim was another inspired choice. His is a strange part indeed. He was Desmond's first director in silent films and left his career behind to take care of her. He was also her first husband.Sunset Boulevard for it's time and with the Code firmly in place was a brutal look at the sexual needs of a middle-aged woman. Before Holden knows it, he's giving up his life as an aspiring screenwriter to be a kept gigolo. He doesn't like it, but can't leave it. When he does, it results in tragedy.Nancy Olson plays a reader at Paramount studios where Holden is trying to sell a script. She and Holden had good chemistry and after this they did four more films together.Casting Cecil B. DeMille as himself was of necessity for who could play the great DeMille, but DeMille. DeMille in fact was a former actor and playwright at the turn of the last century. In his autobiography DeMille lets us in on a private joke. He in fact did direct many of Gloria Swanson's early silent films and a pet name he had for her was 'young fella.' Note that when Norma Desmond comes to the Paramount lot to see him, he greets her with that same expression. Note that DeMille got a plug for his own film Samson and Delilah which was in production at the same time. It is the set of that film where Swanson and DeMille meet.You will never forget the finely etched characters of Sunset Boulevard. You can see it many times as I've done, but if you see it only once you will have it burned in your memory. Especially that last scene before the newsreel cameras where Swanson loses whatever sanity she has left. She descends down the stairs of her mansion and descends into the comfort of insanity.I've often wondered should a sequel have been done covering the trial of Norma Desmond. I'm sure Billy Wilder wanted to move on to other projects. Still that would have been a film to see.",False
22,7,Overrated in my humble opinion,bsinc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dom De Luise once uttered a line I use quite often:""Nice, not thrilling, but nice!"" That's exactly how I feel about ""Sunset Blvd."", because as much as the first 30 minutes of it were extremely promising the overly long and much less entertaining middle just slowed the pace a gear to many. I somehow hoped that Joe Gillis would get himself mixed up in a murder case or something, when in fact he wound up being a victim of one in the end.Good performance all around, although not really Oscar worthy(maybe the fact that I saw ""A Man For All Seasons"" just a couple of days ago speaks for itself). I truly hope it wasn't the murder plot or shall I say the final ""twist"" that impressed so many viewers, because as much as it is unusual (and for that time perhaps almost revolutionary) I saw it coming a mile away, which is the main reason with my disappointment with ""Sunset Blvd."" Once I knew exactly what was going to happen there just wasn't any fun in watching the lonesome and forgotten old silent-movie actress tormenting herself and others anymore. I can't figure out why this movie stands so tall in the IMDb 250 greatest; a great beginning, a nice ending and some of the best narration(By William Holden) ever put onto the big screen, but the predictability of it all made ""Sunset Blvd."" overly long and not nearly as pleasing and good as it could have been. 7/10",False
23,10,A Bitter and Tragic Masterpiece,claudio_carvalho,n/a,15/08/2025,"In Hollywood of the 50's, the obscure screenplay writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) is not able to sell his work to the studios, is full of debts and is thinking in returning to his hometown to work in an office. While trying to escape from his creditors, he has a flat tire and parks his car in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.""Sunset Boulevard"" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business. The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched ""Sunset Boulevard"" for maybe five or six times, I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever. The DVD has an interesting documentary called ""Sunset Blvd.: A Look Back"" (a.k.a. ""The Making of Sunset Boulevard"" with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Crepúsculo dos Deuses"" (""Dusk of the Gods"")",False
24,7,The ghosts of Hollywood's ravaged past...,moonspinner55,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hack screenwriter chances upon mansion of a faded Hollywood silent screen star who 'hires' him to ghost-write her return project ""Salome"", but who really wants him for her lover. Poor Norma Desmond: she's 50 years old and over the hill! Literate, but queasy black comedy has a great script and majestic performances, but creeps its way to the depressingly inevitable. The palpable aroma of vintage cigarettes and the smell of rosy perfume hanging in the air permeates this incredible Billy Wilder film; yet, the deeper it crawls into its dark corner, the more repulsive it all seems. It can easily be called a masterpiece, but is it an entertaining movie? Great to see Hollywood circa 1950, with Schwab's Drug Store still there, but it's sad to think that even in 1950, stars were being discarded, replaced by the new and the younger, and even a star like Norma Desmond couldn't get a picture made. Thank goodness she had those oil wells in Bakersfield (""Pumping...pumping.""). There's a lesson to be learned from the film: invest! *** from ****",False
25,3,"Okay, definitely not great",moonmonday,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was okay.Gloria Swanson stole every scene she was in, and her expressive slightly overacting perfectly reflected her character, a performer from an age where vivid facial emotion was crucial in the absence of spoken dialogue. Eric von Stroheim plays an understated role and provides a strong, often silent presence. And William Holden is pretty, but not much else.Honestly, the only person who is remotely sympathetic or identifiable is Swanson's character of Norma Desmond, and the rest are fairly awful, aside from Stroheim's Max, who is basically very interesting scenery; I was pretty sad to reach the end and feel that everyone had basically come away with more or less just desserts. Holden's character was especially difficult to like and seemed to choose, at any given time, the worst and most idiotic possible choice of action.Was this Wilder's attempt at self-parody? Some parts of it would seem to be more satirical than serious, and the whole thing was entirely over the top. It could work as a Gothic tongue-in- cheek work, something like the Addams Family meets the silent age of film, which had aged past its prime.Perhaps it's just that the premise and the characters that populate it cannot really be seen the way they might have been in 1951. Desmond and Max's pathos and need for love and companionship juxtaposed with their isolation in a decaying yet still darkly splendid palace cannot fail to draw sympathy and interest. But Holden's Joe is just a stupid schmuck with a pretty face who never does anything right and was a poor choice for a protagonist.Ultimately it's hard to feel anything for him, though part of that may be the truly asinine choice to begin a film knowing your protagonist is...well, see for yourself. Or don't. It's good for a watch. I don't think I'll ever need to see it again.",False

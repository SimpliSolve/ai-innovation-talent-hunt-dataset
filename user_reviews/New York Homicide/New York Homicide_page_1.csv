1,10,8 Million Suspects - Who're You Gonna Call?,csdcsdcsd2003,n/a,16/08/2025,"Never mind ""their funny New York accents"", y'all, I look forward to viewing ""New York Homicide"" whenever it is broadcast around here, especially because of the appearances of host and retired Chief of Detectives Robert C. Boyce, the 6'4"" blue eyed charmer who has the most adorable way of describing true crimes and complexities of detective work unique to the mammoth densely populated city of New York. He recently gave extremely choice comments on a podcast regarding the Long Island Serial Killer - I guarantee that if the now retired Chief Boyce had been working in that jurisdiction, that case would have been solved in 15 minutes, not 15 years.",False
2,1,NO HOMICIDE HUNTER....,marcus-28749,n/a,16/08/2025,"More like an hour long advertisement for the glory of New York and It's police department. Every few minutes they rehash what happened in the last few minutes, just in case you missed it. It's OK, if you like your true crime filled with subjective opinions. Give me Forensic Files, Homicide Hunter or The Murder Tapes any day. Facts beat Opinion in this genre. I guess it's a testament to the psyche of New York, (that they are the best in the world and don't need to do much apart from resting on their laurels). Shame, because without the pompous bombastic lecturing about their opinions, and more facts, it could have had some promise.",False
3,4,True Crime series that pretty par for the course,annamlee-81577,n/a,16/08/2025,"...and an unavoidable NYPD propaganda message that's very on the nose or I'd give it 6 or 7. There's real inner circle (ie: family members, witnesses, etc.) interviews but the host is the former NYPD chief and there's too much self-promotion that I've never seen in other series.",False
4,5,Those accents lol,dresmiles,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show is ok, it's pretty standard. I just can't get over the cartoonish New York accents of these cops. I can only take so much lol. Give the show a try but there are better shows out there with less obnoxious accents lol.",False

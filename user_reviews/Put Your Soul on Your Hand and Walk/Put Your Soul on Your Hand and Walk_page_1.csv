1,8,Powerful and heartbreaking,GerardoMenmar,n/a,15/08/2025,"A powerful and heartbreaking documentary that, through video calls, offers a much more intimate perspective than the news ever could on the barbarity of the genocide carried out by the Israeli government.Gratitude goes to Fatima Hassouna (may she rest in peace) for welcoming us into her home, sharing her story with immense strength, and for the photographic documentation she created - and to Sepideh Farsi for bringing to the world the voice of a Palestinian woman who, sadly, did not live to see her dream of a world without war come true.Screened at the Guanajuato International Film Festival.",False
2,10,"R.I.P Fatima hassouna, you'll be missed",amarrevolver,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know what to say.. she loved her country and her people more than anything, even though she was newly married and had the chance to leave but she felt that her country needed her voice.. she was assassinated with 10 in a targeted bombing by a bunch of disgusting child murdering criminals.. she was 24 of age.On one of her last posts on social media she wrote: ""If I die, I want a loud death, I don't want to be just breaking news, or a number in a group, I want a death that the world will hear, an impact that will remain through time, and a timeless image that cannot be buried by time or place.""
You'll never be forgotten Fatima and thank you for your courage, you'll be missed.",False
3,10,Heartbreaking Masterpiece Silenced by Violence,muhannad20,n/a,15/08/2025,"Put Your Sole on My Hand and Walk"" is more than just a film - it is the soul of a people, a cry for freedom, and the legacy of a young, brave artist. Fatima, a 24-year-old filmmaker, poured her heart into this powerful story. Through stunning visuals and poetic truth, she gave voice to the silenced, reminding the world of the resilience of those who love their land.Tragically, Fatima and her entire family were killed by the IDF in Ga za. Her only ""crime"" was creating a film - a film that touched millions. This is not just a loss for cinema; it is a loss for humanity. Creative voices, innocent lives, and people who dare to speak through art should never be silenced with violence.We honor Fatima not only for her film, but for her courage. Her message is louder than ever. And even though she is no longer with us, her words, her vision, and her truth live on.Let this review be a tribute: You can silence a person, but you cannot kill an idea.",False

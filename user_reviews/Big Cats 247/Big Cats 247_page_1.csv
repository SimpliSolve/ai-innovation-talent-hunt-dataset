1,7,grassland nature shoot,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"A team of wildlife documentary filmmakers is following the big cats of Okavango Delta in Botswana. Sure, there are the lions and the cheetahs. They are also dealing with the other animals of the grassland and the many challenges in the wild. They do night time filming with some old fashion night vision. Night time brings out some great hunting. It is a BBC production and this one has a lot of the people on camera organizing the filming. It is different from the other BBC nature shows and injects some excitement from the hunting. However, they really should make these people the human stars of the show. They need to work as hosts and there are too many of them.",False
2,10,WOW!,Reviewer_1234,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll just preface this that I don't watch many wildlife shows or movies(I will now), but I was just scrolling through the channel guide last night and was lucky enough to stumble on this show. This show follows a pride of lions along with a jaguar and a cheetah(I believe), where you see their everyday struggles of being in a ""survival of the fittest"" environment. The sheer amount of effort and dedication it takes for these amazing animals to get their next meal is really highlighted in this show. I found myself on the edge on my seat for the entirety of the first two episodes, often celebrating a kill like it's a winning Superbowl touchdown. Not to mention the dedication from the camera crew to get the amazing shots they do. It is truly a eye opener to someone who doesn't watch many shows like this to see the life and root for these amazing animals. Most definitely worth the watch!",True
3,10,Marvellous,bil-24,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerReally enjoyed this series. If you've ever seen 'Big Cat Diary' from the early 2000s, then this show is basically that - but with modern camera tech, drones, and a mix of local & British camerapersons. It has lots of drama, and gives a really good insight into the daily struggles of these magnificent animals. So much is about motherhood, and the challenges of keeping cubs alive in this hostile environment where everything wants to kill them. They make a big deal of how few cubs survive to adulthood, which means you're watching through your hands a lot of the time - hoping that the cute cubs make it through to the end of the episode. It's great TV. I hope they make a second season.",True
4,10,Fabulous Series,kazza-kh-204-970040,n/a,15/08/2025,"This 6 Part BBC Series of the Big Cats of the Botswana Ocovanta Delta is Brilliant. The presenters are educated and Provide much needed information about the Stars of the Show the BIG CATS THEMSELVES,I was gripped about the Life & death these big cats experience on a daily basis, finding Food for themselves & their families, the hierachy,I was invested in the lives of all the big cats, my favourite was Cudom the female Leopard, I won't spoil you with what happens but her Ups & Downs during the 6 months of filming, you can not but admire her.The Camera work was amazing using MILITARY Grade Drones, Camera's & Night Time video. Gave a greater insight to these big cats.",False
5,6,Focus on the Animals!,williamford-17805,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good nature show, but unfortunately let down by this odd over-emphasis on trying to make all the camera operators into stars of the show and turning that portion of the show into a reality show about their unentertaining hi-jinks that no one asked for. They do a fine job getting the shots themselves, which are fascinating at times, but most of them really lack the charisma to be stars. One in particular really seems love the spotlight a little too much, and tries to inject herself into every situation comments that were rarely insightful and often just tedious. There's a reason Attenborough does voice-overs: people want to see the animals, not endless cuts to the camera operators telling them ""wow, this is like, crazy!"" over and over again.",False
6,2,Mostly a waste of time,ablbodyed-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI rarely miss a wildlife show, especially when it's about big cats, so I recorded these episodes and held on to them (all but the fifth, which hasn't aired yet here in the States) and was looking forward to binging them. I started the first episode and was immediately irritated by the muchtooMuchTooMUCHTOOMUCH emphasis on the smug and self-important cameramen and women. I timed it and there was almost the same amount if film wasted on the these people sitting in their vehicles looking pensively ahead as there was film of the animals themselves. The BBC should be ashamed of presenting this when they have a history of absolutely brilliant series that movingly show the cats. If they wanted to focus on the camera people than they should have an episode dedicated to that, not constantlyConstantlyCONSTANTLY interrupt the cats' storyline with pictures of them prepping their cameras. I watched for a while and then was too irritated to continue, and I deleted the whole series. Terribly disappointed. Focus on the cats notNotNOT the people: that just a distraction, and a way to lengthen a series artificially. If you love wildlife series as much as I do, avoid this one.",True
7,5,Too Much Idle talk,farshidkarimi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documentary movies and series about wildlife are always fascinating, especially those about lions. I appreciate all the good efforts of cameramen who document the life and behavior of lions, leopards and cheetahs and there is no denying their risky and arduous work. This series was supposed to be big cats, showcasing their behavior and daily lives in the wild. However, most of the time in this series has been wasted on unnecessary talking of cameramen (women). I really liked to see more of the big cats not the constant chatter of the cameramen. They could allocate a whole episode to the good work of cameraman. Thus, we could enjoy the lives of the majestic cats and appreciate the arduous work of the cameramen.",False

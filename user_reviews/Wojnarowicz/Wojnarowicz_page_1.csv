1,10,How had I never heard of this man in all these years?,lee_eisenberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"It appears that I'm the first person reviewing ""Wojnarowicz"". I should note that I had never heard of David Wojnarowicz until I saw the documentary. In teaching gay history, this is definitely a man who should get highlighted. His multimedia work called out the government's indifference to AIDS victims, and the religious establishment's hatred of them. The documentary was an obvious allusion to Trump's policies, but can also refer to the efforts to censor LGBT materials in schools, libraries, etc. In Florida it's gotten so bad that Canada has issued a travel advisory for gays going there!Anyway, everyone should see this documentary.",False

1,8,Interesting and emotional,grantss,n/a,15/08/2025,"A documentary on the thought processes, intelligence and personalities of dogs, examining their history and relationship with wolves, their domestication and uses in helping people. In particular, we see how dogs are selected and trained to be service dogs.An interesting look into what makes man's best friend tick. Some decent insights, including looking back on dog's descent from wolves, domestication and breeding and how these shaped their personalities and uses.The coverage of the selection and training to be service dogs was very interesting and ultimately quite emotional as we see the dogs get placed with various people with different issues, requiring dogs of varying personalities and abilities.Not quite as profound as I was expecting though. I was expecting some major breakthroughs to be revealed but, unless you're unaware that dogs can be trained to help out humans, a lot of the stuff is hardly revolutionary.Still, very interesting and who doesn't like to see footage of cute doggies living their best lives!",False
2,8,Surprisingly engaging documentary with emotional connection,Airman87,n/a,15/08/2025,"Inside the Mind of a Dog offers a comprehensive collection of the latest studies and understanding into our fury friends' personalities, intelligence, and behaviors. This documentary develops in a way that is both entertaining and compelling.Rob Lowe narrates a series of stories and interviews, from the history of canines to ongoing research, intertwined with the main story of the documentary - the development of service dogs from puppyhood to when they are graduated. Although I knew most of the recent research which was discussed, I did learn something, and believe most people will also find something new to take away. The connection between service dog and recipient is one that will make most viewers teary eyed.This documentary is best watched with your dog(s) by your side.",False
3,8,Live my puppy,Bmore-Hero,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerInside the Mind of a Dog is a captivating documentary that delves into the fascinating world of canine cognition and emotion. It offers a blend of scientific insights and heartwarming moments, making it an engaging watch for dog lovers and anyone curious about the minds of our furry companions.The film excels in presenting complex scientific concepts in a way that's easy to understand. Through interviews with experts in animal behavior and psychology, viewers gain a deeper appreciation for the intelligence and emotional depth of dogs. The use of slow-motion footage and close-up shots beautifully captures the nuances of dog behavior, allowing us to see the world through their eyes.One of the highlights of the documentary is its exploration of the bond between dogs and humans. The film effectively shows how this relationship has evolved over time and what it means for both species. Personal stories from dog owners add an emotional layer to the scientific narrative, making the film both informative and touching.However, the documentary does have some pacing issues. At times, it lingers too long on certain points, which can make the middle section feel a bit slow. Additionally, while the film is comprehensive, some viewers might find it lacking in groundbreaking revelations if they're already familiar with the subject matter.Overall, Inside the Mind of a Dog is a well-crafted documentary that provides valuable insights into the lives of dogs. It's an eye-opening experience that will leave you with a greater understanding and appreciation for your canine companion. For its blend of science and sentiment, it earns a solid 8 out of 10 stars.",True
4,7,Not what I was expecting,karenchapman-87572,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is no doubt the documentary was interesting and did give a great insight into dogs and how they have evolved from predatory wolves to man's best friend. There was a lot of how guide/service dogs are selected and trained and as it was presented it was good. However I don't know if I saw an advert or a trailer that led me to believe it would be something else but as another review stated exactly the same disappointment I'm sure I must have. I thought it was going to be a documentary helping me explain why my dog does particular things and how I can communicate better with him. So for example it said dogs had developed the ability to look at their owners with ""puppy eyes"" by showing the whites of their eyes. But never expanded on why they would do this, what they were hoping to achieve and what they were trying to communicate. It said a service dog that barked wouldn't pass the test because restaurants wouldn't stand for it but never explained what different types of barking meant and how to interpret them to know my dog better. It was an interesting documentary if you want to know how service dogs are trained but not if you want to know if your dog's trying to tell you something.",False
5,9,There is no bad dog...,Adhogati,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very informative (albeit not too heavy on the science - which I would have preferred) look into the absolutely the most accepting life form to have evolved on this planet.From how they have evolved and how our training methods have evolved wot make the best use of their abilities and how we could do better to be better friends to our best friends, this documentary looks into a bit of everything that is Dog.Whether you love dogs, are afraid of them, are unsure about them, this will be a worthy watch that will help us understand what makes these bundles of delight so successful at playing our heartstrings.",False
6,7,It's less about the mind of a dog and more about the training of service animals.,fluffchop,n/a,15/08/2025,It's less about the mind of a dog and more about the training of service animals.It's touching when they meet their dogs.It's interesting but also not that interesting if you want to know what your dog is thinking like the title would suggest. I'm pretty sure there is a wealth of dog behaviour that could have been covered. Like they mention that the dogs tail wags to the right when it knows someone. We should have had far more of this rather than endless hours of training schools for service animals.It's an interesting documentary but also not that interesting based on what the title promises.,False
7,9,"It's good, some great moments",trszigi,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think I shouldn't start with this, but...i sometimes look at how people rate titles in percentage, almost never a documentary just the ones I think of being divisive, and for some reason I looked it up here, I still don't believe people gave this 1...I really would like to know why, maybe they are cats raised to hate or fear dogs..no, just monsters...
So, the movie, difficult subject, needs 10 seasons 11 episodes a season and by the end at least half again, revised what changed and half new information. Focusing on one dog one story would not be sufficient, styles of different videos hard to compose together, feels like nothing new, a safe choice, a tv documentary of the 90s with some higher quality shots. The title isn't exactly proper for it, I can understand how it overlaps, I also was expecting something else. It is always great to see dogs, people who love them, them working together, like I mentioned before, please expect more from yourselves and explore their world broader, as new information, creativity and style etc. Goes it is not better than a 5, but it's theme is always 11 for me.",False
8,6,Title is a bit misleading.,vithiet,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like dogs, and I absolutely love my pup to death. So I was pretty excited to watch this, thinking it would be an in-depth view into the latest scientific research that is surrounding dogs behavior, psychology, etc. But alas, they only barely scratch the surface on these topics and instead the core of this documentary is to show how service dogs are trained. It's fairly well done, has some heart and decently interesting information but there is nothing groundbreaking or innovative about it. So I was a bit disappointed because of my expectations going in. But if you know before you go, and you like dogs, this is fairly enjoyable.",False
9,8,Interesting and Informative,lakings97,n/a,15/08/2025,Inside the Mind of a Dog is a Netflix documentary about the minds of how dogs react and their relations with humans. The documentary is narrated by Rob Lowe and the interesting part is how dogs communicate and sense our emotions. Scientist have done experiments with support from various safe methods to learn the actions of dogs as our pets. I got to say as I was growing up I never wanted to have a pet and as a matter of fact I was afraid of them not till we adopted Spencer. Spencer has changed my mind and the way I think about pets and now he is my best friend. This show taught me several ways to help Spencer overcome any anxiety he may have. Most dogs can understand over 100 words and sleep most of the day but they are always there waiting for us when we get home. This was a great show to give a synapse of a dog's mind. Loved it.,False
10,6,Fun documentary,elfronza,n/a,15/08/2025,"I will make it short. The dog training bit was a bit boring and the documentary was not super deep on the psychology of the dogs but it was fun, cute and enjoyable. A couple of funny moments were this African American guy who had a bunch of one liners dad jokes (you know the one) and an R rated 3 seconds clip of a woman getting licked inside her mouth by a dog right at the beginning of the documentary (wtf).It seemed like a documentary that confirms what dog owners already knew but now can be smug about sharing all these little facts with their friends and family in parties and to other dog people in the park.Not really memorable but an enjoyable Saturday night watch if you are a bit lost on what to do.",False
11,4,Disgusted - could not get past the first three minutes,sallyfinn,n/a,15/08/2025,"I may be focusing on the wrong thing here, however there are at least two, up close, slow motion scenes of humans letting their dog lick/tongue them IN the mouth. I'll say it again... Slow motion. It's absolutely repulsive and made me just turn it off. I have a dog that is my favorite thing ever in life. She is my BFF and child. I understand get ""doggy kisses"" when they lick you a little bit on the lips then you turn away, but this is literally pathologically disgusting, as dogs eat feces and there's no reason to ever make out with your dog!!! Perhaps this was a good thing because the reviews indicate that there isn't a lot of science-based content within this film, and I would have been disappointed anyhow. Note to filmmaker: Maybe next time don't put it so close, in our faces, slowed down while dogs and humans tongue one another. So gross, I can't.",False
12,1,Basically Tells You Everything Any Pet Owner Already Knows About Dogs,alenlin,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI learned almost nothing I didn't already know after spending 1 hour and 15 minute watching this. If you've been a loving dog owner some point in your life, you'd feel the same way watching this film.Even non-dog owners who watches dog short form dog videos online would have known everything taught here about dogs.The title is a bit misleading, it focuses primarily on training and conditioning of dogs and exercise-style experiments that so-called college funded ""researchers"" are performing with the dogs. There is very little depth in the findings, and it seems like nothing new has been discovered.Parts of the film, especially the interview with Brian Hare came across as a bit preachy with implications of a certain social political commentary.",True
13,5,Fun and interesting,srikanthan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't like documentaries, especially the Netflix ones which have less substance and more drama. This is no different, as other reviews noted, its less about the mind of the dogs and more about training the dogs. For me, I did not much care about the title as I sat to watch this, as was doing something else and put this on as a background noise. However the episode is surprisingly interesting, and I ended up watching every moment. I am going to watch the other one, inside the cat's mind. I learnt a few things in watching this episode, (Spoiler alert applies to documentaries?) such as each dog has unique nose print just like humans have finger print, the world record about a dog having 24 puppies, difference between dogs and wolves, in that dogs show the whiteness in their eyes and endear us etc. Quiet an interesting documentary, I would love to watch with my children.",True

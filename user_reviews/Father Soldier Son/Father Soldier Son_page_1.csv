2,8,"Brilliant, hard hitting film that lives long in the memory",jops-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film is brilliant, not an easy watch. but just about as raw as a documentary can come... thoroughly recommended.However I chose to write to reflect on the extreme entitlement of some so called 'reviewers' leaving comments on here and out in the world in general recently. It is becoming more and more common for people to give a film a low review because it does not conform to their political. or social views on life. These people totally misunderstand what reviewing a film is all about. But one of the user reviews of this film on this site contains the most entitled sentence I have ever read.""The accident of Joey also never show to us! Pathetic!... Another disappointed film!""Joey was the 12 year old son of the film's protagonist tragically killed in a traffic accident during the filming of this documentary, which was made over many years of the crew visiting the family... That this reviewer is castigating the film crew for not being out there waiting to catch the moment for his entertainment is utterly contemptable, I am sure even if they were there when the accident happen it is unlikely the family would have wanted to retain this fatal moment in the film... reviews like this show a pathological inability to separate entertainment form reality.",True
3,6,I'm quite overwhelmed,simone_elmgreen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet me start by saying, that I thought the documentary is very well made. However I'm surprised by the lack of insight and glorification of the army and war. I'm european and I can in no way understand this. Im amazed, that Brian doesn't seem to realise, how much him being away and in danger has affected his kids. They're clearly missing him when he's away and are afraid for his life. And how, after his injury, he takes his frustrations out on his sons and girlfriend, seemingly without zero remorse. And wants his sons to join the army, even though it might not be, what they want. And despite the dangers is intails.
Joeys death was absolutel devastating. I hope the family can heal and find happiness in spite of this terrible tradigy. Especially Isaac, who seems quite damaged and has a hard time finding his way.",True
4,9,A True Life Story,mikefio22,n/a,16/08/2025,"This isn't a documentary that is supposed to make you feel sorry for the man. He doesn't want people to feel sorry for him either. He even says it at one point. This story shows the ups and downs of life from the perspective of a family that went through really tough times. The ""reviewer"" who called SFC Eisch a snowflake obviously missed the point. He also probably never served or went through anything remotely close to what this family went through. I bet he wouldn't say it to his face! I did 8 years in the Army and if anyone ever called me a snowflake, that'll be the last thing they say to me.I just wish more people had the integrity and power to parent like SFC Eisch does. He raised some great kids and to do it with their mother out of the picture, while on active duty is a real accomplishment. Mary, the step-mom also needs a pat on the back! These are people i wish i could call friends.",False
5,10,Exceptional,matheo-62471,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStarts as a Point of vision of a ""normal"" family who have an active military person in the family. Ends as a ""normal"" family who have an Afganist√°n veteran who was wounded in combat. It's a roller coaster about emotions. leaves you thinking about many things.
It is a production that is very worth seeing.",True
6,7,Timed snapshots are revealing,Xavier_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"I felt this real life documentary was frustrating to watch at times. The film maker is careful enough to only show glimpses of the story behind the scenes and paints his own narrative. A decent story in any case, not scripted but obviously massaged.Some elements of the film that bother me. The military is always shown in a positive light, despite the huge emotional and physical toll on this family. The family depression/stress/ptsd is never dealt with or addressed despite being obviously causing issues. The father is rarely shown in any teaching moment.This becomes almost a recruitment advertisement, and it seems logical that if the real story were told Eisch would risk losing his benefits and retirement.",False
7,10,Brilliant heartbreaking engrossing unforgettable,zoesfleming,n/a,16/08/2025,You will never see a more compelling documentary in your life. This family has seen the best and worst.

8,7,The American Tragedy,RandyFoxglove,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who serves in the US armed forces? The disenfranchised and the underprivileged. This terrifying look at a military family shows the darkness that is a result of the military Industrial Complex that creates the need for their service.The willful ignorance of the young man who knows not why he fights but desires to prove to his father that he has what it takes to ""go to war"" took my breath away.",False
9,10,Paths of Glory?,jarthur0111,n/a,16/08/2025,"The years of work making this movie have paid off handsomely & tragically.

10,10,One of the most heartbreaking things I've watched in years,sophiahwright,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was so well done and they couldn't have followed a more beautiful and loving family.

11,5,Incredibly sad,SandOwl_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBoy is told by his father that he always wanted a son to enlist. Boy is the youngest & only one left able to do so in the family, so he does as his father wants.
Boy turns into man, has two sons of his own. He's away for 6 months at a time, with two weeks break in between to spend time with his boys.
His boys are deeply affected by their fathers absence, the risk to his life & they're plagued with fear of possible loss.Man says he doesn't want to be over of those father's who tells at his kids when he gets home.Father is wounded, returns home & tries to save his leg. This process takes years. During this time his oldest son wears a great emotional burden of feeling like he has to be there for his father all the time, that he may still lose his father. So eldest son status close, helps his father and bears this weight. Father didn't intentionally place this weight on his son, yet he fails to see it is there, let alone get his son help.
Father is angry & frustrated about his damaged leg. Takes this out on his boys and his girlfriend. Father takes no responsibility for his own wellbeing, gets no therapy, no external help to help him learn coping mechanisms so he doesn't take his stuff out on his children.
The children bear the burden of this, particularly good oldest who is picked on, rather than guided.Oldest boy wants to be a police officer, go to college. Be closer to his family, not deployed overseas.
Father says boy doesn't have the grades. That school is sending home notes asking him the father, to help his son with homework. Father claims he doesn't know how to do what the kids are doing today.
Father doesn't get a tutor for his son to help him realise how own dreams of going to college.
Father tells 17 year old son that I've be turns 18 either he needs to be enrolled in college or the army. Father constantly telling his eldest son that there's no way he's going to college, he'll be enlisting in the army. Son tells the camera that he is going to go to college even though his father doesn't believe him.Youngest son is all gung-ho about joining the military. Youngest son, 12 years old ,is killed in a tragic accident (RIP Joey & condolences to the family).Eldest son is now going to enlist as he feels that's the right thing to do. It's what Joey wanted to do. He feels he should do this.Father has pushed son to enlist all his life. Father wanted his sons to enlist, as his father wanted him to enlist.Son says the army isn't what he thought it was like when he was younger. He's suffering from depression yet is unsure why, could be his mother leaving, his father being shot, his brother dying, he doesn't know. He feels he isn't good enough, that he hasn't done as well as his father so isn't acceptable, that he'll never be good enough, that his younger brother would've done better and made their father proud, whereas he has failed to do so.The father has another son with his new wife. While the son is only days/weeks old, the father tells the camera he wants his baby son to enlist when he grows up.What a terrible story.Father's in denial of the damage their deployment does to their children. No willingness to see this damage at any stage, to provide professional help, nor encouraging them to be their own men, their own person to follow their own dreams.
Instead it's like children bred for war by ignorant people who have an inability or unwillingness, to stop the generational damage & slaughter.No personal accountability by the father.
His own unhappiness not even being enough to stop his son from possibly experiencing the same, instead telling him he must enlist.This is generational damage being played out on the screen.
While it's interesting from the perspective that I've not encountered that particular situation myself, it's still the same abuse perpetrated all over the world by domineering, ignorant parents.Father's should encourage their children to be their own people, to follow their own dreams. Support & love them in every way possible, including being there if dreams are needing to be changed.
Not to force their vocational wants onto their children.
Adults need to be responsible for their emotional wellbeing, to get therapy and do what's required to be okay so they don't abuse their children. They need to be switched on enough to realise their actions create harm and get professional help for their children, for as long as needed.18 is still a child. Not an age to be shipped off to learn to kill.I'm deeply concerned for this new baby, born in 2019?
What happens if that young boy turns out to want to be a drag queen? An actor, hairstylist, makeup artist, politician, vet, doctor, mechanic, janitor, pilot, physicist, or any other vocation? Will the father grow enough in this time to see how dreams for his child come second to the child's dream for themselves?
Will he get tutoring for his child if their grades aren't okay?During all of this, will be get professional help for his eldest son, so he can work through all of his trauma? So he can heal & learn to love himself as he is, without constantly feeling he has to impress his father, that he'll never be good enough? All the while watching his new sibling grow up constantly surrounded by his father's presence and love, something he didn't get our have in his life.Parenting doesn't stop because you've forced your child or of home, or they've left home of their own volition.This father has a responsibilty to help his son, himself and thus his newest son.If you're a military father who breeds kids for enlistment, you should watch this and see the lasting damage it does to children.
It's selfish to do that to your children. They didn't choose to enlist, or have you as a father.Joining the military? Don't have kids until you're done.I wish the eldest son all the very best in this life. I hope he isn't killed, harness or maimed while in the military. I hope he gets the help he needs to be okay within himself and to unravel his father's enforced damage. So he can love and respect himself irrespective of his father's views. He matters. He's not the disappointment here. Not in any way.",True
12,8,Extraordinarily moving documentary,jmvscotland,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Father Soldier Son"" is an extraordinary documentary. Deeply moving, tragic and charged with emotion. A testament to the ability of some human beings to deal with and to overcome the most terrible loss.I looked up how much a Platoon Sergeant like Brian Eisch is paid now in the US Army and found that it's only about $US36,000 a year. Deployment to operations in such as Afghanistan would probably attract further pay in the form of allowances but what an extraordinary job soldiers like Sergeant Eisch perform for their country for so little financial reward.I was moved by this documentary so much. Highly recommended.JMV",False
13,10,Excellent Documentary,geenam,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerExcellent documentary on the realities of a military family. Watch, but make sure you have a box of tissues....",True
14,10,Very deeply touching documentary,jangchupla,n/a,16/08/2025,This is my first review on IMDb and I was so deeply moved. I felt I need to let people know that they shouldn't pass this doc. I would rate it higher if I could. The real life struggle of a military man and his family. It touched my soul in ways no other documentary could. Pls watch.

16,10,Puts it out there for all to see,ckmerc02,n/a,16/08/2025,First..for this who sit in judgement... stop.. walk in Mr. Eisch's shoes first. Have you sacrificed? Were you a single father raising two boys? Right. Show some respect. So regarding the documentary...an outstanding real life picture. One that you will look at and see a bit of yourself in. Caution..it will pull you in..not let go..for several days after.,False
17,5,Typical USA showoff,johanrndrs,n/a,16/08/2025,"What ever you do you need to be tough.Live up to your fathers expectations or be a loser.Loose a kid, just take another one and send him also to war.The boy is in the Army but he does not know why war started or is dragging on, He just wants to go fighting for his country.This is not happiness, this is just sad. US kids are som brainwashed that they cannot think for themselves anymore.That is probably what the US of Amerika wants.Just sad and terribly wrong.",False
18,9,Life with Father,jadepietro,n/a,16/08/2025,"GRADE: B+THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A powerful look at an All-American family and the tragedy that befalls them.JIM'S REVIEW: Father Soldier Son is a vivid portrait of one American family and the impact that war casts upon them. Documentarians Catrin Einhorn and Leslye Davis followed the lives of Brian Eisch, an Army sergeant deployed in Afghanistan and his two sons, Isaac, age 12, and Joey, age 7. The film spans nearly a decade and covers their emotional and physical toil unflinchingly. It is a moving testament to the courage and love of a soldier and father for his children and the way we grow together and apart.The film chronicles the mental anguish and physical recuperation that becomes a common occurrence for Brian once he is ambushed and seriously injured in the war. His children's rose-colored view of military life is permanently altered. One son still idealizes the Army life while the other readily avoids its allure as they adapt to their new life with father. There are some serious gaps in the storytelling as years pass and some major events are not seen on film. Yet, the film captures the everyday existence of one family starting over with such a measured eloquence. Nathan Halpern's music score adds layers to the heartbreak. The film is a honest expos√© of hurt and healing, a soldier story that is uniformly balanced and observant.Seeing the children grow into teenagers and speaking openly of their new-found fears about their shattered divorced dad is quite moving. Watching the father come to terms with his own disability and its limitations while losing his self-pride at being ""a burden"" to his country and family is emotionally gut-wrenching. We also witness Brian's eventual remarriage and the addition of a stepbrother into the family unit, but this character is completely overlooked as a viable family member In the documentary which seems an odd decision from the filmmakers to sidestep his presence. Still, there are unexpected moments of tragedy that haunt both the Eisch clan and moviegoers, bringing added depth and sadness to this family drama.The filmmakers had direct access to the family and their daily activities (physical therapy sessions, VA visits, school wrestling matches, house chores, proms, graduations, births, etc.) and this approach paints a more complete picture of a family coping with adversity and dysfunction. Subtle images of military paraphernalia strewed throughout the house, the constant playing of violent video games as entertainment, an American flag draped at half mast...these and other objects effectively hint at the patriotic mindset of this rural Army family. Their love of duty and country becomes a lasting presence, an undeniable force that envelopes parent and child throughout the years.Father, Soldier, Son is a fascinating look at the male psyche, the glorification of the military, and the underlying bond between father and son. Lessons are taught and learned. As the saying goes, the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children. It seems the Eisch's story is a prime example of history repeating itself and reinforcing that adage. This powerful documentary presents the evidence and becomes a lingering glimpse into one part of Americana desperately wanting to ""be all it can be"", even if everything is stacked against our blue collar families overcoming the odds to merely survive. The circle of life goes on...NOTE: While I completely understand Brian's anger issues due to his injuries and do not agree with his ""toughlove"" stance in raising his sons, the filmmakers sensitively capture his anguish and frustration that continually hangs over his family. This shroud of gloom permeates his home and affects the family within it. A follow-up documentary on the Eisch clan in another decade would be enthralling.",False
19,8,A beautiful and tragic story,whatgift,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is amazing story, told with great empathy and sensitivity by the filmmakers.The real tragedy here is the two boys - both beautiful souls who deserved better than how they ended up, a reflection of the society they grew up in.It's so depressing the American obsession and glorification of the military and guns, it's actually embarrassing that a modern country can be so far behind with current times and sensibilities.I do feel there is hope for the people in this story, although I really feel bad for how Isaac finished up, I hope he's doing ok.",True
20,10,Rare glimpse behind the curtain post-deployment.,sammig-47718,n/a,16/08/2025,"The person that gave this movie 1/10 stars is either a complete sociopath, or didn't watch the movie at all. If you don't respect or feel gratitude for the men and women that risk their lives to protect us here at home (no matter the reason they ""chose"" to do so), then you should probably move to another country. Permanently. I'll bet the bravest thing you've ever done is sit behind your computer screen and spew negativity on all that is good in the world.ANYWAYS, I'm sorry, but I saw that review before I watched the movie, and after watching I could not believe someone could be so soulless. Besides the war aspect of this soldier's life, we get a gut-wrenching look into this soldier's home life post-deployment...without giving anything away, just know that I cried my eyes out. I yelled at the screen. I'm still shook. This is a film that every American should see. Period.",False
21,10,Worth to watch,willekesnijder,n/a,16/08/2025,Did not expect this. It is going to make you cry. Really worth to watch,False
22,9,A really touching documentary,bayherd,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the best documentary I have seen. A really sad one. Filmed over several years, we get to see how the father and his sons change throughout these years after the father gets injured in Afghanistan.A the beginning of the film the father tells a story of one of his sons friends, that his dad changed after being deployed to Iraq and that he doesn't want to become that father.And sadly, he becomes exactly that father.This is a very moving and sad documentary, and very impressive that they managed to film it over several years. To see all their pain, happiness, love throughout all the years.That this documentary haven't gotten more praise or more awards is beyond me.I can highly recommend this one.",False
23,5,"A sad story depicted as the norm, when it is not.",pudim_pudding,n/a,16/08/2025,"The military provides young Americans several opportunities. The United States is by far the freest country in the planet. There are some casualties, and some problems that can be fixed. But the military should be seem as part of the solution and not as part of the problem.",False
24,10,A real raw masterpiece of a generational military family.,castrosamuel-07622,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film was recommended to me by a career Ranger prior to re-enlisting. First I want to say Thank You to the men and women who sign the dotted line, it's not easy, when I did it was terrifying but as you watch this film don't judge something you don't fully know yourself. For many of us who are generational military this will hit harder than you're expecting it. Before I left for BCT my father told me ""there are some people in this world who just won't understand, and you shouldn't try to make them."" Watching this film and reading the comments is a perfect example of that. So much so that it drove me to actually comment something. I have a son of my own now and so this story made me appreciate everything that much more, not just freedom but family. I was never one for being patriotic nor commenting on the internet but unless you have served or have a parent who has served, respectfully, you should keep your mouth shut about a way of life you have no idea about. This is deeper than just some documentary, this is the story of many young men like Issac and I who grew up this way. I'm not justifying this man's actions, trust me from personal experience, but it's very easy to get on the internet and voice your opinions on how terrible of a father he is, he executed his job as a father and a warrior. Who are we to judge? Rest In Peace Joey.",True
25,8,Shows all that is wrong with America,adamfrandsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTerribly frustrating to watch a dad ruin the lives of his young sons, himself a victim of the military industrial complex and his own low self esteem. Primitive.Going into the military is the easy choice young people can make. There are no ethical or aesthetic requirements and there is no justifiable purpose. It is the easiest way to make a living, and society grants a free pass on all moral issues and societal obligations.America is not a free country, there is no democracy and little free speech and even less free thought. It is an aggressive military power that only seeks to enrich itself with no aesthetic, higher purpose.America is the only country in the world to have ever used a nuclear bomb against an already defeated enemy. Countless humanitarian issues both domestic and abroad. Racial divide and prejudice, poor educational system etc. etc. etc..Thinking about all those poor people at the other end of the barrel makes me sick to my stomach. And also seeing how these young boys are forced into the glorification of something so destructive and worthless as the military is just heartbreaking. Using the death of his youngest son to engage his otherwise college bound older son to enlist is just so gross to watch.",True

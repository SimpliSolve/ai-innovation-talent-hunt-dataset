1,9,Classic HBO,AyeMacks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredible documentary. Maybe the rawest, unfiltered & emotionally charged films I have ever seen. This should be mandatory viewing in the education system. This will change the way you view addiction, the legal system & humanity as a whole, Jon Alpert's commitment to the project over a 35+ year period is something to be witnessed. How this is not getting the mainstream attention it deserves is beyond me, a truly must see film.",False
2,8,Emotional rollercoaster ride through 3 decades of drug use,littlemissunshyne,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been an IMDB member for several years, seen and rated countless films and never been moved to write a review until now. My heart is simply broken after watching the ups and downs of the people we get to know in this documentary and bearing witness to the literal highs and lows that decide their fate. Early on I became somewhat irritated by the film-maker as he seemed to condone and almost egg on the subjects actions but I think as he matured (or perhaps his filmmaking did) he simply let their stories tell themselves, and that's when I found myself wholly invested and wishing to see a happy ending for these people. We got a painfully honest ending instead.Paying special attention to the children involved and seeing their lives ripped apart by their parent's addiction is one of the toughest parts to witness. They deserved to grow up without recognizing track marks or staying up late every night wondering if their loved one will return. This film will stick with me for days and is highly recommended even though it becomes very tough to watch.*Note: as another reviewer pointed out there are some extremely graphic scenes involving one of the film's subjects, so be warned to turn away and perhaps just listen during that portion.",False
3,9,As Real as it Gets,crtant3,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter the first 2 minutes of the film, I had to stop and search IMDB to see if this was a real doc or a mockumentary (e.g. Found footage). At the opening we are introduced to three crooks, and later a girlfriend that are so over the top, brazen and ridiculous in their escapades that I could not believe it was real. LOC walks through a landscape of knucklehead families, parentless children, petty theft, a broken criminal justice system, prostitution, AIDS, job loss in America, etc..Early on we are then introduced to their family life and circle of friends that are not much better off than them. One guys father appears so broken and beaten in life he flinches each time his son makes an animated or sudden move. Parental abuse? A girlfriend is openly beaten by another guy over her pregnancy, they have only been dating a month. From here it spirals revealing the almost impossible task of escaping this life and its environment. After long stints in prison, they all come out with a more sober view of the world intent on change, but it is tough to make it materialize.At times I felt the director was almost too removed in achieving his product. At one point a 6-year-old sits in an open window on the second floor. After he gets his shot, he points it out to his older (10 yo?) sister who tells him to get down. There are several times the director can be heard asking questions that are almost ghoulish and exploitative. I guess usually we don't hear the prompting questions from other directors.Regardless, I was going to give it a 9, but the way this hit me emotionally I bumped it up to a 10. Where ""Cape Cod Heroin"" and ""Dope Sick Love"" stopped short of really showing the amount of crime that goes with addiction, LOC stays with it.",True
4,10,"Life of Crime: The Beginning, The Middle, & The End",udar55,n/a,16/08/2025,"Viewed via a virtual screening at DocNYC. Jon Alpert's seminal works One Year in a Life of Crime (1989) and Life of Crime 2 (1998) set the standard for the gritty documentaries HBO used to produce and set the tone for addiction docs that are prolific in the age of the internet. Following the lives of thieves and drug addicts in Newark, New Jersey, they were shocking and incredibly candid fly-on-the-wall documentaries. I was given both films in the 1990s on a VHS tape and have returned to them regularly over time, with Life of Crime 2 featuring one of the most haunting final shots I've ever seen in any film. The new production Life of Crime 1984-2020 acts as both a ""greatest hits"" of the first two films and a sequel catching up on the subjects. The first hour is essentially a condensed version of parts 1 & 2, but hardcore fans will still want to watch for the extra footage from those earlier shoots. The second hour catches viewers up on the whereabouts of Freddie, Rob, and Deliris post-1998. Again, it is harrowing peek into the mind of addicts, the cyclical nature of addiction and the ripple effect it has on the addicts' families. It gets very dark and I would warn viewers that one fate is particularly gruesome. Some may argue Alpert's motives, but I feel he always liked this trio and this is a fitting, if tragic, end to their relationship.",False
5,10,Truly Disturbing.,RobTortureWright,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWow. Just Wow.A truly shocking documentary that really opens your eyes to the destructiveness drugs can have on someone's life.From around the five minute mark when I saw a man abuse his girlfriend and slap her around I knew this was going to be a no holds barred, eye opening and VERY dark look at how peoples lives can be utterly destroyed by drugs, but more importantly the poor decisions that they make which leads them to drugs and crime.Life of crime follows three damaged individuals trying to make a living and just plain survive: Rob, Deliris & Freddie, and amazingly it follows them as the title suggests from 1984-2020. That's a dedicated camera man right there.At first it started slow, not the film itself but the gradual downfall of each person, showing Rob and His friend Mike stealing small things like bed sheets and T-shirts and making a quick buck doing so. We get a glimpse and their family life and in all of the cases it's dysfunctional to say the least. As previously mentioned the scene of Robs friend Mike hitting his girlfriend had me pretty stunned, mainly because of the act itself but also because there was a full family in the house just carrying on like nothing was happening. The girl cry's and begs but no one cares. That's scary right there. She talks to the camera man and says she's getting an abortion because not only is she dating a woman beater, shes also pregnant. And to top it all off she's only been dating him for 2 months.The scumbag Mike boasts about how the police will never catch him and then we switch to him in handcuffs crying like the baby he is. He receives a long sentence in prison but we never find out what happened to his abused girlfriend, hopefully he rots in prison while she went on to live a good life.The film continues to show drug use and court cases but At one point it switches to a ""9 months later"" screen and when Rob reappears it looked like he aged 10 years. He was missing teeth, looked gaunt and truly resembled the junkie he was. Scary that only 9 months had passed and his life looked it was heading off a cliff.Deliris is a hooker now selling her body to make a quick buck and Freddy is bouncing in and out (But mainly in) of prison.One thing that hit me was I felt so sorry for the kids, especially deliris's kids, seeing that little girl asking why her mom didn't love her was heartbreaking, but the total lack of care was even worse. Seeing them roaming the streets at 1-2 in the morning, while their mom scores drugs up the street. Seeing them be left alone most of the time to the point of her son being on the edge of the open window and having to be told it's dangerous by the cameraman was just plain depressing to watch. Sometimes it's hard to witness the decisions which caused a situation like this to unfold but in life of crime all of that is told to you like a stone cold slap in the face making you realise how it all ended up so bad.Many years pass and we reach 2000 now and Freddie is saying he's too old to think about things like escaping prison. It doesn't state each persons age but he looks at least 15 years older since the last time we saw him, but that was only in 1994. His body is withering away. It also doesn't help he has HIV and stopped taking his medication because he thought it would give a false positive reading for Marijuana.Deliris is skin and bone, showing her track marks all over from the needles and it's honestly just sad to see. Rob looks like he's doing better but well... he's still locked up.We see some positives as deliris gets clean and Rob gets out of prison and starts working, that's one thing that I took from all this, that the road to the end isn't always a straight decline, it's a bumpy road filled with ups and downs, and a lot of times these 3 people look like normal respectable members of society, but when they fall, they fall hard.Throughout this film I found myself wanting to know more, wanting and wishing them to do well, when ultimately I knew what was going happen.It was heartbreaking to see deliris watch Rob walk down the hallway while she stared at him, high as a kite and weighing about the same as a bag of flour.Cut to a few years later and Freddie has passed away and is laying there, lifeless and yet somehow still with a story to tell. The Robert death is one that truly haunted me, this is something that will give most people nightmares, a badly decomposed body on full display in front of the camera. I don't want to go into too much detail but Rob had either knowingly or unknowingly went out on a last high and his body wasn't found until a LONG time later. His bloated discoloured skin is something that I won't forget in hurry. Really disturbing.In 2019 we see that Deliris has survived and turned her life around, she doesn't weigh 10 pounds anymore and in fact looks well fed and much happier which was nice to see, she spends her days trying to help people get off drugs but 99% of them don't want help or don't last in any ""program"" that they attend. What was shocking to see was a small girl who was appeared at the start now fully grown up and addicted to drugs, toothless and looking higher than a jet. Almost endlessly the cycle seems to continue.Sadly in 2020 Deliris passes away and in what seems like a cruel ending we see the message ""The pandemic shutdown took away deliris's support services. She had been clean for 13 years. Five dollars worth of drugs killed her""
that was pretty hard to take because I hoped someone would make it out and beat this terrible affliction, however this isn't a made up story and so often with life it doesn't always have a nice ending. That's something that most people only realise when their loved ones pass, but we get to see it for better or worse on full display with this documentary.Overall this documentary is absolutely not for someone who's easily upset or disturbed. It exposes how brutal life can be on certain people and how wrong choices can lead to a life of misery and despair. More than that It can feel suffocating at times but I honestly think it's a provocative and very necessary film that shows just how damaging life can punish you and how we all need to continue fighting our demons each and every day but also take the time to appreciate what we have. This film honestly scared me but it also made me appreciate it as a work of art with a powerful message behind it. The commitment to put something like this together is unmatched in anything I've ever seen. Plus congratulations to the cameraman Jon who somehow managed to sleep at night.",True
6,10,HBO at its very best.,killercola,n/a,16/08/2025,"Probably the most incredibly raw, emotional and tough to watch documentary in tv history. It is filmed beginning in 1984 and takes you on a 36 year journey following the lives of three people up until the year 2020. I can't stress enough the importance of this film as a tool to show troubled teens what will happen if they choose a life of crime and drugs. I had to take a moment on several occasions because it was so graphic and troubling. Fair warning: this is not for the meek. Watch at your own discretion but prepare yourself. HBO proving once again why they are still the premier premium service.",False
7,10,Haunting.,CriticsVoiceVideo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very powerful, gritty documentary. God bless all the people involved and their families for allowing their lives to be so graphically captured.

8,10,Shocking,heatherher,n/a,16/08/2025,"This has to be one of the most saddest documentary Iv seen..I never realized so many children grew up the way I did,and have the same exact outcome..watching this brought back so many bad but real life memories..my mom passed away in March from an overdose,so this documentary was pretty much about her life and how she lived it...it's devastating .",False
9,10,Honest representation of dope addiction,gval-28450,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary really hit home and showed the beginning to end struggles of drug addiction. Should be shown to kids in school in order to truly scare them straight away from drugs.,False
10,n/a,Phenomenal Documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,This must watch documentary depicts the life of these people in such a raw and real way.It really helps viewers understand and empathize with the heartbreaking reality of drug addicts.I highly recommend this film.,False
11,7,Sad yet moving,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Life In Crime 1984-2020"" (2021 release; 122 min.) opens, we are told that three residents of Newark, NJ were filmed over the course of 36 years. We then go to ""1984"" and get to know Rob, Freddie and Deloris. Rob and a couple of his friends are stealing from stores left and right, in order to resell the stuff and make a few bucks. Freddie is just out of jail after serving 60 days for possession of cocaine. Deloris is a struggling young mother with a drug habit. Along the way we see Mike, a friend of Rob's, berating and beating his pregnant wife... At this point we are 10 min into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from veteran film maker Jon Alpert. Previously Alpert directed 1989's ""One Year In a Life of Crime"" and 1998's ""Life of Crime 2"". This latest film is in the same vein, but otherwise not related as such to the prior two documentaries. The most amazing thing of course is that this was filmed over a period covering almost 4 decades (besting Richard Linklaters' 2014 film ""Boyhood"", filmed over a mere 11 years, by several decades). This documentary is both sad and moving, Sad because at face value, Rob, Freddie and Deloris are low-lives and losers. Moving because your heart goes out to Rob, Freddie, and Deloris as they fight seemingly impossible odds to pull themselves out of a life of poverty, crime and drug addiction, month after year after decade. It's almost too much to take in, to be honest. One of the most devastating scenes in the film is when Deloris is confronted by one of her kids, a girl maybe 8 or 9 years old, asking Deloris whether she loves her kids (yes, she says), but then why does she keep doing drugs? Watch how Deloris responds... Beware: this movie isn't for the faint of heart. I myself looked away on a number of occasions.""Life of Crime 1984-2020"" recently premiered on HBO and is now available on HBO On Demand and HBO Max (where I caught it). HBO also has said that it plans to reissue the 2 earlier Jon Alpert documentaries, with updates as to what became of the people featured in those films. Meanwhile if you are in the mood for a tough, sad yet moving 'cinéma vérité' documentary about the day-to-day struggles of 3 people in Newark, NJ, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
12,10,Life of Pain and Suffering,jersey-68481,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary depicts what can't be described in words - it's the pain and suffering caused by the life of crime and drug addiction. Jon does an excellent job piecing the stories of Rob, Freddie and Deliris together - with their struggle, triggers that cause them to relapse, and the constant cycle of pain and suffering. I found myself rooting for them as they got clean and fought the good fight. May they all rest easy in paradise.",True
13,5,Lots of unanswered questions,chuckdonaldson-54341,n/a,16/08/2025,"There lots of breaks in the narrative: people you meet in the beginning who just sort of disappear and leave you wondering ""What happened to Bobby?"" or ""Why is this guy in court?"" and ""Why is he doing that?"". The confusion could have been alleviated with some captions.",False
14,10,Another HBO masterpiece...,Carson-Oregon-19449,n/a,16/08/2025,The documentary gives a very dramatic informative insight into the lifestyle of criminals in New Jersey and what they had to do in order to survive. It showed that once you get into a life of crime it is very difficult to get out of it regardless of your once normal life.For someone who wasn't even born in the 80s or 90s; it's fascinating to see what life was like in New Jersey back then.I recommend y'all watch this beautiful time capsule of a docu movie.,False
15,10,In 2021 everyone needs to see this,brett-human,n/a,16/08/2025,This is without a doubt one of rawest and most realist documentaries I've ever seen and I have see a few. In the end it feels personal no matter your views on addiction and it will leave you feeling shocked and helpless. Only HBO can deliver something as emotional as this.,False
16,10,A real gut punch,rooster_davis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched the first two installments of this documentary decades ago. The second installment of those two ended at some date maybe 20 years ago and nothing looked especially promising for the three main subjects. (The 4th one, Mike, was in prison and maybe still is. We didn't find out about him.)Freddie tested positive for HIV and spent years in prison, fortunately kept alive by HIV drugs. Rob also spent years in prison as did Deliris. All three came out clean determined to make a go of things at last and stay off drugs for good.Rob was doing great. He had a job at a drugstore and when it closed they transferred him to another of the company's stores, because he had been a good and reliable worker. But the manager of the new store, upon learning about his past, fired him. He was unable to get a steady job after that. Freddy also had problems getting steady work and staying 'clean', given his family and friends who were all 'using'. He ran into trouble with his finances and life in general and was on the fence about whether he could keep up being clean. Deliris started out strong, then relapsed... she looked like death. Rob however is seen visiting her in one clip, urging her to get clean again.Fast forward... the first thing we see is Freddy in his casket. I wasn't expecting that and caught myself saying 'Oh no...'. He lost his will power and drive to stay clean, and died from drugs. Then we see how Rob also died... on the floor of his small apartment, from an overdose of pure heroin. The police give us a view of his apartment, with blood all over the floor that came out of him after he shot up for the last time. We also get a look at him in the morgue, including his face which is greenish and lifeless. It's obviously him though. Again, so hard to see.Deliris however - she got clean and stayed that way for 13 years! She gained weight and got healthy and began working to help other addicts to get off drugs and get them help. She was even named Newark NJ's 'Citizen of the Year' for her triumph over heroin and her success at life once more. But then... Covid hit. She lost her job and her support group was disbanded over the virus. After three months on her own with no support, she bumped into an old acquaintance who (may they burn in Hell) sold her some heroin. One shot, she overdosed, she was gone.This was so hard to watch. I'm a full grown adult man and the very last scenes put tears in my eyes. We also saw Deliris in her casket and her family and friends grief stricken. For me the worst and most moving moments were seeing her young grandson - who looked just like her own son had at that age - crying at the side of the grave as her casket was lowered. That hit me.I had really hoped that at least one of these people would straighten out and live happily ever after. During the course of the earlier parts of the documentary I got to know them and to a lesser extent some of their family members, and I learned to care about them. They were not bad people. Having such a devastating ending to all three stories was just so very sad. People who think we should legalize drugs and lessen penalties for those who sell them should be made to watch what drugs did to these people, and their families. Whether the drugs are legal or not, they will get you addicted and kill you. Freddy said exactly that, late in the program - 'I don't care how long you been clean, if you ever used before, you're gonna use again.' Sadly he was right in all three of these cases.Rest in peace Freddy, Rob and Deliris. I hope your stories save the lives of some other people.",True

19,8,This was really sad,jaysmoke,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust when you thought there was light at the end of the tunnel....gosh this was a really messed up watch. It started off really crazy, unbelievable, guys having fun, robbing stores and selling them for small change. I thought it was a story about crime but it turned out to be a life of drugs instead. What's chilling about it is that, it's a true story and these things happened to them in real life. So sad.",True
20,9,A powerful conclusion,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the final film in a trilogy of documentaries that was made over several decades. It follows three main people as they engage in small-scale crime, become addicted to drugs, do some prison time, break the cycle, relapse, and on and on in a distressing and depressing cycle.As the title implies, events play out between 1984 and 2020, but the structure does warrant a disclaimer. The years between 1984 and 1998 were detailed in the first two Life of Crime films, which means that the first hour of this third film contains tons of footage that people who've watched the first two movies will have already seen.I hadn't watched the first one in years, so I appreciated the 1980s years getting recapped, but I zoned out a little during the 1990s scenes, because I'd seen it all just hours beforehand. Because the first hour is a good recap, it might be worth just watching this final film for anyone interested in the series. Or for anyone who really doesn't want to miss anything, watch parts 1 and 2 (about three hours in total) and then skip the first hour of this two-hour documentary.There's another disclaimer when it comes to watching this documentary: it's extremely confronting. The first two were tough to watch, but the scenes of drug use in this one were more graphic, and there's one very gruesome scene towards the end that's a difficult sight to comprehend. It's not there just for shock's sake, and serves a purpose, but it's very disturbing.In covering so many years and showing all the cycles the subjects go through, this is definitely the most emotional of the bunch. I was willing to go easy on the recap-heavy first hour because of how brutally effective and well-made that second hour was, and how it made for such a strong ending.All in all, these three films might be some of the best documentaries about crime, addiction, and the problems with many US institutions out there. It's hard but important viewing, and I don't think I'll forget it soon (even the comparatively less distressing first film stuck with me, and it's been about five years since I saw that one).",False

When Rob had an addict living with him, doing drugs in front of him; I just knew he'd succumb to temptation..Poor Deliris, just when we think she rounded the corner.

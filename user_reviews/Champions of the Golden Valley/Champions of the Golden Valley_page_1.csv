1,9,"Well made, insightful film with bittersweet insights into what migh thave been",tw1898,n/a,16/08/2025,"We saw it as part of the Tribeca Film Festival -- very enjoyable but also sad, joyful but bittersweet. Highly recommended. It puts faces to the trauma that has been the ongoing history of Afghanistan the last many decades.For those who live in areas that house refugees, the film gives you insights into what these newcomers might have been facing in their native countries -- and hopefully makes you feel more welcoming, patient and kind toward those displaced through no real fault of their own.It also gives me, a sometime skier, a better appreciation for the sport -- the joy that even the simplest equipment and techniques can bring.",False
2,10,"A film about shared humanity, friendship, loss and grief, and skiing",rastrellipaul,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film completely blew me away.It follows skiers from the Bamyan region of Afghanistan during the years 2019-2022. It shows how shared goals and the joy of sports can unite communities and how these pursuits extend far beyond just winning. The themes of this film are universally applicable and very salient today.After watching this film, I'm inspired to get to know my neighbors better, support refugees in my community, and adopt curiosity when meeting new people and people who are different than me.This isn't a political film. It's a film about our shared humanity as citizens of the globe. I cannot recommend it enough!",False
3,10,Shows the joy of skiing while giving an intimate portrait of those whose stories haven't been told,samsidiqi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Champions covers a lot of ground. It is fundamentally a ski movie about a competition, but it is also a refugee story, a history of a valley, and an intimate portrait of individuals struggling with their lot in life. It is impressive how well the film covers all of these in a cohesive whole in its 80-minute run time.As a skier, I love how it captures the joy of skiing. It helps me realize how lucky I am to have the opportunities I have, when these poor shepherds can enjoy skiing without winter clothes on wooden skis they make themselves.As an Afghan citizen, I appreciate that the director respected his subjects and helped them tell their true story without pushing his own US agenda.As a human, I appreciate that this story focuses on our joint humanity.It's a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend it.",False
4,10,An Absolute Must!,sarajgottstein,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a truly important film to watch. It addresses some of the most important humanitarian issues in our world, while simultaneously weaving together an incredible story of an Afghan ski club. The cinematic experience is beautiful. The film captures heart warming stories of men and women in Afghanistan that learn and love to ski. It importantly addresses the collapse of Afghanistan and the impact on the millions of people who both left and were able to seek refuge elsewhere. You will undoubtedly laugh and cry, and feel passionate all at the same time. 10/10 and brilliantly done! Incredibly important film to watch and support!",False
5,10,A Story the World Needs,sidetrips,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerChampions of the Golden Valley is a film that feels both heartbreakingly timely and enduringly hopeful. It's rare to find a documentary that captures so much emotion without ever feeling forced - yet here, every moment rings true.The story follows a group of young Afghan skiers, racing down the snowy hills of Bamyan Province with handmade skis, fueled by pure joy and community pride. It's impossible not to be moved by their spirit. At a time when headlines are filled with division and despair, Champions reminds us of the strength people carry inside them, even when the world around them falls apart.The cinematography is breathtaking - wide, sweeping shots of rugged mountains and stark winter landscapes that feel both beautiful and brutal. Every frame feels purposeful, inviting the viewer into a world few have seen firsthand. The direction is thoughtful and restrained, allowing the athletes' personalities and dreams to shine without ever feeling exploitative or heavy-handed.Watching this film is a journey: inspiring in the determination of the athletes, saddening as the realities of their country's future become clear, and ultimately joyful in the resilience they refuse to surrender. It's a story of triumph that doesn't pretend the hardships aren't real - it simply shows that hope is stronger.Champions of the Golden Valley is an extraordinary story, beautifully told. It left me feeling humbled, uplifted, and more connected to the world beyond my own doorstep. It's exactly the kind of film we need right now.Seeing it with the director and producer in the room, knowing they played a direct role in helping many of the film's subjects find safety after the fall of Afghanistan, made the experience even more meaningful. Their commitment off-screen matches the heart they captured on-screen. No wonder it has won so many awards. I look forward to sharing it with our audience and seeing the hope it sparks, even in the hardest times.",True
6,10,"Heartfelt, Moving, and Impactful",oysterlevi,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was an incredible feat of storytelling, blending culture, sport, and conflict in a perfect way that brought you into the Afghanistan with compassion. It made you feel years of joy as you watched kids build skis out of wood and scraps of plastic and then to watch them laugh as the shredded down the mountain. But it also broke your heart when you realize how fragile life in a warzone is. The bridging of tribal tensions through sport was an achievement, it portrays a great rivalry that only the outdoors can heal. The representation of women and girls doing something as radical as skiing in Afghanistan swelled your heart. Highly recommend!",False
7,10,Must watch for everyone!,as-81569,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is incredible in both its cinematography and visual story telling, as well as all of the individual stories within this film. It made me laugh, cry, and gave me chills. This is truly a powerful story that I would recommend to any adult.I am writing this review after my second time seeing it. This is a movie you could continue to watch over and over and still see different parts of it come through every time. In my opinion, that is truly a testament of how remarkable this movie is.The heart and soul of this movie truly comes through as everyone involved with this film has been so deeply connected to one another.",False
8,10,Uplifting and Heartbreaking,fisherc-26432,n/a,16/08/2025,"Champions of the Golden Valley is bittersweet. On one hand, you witness moments of elation, shown through the Afghan Ski Challenge. On the other hand, you see the crushing effect that the Taliban has on Afghanistan and its people. I showed this film to my Grade 8 class and it is an excellent introduction to the realities that Afghanistan has and is facing, and what the Taliban is.The film also presents rivalry (both physical and religious) and how sport can be used to bridge gaps between people and genders.The film is slightly long, so if shown to younger viewers, it would be a good idea to break it up into two separate viewings.",False
9,10,Bring your tissues!!!!,jessiemac-89744,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me start by saying, I'm not a fan of documentaries or subtitles. That being said, I absolutely loved this movie. I quickly forgot it was a documentary or that I was even reading subtitles. It was a heart wrenching, beautiful, emotional experience. It was a privilege to connect and experience a culture so different than mine and was even more poignant with the current political shift in our country at the moment. This movie highlighted a universal connection and told the stories of brave champions that I otherwise never would have heard of. In such a short time, I experienced hope, pride, love, nervousness, joy, fear, sadness, and rage. I cheered for people that I will never know and for a moment was able to share into a feeling of universal connectedness. I highly recommend this movie to everyone!!!!",False
10,10,Life changing.,nicholasancelin,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film opens up the heart, mind, and soul to the realities of life for our brothers and sisters in Afghanistan - and does so through the lens of a beloved past time, skiing.This film is not only emotionally powerful, but beautifully made. The story told here dances with brilliant usages of lighting, music, personal testimony, and human expressions.I am eternally grateful for the opportunity to have seen this film twice now in person. I hope and pray that the film industry embraces this film and grants the general public the privilege of sharing this cinematic experience of human expression and world unity.",False

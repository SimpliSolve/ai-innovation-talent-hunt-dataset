1,7,art with purpose,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Over the years, I've managed to maintain zero artistic ability, and yet my admiration and respect for artists has continued to grow. It's quite likely you've never heard of Geoff McFetridge, and equally likely that no one you know has either. Leave it to commercial director and artist Dan Covert to recognize that a fellow artist's story is worth telling.With interviews from film directors Spike Jonze (also an Executive Producer) and Sofia Coppola, and photographer Andrew Paynter, we get a real sense for the admiration McFetridge draws from other artists. His wife Sarah also gives us her perspective on her husband as an artist, father, and partner, and yet we find Geoff's own introspection to be the most descriptive and informative. This is a man who doesn't shy away from self-analysis ... which makes sense given his personal mission.For an artist as prolific as McFetridge, it's not surprising to learn that his childhood habit of ""drawing all the time"" has followed him into adulthood. It's really more of an obsession than a habit, and he's managed to turn it into a profession. Born in Canada, he made the decision to enroll at the California Institute of Arts, and now can be described as melding art with commerce. His work has adorned ads and products for such companies as Nike, Apple, and Pepsi (among many others).Surprisingly, it's not his brilliant design work that is most interesting. Rather it's Geoff's constant pursuit of meaning in everything he does - in art, while running ultra-marathons, and in being a husband and father to two daughters. This is a man who pushes himself constantly. Down time is not part of his plan. He used art as a way out and way to have control as he searched for his place. He always had the colors and form (geometry on acid), and his wife Sarah is the one who instilled emotion into his work.McFetridge is highly respected by other graphic artists, while remaining virtually unknown to the general public. His greatest gift is not a steady hand, but rather an innovate mind tied to a tireless work ethic. It seems strange to say, but he's inspirational in the way he seeks meaning - giving us the desire as well. On the surface, one would expect a biopic on an under-the-radar graphic artist to be a short film, but director Covert understood that a full 80 minutes would better serve the audience. He was right.In NYC theaters on June 21, 2024 and VOD via Gravitas beginning July 2, 2024.",False

1,9,A wonderful documentary about a wonderful mind.,alfiebclark,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOnly until recently have I really been 'back into' professional wrestling, but I always came back and watched around April, and other dates if it interested me.Bray Wyatt, or Windham Rotunda always interested me, and learning of his passing a few months ago gut-wrenching.An amazing mind, gone far too soon.This documentary covers his whole life, and whole professional wrestling career.The worst thing I wanted was to come into the documentary, and see WWE make it about themselves, rather than the life of Windham.Fortunately this was not the case, most of the interviews you see are with the family of Rotunda, with some wrestlers included.The documentary, and the WWE acknowledge their mistakes with their creative, going into detail about Windham's first character given to him, Husky Harris.It's an incredible documentary, and doesn't seem to miss any corner covering the life of Windham, and there was likely not better choice to do the narration than Mark Callaway, better known as his character, The Undertaker, who is usually referenced in conversations about the character of Bray Wyatt.The last thirty minutes of this documentary are absolutely heartbreaking, yet turn to hope, as his creativity and influence on those around him will never go away.My only complaint is a rather jarring cut to a teaser at the end, somewhat cutting off the final image, with Windham's name, 1987-2023.Nonetheless, if you're a fan of Bray Wyatt, or just the WWE, I wholeheartedly recommend this documentary.",True
2,10,Yes!,jmjones-34107,n/a,16/08/2025,"So amazing. I could not have asked as a fan to receive anything better. I finally feel like I got my closure. Everything that was said and shown was just again, amazing. As someone as close to him in size and age I was like many others and drew so much of my own self esteem from him and the will to be myself it's truly no wonder why he was an idol in so many lives. From Husky Harris to Bray Wyatt himself we got to figure out our own characters. Everything he did left you wanting more and wondering what's next. He was truly one of one and it's incredible to see just how great of a man he truly was. All I can say is Thank You Windham and his entire family. Thank you to everyone who willingly say down to give us this great insight into his life and a bit of closure.",False
3,10,Just wow....,notoriousvic-44206,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have often wondered what if Bray Wyatt had been in a WWE that had no Vincent McMahon Jr. Watching this special makes me hate we lost him so soon. What could have happened if he hadn't gotten sick & what could he have done.This is a great special, gives you a look at some of those who are avid wrestlers haven't seen. The infancy of Bray Wyatt & the family. He was never the greatest in ring worker, he was never a ""Dave Meltzer favorite"", but he connected like no one else has ever done.I wanted Wyatt to stay as the cult leader, but evolution of the character is wrestling, and I hate Vince/Dunn/Johnny Ace/Prichard watered that character down & ruined it.Anyway, the what if are amazing, but don't touch what was..",False
4,10,Beautiful Tribute,aaronsweeneyrebornagain,n/a,16/08/2025,Seriously well done to WWE and peacock for producing this documentary it gave us an inside the mind of the legendary bray Wyatt it's sad we lost this genuine good person who had a genius mind for the business he lives on in his 4 incredible kids he will be remembered forever his work will live on in his brother.So yes I definitely recommend this a good watch for the fans on bray it's sad and heartbreaking it looks at his life and shows how good of a HUSBAND SON BROTHER FATHER FRIEND HUMAN he was rip bray you're sadly missed and I know bo will do you proud by continuing your storyLet him in.,False
5,10,Absolute Treasure.,jamesheindl-04217,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a very well done documentary about a Special Human who has the ability to touch people around the world. I hope everybody gets an opputunity to watch this and I will say bring the tissues because I am still very choked up. Mark Calaway aka Undertaker does a magnificent job as well as Bo his brother. I am one soul that he touched recently and can say Thank you Bray Thank you Wyndum and I will always let him in! I do not want to say much more as it will just be giving up spoilers. But this is very close to the heart and will also show different sides to him including the incredible legecy he left behind with the Family he created. I wish that I was half the man he was and Still cannot believe he was taken so soon before he was able to finish his story.,False
6,10,Grab Your Tissue's,papamuntz,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful tribute to one of the most brilliant minds to ever lace up a pair boots and enter the squared circle. Hearing his family speak about him and what kind of man he was outside of the ring, is the most captivating part of of this documentary. With plenty of never before seen footage and accounts from current and past WWE personal. This documentary really seems to capture who he was and what he means to everyone around him still. Its a great peek behind the scenes of his mind and creativity. The Undertaker does a great job at narrating this documentary. I couldn't see anybody doing it other than his brother Taylor (Bo Dallas). If you are a fan of Bray Wyatt or his work, this is a MUST watch.",False

1,4,"Please skip this, even if you are from Winnipeg",EndeavoursGirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I swear it seems like Steve paid these people to make this ""doc"". It swings massively from a normal doc (interviews are going well, look great, smart people), to completely off the wall... a talking bison that's sarcastic? Steve re-enacting his own crimes? In the hotel and outside of the bank? THEY INTERVIEW THE COP???I remember seeing him on CTV in the 90s, he was memorable and funny, hence why I wanted to see this... but I, like other reviews I've seen, turned it off half way with no desire to turn it back on.It feels like a self-indulged bio-pic. It's boring, and it's styling is all over the place.Would not recommend. Please watch anything else about Winnipeg.",False
2,6,A fairly well told story.,tbugera,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm from the ""Peg. Not much of a TV watcher - definetly not Sports. I had a vague recollection of Steve as a sprortscaster - definetly never heard of his theiving capers. (what else can you call it-:)It was fun to see scenes from Wpg. This show told his story in a fun way. He is clever in a kind of dumb dumb nieve sort of way - who appeared to want to get caught. (cuz no one is that thick) I think it was kind of interesting that he chose to work with the film maker (whatever his reasons may be)Over all it was a great way to tell a story - after all that's what it's all about.Is his Ex like 99 years old - OMG the colour and style of the sofa should be grenaded out of it's misery as it reads sooo 1950sWhen I first saw the title et al I briefly thought it was the story of the Jogger in Wpg who robbed banks - wrong-oh...Could have been 1/2 hour shorter - for sure!!! Thankfully they didn't stretch it into a Mini Series as is the trend these days.",False
3,3,Look at me syndrome,edithnagel-59428,n/a,16/08/2025,"The main character of the movie is Steve He is a classic narsacist who only cares about himself and come across as desperate for attention and to remain relevant.The film adds little to the original story and unless you like listening to Steve drone on and on, it is repetitive and boring.If he was a more likeable person it would be a much better ride. But again, this guy is so unlikeable and the directors do nothing to really press him on all the terrible decisions he made nor does it hold him to account for the victims.I wouldn't recommend this at all. I'd rather spend time watching something that is entertaining and enjoyable.... This is neither.",False
4,3,At least there's a talking bison,MadValkyrie,n/a,16/08/2025,"When you first hear Will Arnett voicing the bison narrator, you wonder what the hell have you started watching. But as the documentary continues, you are grateful for at least that level of entertainment.For any Winnipegger who was around when this story broke, you kind of hope that you'll get some new information tied in with some jokes about their hometown. Instead, what you get is one of the oddest re-creation sequences you'll ever watch. While most criminals will simply recount their crimes over actors re-enacting, Vogelsang not only does it himself but does it in an odd, fourth wall breaking style.Whatever the filmmakers intended for this documentary, it turns into Vogelsang simply basking in the attention and self aggrandizing every aspect of his past. Not only did I feel that while watching, interviewees within the documentary assumed that too without having seen the final product.To come full circle, the only remotely entertaining part of this whole film is a talking bison voiced by Will Arnett. Just skip this doc.",False
5,3,Winning in Winnipeg,brownpianolover2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't give this man one more second of airtime. This documentary, made by one of Steve's former friends, does the one thing Steve Vogelsang desperately needed and that was to feel important by being back in front of the camera.At times, I'm not sure if this documentary is meant to be tongue-in-cheek or is just bad. There is zero deep level insight into why he robbed banks with the only explanation being he needed money. Steve shows Zero remorse for the things he did to his victims or wife. He seems incapable of recognizing his problematic behaviour and uses it as a form of excuse and celebration. He's the definition of a narcissist.",False
6,3,Disappointing,KaGillianaire,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping for a documentary that was fun, but still went into the how's, why's, etc but it very much felt like a way to remind everyone he's (Steve) still here and desperate for attention.He had opportunities to show remorse for how he affected the victims but he always turned it around and made it about him.The only thing this movie has going for it is the talking Will Arnett bison and the interviewed folks who, I felt, gave a better description of who this man actually was/is.I've watched it, and am happy to go on not knowing who this man is.I recommend not watching this. Don't give him the satisfaction.",False
7,3,Even Winnipeggers will be bored,cabermcjock,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having lived the majority of my life (so far) in Winnipeg I'm automatically drawn to anything about the place. Winnipeg is one of those cities that one does not have mid feelings about, people typically love it or hate it.This documentary is similar. If you've read the other reviews here, they're all pretty accurate. It feels only like a vehicle to put Vogelsang even slightly back in the spotlight.I feel like they wanted to be lighthearted about the overall story, but it mostly comes off as snide. If I'm supposed to feel sympathetic for Steve, then he should have been presented in a more sympathetic fashion. Any attempts by him to express remorse for his crimes and the legitimate fear and trauma he caused people are unconvincing and forced. Referring to himself as being in ""the depths of despair"" is probably not a lie but sounds like it's just a line he's reading off a teleprompter.Will Arnett as the narrator/spirit bison is just an odd choice; nothing about this feels spiritual in any way.The reminiscence of the 90's was enjoyable but I'm a nostalgic person to begin with and the 90's were fun.Full disclosure like many others I did not watch the whole thing and I'm very unlikely to ever do so.",False

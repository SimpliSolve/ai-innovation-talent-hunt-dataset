1,8,A story of independence and growing up,severajaaho,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSet in a small village by a lake in Mexico, Cosas Que No Hacemos is a story centered around Noon, a boy on the brink of his adulthood. His sexual identity differs from the hetero-normative discourse, which he unable to express directly due to strong cultural repression. This creates the underlying tension throughout the film, along with his need to find his own independence from his family. The film touches broader social themes, including poverty and violence and much of it is viewed from the perspective of children. This is done with careful camera angles and a method where the role of the camera in the context is faded out in relevant scenes. The setting and the colours that blend into the background of blue sky and yellow sand along with scenes of night time with neon lights create a distinct and memorable experience.",True

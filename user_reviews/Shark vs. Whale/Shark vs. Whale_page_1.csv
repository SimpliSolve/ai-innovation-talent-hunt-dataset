1,1,Spoiler,mommaisabelle,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI love nature shows with whales and sharks. However, this made me so angry. It wasn't shark VS whale. It was whale tangled in fishing line and these people just watched it get ripped to shreds because it couldn't get out. I agree not to interfere with nature... But this wasn't nature. This was humans polluting the ocean and a whale was killed because of it. Whomever filmed this should be ashamed and have charges put against them. ðŸ˜¡",True

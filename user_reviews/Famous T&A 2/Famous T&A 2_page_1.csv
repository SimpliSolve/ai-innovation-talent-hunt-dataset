1,7,Only took forty years for a sequel!,DarylJGittings,n/a,16/08/2025,"Forty Years after the original ""Famous T and A"" movie Full Moon released a sequel. This time Diana Prince hosts a collection of sexy movie clips featuring many well known ladies of the B-Horror scene. Some of these clips will come from movies that are familiar and some will be from unfamiliar films. Many of the films under owned by Full Moon Features, but a few are not.Some of the actresses featured are: Linnea Quigley (Return of the Living Dead, Night of the Demons), Tanya Roberts (The Beastmaster, Night Eyes), Sherilyn Fenn (Two Moon Junction, Just One of the Guys), Barbara Crampton (Re-Animator, From Beyond) and more.A few of the films featured are: Tourist Trap, Meridian, and Fairy Tales.Diana Prince does a fine job as our host. She takes what films the scenes are from, making it easy if you wish to view them. This is a fun film for fans of Full Moon Features. The DVD runs about 90 minutes and features a few minutes of behind the scenes footage as well as about a half dozen trailers.Grab a Coke and some Popcorn and settle in on the couch for some good entertainment.",False
2,3,Welcome to the Clipshow,refinedsugar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I haven't seen 'Famous T&A' yet, but also don't think it matters a great deal here. The sequel '2' is still a whimsical look at female nudity via b-movies updated to present day with the idea this element improves a film or is the best part(s). If you crave nostalgia you'll find pieces of joy, but it's hardly killer stuff and well versed in self promotion.Host Diana Prince takes us through a presentation that flows well yet dare I say low energy. Intro has the right vibe as the original title is talked about then early examples of T&A for a lite history lesson. Her further narration has details on the titles, but the whole thing comes with a catch. These are not the best nor most ""famous"" pieces of T&A to be found. It's Full Moon Entertainment mostly shamelessly plugging their own releases.As one versed in T&A pics and the women within, I was bound to find material I was already familiar with. Issue is when you combine old hat with stuff that is new but hardly hot you quickly find yourself growing bored. Sometimes a disconnected scene gets shown in whole and we're not talking about for nudity sake either. Nice way to pad runtime. You might also like to know that host Diane is shown with her boobs pushed up in a tight dress throughout, but you never get to see those puppies.I didn't find much to get excited about with 'Famous T&A 2' and its not like I'm the wrong audience. Chalk it up to the limitations of this format or their choice of b-movies. Pandering, advertising for Full Moon strikes once more in the last fifteen minutes as the films of Surrender Cinema (owned by Full Moon) get highlighted. Skip it.",False

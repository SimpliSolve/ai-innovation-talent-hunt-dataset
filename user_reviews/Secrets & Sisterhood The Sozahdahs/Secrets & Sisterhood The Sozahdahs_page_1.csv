1,5,IT'S OKAY,kingstonjayne,n/a,16/08/2025,"Show is okay, felt like some of the drama are forced to keep the audience engaged like the Sonoma trip they had, Shakur's out bursts were out of the blue and talking all big for now reason ""yall started, I ended "" like what??? I'm so lost, your 30+ lady come on now. Genuine love and interact among each sisters and less talk about the show because it's killing the vib. Yes, its normal to have family drama, especially a big one, however, some of the drama is so annyoing and doesn't make sense, the talk to each other like strangers. I come from 7 sisters and it doesn't matter who makes the most money or who contribute the most to the family we all know our role, the oldest will be the oldest and the youngest is the youngest. Hamid you need to have a therapy session with Shakura.",False
2,2,Shallow and disrespectful to culture/religion,gisellamannino,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love reality TV, I watch almost all of them! I was excited to watch this one because it is different! I have never heard of Muslim American and thought maybe they still practice their religion, culture and values but not as strict as they do in their Country. Well, I am appalled at how they dress around their ""strict"" Mom, the way they speak, the way they pick and choose what part of the religion they will follow and what part they will not. Now I am for being your authentic self, but they seem to be afraid of their Mother, yet continue the behavior that Mom would not approve! They talk about sisterhood, Wolf Pack but they attack each other every chance they get!",True
3,1,"Troubling Cultural Appropriation and Misrepresentation of Afghan Culture and Islam in ""The Sozahdahs""",habibanwar-58759,n/a,16/08/2025,"First and foremost, the cultural appropriation present in this TV show is highly distressing. The creators have taken elements of Afghan culture, without truly understanding or respecting their historical and cultural significance. These elements are superficially incorporated into the narrative without any meaningful context, reducing them to mere aesthetics for the sake of entertainment value. Such disregard for cultural sensitivity is not only disrespectful but perpetuates harmful stereotypes, contributing to a culture of exploitation.Furthermore, ""Secrets & Sisterhood: The Sozahdahs"" presents a gross misrepresentation of Islam. The portrayal of Islamic beliefs, practices, and values is woefully inaccurate and superficial. It is evident that the creators have not taken the time to understand the complexities of the religion, instead relying on clich√©s and stereotypes to drive the plot. This kind of misrepresentation perpetuates ignorance and prejudice, fueling misunderstandings about Islam and reinforcing harmful biases.The most troubling aspect of this TV show is the underlying motivation behind its production-to garner an online audience at any cost. The creators seem willing to sacrifice authenticity, respect, and accuracy to capitalize on the popularity of Afghan culture and Islam. This approach is not only morally bankrupt but also contributes to the harmful cycle of cultural appropriation and misrepresentation that is all too prevalent in the media industry.In conclusion, ""Secrets & Sisterhood: The Sozahdahs"" is a deeply disappointing TV show that engages in troubling cultural appropriation and misrepresentation. It is evident that the creators prioritize online popularity over the respectful and accurate representation of Afghan culture and Islam. As an audience, we should not support such exploitative practices. Let us instead demand and support media that celebrates diversity, fosters understanding, and promotes authentic representation, rather than perpetuating harmful stereotypes and disrespecting cultures.",False
4,10,Don't just rely on the low ratings; it isn't the full picture.,whhpcb,n/a,16/08/2025,"A quick note:
Most of the reviews which have lower ratings come from Muslims who may not be seeing this for what it is: a portrayal of how religion and culture can be so conflicting in a modern environment. These sisters are not tainting a religion or Afghan culture, and I'm saying this as a Muslim myself.Each of us are entitled to our own opinions and truths, but rating this show purely on how well these sisters fit your idea of religion and culture is not helpful for anyone wanting to find out if this show is worth watching or not, from an entertainment perspective.Now for the actual show itself:
The struggles these sisters go through are all too real; made especially hard growing up Muslim. Dealing with topics like sexual curiosity; pregnancies out of wedlock; drinking, all of which are taboo given their upbringing.There are so many personalities, as you may expect from being a family of 10 sisters, and seeing them navigate and understand each other is insightful yet very entertaining. You get to see glimpses of their upbringing from their Afghani mother, without their father who tragically passed away years before. Some sisters are immigrants to the U. S., whilst others were born there. Some are conservative, some are in between, while others are liberal. This diversity is what makes this show interesting!The show is gripping and a nice departure from the typical families you might be familiar with in reality TV.This offers something new and fresh and I hope they continue to develop and showcase this!",False
5,1,Total mockery the Afghan / Muslim culture,beast-65542,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is a total disgrace to the Afghan Muslim culture. As an afghan American, I am ashamed they went this far to a little bit of fame. They made a mockery of our culture and religion. This is not true afghan culture. We hold our culture strong. I like how the sisters use phrases like ""you would get stoned back home."" Yet, they do all the things that are banned and forbidden in the our culture and religion. They go above
and beyond to be like the Kardashians, but all they are a bunch of hypocrites. Shame on you for using our culture and religion to your benefit. Please do not watch this show and expect to know true afghan Muslim culture.",False
6,10,Loved this show!,leopgexpress,n/a,16/08/2025,I loved this show on so many different levels. I was definitely reeled in as I wanted to learn more about each of them. It's amazing to see how they all have such very unique experiences even though they grew up under the same roof. It's definitely a roller coaster ride of emotions so I had to binge to see how it all played out. I watched this whole reality series in one day ! Literally. Was crying and laughing and had everyone in the room feeling the same way. I recommend this show because it's so raw and real and authentic. The balance with culture and religion. The respects and love that we don't see now days. Wow ! Love it.,False
7,1,A disgrace to our values,zcijfbrvx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Personal Review: ""Sozadah's"" - Disappointing Portrayal of Afghan Culture, Missed Opportunity.As an Afghan, I was excited about ""Sozadah's"" to understand my culture better. However, it fell short. The show perpetuated negative stereotypes, lacked authenticity, and exploited Afghan culture for sensationalism. It disappoints and undermines the complexities of Afghan heritage. Media should responsibly represent diverse cultures, and ""Sozadah's"" missed that chance. The show's portrayal of Afghan culture was insensitive and failed to capture its true essence, perpetuating misconceptions and disrespecting Afghan people. It missed an opportunity to promote understanding and appreciation and instead focused on self-perception of western-driven, matrix-controlled nonsense.",False
8,10,Yayyy!!,lyovik-38516,n/a,16/08/2025,Finally!!!! A relatable fun and real and raw new tv series. All these beautiful sisters that show us their lives with career and love and family are so brave for sharing it with this world. There are so many that can't accept but we all are experiencing or have already gone through one of these problems that they have showed to the world to see. I recommend everyone give this show a chance and watch it because it is so worth it. I literally spent the whole day binging this show with all of my family and my friends. We all laughed and cried together. Loved the unity loyalty and respect that they all have for each other.,False
9,1,Dollar Tree Kardashians,malalamaiwandi,n/a,16/08/2025,"These 'Dollar Tree Kardashians' cannot adequately represent our culture and religion. What do they really know about our cultural and religious values? They seem more interested in fame than in accurately portraying who we are.We would have preferred to watch them as Americans, without our sacred ""AFGHAN"" name associated with it.It's disappointing that Hollywood and the West always choose such representations for us. We are well aware of this, and even these the 'DT Kardashians,' understand it too.A true Afghan American embraces American culture while preserving our own honorable culture and values.",False
10,1,thats obviously a show to display as if its 'normal' in 'islam',aminoop,n/a,16/08/2025,"What u see there is a show to let u think how muslims in america should live, or make it as if its normal to wear such promiscuous disgusting type of clothes or drink what was forbidden or doing things such getting pregnant outside of marriage when one of the top forbidden things in Islam. Whats wrong with people, if u hate islam and want to portray it to ppl then atleast make what islam says to the letter. What they show in this show is an absolute disgusting way to view it to people on how they brainwash young girls (especially muslims) to think what they are doing is normal. Just Depravity.",False
11,1,"Absolutely wrong and degenerate, it creates a false image of Islam",kawishjagroep,n/a,16/08/2025,"This creates a false image of Islam. And there is no such thing as conservative Muslims. You are a Muslim or you are not a Muslim, simple as that. This show is an attack on the Islamic believe with its liberal fantasies. And people are buying it, suit yourself you know what the Quran says. Or you never believed.It's portraits Muslims and Islam in a bad daylight. In the show the sisters are drinking, dressing sexy, promiscuous sex and on top of that she is pregnant and probably not even married. All of this in forbidden in Islam!It's in the Quran that's it's forbidden!So you tell me are they Muslim? A Muslim believes in the Quran, then how can you do absolutely the opposite of what the Quran says?But if they do not respond to you - then know that they only follow their own desires. And who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people."" Quran 28:50This show encourages other so called liberal Muslims to fall in this trap and also start this degeneracy. It's absolutely disgusting that other Muslims make reviews that they support this and are doing the same thing. This show is an attack on the Islamic believe. They portray absolutely nothing of the Islamic believe.""And of the people are some who say, 'We believe in Allah and the Last Day,' but they are not believers. They think to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive it not."" Quran 2:8-9.",False
12,10,"Diverse, Engaging, Relatable, Finally Reality TV Gets It Right!",jodiedwards-22678,n/a,16/08/2025,"A show like Secrets & Sisterhood: The Sozahdahs has been long overdue. Diversity of thought, religion, culture and sensuality will be hard for small minds to grasp. Shakur, your vision brought this to life and we need more people in the world like you who are willing to pull back the curtain on topics like the ones covered in this show. The creative direction towards a soft introduction to starting a conversation that many shy away from was noted and appreciated!That to me is what reality tv should be, truth is many of us are and have experienced scrutiny, judgement, disappointment, rejection, happiness, love, fear, and second chances. The realness during the interviews paired with strategic storytelling for the plot was tasteful. It's hard sharing family moments, secrets and even wins with the world, especially the internet. Nothing felt exploited just for the views. As a Creative Director I notice those things and it really set a strong backbone for this show. Kudos to the team!I can't wait for season 2,3,4,5,6+. I see so much more waiting to be told, like being able to see the sisters blossom (even more) and step fully into their perspective roles as thought leaders mixed with their unique style. As they continue to inspire the world with their individual passions, beliefs and talent I know many will come to see SSTS as more than just a show but an invitation to unapologetically be yourself in a world that's constantly telling you who you should be.Blessings to the talent, production crew, family & supporters. Let's lift them up, there's an opportunity for us to amplify whats just getting started here.Much love,
Jodi-Kay Edwards.",False
13,1,"Highly offensive. Missed opportunity. Horrible ""acting"".",laylaverone,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was excited to see a show were Muslim women act modern and not super conservation. I am an American who reverted to Islam late in life and there are so many struggles and beauty in this lifestyle that could be shown.What I found was a vulgar, heartless, cheap, and offensive depiction of Muslim-American women as well as Afghan culture.To a westerner who is not educated about Muslim, Persian, Afghani, or Middle Eastern culture the show may seem innocent. To anyone who is aware it is clear that this is an intentional attack on Muslim women.By creating this show these women have shamed and disrespected their mother and late father. The mother is clearly not informed about what kind of content is being shared and edited in when she is not around. That is very obvious. She is not consenting and looks like was manipulated to participate in a show that absolutely disgraces her faith, culture, family, and community.Hopefully there will be legal consequences for their actions. Its not right.Aside from the absolute atrocities in every scene, the show itself is boring and tasteless. They could have made a beautiful production! What a waste.This show broke my heart and made my soul feel what can only be described as ""ick"".",False
14,10,Just wow,jjcavari,n/a,16/08/2025,"The unbreakable bond between the sisters becomes a focal point, highlighting their resilience, love, and unwavering spirit. This portrayal serves as a testament to the strength and depth of their connection, providing viewers with a glimpse into their personal lives and love lives as well as their careers. They are all smart and educated women that are so kind and true and just so real. Everything is so real. I can relate to all their stories on so many different levels. I think that many people can relate to at least one of the many beautiful sisters. I will definitely be waiting for another season. I hope that it comes out soon.",False
15,n/a,So impressed and humbled by this show!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show was phenomenal. It took me on a ride. Laughter, tears, sadness, excitement, gut wrenching, euphoria, happiness and overall made me feel so good. I found myself so invested in this family and I genuinely want to see them all win together as a family and individually. I for one am a huge fan now and champion this wonderful family. I wish there was more programming and shows like this that display their heart and soul like they did. So real and so raw. This show taught me a lot as well. My takeaway from watching these women is love and sisterhood and how hard they fight for their love and bond. I'm really impressed Hulu is giving platforms to diverse groups and allowing them to tell their stories so authentically. Great job Hulu!",False
16,1,A Shallow Reality TV Disaster,scykfhgm,n/a,16/08/2025,"A disgusting and repugnant reality show that shamelessly mimics the Kardashian family's style and format. The characters lack any originality, indulging in self-promotion, materialism, and superficial drama. The show's manufactured conflicts and shallow values make it detestable, with no substance or genuine emotion. This cheap knockoff lacks originality and fails to provide any meaningful entertainment. Stay away from this hollow attempt at copying the Kardashians. Save yourself the agony and stay far away from this disgusting and hollow attempt at entertainment. It was one of the most disgusting and repugnant displays of unoriginality I have ever witnessed.",False
17,10,Yesssss,hamletanderik,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Secrets and Sisterhood"" is seriously an amazing TV show that totally rocks! It's all about these ten Afghan American Muslim sisters, They are navigating through their lives. Love loves and careers. They try to balance culture religion and everything else. Finally something relatable to everyone on so many different levels. I watched this show in one sitting. Can't wait for another season to come out. I highly recommend watching this series because it's one of a kind. Definitely worth watching this show. Haven't seen anything like it. This one is going to be hard to be that is for sure. Probably will watch it a second round.",False
18,1,Misrepresenting religion and culture,cyande-01480,n/a,16/08/2025,Hulu has done a filthy job making this show misrepresenting Islamic believes and culture of Afghanistan. This is probably to distract people and stop the rise of Islamic religion in the west which is growing in speed. This misrepresentation will be leading to serious action against hulu and they will suffer serious damages if they doesn't stop this false matrix propaganda. Afghanistan as a nation has culture of preservation and modesty of religion and women and the western media is totally misguiding people about it. This is the worst western matrix can go against Islam and it will not help them in any form.,False

I laughed and cried and everyone else that watched with me were going on an emotional roller coaster with me. Haha like wow finally a show that I love and can tell everyone to watch too.

21,1,Judgemental sisterhood from hell,caroline_chupaa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have never seen or met anyone who trash-talks they're sisters or family more than this grown-ass women..Much talk about family, tradition,
Respect and sisterhood yet lacks all of it. Really bad portrait of how women should treat each other, family or not.The amount of hate and jealousy these girls how for each other is sickening. I found it really strange,
Sad and fake how they all seek attention their view on religion, cultural differences and all the judgement and pure meanness they bring out in each other and themselves.Either this is such a staged dumb reality tv-show aiming for some serious hard views from a wannabe Kardashian family or they are seriously in need
For therapy and some deep cleansing or how to speak to people, treat people and behave public and

22,10,A must see!!!!,fiftyfivelogistics,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a new show that I recommend everyone to go and see. It is so relatable on so many different levels. The girls are so real and unfiltered and just living their lives like all of us out here. Hiding certain things because of religion we all do it. I can say that my friends all have the same relatable problems and issues. So many ups and downs but it's so important that they all come together always. The love and respect they have for each other and for their beautiful strong and brave mum. Like wow I was so blown away by this tv show. I can't wait for another season to come out soon.. I will be waiting !,False
23,1,Dumb and dumber...,stronald1,n/a,16/08/2025,"... was a funny movie. This is NOT. Why would anyone even think of making stuff like this? As you can see for yourself, the only people giving this high (10 stars) ratings, are fake raters with only 1 review. After the 10 star ratings it drops down really fast. I can only find that the makers of this show either think that the audience are idiots or they are trying to dumb them down. And both could be true.Don't waste your time, be usefull. Go water the plants. Keep your children away from this. If you want to spend your time with something stupid, find something else. This one is beyond stupidity.So. You're warned.",False
24,10,A Great Representation of What It is Like to Grow Up as a Muslim American in the USA,severinez,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would have to disagree with a lot of the negative comments here. I am a Muslim American who grew up here in the US and have lived a large portion of my life in LA. This show is great because it authentically touches on A LOT of internal conflicts that come with growing up Muslim in America, including dealing with taboo issues like pregnancy before marriage or being in same sex relationship.Like it or not, there are many practices and teachings of Islam that conflict with American practices and traditions. It doesn't mean that either side is right or wrong here. What the show touches on is how the younger generation struggles with reconciling those two different ways of life, and show also does a great job of showcasing the older generation of siblings, who very clearly are rooted in their traditions and devout Muslims. These are real experiences of muslim women in the US, so I don't understand how this could be considered cultural appropriation or misrepresentation, especially when I have had similar experiences.Overall, I thought it was fun, entertaining, and really relatable show. I hope they have a second season!!",False
25,1,"OMG, My jaw is stuck open",neromancer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do not know where to start. Just be a another reality show but do not bring any of the true Afghani culture and Islam in it. I was compelled to make my own judgement of this show after being brought to it from a YouTube review. I do not want this type of TV at all. So, I cannot review it with a non-bias perspective. Whoever the producer and director is needs to have their creative license reevaluated. They should be ashamed to bring to light such a blatant inaccuracy to pop culture. This is just a a countless example what people will do for money. Not just the actors but also individuals who brought this series to HULU. For the viewers who have any bit of intellectual minds would be disgusted of this trash. Of course there must be a small population of individuals who approve or else this series would never have been made. Those who want to watch will watch and others will not watch.",False

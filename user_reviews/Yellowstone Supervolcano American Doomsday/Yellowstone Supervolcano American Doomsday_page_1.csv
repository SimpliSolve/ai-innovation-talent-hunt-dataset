1,6,Sensationalized up the wazoo,blondbs-67336,n/a,16/08/2025,"But still interesting & entertaining. Great scenery.Adventures below ground are quite exciting. All the other eruptions shown are nicely alarming.***Editing tho, folks...when the narrator talks about the May 3, 2018 volcanic eruption in Hawaii of the Kilauea volcano, he calls it, quite clearly, the KALAWI volcano. Bad form there. The least he could have done was brush up on the actual pronunciation.The videos & still shots of so many other eruptions are fascinating and quite varied.If & when Yellowstone blows its top, it certainly seems like ALL of No. America is going to be screwed! And, there's pretty much nothing that anybody can do about it. Cross your fingers & hope that you're on vacation somewhere in the Eastern Steppes of Mongolia!",False
2,8,fascinating and full of information,spinosa5,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was much better than I expected. The explanation of what the Yellowstone Caldera is, and now it will inevitably erupt are well explained. Comparisons to historic volcanic eruptions (Mt. St. Helens, Iceland Pompeii and others) show the incredible forces and well-documented destruction that have occurred. Then it is pointed out Yellowstone will be of a magnitude so much greater that it may destroy North America, and possibly the world. I didn't find it over sensationalized and the animations were well-done. One thing I measure docs like this is by the quality of the experts who are interpreting and documenting the story. The folks presented here are real, with impressive credentials and do a great job sharing their expertise. I definitely recommend!",False

1,6,Superior to other shows on the subject,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was surprised at how well this was done. If is far superior to the trashy, cheap, sensational treatments it has gotten on Dateline NBC, 20 20, 48 Hours and many many other news outlets.This show doesn't focus on Alex Murdaugh, it focuses on the situations and victims he caused.You hear from the kids on the boat, their patents, law enforcement, private detectives, jailhouse recordings and others.This is one documentary Netflix did right. It doesn't seem padded or overlong like many of their shows.Please keep it up Netflix.This is far more compelling than focusing on Murdoch himself.",False
2,8,A shocking series.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"The series starts with the exploration of the death of a young woman named Mallory Madison Beach, who dies in a boating accident, where she's accompanied by her boyfriend and some friends. One of those on board was Paul Murdaugh, a young man from a wealthy family, a family that has links to numerous deaths.I am genuinely the first person to criticise Netflix when they drag out a documentary series, and after episode one, I felt that vibe, however I was unaware of The Murdaugh story, and this time I'd suggest the format works, there are numerous shocking revelations.Lots of powerful interviews, and just think these events are so fresh and raw for many of the people, one or two interviewees made me feel as though they were trying a bit too hard, perhaps I'm being unkind.If you're unaware of the story, it's shocking, it's truly like a plot from an over the top thriller, you can't believe one family got away with so much for so long.You'll be aware that money and power carry a lot of weight, if you have one you're laughing, if you have both you're practically bomb proof.I'm looking forward to the next chapter.8/10.",False
3,8,Quite sad,gallagherkellie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel like a lot of the bad reviews on here are by people who know the Murdaughs which is making me giggle. How sad.Anyway my thoughts on the documentary: I watched this after seeing the outcome of the trial. I knew a little bit about the boat incident but I like how in depth they went into it. It broke my heart. It also broke my heart seeing Paul's ex talk about her experience with him as I had a similar experience with my first serious boyfriend.They made me feel terrified and like I was actually at the boat scene. I liked that they went into detail about the Murdaughs. The police not wanting to comment on anything is solely due to the fact they let this family get away with so much crap over the years, it's disgusting.I had no idea about the other deaths of Stephen and Gloria so that was interesting to hear about, I feel like a bit longer could have been spent on stephen's because his was a definite murder.Very happy with the outcome of the murder trial. Reminds me of John List a bit.",False
4,6,"Interesting story, terrible editing by Netflix",GazTruman,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story is interesting. Powerful people above the law getting away with literally murder.The execution by Netflix is worrying... the first two minutes of the 3 part doc is basically a trailer telling you everything which is going to happen over the next 3 hours. Could basically turn off then.The final part of episode 2 (presumably to make you watch episode 3) is disgraceful. Literally just starts telling you about another case without any storytelling.I'm starting to wonder if documentaries are dead and slowly just becoming fiction. Netflix are to blame for this, throwing out low quality docs month after month, with only one gem every year.",False
5,7,Murdaugh Murder Mystery,Lejink,n/a,16/08/2025,"Five mysterious deaths occur on four separate dates in the last ten years in the lowcountry region of South Carolina and each one has a connection to a powerful dynastic legal family in the area. First a young gay man, alleged to have had a same-sex relationship with one of the two young sons of the influential Murdaugh family, is found dead late at night lying in an unnatural position on a country road. No arrest is made but the local grapevine points the finger at the oldest of the two sons of multi-millionaire local attorney Alex Murdaugh.Then, a few years later, the younger Murdaugh son is allegedly drunk at the wheel of a small boat which crashes and sees one of its party of teenage passengers, a 19-year-old girl thrown out into the water and drown.Next, the Murdaugh's 57-year-old family housekeeper of 20 years dies at their residence after reportedly tripping over the family dog and falling backwards down the brick entrance steps and hitting her head.Finally and most recently, Alex Murdaugh himself is charged and as of this morning, convicted of the murder by the shooting of his wife and younger son, but not before he has bizarrely botched his own death, paying a third party to shoot him, in order that his surviving son can claim on his life insurance.Deemed by many as untouchable in the small area where this empowered family resided and presided, Murdaugh was finally brought to book, with all of the above details and more unfolded in not one but two explosive separate TV documentaries, one by HBO, the other by Netflix.""Oh what a tangled web we weave..."" Murdaugh Sr said in his own defence on the stand but seriously, Spiderman himself couldn't have created a bigger or stickier one than we get here. Besides the tragic deaths, we learn that Murdaugh Sr was a serial embezzler, even defrauding the surviving family of his late housekeeper of a multi-million liability pay-out he himself had instigated on his own household policy, set up barely months before. Murdaugh claimed that the money he stole was swallowed up by his opioid addiction though the point was effectively made that even with the high cost of his palliative drug of choice, it could only have amounted to a fraction of the actual amount he took.Told in Netflix's typical tabloid-style, fast, flashy documentary style, with multiple interviews, usually from multiple angles, together wirh sometimes unnecessarily morbid reconstructions, like the aftermath of the boat crash and especially an unnecessarily tasteless graphic image of the dead housekeeper's trainered feet posed at the top of a set of stairs, this was nevertheless addictive true-crime, only-in-America trash TV, which for all its ugliness and garishness, was compulsive viewing for my wife and I.By sheer coincidence, we only watched the final episode last night and have woken up this morning to read the headline news that Murdaugh Sr has indeed been convicted of the murder of his wife and son on circumstantial, but obviously to the jury, convincing evidence.Somehow though, I think there may be a further twist to come in this fantastical tale. Apparently at one point in his father's trial, his surviving son tried to pass his father a John Grisham book, the irony being that even at his most imaginative, the author himself couldn't have concocted a plot as unbelievable and improbable as this.",False
6,7,Good But A Bit Dated,johnspringer-95440,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is trending on Netflix in light of Alex Murdaugh's recent murder conviction, but the show itself focuses primarily on the earlier crimes (and alleged/possible crimes) of Murdaugh and his wealthy, powerful and severely dysfunctional family. The focus is appropriately on the victims and the presentation is (mostly) even-handed, although it does lapse into conspiracy/sensationalism in a few places. The series covers the murders of Murdaugh's wife and son Paul, but it ends before the start of Murdaugh's trial. Those looking for a documentary analysis of the trial evidence and/or a current examination of the possible motives in those murders may be disappointed.",False
7,6,Intriguing docuseries with more speculation than convincing evidence,camerong-73357,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just saw this short series of 3 episodes and it is quite informative and well-produced. If you are a true crime buff and don't know the ins and outs of the Murdaugh story then this will truly fill you in. This features many of the acquaintances of Paul Murdaugh who were a part of his entourage and experienced the tragedy of the boat crash which claimed the life of Mallory Beach. It's honestly hard to sympathize with these former friends of his knowing they continued to hang out and drink underage with a reckless jerk who had already crashed a vehicle drunk with them before.This series overall gives the viewer an idea of the corruption of this family and sort of paints them as the Kennedys of the South. It makes one have good cause to suspect that Alex Murdaugh did kill his wife and son. However, I feel like the suspicion connecting the Murdaughs to the other deaths doesn't have any solid basis other than small town rumors which have come to light. Coming from a small town in Texas, I have experienced firsthand the ease of which asinine rumors can go around about some things despite being able to testify to the opposite.",False
8,7,Justice got served.,deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"True crime stories, it's the new thing lately and to be honest I love watching these kind of documentaries. It might not be everyone's cup of tea but if you're into this kind of true crime stories this one is worth watching. Six episodes to tell us what happened, to make us understand with what kind of people we're dealing with. In my opinion they dragged it out a little bit. They could have made it shorter and it would still have been understandable. That said I enjoyed watching it, although some characters were annoying. For once I think justice got served and that's a good thing. Rich influencing people getting away with things is getting old so it's nice to see that this didn't happen this time. There's still a long way to go but we're on the right track this time.",False
9,9,Least sensationalized,eegeddes44,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching multiple documentaries, special news reports, etc. On the lives of the Murdaughs, a southern institution of a family, I was very pleased to find this docuseries actually gives more screen time to Mallory Beach, the REAL victim, and not to the insane, evil murdaugh family and their conspiracies. (Although the audience is given information that I've never heard before on the specifics of their swift and direct interruption of the investigation.... facts provided unbiased from the kids on the boat and their parents, who must finally feel unthreatened to speak openly.)This was more of a tribute to Mallory, a testament to her as a person, as well as recognizing the pain all of the kids endured, versus a shockumentary on how unabashedly despicable the Murdaugh clan ruled over the innocent community for a century.Yes, there is focus on the other deaths and events involving the murdaughs specifically, but FINALLY the audience gets to know the reality and loss of this teenager, as a human being.That is what is missing in so many true crime documentaries. The focus is on the perpetrator, rarely on the victims.",False
10,7,A Lot To Consider,ThereelscoopwithKK,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFor someone who knew nothing about the story I would say that the first two episodes were quite informative. However, as a collection of all of them I still don't feel you are getting the absolute truth in all of the interviews. In order to form an opinion on the boating tragedy I would have liked to have seen the witnesses cross examined to get a better idea of more about what was going on with all of the members on the boat.The third episode is chalk full of speculation. Certainly much of it is rather suspicious , but suspicious and guilty are not the same thing. From what you are shown it seemed a guilty verdict was likely and that is what came about in the past few days . As for the other cases the mini series shows as suspicious potential involvement are just that. I personally need a lot more evidence and not hearsay and speculation to label guilt. There's no doubt some shady stuff going on within this family and it's nice knowing the justice system is finally looking into it.",True
11,8,Interesting and heartbreaking,senturk-zeliha,n/a,16/08/2025,There is an ongoing trial about this family and it is shocking to see how much privilege and entitlement going on in that community. No one is safe in a setting where a group of people can get away with anything and never learn from their mistakes. It is heartbreaking to see how many lives were damaged permanently because no one could question the power of this family. You see how a generational legacy can turn into a trainwreck.This story is far from being complete. There are still a lot of missing pieces and the time will tell how this scary movie will end. I'm wondering how things will work out for Buster.,False
12,4,Netflix can drag out a documentary,stsorrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"It seems as though Netflix wants all of their documentaries to be three episodes long at about an hour each. While this doc has a ton of info to share, just like so many others before it, they say the same things over and over. The first hour and a half is devoted completely to the boating accident.... And it could have easily been presented in 30 minutes or less. I found myself fast forwarding through many of the interviews, as it was a loop of personal accounts of the accident and the individuals involved, but they were just repeating what had already been said.The story, or stories, are interesting, but all interest gets lost due to the terrible editing and long winded presentation.",False
13,7,Excellent Docudrama,rspprodinc-20208,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very well done dealing with a lot of the history of the family troubles instead of mainly the son and wife murders. I only wish that whoever did the interviews, would tell the interviewees NOT to use the word ""like"" in their replies. This was mainly done with young people that were on the boat where Mallory went missing. It seems every other word they spoke was ""like."" I've interviewed a lot of people in my production days and warn my interviewees not to use that would. The use of ""like"" was so distracting in the interviews I almost quit watching the show. Otherwise, this was very well done and in depth of the entire case(s).",False
14,7,Just gets worse and worse,cb_whitewood,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't follow the first installment of this documentary very well, but what was revealed here was wild (in a bad way).Every life touched by Alex Murdaugh suffers the consequences. In season 1, it was shown that just being around this family meant you were liable to get sucked into dangerous situations. People got hurt and/or died in a boat accident as a result of Alex's traumatized son's drinking, and people who worked for the Murdaugh's were also sucked into this mess, getting asked favors or told to lie in court. Holy crap! Not even his family was safe, and I think it's unfortunate this ""scandal"" occurred at all.This season goes pretty fast, and has a few minor twists. TW for several graphic discussions of great bodily injury that resulted in death.",True
15,6,"Sometimes, It Takes a Tragedy for the Castle to Finally Collapse",penelopepoczuda,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's easy to get lost in the labyrinth of the Murdaugh family. Escaping unscathed is harder. Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal begins with a 2019 boating accident but quickly reveals something much larger-and far more rotten. The documentary series follows the downfall of one of South Carolina's most influential families, blending crime, power, and a suffocating sense that the entire system had worked in their favor for decades. This isn't just a murder case; it's a display of privilege with deadly consequences.I've never been much of a true crime documentary enthusiast, especially the kind that settle for reading facts like an extended news report. If there's no unusual angle, personal approach, or at least a hint of narrative boldness, I tune out. But Murdaugh Murders landed in my lap as if to say, ""You don't know anything about this story, so sit down and listen."" So that's what I did. I didn't choose it because it seemed promising, but because it was the most talked-about-and sometimes, curiosity wins over the fatigue of seeing the same formula. The structure here is the one Netflix has already turned into a franchise: archival footage, generic soundtrack, emotional interviews, and absent culprits-the only thing left is to hear the echoes of those who survived. It's not revolutionary, but the raw material pulses.What the series does best is dismantle the myth of this legal dynasty, layer by layer, until only the bone remains. There's no traditional suspense-we know early on that something is deeply wrong with Alex Murdaugh. The real interest lies in watching the empire's decay: the drunk son who kills a friend in a boating accident, the father who tries to cover it up, the housekeeper who falls down the stairs, the young gay man found dead on a rural road. The series tries to cover everything but stumbles. Gloria's case has substance; Stephen's is little more than innuendo with dramatic editing. Some episodes have meat, others only smoke. And that's where sensationalism starts to creep in.Still, there are strengths. The series keeps its focus on the human wreckage left behind: friends, colleagues, collateral victims-all helping to build a devastating portrait. And the turning point doesn't come from miraculous DNA or a dramatic twist, but from a simple video. A banal recording made by the son himself, placing Alex at the crime scene and blowing apart the alibi of a man used to crafting narratives. It's technology, not emotion, that delivers the final blow.There's a noticeable shift in pacing as we approach the courtroom. When we finally see Alex on the stand, the tension dissipates. There's no shock, just confirmation. From the start, it seemed unlikely that someone with his background would walk free-especially in a town where people were whispering his name long before they heard the facts. And maybe that's why the trial feels more like an epilogue than a climax. The real fascination had already played out: watching, almost without blinking, the downfall of a man who believed himself untouchable.Murdaugh Murders isn't the kind of documentary I usually watch, but it kept me to the end. Maybe not because of the format-worn-out, repetitive-but because of the raw story. In the end, the series is less about a crime and more about everything that allowed it to happen. Justice arrives, but not with relief-with exhaustion. The Murdaugh name, once synonymous with power, ends as a synonym for scandal. And that says a lot about deep America: where names matter more than evidence, where influence masquerades as innocence, and where sometimes, it takes a tragedy for the castle to finally collapse.",False
16,8,Eye opening but not surprising,kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Murdaugh Murders: A Southern Scandal (2023) is a series that I recently watched on Netflix. The storyline follows a group of privileged kids with money, drugs, boats and planes in South Carolina that one day takes their carefree lifestyle too far leading to the death of a young lady. One of the kid's fathers is the town lawyer from a family with a history or privilege and living life above the law and comes in to hide the murder. The misdeeds of father's past come to the surface and he takes things a bit too far for the cover up.This movie is codirected by Jenner Furst and Julia Willoughby Nason, who also worked together on The Pharmacist. Growing up in Maine I could relate to just about every aspect of this picture. This docuseries perfectly depicts small town white America and the lifestyles, relationships and how authority works...until someone gets too comfortable and gets over their skis. The interviews with the people involved was fascinating and their raw emotions and depiction of the events were fascinating. I did feel there was a lack of accountability on display from both the victims, families and towns people, but if this doesn't perfectly depict the problems within our society nothing does.Overall, both the big picture and actual storyline of this series is fascinating, eye opening but not surprising. I would score this series an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",False
17,8,Very Informative,wmamills,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent overview of Murdaugh scandal, including the power they had in Hampton Country, South Carolina and more specifically the town of Hampton. This power included the fear of local law enforcement and local townspeople had in crossing the Murdaugh family. It covers an overview of the Murdaugh dynasty, which has come to a close now that Alex Murdaugh has been disbarred and fired from the powerful law firm that his great grandfather started and with his son Baxter thrown out of the University of South Carolina for plagiarism.The scandal begins with the boating accident caused by their son Paul who was later murder along with his mother Maggie up through the ""attempted"" suicide on Alex's life.",False
18,5,A little long and compartmentalized,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll start by saying I agree with one review that tells us Documentary used to mean facts and data and that this (and most) documentaries today are full of hearsay and innuendo. Honestly, the definition leans more toward Tabloid but, for some reason, that's not really a genre in the film industry. Odd. Having never heard of this case (I'm one of those rare birds who doesn't indulge in broadcast news), I was actually drawn in by the trailer where the girl says she felt the deceased visited her on his ""passing journey."" I also do like true-crime type stories. My objective view, based on not knowing anything about the case, is that this docudrama (ah, there's the word) was disheveled and jumped around too much, reiterated too many points, and led almost nowhere. It seems mainly a vehicle to draw in those who followed the trial in the news and were aware of the innuendo surrounding this family. More than one review thought there was no motive for Alex to murder his wife and son, but I'm trying to figure out if they mean the docudrama offered no motive; their lack of understanding how to put 2+2 together, or in reality there was no motive offered during the trial. For me - again, based only on this series - I thought there was more than enough motive based on the fact the wife was trying to divorce him (his financials would be revealed; she probably knew many secrets; he would lose face in the community) and his son was an albatross because of his involvement in the killing/boating accident; Alex had lost credibility by keeping his son out of prison and was probably deeply in debt from paying off so many people in the police and court systems (you didn't really think he spent all that money on pills, did you?). I mean, there's just a lot of common sense that is missing in some of the reviews who don't seem to understand what happened or think there was no motive. There's also a lot left out of this series, such as that Maggie was the true owner of all the Murdough's properties - Alex had sold them to her for $5 each at some point to protect the property from any lawsuits that could arise against him in the future (knowing he was embezzling the firm's money and stealing from clients). So he had HUGE reasons to kill Maggie since he was named in her will as the beneficiary of all their properties upon her death while during a divorce she could simply walk away with them.As someone in the legal field, I feel compelled to point out that most of the other allegations against Alex are hearsay and have no evidence - not that I don't believe them. But I think Eddie is a lot more involved than he claims. And what about his brother coming and cleaning up the crime scene! Netflix kind of glossed over that, although, presumably, the police already had clear photos of the scene. That's outrageous that he was even allowed to do that AND I felt I saw the entire sociopathy of that family in his face and words in those moments when he pretended he thought it was ""the least he could do."" That is one of the biggest lines of bs in the whole series and it was only 4 seconds of footage.I wish they could have gotten Alex for Gloria's murder, as well. He clearly staged her death for the insurance (probably left her there for Maggie to find) and then had the nerve to perform insurance fraud while pretending to care about her kids. I mean, this guy is a sociopath of the most lethal caliber. Hopefully, he will never get out of prison.It's a sad story and not that uncommon for kids in powerful families to get away with things that are truly dangerous all to keep the parents from facing reality; it's a form of neglect. But I do agree with another review that reminds us those kids did know better but went along with Paul that night anyway. Each of them tells the camera that they felt wrong about going to the clam bake so far away by boat, and that they didn't want Paul to drive while he was so intoxicated. But no one did anything about it. Perhaps the biggest irony is that Paul was the outsider that everyone put up with because of his relationship with Morgan and, no doubt, because of the extravagances having such a wealthy friend afforded them. It's an age-old dilemma that our young women will turn the other cheek in the face of abuse.By the end, we almost feel sorry for Paul and, truly, he was a victim of a violent, negligent family. The police and everyone Alex had on his payroll should also face some kind of investigation.",True
19,8,Murder he wrote,RedKidBytes,n/a,16/08/2025,"The original 3 part of the true-crime docuseries investigates the Murdaughs, the most powerful family over the past 100 years in Low County, South Carolina. The family last name led the office of prosecution for 87 years. They became a formidable force through their connections with local law enforcement, political leaders, and the owners of the local banks and businesses. Whilst holding public office of prosecution, their family members have also established a law firm with partners that provided them with almost an iron grip over all the surrounding communities.On February 24th, 2020, Paul (19 years old) the youngest son of Alex Murdaugh, was piloting a speed boat whilst under the influence of Alcohol. One of the passengers, Mallory Beach (19 years old) was killed in the accident when the boat hit one of the pillars of the bridge at about 2:30 pm.Paul's father Alex and his grandfather immediately entangled themselves in the event to cover up Paul's involvement in the accident. They blamed Mallory Beach's boyfriend and warned police that he was the one who was piloting the boat.However, the event brought national attention and brought the Murdaugh dynasty under the microscope. What happened next was an unbelievable set of events that finally started to crumble the dynasty.Although the details of the events have long been in the news, however, the documentary brings up the personal perspective of the people and the unfortunate lives that were destroyed. It's a well-done true crime documentary.",False
20,9,Shocking true life tale that you won't believe,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,16/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn a small town in South Carolina, the Murdaugh family law firm was the all big powerful name in legal proceedings. Paul Murdaugh was the youngest son of the family, and considered the runt of the litter, but still lived the high life on the back of his family name, taking on the can-do-what-I-want attitude that was known of the Murdaugh brand. But one night, during a booze fuelled escapade on a speedboat, teenager Mallory Beach was tragically killed when the boat capsized, with Paul reportedly at the helm. He seemed to dodge justice on the back of his connections, but his evasion of accountability unravelled a whole disturbing backlog of corruption and murder that is beyond belief.Netflix seem to be pumping out plenty of true life content lately, but then they must have much stuff to choose from. I do remember seeing a New York Times article pop up regarding this shocking case, with a man, a qualified legal attorney, being convicted of the murder of his wife and own flesh and blood son, but then there'd been the case of Chris Watts a few years before, so there's at least a pattern of that kind of thing going on in the States. And while it's far from easy viewing, it does at least provide compelling material to delve in to, and pick apart.This is truly a shocking account of corruption and murder, that will leave you in disbelief that such a thing could happen, but then in a closed, tight knit backwater American town quite believably could. With two deaths of those who could bring scandal to the Murdaugh family before the speedboat event, and then the final, horrific occurrence, it was all just a ticking time bomb that lead up to what played out, the whole sorry thing playing out like some twisted John Grisham novel come to life. NF play it the safe way, keeping it condensed to three compact episodes, rather than the long, sprawling sagas they've been known for in the past, keeping it focused on the particulars of the case, rather than getting bogged down with too much unnecessary filler.It really is a horrifying, eye opening account of rich and powerful people getting away with whatever they want, another unsettling case of fact being stranger than fiction, and leaving you uneasy at the depravity of human nature. ****",False

Paul Murdaugh is responsible for a boating accident that resulted in the death of Mallory Beach. Alex Murdaugh kills his wife and son Paul, then tries to frame his cousin by staging a roadside shooting of himself.I recommend this short series. Netflix has a tendency to run things longer than they should be, but this was efficiently made.The only comment I would make, and this has been brought up by other reviewers, is the drunken state of all six kids that got on the boat the night Mallory died. Obviously Paul was driving, and Paul crashed the boat, but the state of all the kids that night speaks volumes. Paul had the toys and Paul had the money. He didn't seem like the most likeable person, but money makes up for that. Was it peer pressure that made the five kids get into Paul's boat? Were they so drunk that they didn't see the risk? They must all be living with massive guilt knowing that they could have saved a life by refusing to get into that boat that night. They are lucky that all of them didn't die.",False
23,8,Excellent documentary,creardon-68012,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having only learned about Alex Murdaugh from seeing his sentencing on CNN, I decided to find out a bit more. This Netflix documentary providing a fascinating and touching background to what has recently been on the news. It took me a while to figure out the people involved, but the interviews with the young people impacted by the Murdaugh's behaviour was wonderfully done.

Unfortunately, because race always seems to be an issue in America, we all get drawn into the lie that these people represent all white people. They don't. Not even close. I found the first part of this series very difficult to get through, because as a working class, conservative white man, I despise everything these people stand for. Even the friends, who are interviewed in a way that tries to make them sympathetic, are just gross. Who is buying these punks their alcohol? Who is supplying them with trucks, guns and boats? Their idiot parents, that's who. Idiot parents raising more idiots that the rest of society gets pushed around and bullied by.

25,8,An interesting watch,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was an interesting watch. If you know nothing about the case, this series will take you on a strange ride. My takeaway from it is that the law needs to be equally applied to everyone, and when you start to bend the rules for someone because they have a privileged position they will continue to bend as many rules as they can and tragedy will likely happen. It's hard to talk about this series Without describing exactly what happened and while these events are public knowledge I think it wouldn't be fair for me to explain the events before somebody watches it. I will just say that if the rules had been taken seriously by the people in this community most notably the police and the legal establishment it's possible that at least four people would be alive and one probably wouldn't be sitting in prison right now or at least he would be sitting in prison for a different crime. It's a well done documentary so I recommended if you're interested in True Crime.",True

1,9,Books Needs to Be Saved,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Frustrating, vital, and carefully crafted is the best way to describe documentary. Filmmaker Kim A. Snyder creates an impressive and upsetting documentary that explores the importance roles for librarians and exploring how the United States have become troubled and terrifying they have become. Using great discussions and themes explored throughout, Snyder really gets into the topics carefully and well-crafted, exploring and exposing of how book banning, politics and religious agendas have become an major issue with the country and effecting individuals.Alongside with a good presentation and structure, many of it's purposes and themes are well-explored as Snyder doesn't hold back. Discussing how books are necessary and how librarians are fighting against the political censorship the United States and government is forcing. It's scary to think the fact the United States across themselves are implementing these changes, which perfectly demonstrates how problematic and worrisome the United States has become.Various moments have moved me and frustrated me in the best ways possible. Regarding structure, the documentary is a typical structure but it succeeds with discussing it's themes, ideas, and purpose perfectly. Overall, this is one of the best documentaries at Sundance thus far.",False
2,10,Loved,wendybethkalth,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI loved the film and thought it was very relevant to today and the school libraries.the school public libraries are under attack today. Why are they banning books they know a little about. It's a plot from Farenheight 451. It meant a lot to learn how to get involved and to hear from the stars that were there. Why are they trying to censor our children? It's very scary what is happening in the legislature and all. People should have the right to read what they want. I think we have a constitution for a reason. It is ironic how they called this one woman woke. I broke for another woman's son in the film.,True

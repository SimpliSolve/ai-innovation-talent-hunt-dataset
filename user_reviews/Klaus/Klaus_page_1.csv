1,8,"In a sea of generic Christmas movies, Klaus stands out",cricketbat,n/a,15/08/2025,"Klaus is an amusing new twist on a very old story. It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness, featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and a clever plot. In the sea of generic Christmas movies that get churned out each holiday season, Klaus stands out because it tried something different and it succeeded.",False
2,9,"Wow, we finally have a new Christmas classic",Joejoesan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOkay, when it comes to Christmas movies to me there was only one: It's a wonderful life by Frank Capra. The Bishop's Wife and Love Actually are also very good but they don't have the same magic.
This year I can finally add a new classic: Klaus. It's a funny and surprising tale of how the real Santa Claus was born. I love the story and especially the look of this movie is amazing. Klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks to computers it has astonishing lit scenes. That makes the journey extra special.The story is about this lazy and clumpsy guy, Jesper, who is the only son of the director of a Mail School. His father wants to teach him a lesson and sends him to this little snowy place called Smeerensburg. Only if he succeeds in delivering 6000 letters in a year he's allowed to come back and continue his luxery life.
Of course Jesper obeys: he doesn't have a choice. But when he arrives at Smeerensburg he discovers that his mission is an almost imposible one. Two rival families are at constant war with each other and will never send each other letters. But when Jesper visits his last hope, this hermit called Klaus, something magical happens. By accident this mourning figure receives a letter from a child and wants to return this nice gesture by giving the boy a present. Suddenly all the childeren of the village want to send letters...Why does Santa always say ""Ho! Ho! Ho!?"". How did he get his reindeers? Does he really have a naughty book? Why does he travel on a sleigh? All those questions will be answered in this great tale of one man, Jesper, changing the fate of a town that once only knew anger and never friendship. The end of Klaus is actually quite moving.Forget The Polar Express or all the Christmas Carols. Klaus is the real deal! Go see it on Netflix!9/10",True
3,8,"Watch and learn, Disney",tarapov-92-654064,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very solid original story, awesome visual style and great writing. All it takes.

4,10,It's one of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen!,evilmonkey226,n/a,15/08/2025,"At first I thought it would be dumb, but omg it was AMAZING! The story was awesome (I won't give any spoilers) and there were parts that made me laugh so hard and parts that made me cry. I don't usually cry during movies, but I'm sitting here writing this review with tears in my eyes. I think it is going to become a new movie to watch every Christmas with my family!",False
5,10,Wholesome and Original,arcticerika,n/a,15/08/2025,"Klaus was a heartwarming animation with a very unique take on the ""Christmas origin"". I originally put it on as background noise for folding laundry but caught myself sitting on the bed for the entirety of the movie. The animation was really well done and the characters were memorable. I loved the similarities with Tim Burton films. It's nice to have a different Christmas film but that has the spirit nevertheless.
One of the best Christmas animations in awhile. Great film!",False

A film seductive for so many motives than it is bzarre to define them because, maybe, each viewer discover his interesting things . It is a Christmas film, with the rights to be a classic one, for the wise way to explore the manner to become adult, the hate, the changes as result of the facts of one man, about dreams and purposes, interests, generosity and love. Happily , it is more than a film about Santa. In fact, it has the precious gift to be exactly a film about his viewers. And that is just the great detail defining it.",False
9,7,"A heartwarming, charming and gorgeous animated movie.",Martinito_08183,n/a,15/08/2025,"A heartwarming, charming and gorgeous animated movie that retells Santa Clause's origin story in a new and interesting way, although it does stumble in some places, especially with it's familiar story that we've experienced before and hitting most of the same beats (but that doesn't mean that it didn't had great moments); some of the characters needed more development (like the schoolteacher Alva, who unfortunately comes out as a generic love interest, while still shines in some moments throughout the story), while others (the villains) can be considered average at best; music, which was 30% great, while the other 70% didn't stand out all that much or the composer is repeating the same music a couple of times and the dialogue was great and in some moments OK at best, which included jokes that weren't all that funny.There is one thing that i want to mention: before i saw the movie, i read some reviews and saying that the main character Jesper has the same characteristics with a another existing character in a animated movie and that character was Kuzco from the movie ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and how they were too similar to each other. There is truth to that discussion, since Jesper starts out the same way and act the same way throughout the movie, but for me - he did grow on me the more and more i continue watching the movie and i started to separate him and Kuzco from one another and Jesper did stand on its own as a character.I'll just say it, since it's the most noticeable thing in the movie: i ADORE the animation. It's so gorgeous to look at. All of the designs of the characters, the environments, the movements of the characters and the lighting are just masterfully made and the cinematography accompanies it and making it jaw-dropping to look at. If that movie doesn't inspire you to become a animator, then i don't know what can.I'm so happy that people from around the world are still keeping the spirit of the traditional animation alive and proving to the huge corporate studios, who abandoned that technique of animation (i'm looking at you Disney), which existed for far long than we can remember is not dead and it doesn't give up on a fight. That doesn't mean that i don't adore the 3D / CGI animation that Pixar created (which i'm so grateful for that), which also creating a new way to tell stories, but it's sad that we only get 3D / CGI animated movies in the movie theater and the only way to see new traditional animated movies is on streaming services like Netflix or in festivals. Movies like ""Klaus"" still give me hope and that's a good thing. I'm giving ""Klaus"" a 7.4/10.",False
10,10,A New Christmas Classic,magdalena_,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a joy to watch! I absolutely loved this hand-drawn animated film, the story kept me entertained from start to finish and I'm very glad that Netflix is giving this art form a platform on its streaming service.",False
11,7,A True Act of Goodwill Always Sparks Another,ThomasDrufke,n/a,15/08/2025,"Klaus pretty much represents both sides of animated films in the 21st century. Sometimes you have a film with glorious animation and an immersive story that challenges the viewer. Other times, you have silly animation that feels like it's only meant for the kids of the household under 10 years old. It's a tale of two halves and Klaus at the very least, ends on a touching note and finishes well overall. The message is clear by the time the credits roll but for a while I was unsure about the direction the Oscar nominated feature was going.7.4/10",False

But what sappiness was in the movie well used. The main thrust was not sappy. It was a well told story, with the proper nuances in the animation and the vocalization. I consider this movie to be for adults. You will thoroughly enjoy it.",False
13,7,'A true selfless act always sparks another'...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,"As valid as any other conjured story about a benevolent old man with a fluffy grey beard.

14,5,The cliches bring down the occasional brilliance and turn the movie into mediocrity,Harhaluulo54,n/a,15/08/2025,"The quirks, the wits, and the clear self-awareness in writing carry the movie a long way, but the massive amount of cliches and shameless use of one-dimensional ""bad guys"" in the narrative made the work seem less genuine than it otherwise could have been. The brilliant reflections that characters go thru during the run are surprisingly well-planned and executed, but then again, those overly gimmicky tropes in the plot make it seem like the writer was talented enough to avoid them and create something more original and sincere, but just decided not to. Very weird decisions were made here and I cannot fully approve them. An okay movie but nothing more.",False
15,10,My Christmas watchlist just got a little longer,CubsandCulture,n/a,15/08/2025,"Everything about this droll take on the Santa myth is inspired. JK SImmons as the title character, the animation style, the way in which the various elements of the mythos come together organically and so forth all just fit. Even the final moment of magical realism is just right. It all adds up to a heart warming tale of Christmas.I will be watching this each year for awhile.",False
16,10,Claus.,morrison-dylan-fan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhilst I was vaguely aware of the title from seeing it mentioned at the Oscar's, I became aware of Klaus from seeing a large number of fellow reviewers highly praising the film this year,which led to me meeting Klaus.View on the film:Revealing later that he had wanted to do a traditionally animated feature film, but he wanted to see how the animation would have evolved without the switch to computer-generated animation, the 20 years spent working in various other animation departments, leads to co-writer/ (with Jim Mahoney & Zach Lewis) and co-director (with Carlos Martinez Lopez )Sergio Pablos make a chart-topping Christmas number one directing debut.Developing the project for over a decade, Pablos and Lopez ultra-stylised use of volumetric lighting and texturing, (first time to be used in hand-drawn animation) gives the animation a dazzling depth of field appearance, with the detailed, expressive hand-drawn character animation seamlessly blending in with the thick texturing given to the background and buildings drawing a pop-up book elegance.Later revealed by Sergio Pablos that he had improvised 40% of the dialogue,Jason Schwartzman gives a fantastic turn as Jesper,thanks to Schwartzman voicing his distinctive kookiness with a growing can-do confidence,whilst J.K. Simmons brings a merry, towering warmth in his merry performance of Klaus.Simply having a wonderful Christmas time in a miserable town, the writers gloriously take the characteristics of Santa (such as flying reindeer)and turn them inside out with hilarious sight gags that soar with excellent drama from Jesper bonding with the locals,and Klaus coming out from the wilderness, to discover the true meaning of Christmas.",True

20,7,An early Christmas present.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,n/a,15/08/2025,"'Klaus (2019)' is essentially a demystified 'Santa Claus' origin story and it's as formulaic as you'd, perhaps, expect. It's also just delightful. Its predictability can't prevent it from being good and, boy, is it good. It's an enjoyable, effective and visually striking animation with a kind heart and a gentle spirit. It sidesteps the sloppy sentimentality usually associated with 'Christmas' movies in favour of, essentially, a subtler sort of the same thing. Its 'Christmas spirit' is strong but well-earned, sweet but not sickly. The movie is just a joy, in general. It's fun, fast-paced and aesthetically distinct, brought to life with a beautiful 2D-3D blend. It doesn't feel entirely typical, either, thanks to its endearingly strange setting and relatively well-realised characters. It makes a couple of very minor missteps - such as a second-act lull in pace and a slightly odd ending - but it's ultimately a thoroughly entertaining experience. 7/10",False
21,10,Best Netflix animated yet?,manos-84557,n/a,15/08/2025,What an amazing movie ! The animation is perfect and the plot even better. Worth every minute.,False
22,6,Overhyped but Generously Sweet,elicopperman,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTraditionally animated films have become far and few in recent years, so whenever a new one comes out, it gets immediate buzz from animation enthusiasts waiting for the next big innovative change in the media. One film that got said attention is Klaus, a modern retelling of the Santa Claus myth from Sergio Pablos, creator of Despicable Me and Smallfoot. Partially made at his Spanish facilities SPA Studios and released on Netflix (in addition to select theaters) this month, the movie itself is a perfect example of a decent film that was unfortunately tainted by overhype.The plot revolves around a postman named Jesper who is stationed in the Northern town of Smeerensburg, which is overrun with hatred from the conflicting Krums and Ellingboes. While in need to sending letters to meet a quota, he befriends a reclusive toy-maker and then slowly finds the true meaning of good will towards all. From that description alone reveals the film's weakest element: the story. The plot has been done before and has so many cliches spread out just to keep it going, from the main character becoming more accepting of the big changes in his life, to the main relationships starting off rocky before gaining the right trust, to an obvious love interest who changes her mind on how to live, and even the whole liar revealed arc. It doesn't help that Jesper is kind of unlikable during the first half due to his petty behavior and egocentric sardonicism, making him hard to connect to until he learns more about the meaning of hospitality. As a result, the feature lacks much surprises and is very predictable from start to finish.With all that said though, the one saving grace in the film's narrative is the overall heart. As the film details the act of good will towards people to lead better lives, it feels very earnest in its intent on doing selfless acts for the greater good of those who you befriended. That actually leads into the character of Klaus himself, who may seem like the average stoic woodsman with a softness hidden within, but his origins give more depth and substance than most renditions of Santa Claus before him, making him a great example of performing deeds through generosity and kindness. Speaking of the other characters, Alva and Mogens offer a good amount of spunk and sarcasm to make their appearances at least enjoyable, but the villains Krum and Ellingboe lack any originality past their hellbent wishes to keep their old hate field traditions. The most distinctive character in the film is Margu, a young Saami girl who acts more as the cutesy admirer of Jesper and Klaus since she wishes to help carry out the spirit of Christmas through means of goodwill to her heroes.Now even though the film may be underwhelming in terms of story, at least the animation makes the experience worthwhile. With a lot of talented character animators on board, they breathed a lot of life in the characters through strong acting and appealing designs. Their cute and cartoony designs blend in well with the cool and somberly colorful environments, which look like they came straight out of a children's book. There are shots in the film that feel like pure concept art, with flat albeit rich textures, soothing scenery and angular proportions that are fun to view. In addition to the animators, the film's cast like Jason Schwartzman, J.K. Simmons, Rashida Jones and Joan Cusack gave more personality and spontaneity to their characters than the generic plot ever could. Finally, the music score by Alfonso Aguilar is very pleasing and calming given the feature's intentional sweet nature, but some of the song choices are flat out stupid. The end song is ok as far as routine pop songs go, but did we need to hear an out of place rap song in an otherwise rich looking Nordic tale?So Klaus may not have been the next big hand-drawn film we were all looking for due to its weak story and hit or miss characters, but at least the colorful animation, charming voice acting and message of good will can offer something in return. Personally, I feel like this is best suited for children, because they'll gain a lot more from this growing up then most adults and teenagers would; it could be their first time learning about why we must care for one another. In this world consumed by hate, greed and cynicism, at least we have beacons like this to remind us why we live and breathe.",True
23,9,Rare christmas story,caroline_schmid,n/a,15/08/2025,"A truly heartwarming story.

24,7,Klaus is good; once it gets going.,barnandkaren,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerKlaus (2019) PG NetflixA big budget splurge from Netflix, though I'm sure they're hoping that it will be a festive favourite that viewers will return to, year after year, to justify their investment.Klaus tells the story of an heir called Jesper who is banished to a remote northern island to prove his worth by setting up a successful post office (it makes a bit more sense in the film). As he tries to meet the challenge so he can escape, along with a kind, old, bearded local woodcarver called Klaus, he accidentally establishes all the legends of Santa Claus. It does this quite well but, damn, it takes its sweet time to get there. It's halfway through before you sense how the film has anything to do with Christmas, and it's over an hour before the C word is mentioned.Despite being animated, I'm not really sure it will work for younger children. My daughter Libby sat in the room while we watched, but focused on her iPad the whole time. There's some lovely animation, but it needs to be funnier and the first half draaaags...Christmas Cheese Rating: 7/10 - Eventually, we get some Christmas imagery, but it mostly avoids the cheese.Snow Rating: 10/10 - It's set in the far north and relies on snow to remind you it's supposed to be a festive film.Actually Any Good Rating: 7/10 - It is good; once it gets going.",True
25,5,Run of the mill humour with annoying characters,lexva5,n/a,15/08/2025,"The animation is good but the story is boring the first good part of it at least. Humour is the usual and repetitive stuff you find on American shows for children with the central character getting it wrong all the time until he becomes a better person. Usual tropes abound. Pathetic and annoying most of the time.
Children (whom I am not) may be more forgiving towards the story",False

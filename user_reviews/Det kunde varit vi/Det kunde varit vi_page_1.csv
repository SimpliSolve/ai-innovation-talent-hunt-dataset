1,10,Breathtaking semi-docu,martinpersson97,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis incredible documentary drama, is definitely one of the better Swedish films of the year, which is no faint praise, to say the least, given the ever impressive track record.It is a very important and well paced outlook at the treatment of disabled people and an historical point that is weaved into sort of a feature film with great actors, very well and emotionally done, to say the least - and a very poignant film that should be viewed to remember history in the most important ways.The cinematography, cutting and editing is stellar, very beautiful and meaningful imagery, very beautifully put together, and accompining the tone of the film.Overall, definitely an important and emotional ride that should be demanded viewing for anyone. This is a story that should be remembered!",True

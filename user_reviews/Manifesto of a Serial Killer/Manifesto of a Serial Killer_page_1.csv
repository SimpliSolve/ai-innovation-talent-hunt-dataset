1,8,The human element of truly heinous crime,brashbuzz,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a True Crime Documentary fan this is a must see. This is a major True Crime story which has surprisingly not often been told, and when it has been, it has not been told in depth - nor from the victim's families perspective, which is a disservice to them & their pain. Shot with current and old footage, this documentary gives the viewer a first hand look into the behaviour of people involved at the time of the crimes. This is a well crafted documentary which tells all the facts, whilst also highlighting the very human element of family that can't help but make anyone with a heart emotional at the stories told.",False
2,10,"""This case will make Charles Manson look like a man who organized Sunday School Picnics""",Her-Excellency,n/a,16/08/2025,"Manifesto of a Serial Killer is one of the better mini-series documentaries by the Oxygen channel (NBCUniversal Television and Streaming). It delves into the spree of murders and tortures committed by Leonard Lake and Charles Chat Ng, and also, deservedly so, points the finger directly at Lake's ex-wife whose exculpation may be one the greatest travesties / miscarriages of justice within the American Judicial System, to date.Even for True Crime aficionados, Manifesto of a Serial Killer is not easy to watch. Less so, is it easy to understand the level of depravity that some humans are capable of, and that are depicted not in reenactments, but from real recordings and footage.If you are not familiar with the case (as I was not), you will be shocked that this is not a case which is more well-known. If you are aware of the case, you will certainly learn more than what you thought you knew of it.Either way, you can't help but be affected by it.",False
3,9,paul and charlie ...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Had the best kinky and fetishlike friendship on earth, but was that good for the rest of the society? Definately not, as it was unveiled by californian criminal justice ''league''( police fbi etc), the two culprits kidnapped and surtainly killed 20 to 30 people in a killing spree lasting from 1982 to 1985, and there are still reasons to believe that there are more victims that hasnt been reported missing, nor found on that top of the hill walseyville california.So if your going to dig for gold in this particullar area, you might find some white ivoryish stuff, well its not an elephant, more likely its bodyparts that should be reported to the police asap, cause mr ng (ning ning) is still alive.Its one of the better oxygene productions, with minimal use of dramatization, loads of crime scene stuff and a myriad of media cuts and clips, it starts off a little slow but ep 2 and 3 will make your hair stand at the edge.This is one among the worst of crimes done in the u.s , apart from war incidents and organized crime and civil uproars, criminal history for sure,if youd like to learn more about crime related history, then do as the grumpy old man, and delve into it. Its gross...and very well made.",False
4,5,The horror,evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery well-assembled account of a spate of killings in mid-Eighties California.Heavily forested Wileysville, a half-mile into the sky at the edge of the Sierra Nevadas, is not a place you'd expect to find a bunker-enclosed torture chamber, but that's what cops discovered when they managed to stop two men's murder spree.One of the suspects eluded justice while in police custody by swallowing a cyanide pill -- in the best tradition of Hitler's henchmen -- and the other was nabbed in Calgary, Canada, after shoplifting some canned fish and shooting a security guard who tried to stop him.The documentary includes self-taken video footage of one of the killers sprawled in a recliner, discussing sordid plans for a ""grand project."" Along the way, we meet the sister of 40ish Paul Cosner, who'd met with disaster while trying to sell his car. Other tragic victims included an attractive young family; the dad's fatal step was attempting to lease some of his sound equipment.Cosner's sister's decades-long search for answers and closure ends not with a proper burial, but with a scattering of rose petals.""I can't imagine the terror he felt,"" she says. ""You can't move on. Paul was my life.""",True

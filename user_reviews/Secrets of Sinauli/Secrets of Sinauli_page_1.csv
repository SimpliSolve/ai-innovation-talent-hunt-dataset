1,10,Who needs iron age when you have golden age.,dixitsandeep,n/a,16/08/2025,"They said how could mahabharat happen before iron age.
They said our temples could not be older than iron age because tools will be required to build them.Now we know how could it all happen.
We were making everything without iron , with copper, bronze, silver, gold.
Who needs iron age when you have golden age.
The difference between seeing a ppt from ASI and this series is great presentation.
These guys have recreated everything, so that we can see how did it look like when it was not decomposed.specially, First chariot ever found in India, its recreation is beautiful. I can imagine that at least some of the chariots in Mahabharat times would have looked like.Here are the answers.",False

3,10,Glorious Discovery of our Ancient Civilization,rkshopping-36414,n/a,16/08/2025,"Irony is we as citizen of India (including myself) know very little about our own archaeological site Sinauli; reason being screen time is given to trivial affairs by Media, and not to such epic discovery which is our past and history. Watched first episode and I had back-to-back goosebumps, loved it. Kudos to ASI experts and makers of this documentary.",False

7,10,AMAZING!,amubecurious,n/a,16/08/2025,"Secrets of Sinauli: Discovery of the Century is a blend of history, science, technology and mythology.
An archaeological site- Sinauli, located in Baghpat district in western UP, is reported to be the largest necropolis of the Chalcolithic period (between 2000 BC and 700 BC) in India. The excavation at Sinauli unearthed a 4000-year old chariot, copper weapons and warrior burials. The chariot is encased in copper and is believed to be the oldest surviving physical evidence of the chariot ever to be discovered in the world. Alongside, there are also shields, bows and arrows, spears, swords, helmets, axes and other copper weaponry that have been unearthed from the burial sites.",False

13,7,People are rating the findings and not the documentary,OnjiMooteDaMarle,n/a,16/08/2025,"I appreciate what ASI is doing (that is their duty though) but this documentary is a little irritating. No matter how happy I was watching this doc, more of the explanations were in the animated parts & so many archeologists and professors speaking about it which is great but one needn't cut half a dialogue from one person and continue to the next. The editing was irritating. IMDB users are so happy that something of this size & time has been found that everyone is rating 10/10. This IMDB rating is for the documentary and not for the finding. The animation part should have been very little and more about the findings and how they cleaned it up, why they used whatever to clean it, excavate it, how many villagers had already taken away what artefacts etc. Had to be explained. This looked like Neeraj was in a hurry to show this before any other Bollywood film maker could get hold of it.",False

15,9,Befitting reply to leftist distorians !,hemantmrm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watch it for striking excavation discoveries, the narration, script and dialogues won't let you get bored.The shield, sword and small standing chariot proves that it was designed for horse and not for bull. If you read Wikipedia page of Sinauli you will find claims and links of JNU distorians and those who have never visited the site personally. But truth cannot be suppressed.9/10 for being truthful and tight direction.",False
16,10,Absolutely loved it,imsanskarsharma,n/a,16/08/2025,Archeological sites are boring if you go there and visit in person. But the way they showed us in the documentary was exact scenerio in the mindset of the excavator or archeologists. Their hardwork is recognised by this means. Thank you for this amazing documentary,False
17,10,The great Indian civilization,msanilkumar-02952,n/a,16/08/2025,"Actually our civilization is not after english ruling era we are belongs to an civilization which is 6000 year old, Our Ved and Puran is the key of the information and the Granth of SANATAN is the key for every scientific research, Germans were understand much early and america was implement it early and we Indians are only understand that these Granths are divided us, My opinion to every indian please learn it",False

21,10,Literally the best,dhruvjagannath-60102,n/a,16/08/2025,"Quest for one's own history,quest for one's own ancestors is probably the most important question for a civilization. Animation,facts & figures, casting top of the archaeologists and experts in the documentary speaks about the credibility, truness and dedication of the director and the team. Highly recommended to the one(indians) who are interested in knowingnowing about their true history..",False

23,7,"Excellent documentary, but possibly influenced by political propaganda",abhi-wink,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is undoubtedly an excellent show. The VFX are great and the narration by Manoj Bajpai is superb. The archaeological findings from Sinauli have been presented nicely. The only thing which puts doubts in my mind is that the archaeologists, without any firm reasons are strongly correlating the findings to Indian mythology. The inferences should generally be made based on facts, but it looks like people with existing beliefs trying to justify it with the findings. While the show is for entertainment, I hope the archaeologists are actually doing their research without any preconceived notions.
""India was a land of rich and advanced culture from an ancient time"", this can be depicted from the findings. But are we the descendents of the same race or is it related to our mythological stories, can't be assumed from the findings at this stage.I am not an expert in this area, but I have just shared my opinion.",False
24,5,Ok but not good,anirbanbh-51263,n/a,16/08/2025,"Do not expect it to be a scientific documentary. It is not sufficient to say our people were great. You have to prove it by scientific means. This documentary is high on rhetoric, low on facts and analysis.Still it is an okay effort considering we have so few documentaries on History.",False
25,10,awesome series,ashuthakursagar,n/a,16/08/2025,After a long time i have seen someone is trying to put real history of indian. thank you for this series hats off to you sir,False

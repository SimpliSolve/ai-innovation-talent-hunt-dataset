1,7,Intriguing but felt incomplete at times,avenuesf,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was fortunate to have seen this through Sundance's 2021 virtual film festival, and it was followed by a Q and A with the filmmakers.I've always considered Luchino Visconti's 1971 film ""Death in Venice"" to be a masterpiece and I've wondered whatever happened to Bjorn Andresen after its release. Like the title of this documentary, he was often referred to as ""the most beautiful boy in the world."" This film illustrates yet another example of what the effects of sudden fame can do to a pre-teenager, especially one that had been objectified so specifically by his looks. He was idolized in Japan, introduced to record deals, and doted on by gay men (although he doesn't describe any sexual events or abuse, just being paraded as a ""trophy.""). There is a particularly disquieting clip of a conference in Cannes in which Visconti speaks to the French press and describes him solely as just a body. There's also a clip of his screen test for DIV, which I found fascinating.What becomes clear as the film progresses is that fame was particularly lonely to Mr. Andresen because he and his sister had been abandoned by their mother, a single parent, at a very young age. He was left with a grandmother that pushed him into auditioning for the Visconti film role because she wanted him to become a star.Unlike most documentaries, the film slowly answers questions as it unfolds. At one point we follow him into an archive where he discovers that his mother's body was found in the woods by authorities in 1966. It's not clear in the film if she had committed suicide or had been murdered (the filmmakers during the Q and A explained it was suicide), but it's an incredibly intimate and painful scene that I almost felt voyeuristic watching. We also learn that during his marriage he lost a son to SIDS, which he blames himself for because he was drinking heavily at the time and didn't feel he had the tools to be a father.Much like ""Death in Venice,"" there is a sad, melancholy tone that pervades throughout most of the documentary's running time. Mr. Andresen has all the signs of a man suffering from clinical depression, but the film never touches on whether or not he's ever received professional help for it. The filmmakers described during the Q and A session that they had a lot of material they left on the cutting room floor in order to keep the film at a an acceptable running time. Some of the details seemed crucial to me: there's no description of his marriage in 1983, just a few photographs. Additionally, IMDB lists close to 50 film and tv roles Mr. Andresen has been in, but the only one that's illustrated in the documentary is a scene from Ari Aster's ""Midsommar.""""The Most Beautiful Boy in the World"" succeeds at being a very poignant portrayal of its subject. I recommend it, but feel that some important aspects of Mr. Andresen's life were left out that would have given me a more complete picture of who he is. The filmmakers stated they purposely put the film together so the audience could read between the lines; that works for the film in some ways but works against it in others.",True
2,6,More intriguing than illuminating,ozjosh03,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a fascinating documentary, particularly for anyone who knows Luchino Visconti's Death in Venice and is therefore already acquainted with the haunting beauty of the young Bjorn Andresen, who played Tadzio. The Most Beautiful Boy in the World is sumptuously photographed and deftly edited to create a legend around Andresen's main claim to fame - and therein lies the problem. It gradually becomes apparent that the producer-directors of this doco are hellbent on the main narrative being that of a beautiful innocent corrupted and all but destroyed by his youthful brush with movie fame. While nobody ever explicitly speaks in terms of a Death in Venice curse, it's very much implied in the shots of an aged and frail Andresen gazing along the same beach where his younger, more carefree self frolicked while making the film; and in the all-to-clear parallels between the lost, lonely old Andresen and Dirk Bogarde's pathetic, crumbling Aschenbach. What's troubling is that the documentary makers are quite clearly determined not to allow too many facts to get in the way of their myth-making. The emphasis is all on instant fame and the pressures of being labelled ""The Most Beautiful Boy in the World"" leading to Andresen having a deeply troubled life. In fact, this is 90% of the film, with stern fingers pointed at Andresen's fame-obsessed grandmother and some sly, not-entirely-justified jabs at Visconti for their parts in exploiting the boy. There's much less examination of Andresen dealing with a mentally unstable mother, his mother's grisly death when he was still a child, his loss of his own child to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome or his struggles as a husband and father. All of these likely had a bigger impact on Andresen's life than briefly being a poster boy for youthful beauty, and they can't all be conveniently traced directly to his Death in Venice experience. The filmmakers also curiously omit any mention of Andresen actually having a fairly extensive film and TV career after Death in Venice, leaving the false impression that playing Tadzio not only led nowhere, but more or less destroyed him. Frankly, by the end of this weirdly deceitful exercise I formed the impression that Bjorn Andresen has been more egregiously wronged by The Most Beautiful Boy in the World than he ever was by Death in Venice.",False
3,6,Things happen,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bjorn Andresson's mother committed suicide when he was very young. He was then cast in Visconti's film 'Death in Venice', as Tadzio, who was, in the eyes of the film's main protagonist, ""the most beautiful boy in the world"". Subsequently, he does not consider himself to have had a very happy life. We're all made, at least in part, by our experiences; Bjorn, perhaps, was not well-served by his. Because his story is so particular, and peculiar, there's some interest here; but at the same time, things happen to all of us. One doesn't have to blame Bjorn for how his life turned out to see that there aren't stright lines between its beginning and its end; and sadly, there are many people who are unhappy and depressed, even those whose lives have contained little of external note. Sometimes, it's more interesting to watch a documentary than a fiction inspired by the truth; here, I felt that a novelisation of Bjorn's life might bee interesting than a straighforward reporting.",False
4,6,Tadzio grown up,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. In 1971, renowned Italian film director Luchino Visconti announced he had cast ""the most beautiful boy in the world"" as Tadzio in his new film, DEATH IN VENICE. Co-directors Kristina Lindstrom and Kristian Petri document the story of how Bjorn Andresen's life took him from beautiful to broken. It's a tragic tale of how adults wrecked a young man's shot at happiness.The directors do not shy away from showing both sides of Bjorn - then and now. Clips from his audition for Visconti include a creepy photo shoot where 15 year old Bjorn is asked to bare his torso. Two things are clear: the youngster is quite uncomfortable, and he's truly beautiful by most anyone's standards (except for the ""Eye of the Beholder"" episode of The Twilight Zone). Modern day Bjorn sports the scars of life. Deep facial wrinkles are the price of decades of smoking cigarettes. A long gray mane of hair punctuated with heavy facial hire help hide what was once a beautiful boy from the world.When we first meet Bjorn, he's living in a filthy (truly disgusting) apartment and facing eviction. His girlfriend Jessica helps him clean the place, preventing him from having to move from his home of many years. Over the course of the documentary, we hear from Bjorn's sister, a friend of his mothers, his Governess, Casting Director Margareta Krantz, and Bjorn's daughter Robine. We learn of many tragic experiences Bjorn endured. These include his mother, an unknown father, his misguided Granny, and his 10 month old son. Beyond all of these unfortunate elements, we simply can't shake the creepiness of Bjorn's first meeting with director Visconti.Exploitation is the best word I can come up with - not just for the audition and photo shoot, but also the subsequent marketing appearances at film festivals. DEATH IN VENICE (based on the Thomas Mann novel) has long been entrenched in gay cinema lore, and in the movie, Tadzio (played by Bjorn) is the object of an older man's desire. Knowing what we do of Visconti, and seeing what we do in the audition clips, our mind goes places we would rather it not.Bjorn Andresen is an unusual subject to choose for a documentary, and not much time is spent on the adult life of the now 66 year old man. Connecting the dots of the tragedies in his life makes his current situation understandable, but this is a man who has taught music and continued to periodically act ... he has a memorable scene in the recent MIDSOMMAR (2019), yet his demeanor and physical appearance leave us seeing a shell of a man. This is certainly not an uplifting profile, but the cautionary tales are plentiful.In theaters September 24, 2021.",False
5,n/a,Exploitative?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Did anyone else feel really uncomfortable with the way the filmmakers handled Bjorn reading the details surrounding his mother's death?It's clearly a very traumatic experience for him, and quite right too, but the film makers refuse to cut away, keeping the camera rolling as it edges closer and closer to Bjorn's face.Now maybe Bjorn requested that they don't shy away from capturing that moment, but it just didn't sit well with me. Particularly from a film whose key angle is the exploration of Bjorn's potential exploitation as a child. Can you really cry ""exploitation"" whilst being exploitative?",False
6,6,Felt incomplete,justkidding42,n/a,16/08/2025,"Intriguing story, good cinematography but the overall story felt incomplete at times.Maybe it was the run time that didn't do it for me, 92 min felt too much for this kind of story and what the creators were trying to say, maybe it's the fact that I personally prefer documentaries with more of a ""did he or did he not"" feeling in their storytelling.Maybe that's just me.Never mind besides my review I really hope the protagonist of the documentary finds his inner peace eventually, he seams like a genuinely good guy.",False
7,7,When fame at a young can be a problem,dougdemelo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary points to a particular case of this boy, who's grandmother tried to get her grandson to make into the film industry. Like many parents were hoping their sons got Tadzio's part, Björn was the one who got it. But unlike many young stars we know, he had problems copping with the attention for being shy and also having family problems didn't particularly helped him. In no way I see him been exploited. He just needed more feedback maybe.",False
8,9,Almost too close ...,hesteraalberts,n/a,16/08/2025,"A rare example of extreme proximity to the subject of this compelling documentary.,The moment that he tells about the death of his son is heartbreakingly honest. So much respect for this man that lost his mother, never knew his father, fell into the hands of an over ambitious and selfish grandma, was selected, owned, degraded and discarded by Visconti, couldn't grow up normally because of his instant fame and could never get rid of Tadzio ever again.",False
9,9,Puzzle of a downfall child.,ulicknormanowen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very interesting documentary about a human being sacrificed on the altar of the Seventh Art ;in 1972 , Visconti was at the peak of his genius and he had flair for discovering actors (Helmut Berger ,one of his lovers ,was prodigious in ""la cadeti dei degli"" and ""Ludwig"".)So he spent some time to find the beautiful boy who would fascinate Dirk Bogarde in the fascinating ""death in Venice"" ;but,unlike Berger, Bjorn was still a child , traumatized by his mom's death when he was too young; although the director insisted the boy was his protégé and his love remained platonic, he did not seem to realize the young actor was overtaken by events : the newsreel at the movie première is revealing :the boy seems to live in a dream , or rather a sweet nightmare :he seems ill-at-ease among these stars (you can spot Romy Schneider on one photograph) and he never was to get over this ""too much too soon"" celebrity .The doc blends the past ( the boy photographed from every angle ,even shirtless, pictures of Venice and of the places where the movie took place) and the present : Bjorn has become a long-haired bearded gaunt man (born 1955) ,old before his time ; the first scene in his apartment shows a guy who does not take care of himself ; his half-sister was perhaps his only helping hand when he was a kid, now she's replaced by his daughter even though his marriage was a failure ; now the man wanders aimlessly on the beach, watching the sea;he has returned to Venice ,but although he has become (reluctantly) a gay icon, his life was forever destroyed in a luxury hotel where Silvana Mangano was only a celluloid mother.",False
10,4,Not a complete picture of the real man,kitteninbritches,n/a,16/08/2025,"There isn't that much written about Bjorn Andresen and not many interviews that I've read but I formed the impression that after making Death in Venice ( a film I love and have watched many times) he became what they call these days ""entitled"" and assumed because he'd been lucky enough to land the role of Tadzio (which didn't call for much in the way of acting ability,) the rest of his career should have been one long success. This didn't happen though he has had a number of acting roles during his adult life, details of which were hardly mentioned. I got the impression this change to semi obscurity left him resentful. I've met him several times and this impression was borne out. This unflattering aspect of his character was never explored, in case sympathy was lost I suppose. Although for some reason the row with his much younger girlfriend on the phone did give a glimpse of it!The film was also very unbalanced, a few seconds view only of the famous film and Venice itself, nothing at all of the beautiful Hotel des Bains where it was set and far far too much time spent on his time in Japan. Very little said about his marriage, which ended after (I originally understood) to be the ""cot death"" of his younger child but in fact according to him, occurred because he passed out on the child while sharing a bed with him through intoxication. There seemed a distance between himself and his grown up daughter too though they were friendly. In fact I wonder whether this emotional detachment is a feature of the Swedish character and a reason why they seem to find relationships difficult to maintain. So I remain unconvinced that the Death in Venice experience as it were paved the way to a later unsatisfactory life, via exploitation etc. It played its part by raising expectations, but any unsatisfactoriness in later life must be mainly attributed to the kind of person Bjorn is.I was interested to see he has a sister, something I've never till now heard mentioned, and that his mother was much more present in their younger lives than I'd realised. Yes, an intrinsically flawed personality albeit of an intelligent and not untalented man. I don't think we can blame Death in Venice for that.",False

12,3,Could've been a great one,kozakiewiczjulia,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film could have been a true gem. Sadly, the fascinating background story of Luchino Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" quickly dissolves into a diluted, weird, shallow and to be honest simply boring exploration of what happened to the most beautiful boy in the world (without at all creating an in-depth portrait). All of the most interesting moments and crucial story parts were actually in the trailer which is great, but there's not much more to this film than the trailer.",False
13,4,Hard done by?,Claresteers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Our sympathies follow this spectral Gothic figure as the familiar tale of instant fame followed by disillusionment is played out.Not an actor (his acting in DIV minimal and awkward) and defined by his looks, I wish he had followed full time his talent for music. Watching him listening to his own playing of Chopin was revealing. But the musical part of his life is left out of this film and therein lies the imbalance.Obviously a depressive which may have been inherited from his mother, would his life have been much different without DIV? Impossible to live with and self pitying.I'm not sure why his grandmother comes in for such blame here. Using opportunities as they arise is not blameworthy. She surely would have wanted him to have a happy life, she brought the two children up and his sister seems to be well adjusted,",False
14,4,"All questions, no answers",sarahcoleman-79272,n/a,16/08/2025,"The whole film keeps you thinking ""NOW we'll find out......OK, this will explain everything"" and it never does. Bjorn floats through the whole thing artfully coiffed in dramatic long coats, gazing pensively out of windows, but ultimately we are none the wiser. Appeared in a film as a kid, no follow up film career to speak of, didn't handle it well. Unfortunately a very familiar tale of flash in the pan success that promised a lot but left another aspirational youngster high and dry. This is probably the highest point of his career since Death in Venice. Disappointing and over long.",False
15,2,manipulation at its worst,calvintoronto,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt must be devastating to lose a child. To have lost your mother. To have been a child actor unaccustumed to fame and its ugly sides. To have suffered in many ways.But if you want to see an entire life documented in such a way as to make a person the eternal victim, then this is your film. There's nothing worse than being manipulated, like this film is doing. Early on, we are told that the crew of the film is all gay (which is highly unlikely) and that Visconti ""protected"" Andresen. What? What's this all about? It's never explained and it doesn't have to be explained because the implication is the stereotype that the gay crew would, of course, pounce upon the boy. FFS. Then, he is taken to a gay bar, which is not a good thing to have done, admittedly. But Andresen says that he felt that all the men looking at him were, ""in their minds,"" having sex with him. Is this true? Who knows? All we have is his word on this. And this is followed by ""I don't know how I got home that night,"" and this statement just hangs there, so as to suggest that something bad happened to him because predatory homosexuals. There is a spontaneous sexualization of any sort of relationship with a homosexual, and this film sure plays that ugly trope up.Then, we see him drinking what appears to be a bottle of wine. What's the context? Who knows? It doesn't matter because it's meant to suggest that Andresen, under the immense pressure of fame (and those nasty homosexuals) has taken to drinking. The film drifts off to his mother's suicide, and we come to understand that, yes, that was a tragedy. It is seriously awful, what happened to him. But then a former girlfriend says to him over the phone what a pig etc he is; and so we're given to believe that none of this -- his being a pig etc -- was really his fault because, well, he's been traumatized his entire life. Then we're on to speculation, from his daughter, how damaged he is/was and if his mother had been alive, the entire Death in Venice experience wouldn't have been so difficult -- and segue to an interview where we're back to, yup, gay men looking at him, as the interviewer reminds us, and Andresen stumbles all over his words -- and why? To make him look damaged, still, by that filming experience.We're not done. The interview segues to an experience he had in 1976, when he came to Paris for a year to make a film. Is he 15? No, he's 21. But the documentary slides from Death in Venice so imperceptably to Paris, with men courting him, that you are made to feel that he is still the same victim he was before. The sound from the violins deepen, to accentuate the ill feeling. We finish off with more recollections of Death in Venice and voice overs bemoaning what happened on set -- when in fact nothing untoward happened on set. Andresen's audition is on film and there are always many people around him (as we recall that his grandmother was on set as was a nanny, 24/7).Seems to me that in the end the documentarians were looking for a story with a good hook and found one: Attractive hild actor suffers the vagaries of fame and grows up into an unhappy and difficult adult. This is a sad story, but it's not a new one. What we end up with, with this film is the re-exploitation of a man's tragedies. We learn nothing, and the stereotypes we may have (about gay men, in particular) are reaffirmed. What a waste of everyone's time.",True

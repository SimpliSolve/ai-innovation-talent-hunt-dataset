1,7,Jokes toned down on offensiveness compared to previous,averagedeveloper,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am someone who follows foreign standups almost only on Netflix. Jimmy Carr has his own offensive humor. When I searched for something similar, I couldn't find it, at least not on Netflix. There was no one who gave me the feeling of ""You couldn't have really said that"" as much as this man. In this show, I don't know if it was Netflix, Carr's advancing age, or the current structure of society, I felt like he wasn't using his punches fully and was holding back. There were a few positive messages squeezed in that you sometimes come across in standups. I wonder if this was a Netflix commission or the artist's own choice. It made me laugh out loud in a few places, but I'd like to see a Jimmy Carr getting filthy beyond comprehension.",False
2,6,Jimmy Carr delivers his usual funny and edgy stuff...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do generally enjoy the somewhat edgy comedy that Jimmy Carr delivers. And thus I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch this 2024 stand-up comedy special.Sure, I had not heard about it, prior to stumbling upon it by perusing the stand-up comedy collection on Netflix, but still I had some expectations to the show, as Jimmy Carr usually delivers good stuff.And I will say that the 2024 show ""Jimmy Carr: Natural Born Killer"" definitely is an enjoyable and entertaining show to watch. Jimmy Carr does what he does best, so it is either a take it or leave it situation, I guess. Either you like his edgy material or you don't, as he easily can offend those with frail levels of tolerance and a lack of humor.I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the 59 minutes that the show ran for. And if you are a fan of Jimmy Carr, then you definitely will enjoy this 2024 show.My rating of ""Jimmy Carr: Natural Born Killer"" lands on a six out ten stars.",False
3,6,Nothing lasts forever.,macc99,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant comics age, just like everything else, and Jimmy Carr is a brilliant comic.He's one of the smartest, funniest, most inventive British comics of his era, but the nature of being sharp and inventive is that it has a shelf-life. There are still flashes of the old brilliance but a lot of it feels like treading old ground. That's not to say that he can't get back to his old level of brilliance, because great comics can adapt and reinvent themselves.The ""I'm so edgy"" shtick is just cringe, and pretty standard for many comics whose glory days are behind them. Just make sure you have the best material, and get on with telling the jokes. It's not the 1950's and the only people who are ""offended"" are newspaper columnists who are only pretending to be for adclick revenue. Truth is, most people aren't actually watching - they have their own lives to get on with.If anyone is genuinely offensive, they won't get a Netflix special - the comic genius of Jerry Sadowitz is an example. It's tough for ageing comics but it is possible for them to revive their act. It starts with them admitting to themselves that their act needs reviving, not deluding themselves that they're an ""edgy"" 51 year-old.",False
4,7,I guess some people are easily offended...,deloudelouvain,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jimmy Carr brings another show with the kind of jokes we're used from him, the short one liners that make you think for a second, and that makes you giggle once you got the pun. Of course you will get people that get offended as his jokes are raw and risqué, but then again he's doing this for ages so why would you even watch his shows if you're that easily offended? Anyway, Natural Born Killer might not be his best performance but it's certainly good enough if you like Jimmy Carr. He joked about every delicate subject possible so I'm not surprised he gets negative reviews. But if you think you can laugh at anything and everything just give this show a go, you might enjoy it.",False
5,n/a,Is stand up comedy dead?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I mean if even Jimmy Carr cannot produce better material than this who else could?He talks about his feeling that he may lost his edge and he is totally right. Having a kid changes you. Sadly he doesn't realize this but the audience does.He is not the same guy who told the brilliant mosquito joke. Other than the emotional and mental change he looks different, too. Really skinny and tired.Honestly I could not remember a single joke from this last special it was so ordinary and boring. What a disappointment.I don't know what's going on with these stand up comedians lately but they all lack something which they had in the past.",False
6,7,Give it a try only if this isn't your first time watching him,chris-fussel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like other say this is absolutely not for the faint of heart. If you've watched him before you know what to expect but to be honest there was only about 10 minutes that weren't vulgar and unnecessary sex jokes. I've seen all of his other specials and I do love the guy, which is why I hate to say this was disappointing. He can do better than this, and yes his thing is to deliberately cross the line. I have a dark sense of humor but even this was too much. It's not his best material and it's not for everyone. His worst special by far. I can't recommend enough if you're going to watch this wear headphones or risk people you live with who are easily offended and cannot understand the concept that he doesn't mean what he's saying and only joking. I recommend giving it a try but NOT if this is your first time watching him.",False
7,10,Not for the faint of heart. Thankfully!,dobraashe,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was my first time watching comedian Jimmy Carr. He has a very unique style for North American audiences that took me about 20 minutes or so to catch on. Once I did, I couldn't stop laughing - out loud! His rapid but pointed delivery style reminds me of the fellows (Cleese, Palin, etc.,) from the classic Monty Python films and Fawlty Towers shows that I watched when I was young.He is not only great at one liner jokes and double entendres but he has an incredible knack for telling stories while engaging unsuspecting members from the audience.I'm happy to see he has many more comedy specials that I can catch up on.",False
8,8,Offensive and witty. Sometimes corny,Hoebagolo,n/a,16/08/2025,Definitely goes over a ton of controversial subjects so will likely offend a lot of people for differing reasons. I'd say over 90% of his material can be considered offensive. He talks fast so there's a lot of jokes. I'd say 1/3 funny 1/3 decent 1/3 corny. One second I'd think he's being over the top or offensive for the shock. Then he'd do the same thing but I'd find it funny. Really tough to judge when every joke is so unique to the person hearing it. But if u don't get offended you'll find more than enough to stick through. I watched alone and lold at least a dozen times. Going into this I'd seen his other specials no more than once and always thought he was decent. This special was better than expected to me. But ya a lot of the jokes weren't huge crowd pleasers so it's hard to recommend to everyone. I also forget his old material specifically but know he's always leaned intro controversial topics so this seemed on brand for him.,False
9,5,Motion Sickness (Not joking),egzirsah,n/a,16/08/2025,"This stand-up special by Jimmy Carr is the first time I have not enjoyed his work. I do not mean that his jokes were not funny. On the contrary, I found much of the material to be pretty good, not his best, but pretty good. Even so, I emitted no more than a chuckle throughout the show. That is because the camera work in this is unprecedented, and not in a good way.Every so often the camera operator would repeat a moving shot of Jimmy by coming in from the side of the stage, all in for a close-up of him talking and then continue passing all the way across in front of him, followed by circling behind him.I found this pointless continual movement so distracting that it made me utterly lose track of the topics and not even hear what he was saying. I cannot recall ever seeing this before in any stand-up special ever, by anyone. This began early in the routine and was repeatedly used all the to the end. I found it so off-putting that the only time I laughed was when I was not actually looking at the screen.My main emotional response was not laughter, but rather feeling bad for his audience in the theater. I wonder how they remained in a humorous mood when I can only imagine they were having their show spoiled by absurd camerawork being performed directly in their line of sight. I would love to know about why this approach was used and the chain of poor judgment that allowed it to happen. It must be utterly bizarre or tragically pathetic.Thank you for reading this.",False
10,10,Funny as!!!,campbellsimpson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is hilarious! A full show of one liners, this is one of the BEST standup comedy shows ever made! He is possibly the funniest person on earth!With a controversial set that is so gender, racial and religiously indiscriminate it's got a laugh for every race, gender, creed and religion that will have you in absolute stitches!Well done Jimmy and well done Netflix for supporting and promoting such a well rounded choice that is for all people who are willing to laugh at themselves and also reflect on the contradictions of modern day encounters.Will watch over and over again, best stand up of all time!!!",False
11,4,Must do better,broughts,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm generally a fan of Jimmy Carr but Natural Born Killer is just awful. It reeks of a desperation to be 'edgy' and puts more focus on seeking to offend than it does to be funny.Don't get me wrong, there are funny moments, but they are too few and far between to rescue the performance.The number of times that he seemingly had to prompt the audience to laugh was embarrassing. I really wanted to enjoy the show and I fought through the want to turn off after 15 minutes...how I now wish I'd have taken that option...Jimmy seems to have become the offensive, out of touch, creepy uncle who only seems able to entertain himself. Sad & disappointing.",False
12,10,Jimmy Carr Further Cements his Legacy,Jblum5,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a former standup comedian , I am in constant awe at how well Jimmy Carr writes jokes. From a technical level, he is a master and has been a master for 2+ decades. I don't know of anyone else who can do it quite like him.Saying this special is ""trash"" is like saying you don't like a painting because you don't like the color yellow. Those reviews come off as hallow, superficial and sad. Comedy has a somewhat unique issue in that some of the loudest critics tend to NOT be fans of comedy. It is one of the only forms of art that deal with this. If a painter paints something, there aren't 100 people commenting how offensive it is who have never looked at paintings before.I for one - despise Game of Thrones. Two seasons in I thought ""when is this going to get good?"" and never watched it again. I don't necessarily believe it's bad show; it's just not for me. ""Natural Born Killer"" may not be for you. It does not make it a bad show. Even I would be personally offended by a few of these jokes if said outside a comedy show. However the writing is masterful, and they come at such a pace that there are more jokes coming to make you laugh again. It features many of his one liners, dipping his toe into every controversial issue he can conjure up and then moving on.I have seen it twice, and enjoyed it both times. There are a few lulls (the last 7 minutes aren't the best) but overall I would classify it as yet another masterpiece from Jimmy Carr. If you like the art of standup comedy - this is an obvious must watch.",False
13,10,Yet Another Masterpiece,PersianComedyCritic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jimmy carr never fails to Deliver with his one liner style of comedy. In fact he is the best at it, with dave attel being the second best.His natural ability to twist almost any story into a dark humored joke is uncanny, and the fact that he can tackle any social issue, completely change the subject and then turn back to the issue while delivering 50 punchlines just make him the best of his style of comedy.He has always been in my top 5 best comedians of our era (which would basically be the golden era of comedy), and my opinion had only been strengthened watching this special.Truly a natural born killer. Many years later, still top notch comedy !",False
14,4,Disappointing,Bezza85,n/a,16/08/2025,I love Jimmy Carr and comedians who ain't afraid to offend.Jimmy Carr- natural born killers is what I was really looking forward to seeing bit it was just awful. He just tried to be as creepy as possible and you can tell the audience most of the time just wasn't feeling it either.I watched it all hoping he would get funnier but you can see he is just signalling for the audience to laugh.All us atheists find Religious jokes funny but he seemed a bit scared to tell any Muslim jokes and that's not the Jimmy Carr we love to see.I do prefer his last stand up and you'll just have to see it for yourself.,False
15,10,Our eternal 14 year old is maturing,galning-05144,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHonestly who would be a comedian now?Around the time of the release of His Dark Material there were weeks of outrage, over a joke, and Politicians were giving soundbites, around what should happen to his career. At that time other comedians were having gigs cancelled (the ones who were not established enough to push back) and there were instances of people reporting jokes, from a comedy gig, to the Police.Meanwhile some venues brought in contracts which they insisted that comics sign, before they would book them, stating that they would confirm to their ""decency"" rules.Jimmy, like several other comedians that tell dark or edgy jokes, had introduced trigger warnings some years ago - explaining in promos and at the start of the show that the Terribly Funny shows were ""about"" terrible things, but were not the things themselves.Now we FFWD to Natural Born Killer - and, on certain social platforms and review boards - the knives have come out.Some complain that jokes were too shocking (like he hadn't been in the business almost 25 years), some that they are not shocking ENOUGH (claiming that they themselves say more extreme things on forums and that the trigger warning had over-promised). Some have even complained that there are too many one liners (after tuning in to see the King of one liners) and others don't like that he is experimenting with more long-form material. You ""can't please all of the people"", as they say.And many, many more (on X) have never even watched this special - they are just doling out payback for the vax joke in the last one.So, what is it like? The first 15-20 minutes the pace is slower than I personally would like. The material is still good - but if it's not his usual fastball then I find myself mentally guessing the punchline. Plus, he seems uncharacteristically nervous and takes a while to settle down.Where I think it comes into its own is in the 2nd half, the new long form stuff. Without giving anything away the ""consent"" routine is clever, well thought out and went down a storm every show (I attended a couple of the live shows and other shows - I saw tweets from delighted parents).The routine that starts with the birth of his son is also excellent and brings in to play the difference in roles / responsibilities of mothers versus fathers. This is a big divergence from his usual machine gunning of jokes and some of his fans are not keen. But there are only so many variations of d*ck jokes he can write and I think these new routines show growth. At some point he has to be morph into some semblance of a grown up.It's not as rapid fire as previous specials and the crowd interactions are a bit muted (Aylesbury are not quite as rowdy as other DVD or Netflix special crowds have been). But it has to get a high score (from me) for the quality of the new longer pieces. They may not be as laugh-out-loud funny as one liners, but they are thought provoking.I love it.It's in Netflix's Top 10 listing in 28 different countries - so he's doing something right.",True
16,1,Jimmy needs a new shtick,gkemerer,n/a,16/08/2025,"After trying to watch some of the netflix comics and removing them almost immediately after beginning to watch them due to their general boring, unfunny acts, I was really hoping I was going to be in for an hour of fun. Unfortunately, that was not to be. I really tried to give this piece of crap a chance but I just couldn't bear it and had to give up after ten or fifteen minutes. Vulgar, unfunny one-liners with Jimmy pausing for the expected laughter, which never came. Then there's the perpetual look of surprise on his face, like he's waiting for the audience to respond to this shocking comment. My response is to turn it off and find something else to watch that is actually funny.",False
17,5,Just not that funny anymore,boedicia50,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPeak Jimmy Carr was very funny but he has been on a steady
downward spiral for last decade.This latest Netflix special he just comes over as slightly desperate.Way too long pauses after every joke his eyes darting around to see if he has offended anyone. You haven't Jimmy unless it is crimes against humour.Rather than just 1 or 2 actual offensive jokes about a sensitive subject he now devotes 5 minutes to each one and it loses all effect.Coupled with the awful waste of time ""educating"" a 19 year old who was with his Dad about consent and Jimmy's version of how couples should have sex which went on way too long and was just not funny.Even worse the punchline to all this went down like a lead balloon.Awkward silence so he repeated it several times.Stick to lame quiz shows on TV Jimmy, your stand up has had its day.",True
18,1,Terrible,erica-84830,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Jimmy Carr for some time but this latest offering is abysmal. Should've switched off after ten minutes as I wanted to but I watched to the end in the hope it would improve. It was painful. His 'jokes' weren't even funny, just embarrassing. Simply standing there spouting one-liners just didn't cut it. The room was eerily quiet whilst he waited for laughs and it was a good thing he was laughing at his own jokes because very few audience members were. Jimmy Carr seems to have turned into his own worse nightmare - a washed up comedian telling dad jokes. The second half did improve a little though, with a much cajoled audience participation and Carr becoming slightly more animated. Even so, I'm sorry to say, just not funny any more. What a waste of time this was.",False
19,2,Whatever happened to Jimmy Carr?,ricardolanzini,n/a,16/08/2025,"The latest addition to Netflix's comedy lineup, ""Natural Born Killer,"" leaves much to be desired, serving as a testament to the dwindling creativity of its once-vibrant comedian, Jimmy Carr. His comedic delivery has devolved into a frantic display of darting eyes, as if he's scanning the room for approval or perhaps dodging imaginary criticism from the ""woke police.""Throughout the special, Carr seems more preoccupied with testing the boundaries of acceptability than crafting genuinely funny material. His jokes often feel borrowed from a bygone era of comedy, lacking nuance or any semblance of thoughtful commentary. Instead, he resorts to hackneyed stereotypes and cheap shots at marginalised communities, all while laughing at his own jokes in a pitiful attempt to fill the void left by a dwindling audience response.It's evident that Carr struggles to find his footing amidst a comedy landscape that's evolving towards more inventive and socially conscious humour. While other comedians are pushing boundaries and challenging norms, Carr clings desperately to his outdated brand, doubling down on platitudinous clichés and tasteless punchlines.One of the most bewildering aspects of ""Natural Born Killer"" is Carr's insistence on portraying himself as a reprehensible character, making light of topics like rape and paedophilia without offering any meaningful commentary or insight. His attempts at moralising on subjects like consent and abortion fall flat when juxtaposed with his own crude and insensitive jokes.Finally, ""Natural Born Killer"" fails to deliver anything of substance, leaving viewers to wade through a sea of clichés in search of a single original joke. Carr's insistence on maintaining his outdated persona only serves to highlight his irrelevance in today's comedy landscape. As the special comes to a close with a misguided attempt at imparting wisdom to a teenage audience, it becomes painfully clear that Carr's brand of humour is well past its expiration date.",False
20,4,On the fence,laujk-63211,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew what I was getting in to when I decided to watch it.I've seen Jimmy live before, around 15 years ago and thought he was funny as hell.Unfortunately, his act still felt like it was 15 years ago.One liners intended to shock.Jimmy pausing with wide eyes and scanning the room to see if he's gotten away with it.I'm hard to shock as I imagine most of Jimmy's old fans would be. So unless you're new and unaware of what you're about to hear, don't expect to be shocked or laugh too much.While the one liners were meant to be offensive and funny, I felt that I had heard them all before.I found the funnier bits were the longer jokes/stories not the one liners.The joke about the supreme Court and the abortion was actually witty and clever.Jimmy Carr IS witty and clever.Which is why this show is a huge disappointment.Unfortunately, it was a bit painful to watch.",False
21,3,At least he doesn't constantly move around,mikeyboy26,n/a,16/08/2025,"I only watched the 20 minutes. Yes , had material that many would find offensive. Did i find that material actually funny? No. See the thing with offending, if used strategically it has impact in a performance. When used liberally ( like salt) it can spoil the meal. Too many short one liners for a quick laugh and he stands there arms out waiting for the audience to laugh. Looks and feels uncomfortable. I will say though .......to his credit he stands still for the ""whole"" performance which is a change form some comedians who constantly walk up and down the stage as if they are trying to get to their daily steps goal. I get dizzy especially when watching live.",False
22,3,Disappointing stand up,mikkilou,n/a,16/08/2025,"Half way through Jimmy Carr's new stand up, ""Natural Born Killer,"" and I've managed to laugh a mere two times. There's a noticeable lack of laughter from the audience too, which is odd considering this is the take that made it to release. His humour usually hits the mark for me, despite often skating on thin ice with the potential to offend.This time, though, it just isn't landing. The performance feels lackluster and fails to deliver the sharp wit and shock-value humour I was expecting. To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement-it's simply not up to par with his previous work.Very disappointing.",False
23,2,Seems like the end of the line or something,darkshad3,n/a,16/08/2025,"I used to love JCs shows, he could make hard jokes but they were just that. Audience participation has always been a thing but not to this level, that Jacob guy should be paid since he was featured in just about a quarter of the show. During the first part of his show he was clearly looking for audience approval, which didn't go very well and was sad to see as some of the silences were long and he didn't go on until he got the response he wanted... or demanded really. During the second half he switched to preaching about ""omg women are so amazing"" and ""consent is super important"". Jimmy, I used to watch you to get away from the constant barrage of preaching, now you're doing just that. It all just seemed like trying too hard, but without real effort, with preaching for clout I guess. Too bad, but it is what it is. Things change and I just won't be on the lookout for his material anymore. When I look for comedy I look for laughs and entertainment, not yet another person shouting talking points. I suppose he's just getting ready for retirement or something, so that in a few years he can do the rounds and say ""well I advocated for positive things"" etc. I don't know. But I do know that I won't see him the same way again after this.",False
24,3,Boring tiktok copy and paste,harryjoseluis,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerGot to say barely original mind numbing boredom wish I didn't renew my netflix on it but least baby reindeer was worth the netflix renew. Let's say the jokes weren't nothing original feel like heard them on tiktok from other comics . He barely dealt with hecklers like he did in the old days . I get it as the years go on the comedy probably sours down but he's seem to being back to being an amateur coz I've seen amateur sitting themselves doing better than this. But he was doing good on I literally just told you don't know why there wasn't more episodes. The delivery is not as good as he done it before it's like he lost magic and seems to pander to the feminist crowd because when you see him old days he didn't seem nervous or scared to punch there but seems like a frail old man.,True
25,4,Waste of time and preachy,jacdye,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's strange to spend the first act mocking those that preach to others, to then spend the entire second half doing exactly that. Since when was enthusiastic consent a talking point anywhere outside USA colleges? Hence the poor kid old not having a clue what jimmy was on about.The comedy part was also a bit lack lustre with the jimmy style barrage of one liners, with unsual pauses waiting for the audience to 'get it'. The middle part of the set at least had some redemption with more story focused jokes that landed better. Heckling was strangely absent from the recording which are some the best bits from previous shows.Overall a 4/10 but would not recommend as a watch.",True

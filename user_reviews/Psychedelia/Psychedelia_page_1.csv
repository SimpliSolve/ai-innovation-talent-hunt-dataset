1,8,Great introduction,suddiberg,n/a,15/08/2025,"It gives a great overview of the history of psychedelics, it effects, benefits and some risks.I doesn't goes to deep, and for the initiated it might be very little new, but as and introduction it works wonder. It for the interested, the curious and the ones that have little knowledge.While adding nothing new to the field, it helps spreading awareness, which is an important factor in todays society.With just under one hour the length is great for its audience. Most people can sit through one hour, even if they are not fully sold on the subject, and adding anything more gives the risk of just going to deep into everything.Its a subject of almost endless depth, and this movie does a great job of showing the tip of the iceberg, while hinting on what lies beneath the water.",False
2,9,A beautiful reminder,cdowsett-93965,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was deeply touched by the beautiful commentary and peaceful pacing of this short but sweet documentary. I myself have taken part in a therapeutic application of plant medicines, specifically for PTSD. It's been a while now since that time but this did such a beautiful job of bringing me back into the true egoless spirit that we all can learn so much from. I'm looking forward to a brighter future of acceptance and accessibility for psychedelic medicines.Thank you.",False
3,9,Wish it was longer!,thelkyoung,n/a,15/08/2025,"A great, concise insight into the history of psychedelic research and the current climate with first hand, personal accounts and stories included which really demonstrates the transformative power of what these plant medicines can do and the healing that is available to people that is evidence based and researched backed. Wish it was longer and there was more opportunity to deep dive into some of the areas covered. Highly recommend and would watch again.",False

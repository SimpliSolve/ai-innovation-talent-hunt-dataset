1,8,The End of the Storm,Prismark10,n/a,16/08/2025,Liverpool winning the Premier League after a 30 years drought spawned a number of documentaries.The title was achieved with the club taking a runaway lead and then there was the spectre of Covid 19.A global lockdown with the threat of the season being voided. It gave it an unusual drama.Made in cooperation with Jurgen Klopp and the members of the Liverpool team. The documentary also had contribution from supporters around the world including Wuhan in China.The documentary tracks the progress of the team and the supporters as the season unfolds.In the previous season the club were pipped to the title by one point but they did win the European Champions League.An enthralling and enjoyable documentary. You can understand Klopp's frustrations as Covid unfolded.However it also has to be noted the documentary was contrived. The footage of those global supporters was not in real time. It would be a stroke of luck that they got a group of Liverpool supporters from Wuhan in 2019.,False

6,10,"Legendary team, victorious against peps City, and a pandemic shut down. What a team.",biggusdickusv,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interviews with Jurgen and Alli pre personal family trauma put huge perspective on what realities the players have been going through since the beginning of the CV19 outbreak.Depicts the passion and groundedness of Jordan Henderson. One of the games most underrated players of the modern game.Gives greater understanding to the 2021 slump during the pandemic recovery. Even neutral fans will appreciate the emotive battles that the team faced post covid.Jurgen Klopp is one of those few people who can in an instant command your attention, make you buy into what he is saying, make you enthusiastic about whatever he is saying, then make you convince all your mates its better to follow his chain of thought ..... great film, well worth a watch.",False

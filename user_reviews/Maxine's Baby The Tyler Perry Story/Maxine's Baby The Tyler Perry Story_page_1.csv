1,7,"Tyler Perry Fans Will Appreciate It, But Does Little to Win Converts",IboChild,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Maxine's Baby: The Tyler Perry Story"" is a great ""rags to riches"" success story, but only a cursory analysis of Perry's body of work. Co-directed by. Gelila Bekele, Perry's ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child, the film rarely scratches below the surface of his life and career. People who are familiar with Tyler Perry probably already know about his difficult childhood and how he clawed his way into an industry that didn't really want him. Throughout the film, there are ample self-congratulatory comments by either Perry or his supporters that present opinions as fact and therefore not worthy of discussion. For example, the fact that several of his films opened at number one at the box office is synonymous with quality and/or commercial success, when in fact that is not always the case. Many films that open at number one are both critical and commercial failures, while films that never hit number one can often be huge successes. The little time spent on Perry's critics is limited to familiar soundbites that largely dismiss them as either elites, ""haters"" or ""dream killers."" At the same time, Perry's criticism of others is given a forum where his opinions are presented as fact with no interest in presenting an opposing point of view. In short, ""Maxine's Baby,"" will probably appeal to his fans and maybe a few others that appreciate his business sense, but does little win over the unconverted.",False
2,7,THE LIFE OF PERRY...?,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A current documentary airing on Amazon Prime regarding our favorite Madea performer, one Tyler Perry. Tracing his hard scrabble roots in New Orleans where he was in an abusive home (getting beaten by his father on the regular) but after finding a calling somewhat in the church where he could exercise his comedic muscles much to the chagrin of his pastor, he then wrote a stage play where he used his own money to stage it to widespread ignorance since practically no one showed up to see it. W/this outcome, Perry still maintained to push forward but not until he decided to put the show on in Atlanta did he finally gain traction w/the people which would become his bread & butter; a large black audience who would occasionally go to mainstream theatrical productions but found in Perry's a safe space for the type of characters they were more familiar & comfortable with. From this success, he decided to mount the same play but now as a film w/him playing his signature character, Madea, which struck a chord w/the viewing public creating a financial windfall for the production which Perry would replicate w/many of his subsequent releases. With the money coming in, Perry decided to flex his finances & build studios in vacant buildings finding it was not enough so setting his sights on an abandoned army base, the die was cast w/Perry buying the property thereby opening up the first black owned film studio complex (even naming some of the buildings after some current & past luminaries like Halle Berry, Spike Lee, Denzel Washington, Sidney Poitier, Oprah Winfrey, et al). Not shying away from the criticism that's dogged his career of his creations pandering to the lowest common denominator (something I myself have said when asked), Perry has embraced what his critics call his shortcomings & used them as strengths. A good doc to be sure but still feeling a bit like it was made inhouse where the Kool-aid was not only served but drank on repeat.",False
3,8,Brilliant,georgemeressa,n/a,16/08/2025,I never knew Tayler's journey and it was so moving to hear it. Going from such struggle in New Orleans growing up to owning his very own studio.It's always incredible to see the journey of ordinary people who go on to achieve such great things.I will almost certainly watch this again and with friends. His love for his mother reminds me of mine and the name of the show is just perfect.Don't usually write reviews for shows/ movies but this one I had to. This has made my Sunday and I would encourage everyone to go and watch it .I hope to one day visit the studio in Atlanta to see physically the great things that can be achieved.,False
4,10,Definitely A Must See! Outstanding,robbin_broaddus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Omg!! Mr. Tyler Perry Sir. My God!! This is worth Watching! You can feel, hear his story and you deserve everybit of success! When you truly allow God to rule and reign in your life, the Overflowing of Blessings your cup definitely runs over! It's moving and you can see the level of process that it took for Tyler Perry to get to where he is now. The rocks that was thrown he used them as stepping stones to walk through to the other side. When you watch this it will definitely give you hope that God has not forgotten about you. God is a reader of those that diligently seek him! Tanke a bow Tyler!",False
5,10,A man with God on his side.,pammo1949,n/a,16/08/2025,"The seasons of his life, childhood, teen years. Early adult hood were beautifully reproduced and garnered an immense amount of depth to assist in understanding the man - Tyler Perry. This documentary also allows the viewer to share his life's challenges, losses and failures and how he achieved mass success both career wise and financial successes. It extremely emotional documentary for me to digest. What I most appreciated about this documentary was it also showed the parasitic criticism of so many people who failed to understand that Tyler Perry is more than an a self centered business icon but a man with a plan that exceeds any criticism. He is portrayed as of of a man of vision that has catapulted him into national and international success. Just looking at the timeline and tracking his success (to this point). -- An American Story of the Fulfillment of Dreams. And philosophical lessons for many to learn. There is a Part Two to this story yet to be written and you can feel the power of commitment to the development of more and more groundbreaking achievement.",False
6,8,"So Inspiring With Lessons On The Importance Of Forgiveness, Faith And Perseverance.",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maxine's Baby: The Tyler Perry Story is a beautiful movie. This documentary is so inspiring with lessons on the importance of forgiveness, faith and perseverance. And I learned so much about Tyler Perry!The movie reveals the childhood trauma that Tyler Perry went through and shows how he became the most successful African American filmmaker we all know. It's also a tribute to his late mother, Maxine, hence the title of the movie.According to co-directors Gelila Bekele and Armani Ortiz, this movie took ten years to make. I had no idea what Tyler went through as a child because he had a pretty private life, so it was incredible to learn more about him and see how strong he is. We already know about his success, but in this documentary, we get to see all the challenges he faced. It highlights many aspects of his life like his faith, his abusive father, his previous studios, the start of his famous character Madea and the impact he had on the movie industry. Something else that is interesting that I learned about from this film is that Tyler Perry's newest studio is on an old confederate army base in Atlanta, which really makes this movie come full circle. The beauty of this rich documentary is that it provides so many different points of views from so many different people and perspectives. We hear from his supporters, his haters, his family, and his friends, such as Oprah Winfrey, Ozzie Areu, Gayle King and Ari Emanuel. In addition to hearing from all of these people, the movie also uncovers never-before-seen videos of Maxine Perry, Tyler's mom, which is really special since she has passed away and she's the movie's namesake.The film's message is all about forgiveness. Even after all the abuse, Tyler was able to forgive and move on from his trauma, which really allowed him to grow. Be aware that this movie deals with abuse, has a few graphic images and also some profanity.I give Maxine's Baby: The Tyler Perry Story 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. It releases on Prime Video on November 17, 2023. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!",False
7,6,Tyler Perry takes control of his destiny,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. For those who have scoffed at the ""Madea"" movies, or the periodic screen appearances of Tyler Perry in supporting roles, this documentary from Gelila Bekele (she and Perry share a child) and Armani Ortiz will open your eyes to the money-making machine and unstoppable force that is Tyler Perry. Clearly more of a tribute to his accomplishments than a deep dive into the man, his business, and his life, the film leaves us with full respect for what he has accomplished, as well as an understanding of an industry mogul who maintains complete control of his projects.The opening credits play like a four-minute trailer for the movie we are about to watch, and that's likely for the benefit of those who haven't been paying attention to Perry's ongoing success and his building of a media empire over the last two decades. Time is spent on his childhood in New Orleans, where sadly, he was so severely mistreated by his father that he later changed his name from Emmett Perry Jr to Tyler, in order to create the emotional distance he needed.His close friend Oprah Winfrey states that Perry ""turned pain into power"", and most of the film details how he went from self-financing a small theater production to constructing the sprawling Tyler Perry Studios on a 330-acre site in Atlanta that was originally the Confederate Army base, Fort McPherson. In fact, the 2019 grand opening of the studios is used as a bit of defining structure throughout, although it times, bouncing back and forth gives a sense of redundancy.The studios are quite impressive, as is the fact that Perry accomplished this outside of the traditional Hollywood system. And other than the remarkable 'rags-to-riches' story, it's Perry's ability to blaze his own unconventional trail that garners the most respect. He recognized the underserved and underestimated Black audience and committed to providing material for ""his audience"". Beginning with his first movie, DIARY OF A MAD HOUSEWIFE (2005), Perry worked his plan. While the critics bashed, the film cashed. Lionsgate President Michael Paseornek took notice, and again, Perry bucked the system by demanding creative control, ownership of his work, and establishing new parameters for TV series and syndication.Perry's work ethic is dwelled upon here, as is his love for his mother Willie Maxine Perry, who shows up in some clips and photos. Cousin Lucky Johnson offers the most insightful personal observations of what Perry's traumatic childhood was like, lending credence to the remarkable success. Perry's determination is beyond reproach, as is his mental toughness and ability to stick to his focus on control and ownership. The music/score of the film is frequently intrusive and overbearing, often distracting from the story, and the film is probably 20 to 30 minutes longer than it should be. However, taking a love-fest approach makes sense in this case, as Tyler Perry has progressed from dreamer to achiever, and the lessons are crystal clear.Releases on Prime Video on November 17, 2023.",False
8,8,I liked the story EXCEPT,livlov22,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI like that Tyler Perry himself gives God glory for his success. He talks about his faith in God. Now with that said WHY would some commentator, Samantha foolishly describe Tyler Perry as the ""father son and holy spirit"" That sounds so blasphemous to me. Others referred to him as "" savior"". How crazy is that?! And as a Christian myself it was offensive to hear. With that said I appreciate the glimpse of his life story that this movie offered, and the look into his personality. I like the clips of Tyler himself speaking about God and his story is truly miraculous. God kept the man no doubt. I think this story will speak to many who suffered childhood abuse. Tyler Perry stepped out on faith from a Word he said he heard from God and God blessed him.",True
9,4,Maxine's Baby: Tyler Perry's Story Gets the CliffsNotes Treatment,mendymariamKE,n/a,16/08/2025,"The anticipation for Amazon's 'Maxine's Baby: The Tyler Perry Story' led me to expect a detailed exploration of Tyler Perry's upbringing, family dynamics, and his journey in Hollywood.However, the documentary falls short of expectations, offering only a few scenes where Perry discusses his early days in theatre and television production.The narrative lacks vulnerability, with Perry speaking sparingly about his abusive childhood.The film raises the intriguing question of how Perry's life would unfold without the pain that shaped him, yet it provides scant information on this crucial aspect.Many stories are introduced but left unexplored, creating more questions than answers. The documentary feels controlled, with a sense that certain narratives are carefully curated.Despite occasional church services and choirs, there's a lack of substantial content that viewers would eagerly want to know.Perry's criticism of the traditional Hollywood system's wastefulness lacks conviction, and the documentary leaves unanswered questions about his creative process.The excessive focus on race, coupled with repetitive language, detracts from the overall impact.The documentary's repetitive nature, constant praise, and lack of in-depth exploration make it fall short of delivering the comprehensive and detailed account expected from such a prominent filmmaker's story.Let me explain,Tyler being a major filmmaker, I expected a better documentary.The documentary predominantly showcases scenes of Perry opening studios, attending premieres, and making appearances on talk shows with figures like Oprah.The content seems shallow, lacking the detailed insights that viewers were hoping for. Perry, dressed impeccably in suits, offers little personal disclosure, leaving the audience wanting more substance and context.The documentary heavily emphasizes Perry's spirituality and frequently delves into discussions about race, highlighting his triumphs as a black man overcoming challenges in the industry.While the theme is undoubtedly crucial, the documentary fails to provide sufficient depth and context, rendering it forgettable and disappointing. Perry's appearances on various talk shows appear to offer more engaging insights than this documentary.One positive aspect is Perry's evident appreciation for his mother and aunt, providing some touching moments.Overall, while there may be some takeaway from the documentary, it offers disappointingly little in terms of a comprehensive and detailed exploration of Tyler Perry's life and career.",False
10,10,Love me some Uncle Tyler,winniemylaie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Baby first of all let me say I don't play bout my Uncle Tyla. Second, I loved the documentary. I truly did. I just finished watching it for the second time. I've seen the critical reviews and I kind of agree with their points about the biopic not going into too much depth. With that being said, oh well! Tyler Perry aint gotta go into depth, he don't owe us that. Today's climate makes people feel entitled to an explanation on people's lives. If someone close to someone dies, social media demands a long drawn out post and obvious sadness to validate that person's grief. I did find out a few things I didn't know. I remember him loosely describing the inspiration behind the Madea character but this story gave me a full understanding of how that character came about. It culminated beautifully to explain exactly where his pain came from and exactly how and why he manifested it the way he did. Of all that Tyler Perry has gave in inspiration, a voice to our community, opportunity, film making, a platform, his studio, to name a few. He don't owe us a thing else. He's well deserving of everything great that has come his way and everything that's left to come. I've not seen every show but I've always loved and respected him for doing them because I understood his vision and, like him, could see the bigger picture. This documentary, like a lot of his other work may not be to everyone's satisfaction or expectations but his fans will continue to support him and I don't think he mad at that. I liked it so much I made this account to write a review. Don't play with my uncle tyla! :)",False
11,9,I'm grateful Perry shared his story,kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I recently watched Maxine's Baby: The Tyler Perry Story (2023) on Prime. The storyline delves into Tyler Perry's upbringing, family dynamics, and inner struggles, showcasing how he used these experiences to fuel his success, work ethic, and determination.Co-directed by Gelila Bekele (Tyler Perry's child's mother) and Armani Ortiz (Ruthless), the film provides a profound exploration of Tyler Perry's family dynamic and how he coped with it. The message that ""you aren't the only one out there, and you can be successful too"" resonates well. While I appreciated the journey of his artistry and success, I wished they had delved more into his partnerships and investments, exploring the artistry behind business collaborations. It could have been interesting to learn more about his collaboration with Opera.In conclusion, the human aspects of this documentary are a solid 10/10, and I'm grateful Perry shared his story. I would rate this documentary a 9/10 and highly recommend it.",False
12,9,Probing and Insightful!,vmmhmp,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHearing how young Tyler was brutalized was heartbreaking. The whole time I wished his stepfather would apologize, but when the nephew tried to visit the man and he cursed him and closed the gate on him, I knew that man was evil and didn't have it in him to show compassion. If one message was clear, that was how much he loved his mother. I wondered why we didn't get to meet any of Tyler's siblings and what type of relationship he has with them. Another thing I observed was that his mean stepfather lived in a nice home, while the aunt who clearly loves him doesn't. He said he supports his family but the documentary only indicated support to his stepfather, who don't even deserve it! It was disappointing that we didn't get to meet Ahmad, his son. It was weird how they hid his identity through the entire documentary. I recommend watching!",True
13,10,A must see!,mtacdavis,n/a,16/08/2025,This man blazed a trail and challenged the status quo of how things are done in Hollywood. He definitely turned his trauma into triumph and inspires us all to thrive in spite of torment.I learned even more about him and was reminded of what I already had learned about him over the years as a fan from the traveling play days.I appreciated the footage of the many icons who are no longer with us. Those giants impacted our community in a memorable and meaningful way through their craft. I was glad they were able to witness the opening of TPS!I finished the film with inspiration and motivation to continue to go after my own personal goals.This is a must see!!,False

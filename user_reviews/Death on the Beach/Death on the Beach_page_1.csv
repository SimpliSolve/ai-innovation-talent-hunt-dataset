1,10,Um... 5.9 ???,deepkut,n/a,15/08/2025,"At the time of this writing, the rating is 5.9 which is ridiculously low for such a very riveting and compelling British true crime show. I'm a huge true crime fan and caught this on Discovery+ and was very pleased not to see any annoying dramatically recreated re-enactments that the producers clearly take creative liberties with to exploit victims and their families. Yes they can become somewhat repetitive but all in all, definitely not a 5.9. I'd say more like a 7.5/8 and of course gave it a 10 to offset the low score. Give it a watch if you're into this ""genre"" and you won't be disappointed.",False
2,8,A real version of the TV show with the Death In Paradise,cdeanroane,n/a,15/08/2025,If you have ever watched UK TV show Death In Paradise you know the police force on St Marie always solve the case and the deed doer is jailed! Sadly that is not the case for many places in what was one part of the UK Commonwealth. This show goes into detail about people who are killed in former places of the commonwealth and that the guilty are not quickly caught. As it take years if someone is ever convicted and even longer before going to trial. So just remember when you jet off to that tropical location if something happens the way the law works there my be very different then how it would he handled in the UK!,False
3,9,True Crime with a Heart,addisonwlms,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm a fan of true crime series, and this one stands out. While it deals with murder and tragedy, each story reveals human empathy and shows how to transform tragedy into positive action. Unlike others that focus on the crime's drama, this series offers a broader view of ordinary people who venture beyond their comfort zones and face danger. The dedication of their loved ones to seek justice and preserve their legacy adds an emotionally compelling and optimistic perspective to a subject often centered on human trauma.",False

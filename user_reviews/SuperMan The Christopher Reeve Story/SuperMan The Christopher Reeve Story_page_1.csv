1,9,I love Chris Reeve even more,orenw14,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cried a lot watching this Love letter of a movie. A love story between Christopher and Dana. And the love of children for their parents. And the love of the public for a famous person. When he died in 2004, I remember being in a hotel room in Galveston Texas.It is the first time I truly cried over the death of someone I had never met. I was diagnosed with Cervical Dystonia in September of 1995, the same year as the accident that put Chris in a wheelchair. I am a scientist so I say, ""our mission should not be complete until the wheelchair is obsolete."" I could not believe he appeared at the Oscars so shortly after such a terrible accident. I broke down and cried. Yes, it is possible to love someone you have never met. He taught us all that we are ""here for a reason!!""",False
2,9,Fantastic,thajose,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a fantastic documentary. I was fortunate enough to see this in theaters when it was shown on Christopher Reeve's birthday.I was a little kid when the Superman movies were huge, and I was a teenager when Mr. Reeve had his accident. I remember most of what was shown in the film, as it happened, but I had not thought of it in so much detail until watching this. The documentary does and incredible job of capturing the highs and the lows of all of the events that took place during those times and after.I want to give kudos to a few things: 1) As the story is told, there is a digital statue that is occasionally displayed that resembles Mr. Reeve/Superman. This was incredibly well used, down to displaying ""Kryptonite"" on it in a very creative way, when he was injured. A truly unique way to display this, whoever came up with that idea, and the artists that executed it, are brilliant. 2) My God, this man's family and friends are made of something special. From his wife, to his children, to Robin Williams and his wife, to Mr. Reeve's Ex and beyond, all of them dealt with this in a way that I do not believe most people are capable of. Most of us could only hope and pray that our family and friends would be able to support us to this degree, if we found ourselves in such a terrible situation. 3) Dana Reeve was an incredible human being.I highly recommend this documentary.",False
3,9,Spoilers....this is equally amazing and gut wrenchingly sad,hoagjaime,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you are an empath like me you may not want to watch this. Its got a lot of sad angles in addition to the accident. It has kind of haunted me for days after watching it. His youngest son....not only is his father paralyzed from the neck down his whole life, then his dad dies at 52, but then he loses his mother right after that when he is still a young teen. When he describes pretending to still be asleep so he didnt have to face the news of his moms death.... BROkE MY HEART. I can totally understand trying to avoid such a moment. He said even though he has the love of his two (half) siblings, his extended family, his adoptive family, he has basically been alone since that day, March 6, 2006. Just awful. The older kids talk about how he left their mom (his first wife), broker her heart and how he was basically gone all the time after that. Just so much heart ache in the story.The good thing is that all the activism that Christopher, and his family and friends did, helped people to walk after being paralyzed, even though it didnt come in time to help him walk again. Anyway its a good one to watch alone if you dont like crying in front of people lol.",True
4,10,A beautiful look behind the curtain,lizzyb-97802,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a paraplegic of nearly 20 years, I knew this movie would be difficult at points, and it was...in all the very best ways. Though my paralysis is nowhere near as severe as Chris's, I could intimately relate to a lot of Chris's emotions as my past feelings and memories were brought to the surface. Trying to retain our sense of self - as well as our roles as a spouse, parent, sibling, and friend - and also continuing to be an active member of society is a difficult tightrope to navigate when our physical sense of being is irrevocably altered and we have to learn to accept this new normal. I could relate to much of Dana's perspective as a spouse as well; though I was not the caregiver in my marriage I experienced firsthand how it changes the marital dynamic. Many people living with disabilities don't have that kind of strength and devotion in their marriage like Chris and Dana did.This film provides valuable insight into the life of individuals living with paralysis. If he as the most prominent figurehead of our community had these struggles, you can imagine how life can be for the average person rolling a similar path. Finally, having become paralyzed after Christopher Reeve, this film was a great reminder of all the ways my life would be different without his advocacy.",False
5,10,Inspiringly Awesome,johnzapetis,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this documentary at the first showing in theaters and the audience was deeply moved. So many personal stories of the life and times of friends, family and colleagues of a man we hardly knew. The true life story of courage and the love he left behind. I had no idea that his childhood shaped his perception of what family could be and that struck home for me. Great to see Robin Williams help his classmate, friend and being like a brother, stepped up when it counted most while dealing with personal challenges of his own.The support of Christopher's wife, Dana, goes above and beyond normal caregiving and deserves her own life story told as well. The personal stories their children tell about what she went through in the years that followed.His advocacy for change in spinal cord injury research has beared fruit all these years later.It was great to see the original Superman film clips on the big screen since seeing them when they first ran in the 70's/80's.Great CGI effects of a Superman statue among the stars and heavens with compelling narration. Bravo!",False
6,10,True hero,loriic,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSuper/man: A Christopher Reeve Story promised a closer look at the life of an icon who brought Superman to life on screen, but what I found was something far more profound. While I expected to witness the journey of my childhood hero, Christopher Reeve, what I discovered was a deeply human story about an ordinary man with both virtues and flaws, and the extraordinary people who surrounded him.The documentary masterfully portrays Christopher Reeve as more than the superhero we idolized. It reveals his struggles, vulnerabilities, and resilience, painting a picture of a man who, while imperfect, found strength in adversity. However, the true heart of the story lies not in Christopher himself but in the unwavering devotion of his wives-particularly Dana Reeve-and their children.Dana's story was nothing short of breathtaking. Her unyielding support, compassion, and strength in the face of unimaginable challenges redefined the meaning of heroism for me. She embodied perseverance and unconditional love, standing by Christopher after his life-altering accident, fighting alongside him to build a life of purpose, and dedicating herself to their family. Her tragic end brought me to tears and left an indelible mark on my heart. Dana's life is a testament to the quiet, often unsung heroism of those who refuse to give up, even when life's challenges seem insurmountable.This documentary reminds us that true heroism isn't always about superpowers or grand gestures-it's about the courage, love, and strength of ordinary people who rise to extraordinary circumstances. In that sense, Super/man is not just a story about Christopher Reeve but an ode to Dana Reeve and their family, who showed us what it truly means to be heroic.",True
7,10,Beautiful,mayracasillas,n/a,16/08/2025,"A real life superhero. Even through his tragedy he still did not give up .He had hope and love and inspired others .It was lovely to see his family supporting him .Even sadder how hard it would be to be paralyzed and not be able to do what one is used to doing but he still kept moving forward. It made me cry such a beautiful man growing up in a broken home as I did just trying to live life. In the end he realized how blessed he was to have the love of his wife ,children and friends and fans .He did a lot for causes that mattered to him. He will never be forgotten. More sadder was how all this affected his children.",False
8,7,Insightful and emotional story about Christopher Reeve and his journey,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.Christopher Reeve was well-known for his performance as Superman and his unfortunate accident in 1995 disrupted his acting career. While I haven't seen many of Reeve's work, I found Reeve's to be a interesting person and this documentary does a good job on exploring his journey before and after his accident with good atmosphere, conversations from other celebrities and exploration about his activist works.The documentary presents good presentation, structure and some informative insights about Reeve's personal life that I didn't know about it and it was pretty emotional to observe. Seeing his family and others discussing of what makes him so special was pretty touching and I felt connected to Reeve's activist work, his journey and the person he is.Without being said, the documentary does have it's faults which are some of the pacing that could be improved. Including the musical tracks feeling repetitive. The musical tracks feel out of place and just like Val and Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie, the musical soundtrack feels cheesy and kind of ruins some of the moments.But as a whole, the movie's core was good and it was interesting to observe and learn about Reeves. May Reeves legacy continues and his legendary performance as Superman to live on.",False
9,10,You Will Believe A Man Can Try - One of the year's best films.,george.schmidt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SUPER/MAN: THE CHRISTOPHER REEVE STORY (2024) **** Heartfelt and accommodating documentary on the life and legacy of Christopher Reeve, actor/familyman/advocate for the disabled focusing largely upon the nearly-fatal accident in which he became a quadriplegic, which not only strengthened his humanity but in fact defined it. Interspersed with family home videos and testimonials from both friends and colleagues as well as those who have benefited from his & his wife Dana's philanthropic efforts, the film balances the man as well as the myth (naturally playing Superman onscreen clearly iconicized him immortal and underlined the cruel fate of his destiny) filmmakers Ian Bonhote and Peter Ettedgui prove that - to turn a phrase on his most famous film's tagline - You Will Believe A Man Can Try. One of the year's best films.",False
10,6,Superman: The Christopher Reeve Story,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating and in the end a very moving documentary looking at the life of Reeve. Unlike most similar documentaries, it cleverly draws your attention to the terrible accident Reeve had right at the beginning the film and how it affected his life, whilst then looking back at his life and career and of course the impact of him becoming Superman. Clearly and largely because of a wealthy, ambitious, competitive and seemingly indifferent father, Reeve became ambitious and competitive himself, ironically devoting his life to endless travel and sporting activities which he always needed to win. He extended this discipline to his admittedly loving children and it is therefore terribly sad that a man preoccupied with such activity should have these driving needs and desires taken from him so suddenly. Yet, he acknowledges that only after the accident did he come to understand true familial love was about togetherness and relationships, not team activities.It is also interesting that a man can gain so much fame from essentially doing 2 films - most of his career was made up of criticism and / or flops and yet he is still regarded as a star. It is all the more remarkable then that with the strong support of his wife Dana it could reasonably be argued that in facing such a difficult life, he achieved so much more after the accident than before. He was clearly loved by his family and friends, particularly Robin Williams. Well crafted and honest documentary that is certainly worth catching, but it is understandably very sad in its tone - be prepared to shed a tear in the closing 20 minutes.",False
11,10,Inspirational,levittelaine,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just left the theater in Hamilton, New York where I watched this film. I think every young person at the beginning of their adult lives should watch this film. It helps people to see the deeper meaning of life that the Reeve family is able to capture and encapsulate by sharing their journey as a family. Recognizing the fragility of life early is a hard truth but it is also an empowering one. It allows you to recognize that that we are all here briefly, and we need to use this time wisely. I thought it was important that at the end Christopher Reeve recognizes that all of the physical activities are not as important as the time spent connecting with the people in one's life with meaningful conversations. He and Dana understood what should be priorities. This film also allows us to see the big picture when it comes to research and human possibilities and limitations. It provides hope.Thank you to the filmmakers and to the family. I only learned about this on the Sunday morning show, and rushed to see it. I don't think enough people have heard about it yet. I am certain word will spread. It's the best documentary I've ever seen, and one of the best films I've ever watched.",False
12,7,A Heroic Tribute,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Hero"" is a revered term that, regrettably, is often overused, one that should be reserved for those truly deserving of the recognition. What's more, somewhat surprisingly, it's a label that is frequently most applicable to those who may not seem like the larger-than-life figures to whom it's most usually accorded. But, in the case of actor and activist Christopher Reeve (1952-2004), ""hero"" is an attribute most definitely warranted. Having burst onto the scene in the lead role of ""Superman"" (1978), he embodied the very notion of movie superhero, a character whose uplifting impact was definitely needed in a society deflated by many daunting challenges at the time. He would subsequently draw upon his success in this film as a springboard to a variety of other, more diverse roles, such as the lead in pictures like the mystical romance ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980) and the mystery thriller ""Deathtrap"" (1982), as well as a supporting part in the historical drama ""The Remains of the Day"" (1993). However, his life took a drastic turn in 1995, when he was nearly fatally injured in an equestrian accident that rendered him a paraplegic. The shock of the incident required a period of difficult adjustment for Reeve, but it would not ultimately deter him from carrying on in various pursuits with the unflinching support of his family and wife, Dana (1961-2006). He returned to acting in a made-for-TV version of ""Rear Window"" (1998) and assumed directorial responsibilities for the TV movies ""In the Gloaming"" (1997) and ""The Brooke Ellison Story"" (2004). He also became an ardent advocate for spinal cord injury care and research that gave hope - and, later, positive results - to many afflicted with this condition, leading to the establishment of an immensely successful charitable foundation and the passage of federal legislation bearing his and Dana's names for furthering these worthy causes. Reeve's inspiring story is now the subject of this new DC/HBO/CNN documentary from writer-directors Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui. It features a wealth of archive footage from interviews with the actor, family home movies and clips from his screen and stage performances, along with a variety of current and past conversations with his three children and his many friends and colleagues in the entertainment industry, including Robin Williams, Susan Sarandon, Whoopi Goldberg, Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels and director Richard Donner. Admittedly, the narrative can become somewhat redundant at times, suggesting the need for some judicious editing, but this release provides viewers with an insightful and heartfelt look at the values and virtues that made Reeve who he was - a true hero and a bona fide super man.",False
13,2,Not So Super,damianphelps,n/a,16/08/2025,Sadly I have watched a few similar documentaries and many of them have been truly sad affairs with stories of courage.Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story didn't afffect me in that way. I found that I couldn't connect with the true story. I also found that the better story was perhaps his second wife rather than Christopher.Christopher came across as selfish and indulgent in his earlier years and didn't seem to treat his first partner particularly well.The film didn't offer any new insights that were worth knowing.I think I would have maintained a higher opinion of him had I not watched the movie.,False
14,10,"Beautiful, masterpiece, poetic",jp300,n/a,16/08/2025,"Christopher Reeve really was our Superman. This was a Beautiful poetic masterpiece for not just fans of Superman but of him as a man.I read some of the rubbish reviews on here and honestly no idea what they are talking about! I loved seeing other actors saying their part about him which really showed the man he was.Seeing him become the Man of Steel to a greater man after the accident, it should open our eyes to when we complain about the smallest of things, and how he literally jumped back into action and embraced life from a whole new perspective. He will forever be the greatest Superman.",False
15,10,A beautiful tribute to Christopher and Dana Reeve,mujali-48677,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up, I absolutely adored Superman but didn't know too much about Christopher Reeve and his story. And although I remember his accident being big news in the mid-nineties, all we had at the time was a superficial understanding- nobody really had an idea just how tough his struggles were, the impact on him and his family.This documentary is perfectly done, it delves in to Reeves's early years and his struggles with his own father as well as the huge changes to his life once he catapulted to superstardom. And then once again a seismic change in circumstances when he had his accident. Although dealt a horrible blow, he never gave up hope and was amazingly supported and loved throughout by his wife Dana - the documentary shows what a truly lovely human being she was in every way. Together they refused to be defeated and used their collective voice to transcend circumstance and fight for the improvement of medical care for people with disabilities.The film packs a strong emotional punch. The friendship between Christopher Reeve and Robin Williams was pure sunshine and the world is poorer without them and Dana in it.",False
16,9,A Beacon of Hope,CarloBrando87,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a thoroughly fascinating journey this documentary portrayed of the late Christopher Reeve. Growing up and watching re-runs in the 90's of the Superman films I was really only aware of him for that and of course, I had heard about his terrible accident but I never knew anything else about him, I wasn't even sure how or when he died.It was also interesting to learn that Robin Williams was a very close friend, if not, his closest. He was always cracking jokes and that was just who Robin was, but he kept Reeve in good spirits when it was needed. That's what you call a good friend.The background of his family and 3 kids was touching and if you're a crier, get ready for the tissues towards the last 15 mins cause you're gonna need them. His legacy he left behind and work surrounding the paralysis and disability foundations is nothing short of phenomenal. Life can be so rewarding yet so cruel at the same time.A very good documentary about a man, but not just any man, a Superman. RIP.",False
17,8,A Touching Tribute,music-fahrenheit,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film documents the rise, fall, and eventual re-rise of the actor's stellar career. Reeve's story is beautifully and lovingly told by those who were closest to him. Growing up in a broken home and without the support of his friends and colleagues, he became one of the best-known and most-loved screen personalities of the 1980s. The tale causes one to think about one's own life and fortunes, or lack thereof...Reeve had it all and lost it in a second, but through his stubborn perseverance was able to carve out a new niche for himself. Through it all, the love and support of his family stayed solid. Get ready for tears.",False
18,6,Real-life Hero,Holli_Would,n/a,16/08/2025,"Touching story, much of which I didn't know about. There are lots of interviews with his celeb (e.g., Susan Sarandon, Glen Close, Jeff Daniels) and political friends (John Kerry) who help tell Reeve's story and to pay tribute.Christopher was and still is Superman to many, and Dana Reeve (late wife) was his angel on earth.They seem like a tight-nit, lovely family, a credit to both mum's for bringing up such wonderful children.The biggest portion of the film was dedicated to showing Reeve's contribution to the arena of disability by giving people without a voice someone to champion their cause.There is a superhero in all of us, after all.",False
19,10,Both heartbreaking and inspiring in equal measure,thomasverrall,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember reading and adoring the bestselling autobiography 'Still Me' many years ago, which was one of the many reasons I had high expectations of this documentary. Thankfully, it didn't disappoint. Super/man was delicately woven together with so much love and care. A rare 10 out of 10 from me, as I sincerely can't see how this documentary could be bettered... every credit should go to its makers and eloquent contributors, both living and passed, as it would have been so easy to tip the delicate balance and make the doc an overly varnished or syrupy tribute. An unforgettable film of an unforgettable story.",False
20,7,Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unlike many retrospectives of late lamented actors, this film has a much greater degree of honesty from it's contributors as it takes a look back at the life of the man most famous for darting about in a blue cape saving the world from Gene Hackman and Terence Stamp. It also benefits from being about a man and his family whose lives have been captured to quite an extent by home movies that illustrate the joyous, and heinous, moments as he rose to fame then struggled to come to terms with his life-altering accident. What we are given here is a frank portrayal of an actor - maybe not the most versatile, it has to be said - who tread the boards off, off-Broadway before lucking out at the audition in London the made him an household name. The principal narrative is provided by those closest to him - his long-term ex-girlfriend Gae Exton, the mother of their children Matt and Ali and by Will, his son with Reeve's profoundly stoical and steadfast wife Dana. There is also some insight from Jeff Daniels, Whoopi Goldberg and Glenn Close - and there is an interesting degree of frankness from these people that also touches on issues faced by some of their mutual friends. Though sympathetic and celebratory, these comments are not entirely adulatory. Indeed, his elder son offers us some thinly veiled criticism of a man who maybe didn't focus as he could have on his first family, and who had a reputation as a bit of a rake at times, too. The documentary quite successfully uses more archive to demonstrate this family's determination after his paralysis to do what could be done to raise awareness and funds to improve treatment and support for others. Apparently some 4 million Americans have some sort of disability and in trying to address this, he demonstrates the power of celebrity to stretch far beyond symbolism proving that political connections, pressure and principle can make a profound difference to situations that many would sooner sweep under the carpet. It's not always easy to watch - but then neither were many of his films - but it does make it's point effectively, avoids sentimentality for the most part, and tells us a story of a flawed man whose sheer willpower and charisma helped create a testament the others may still be befitting from decades later.",False
21,8,The man who flew was the biggest hero of all,DanTheMan2150AD,n/a,16/08/2025,"An inspirational portrait of an extraordinary man who became a symbol of hope and resilience for so many, Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story will serve as a stirring introduction to some but for others, it's a moving reminder of what Christopher Reeve accomplished, endured and overcame. An emotional rollercoaster with some undeniably tear-jerking moments that absolutely got to me, seeing Reeve inspiring crowds with his resilience and firm passion towards helping his fellow man nets us to see a very different kind of Superman. It presents a person who perfected his craft, spoke to the world as if they were his equals and turned tragedy into something positive. Reeve was right when he said we need all the heroes we can get, Super/Man powerfully reminds us that all we need to do is look in the mirror to find one.",False
22,7,A bittersweet reflection on a life well-lived,fredrikgunerius,n/a,16/08/2025,"A detailed and fairly nuanced presentation of the extraordinary life of actor Christopher Reeve. Filmmakers Ian Bonhôte and Peter Ettedgui tell the story through alternating segments about Reeve's rise and fall, with the obvious focal points being his starring role in the Superman franchise and the horse-riding accident that left him paralysed for the last nine years of his life. The film's greatest asset is not any revelatory stories, but the many up-close and personal interviews with Reeve's friends and family, including his three children. They come across as thoughtful, solid people who may have become better versions of themselves thanks to the dichotomy of experiences they are left with as Reeve's children. Only in some segments towards the end does the film lose its tight focus, where Reeve's undoubtedly valuable efforts as an advocate for the rights of disabled people are somewhat overembellished by a few awkward artistic choices and vapid music. However, these are not detrimental enough for the film to lose its main accomplishment: a bittersweet reflection on a life well-lived, both in and out of the limelight.",False
23,1,They ruined it with politics,mb-80174,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was really looking forward to this documentary, as I was a little kid who grew up watching Superman and remember that fateful day in 1995 like it was yesterday.Once I saw Susan Sarandon and Whoopie Goldberg were included, I knew they would find a way to ruin this. Unfortunately I was right. Not even a third of the way through Sarandon started to talking about ""toxic masculinity"" and that was it for me.Par for the course these days, unfortunately. Why do they have to inject politics into everything and ruin the experience?This does not, however, take away from my admiration for Christopher Reeves and his family.",False
24,10,A beautiful tribute,nathandains,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA child of the 80s, I knew Christopher Reeve as Superman, like everyone else. As I got older, I saw Somewhere In Time, a testament to Reeve's abilities and sensitivities.I remember the accident as vividly as the OJ Simpson Bronco chase- etched in my memory. Every time a story came on about Christopher Reeve, every TV interview, my family and I were glued.Now, why do we care so much? Is it because he was ""Superman"" in the movies? No. It's because he was determined. He decided to help others through his own affliction. And his family was so devoted to him.We develop these attachments through our TVs. We mentally adopt these people as our own. And when Christopher, and then Dana left us, they were ALL gone from our lives in a sense.And some of us still wonder: How are the kids doing? Granted, they're my age, but I knew them as kids, as I too was a kid.This is a beautiful tribute to a good man, a good actor. He had his flaws. We all do. But he was loved. And it's sad to see his kids still hurt. But don't we all, for some reason or another?It's good to see that his kids are alright. Still hurting, but alright. We can also hurt, but we'll be alright. Maybe it's good to know we're not alone. I hope they know they aren't alone either.They speak a lot about ""Brother Robin."" I miss him too. And I hope his kids are alright.",True
25,10,As Inspirational As Documentaries Come,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up in the late-1980s & 90s, I had two cinematic/entertainment heroes: Hulk Hogan & Superman. For the latter, it was specifically Christopher Reeve's portrayals of the Man of Steel that I'd rent countless times from the local video store and immerse myself in that fictional universe. When Reeve had his paralyzing accident in 1995 I was still too young to fully comprehend what was going on. Super/Man tells that story and does it in a way that is far more ""inspirational"" than ""sad"".The basic structure of Super/Man is this: it begins in the immediate aftermath of Reeve's horse-riding tumble and paralysis, flashes back to key points of his life, and finishes up with Reeve's legacy in the field of spinal injury research and recognition.I believe there to be clips in this doc that are never-before-seen and interviews that are more candid on the subject than ever before. Viewers hear extensively from Reeve's first wife, as well as home videos and personal stories from his children-at one point son Matthew detailing the last moment he saw his father upright. The doc also does not shy away from the ""rough stuff""-showing pics/vids of Reeve at his worst moments post-accident and explaining just how close he came (at times) to giving up.What's remarkable about Super/Man, however, is how it keeps the viewer in a positive state of mind and not depressed-not exactly a small feat considering the material. Reeve's on-screen superhero persona garnered him the platform to advocate for spinal injury research and that is eventually the attitude the man himself adopted-becoming as much of a super hero in reality as his caped wonder was in Metropolis. Reeve's appearances-enormous ordeals for a man in his condition-inspired millions of dollars of funding and activism and even broke stigmas about treatment of spinal cord injury survivors. One thing Super/Man makes abundantly clear: Christopher Reeve always believed he would walk again, and though he did not live long enough to see it happen that attitude was what really mattered in the end.Super/Man directors Ian Bonhote & Peter Ettedgui put together some incredible montages here to illustrate their key points. In one instance, footage of Reeve being feted by political dignitaries is interspersed with Superman's speech to the United Stations in Superman IV. Chris's friendship with Robin Williams is touching-two souls who understood each other in a way no one else could. A scene with Reeve in his rolling chair walking his dog down the driveway of his home is particularly affecting as well.It is impossible to not get extremely emotional-but in the best possible way-while watching Super/Man. Thus far, this is the definitive post-accident Christopher Reeve accounting and it lives up to that gargantuan task.",False

1,2,the feeling of desperation,silas123,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not a big comedian consumer but I do catch these acts every so often and have nothing but respect for the people getting up there on stage. I mean you can't fake it, no sleight of hand here, the jokes either work or they don't. With that said, this set by Chelsea Handler was a miss. From the beginning, there was an air of desperation starting with the opening about monkey pox and the ""hey, I'm cool with the gays"" bit. In 2025 you can't get up there and hope that 'I like sex and drugs and hate Republicans' is comedy without humor attached to it. After 25 minutes or so without a single laugh, I tuned out for a bit and then came back in with 5-10 minutes left. Finally at the end when she turned her attention to Bill Cosby there were a couple of laughs. But after an hour long screed there was no salvaging this disaster.",False
2,1,Kept waiting for the laughs,imdbfan-2617179974,n/a,15/08/2025,"My husband and I looked forward to watching this comedy special because we were fans and had seen the previews. It turned out to be a waste of an hour of our lives. The content was not funny. The main topic was beyond irreverent regarding underage girls and sex, and the rest of it was just overused material from other comedians. We kept waiting for it to get funny. Besides making our skin crawl, the show had no other effect on us, I have read one of her books and found it to be funny but this show is a misfire. After staying out of the spotlight for six years we expected her to have some fresh and very funny material. This did not fit the bill. Big disappointment.",False
3,8,Irreverence Personified,rhaynes1974,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's a reason Chelsea Handler has lasted so long as a woman in the world of standup comedy. She's irreverent and she's really funny. She doesn't tell jokes per se but her personal anecdotes of chance meetings and her and her family life ring very true and are laugh out loud funny.She's open minded, since ""liberal"" seems to have become a dirty word and she makes no bones about being self deprecating. Do yourself a favour and get lost in her stories. It's an easy hour watch.Although mostly personal stories she takes the odd swipe at politics here and there but this is far less about politics and far more about sharing anecdotes.",False
4,2,Boring and annoying,rxjqgprz,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have always been a big fan of Chelsea H., especially of her dark humor and foul language.Having said that, though, this show was a serious letdown and felt like an attempt to maintain her character current by taking her usual self to the next level but failing to be funny or relatable. Instead, she came off as obnoxious, loud and entitled.The bits about how she has always ""felt"" better than her family literally since the day she was born were simply not funny, and the part where she allegedly had beer, cigarretes and sex at age 9 or 10 were outright offensive (even if it was not true) rather than provoking, I honestly cannot believe that the audience actually laughed at all during those parts of the show. The political commentary is irrelevant and adds nothing to the comedy, which is lacking anyway.",True
5,4,VIEWS ON FILM review of Chelsea Handler: The Feeling,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerChelsea Handler is not really funny these days. She's just not. I mean maybe she once was about ten-plus years ago, on her celeb talk show or in that box office bomb This Means War as Reese Witherspoon's best bud Trish. Heck, I almost forgot about her threadbare existence until she showed up in 2025's commonly-directed comedy special, Chelsea Handler: The Feeling. Yup, I didn't chuckle or snort once mind you, prompting me to think ""Chels, you should've left well enough alone.""So yeah, do I think Chelsea Handler however is mildly attractive and/or aggressively astute? Oh fo sho. That sandy blonde hair, that decent, 5' 6"" frame, that raspy voice, that potty mouth. Sure, why not. But do I think she can tell a joke, overcome a laugh track, or deliver a solid punchline? Nada, not in this lifetime. Uh, just because you spew the F-word, talk at full volume, embrace the fans of the LGBT, or get your self-centered on doesn't make you a legendary farceur, it just makes you reek of being pesky. Handler, well she could learn a lesson or two from stand-up sensation and gross out monger Nikki Glaser. Chelsea, yeah I'm talking to you, ditch the shiny outfit and not try so darn hard. Come on miss thang, embrace ""the suck"", for reals.Whether Handler's waxing on about auto-eroticism, possibly getting busy with the governor of New York, having uncomfortable coition, or the vacancy of her siblings with whom she obviously doesn't like, her ""Feeling"" meanders, goes off on tangents, and becomes downright unrelieved. I mean the woman isn't much of a storyteller, just a professional pie-eye-r who despite not being wasted, still seems to say whatever pops in her head. Now did I ultimately get ""the feeling"" in regards to Chelsea Handler: The Feeling? H-e double hockey sticks no!",True
6,3,Meh,barrywomb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I AM a liberal. Wasn't a fan of the Bushes and despise the current mental institution of a political administration (2025). So I am on the same political page as Handler. That being said, I just didn't find this funny and it had nothing to do with her political views. I remember watching her series a long time ago and I wasn't a fan then either. Tried, but just not for me. Tried again with this special and same deal. Angry can be funny (Kinneson in the beginning was hysterical, Bill Burr is also great), but it just went on too long and wasn't funny to me. It has zip to do with her being a woman as Silverman and Glasser and many others make me laugh out loud. With jokes, they either land or they don't. With me, they didn't.",False
7,1,Disgusting Content,kathyhonor-27500,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerShe is so disgusting! You're a comedian! Talking about 11 years girls masturbating is not funny and shame on Netflix!! Worst show ever. If she thinks this is acceptable than maybe she needs to go for therapy. I couldn't even watch the entire show because it literally made me nauseous. How about you just be a comedian telling funny jokes ! Done with anything she does I'm sure I'm not the only one who agrees that children are OFF Limits when it comes .to certain subjects and categories No wonder she doesn't have any of her own. At least she did that right. She needs to go back to her talk show days because raunch is not way.,True
8,1,"Annoying, pointless, stupid",kofila,n/a,15/08/2025,"Those words specify characteristics not only of this ""show"" but of Chelsea Handler as well. She is also entitled and has a delusion of grandeur. Humour is an unknown mystery to her and still there are people paying her to attempt that. So I guess the joke is on Netflix and us as consumers. But still she has fresh and hot topics. Like Bill Cosby. You know? Not heard it yet? Were you in a cave for the past 10 years? Nevermind. Well I would rather spend an evening with Bill Cosby than watching this boring soccer mom performing anything anywhere on any topic. Cancel Chelsea Handler instead. Cancel Chelsea Handler.",False

1,8,"Strange, yet, fascinating hybrid doc-fiction exploration of the Krahô tribe",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brazil has an interesting history when it comes to the discussions about the tribal communities and their culture, lifestyles, and history. The filmmakers has an interesting but strange approach on exploring the stories about the Kraho communities but with colorful camerawork, good sound designs, observations, and interesting themes being explored, it creates a really good meditative and informed story about the cultures, communities, and the conflicts happening at the same time.Filmmakers João Salaviza and Renée Nader Messora pay respect to the community by providing interesting conversations with the characters, some emotional and engaging aspects about the conflicts of freedom, the people, and the controls happening, and the beautiful sound designs throughout the woods that helps to add the atmosphere and tone.Many of the style and presentation choices remains me of Apichatpong Weerasethakul which I say is the biggest fault since it takes a bit too much influence from his style. But as a whole, I found myself being floored and wowed with this movie. Definitely a slow-burn but worth it.",False

1,8,I hope Belmaya can continue filming,lilianaoana,n/a,16/08/2025,"A film about Belmaya, partially shot by Belmaya.I hope that Belmaya can keep the momentum going, these fleeting moments when you capture people's attention are very brief and very few people can follow that up at least at the same level. It's really a matter of luck and chances. She was doing her training, she probably had some sponsorships, was given the equipment and guidance, and she clearly had support and mentorship. And she resonated with people and was addressing issues that were ""in"" at the level of the national discourse I imagine. And she was a case herself, perfectly illustrating her own documentary short and being the main focus of this here documentary. Sadly that is sometimes the case with these ""fashionable"" topics. How long can they stay relevant, how long can she stay relevant on the scene after the chatter about her work dies down?These programs target and support people at risk for a while. But then they need to help themselves. I hope she is able to. And that she is able to shoot. For money or for herself, or preferably both.As for the film, I am appalled at what women have to put up with in some parts of the world, the humiliation, the suffering, the pain, the constant danger from your own family members, it's disheartening really. Nine castes in a village, what on earth is that? And how was he higher caste when he couldn't even read? The policeman said he was entitled to burn and kill her. It looks like the police should outlaw these beliefs and customs, doesn't it?I never trusted that husband of hers, that change was never going to last. He would never accept feeling inferior to his wife, which he clearly was. That's how patriarchy works. If she's not objectively inferior, he needs to bring her down by threats and violence. Good riddance!",False
2,10,Amazing movie,azbakrie,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an amazing film. You are taken in her perspective of the world and how she goes against society norms in Nepal. The camera helps her fight through. We are taken through her life and how she has grown and changed, and how she is helping everyone grow and change. It's just amazing. You go through an emotional roller coaster.",False
3,10,Insightful,ejanethomas-80409,n/a,16/08/2025,"As others say this is a moving film as we follow Belmaya's struggle to achieve independence in a society that still ranks women as inferior.Despite marrying young and having a child, she finds her way to success after Sue Carpenter gives her a camera; this gradually becomes her tool of empowerment.A sensitive film addressing many issues set against the lovely backdrop of Pokhara. Belmaya's struggle is still not over nor is it for many girls in Nepal.",False
4,10,Powerful and inspirational,elizahward,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow! I was blown away by this film. It's such an incredible and original story of empowerment of a Nepali girl from a poor, Dalit background with no education, who then fights back - against her husband and society as a whole - with her camera as her weapon.Heart-breakingly sad, funny, moving, heart-soaringly happy - you're taken through the whole gamut of emotions, but never feel manipulated. Such an insight into a way of life that you'd never be able to witness if it weren't Belmaya herself behind the camera. Belmaya rocks!",False
5,10,Life changing!!,liasianastasia,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful and powerful documentary following an inspirational woman, Belmaya. Belmaya's story proves to women worldwide that determination and persistence can shift your fate, no matter what circumstances you have been given in life.Sue Carpenter has devoted many years to this film and it has payed off, she has created a one of a kind experience that should be watched for years to come. The film has many life lessons to take from it.An extra perk...it's a stunning insight into the natural wonders that Nepal has to display.",False
6,10,Uplifting and inspirational,olwynowen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI absolutely loved this film and am so grateful that such a moving and uplifting true story has been brought to the screen.Belmaya is a beautiful soul who takes us into her world in a really profound way. This is the story of a poor and uneducated Nepali girl who discovers film-making and, against all the odds, makes a beautiful film chronicling her journey. It is a testament to the power of the human spirit and the strength of women, even in adverse circumstances. It is funny, sad, happy, moving, glorious - in short, a triumph. Belmaya and her story will stay with me for a very long time.Very many congratulations - and thank you.",True
7,10,Fascinating film,Helena_Rold-Azlett,n/a,16/08/2025,I found this a fascinating and very moving film - I would love to meet Belmaya.,False
8,10,Inspirational must see!,jlofchy,n/a,16/08/2025,Beautiful piece of film making with an important message regarding the need to educate young girls in Nepal and by extension other developing countries. A meta-film filled with beauty and strength leaving the viewer with hope for Belmaya and her future.,False
9,10,Probably the most beautiful film ever made in Nepal,elinablue-46500,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such a lovely (true) story about a young Nepali girl who refuses to follow the path in life that is expected of her as a woman. Already at a young age you can tell she's feisty and determined despite having gone through a lot of difficulties already before she ends up in a children's home. It is intersting to follow her ups and downs over many years, as she changes from teenager to a mother. It is beautifully filmed and you really get to see what life is like for a girl in Nepal.",False
10,10,A lovely film. Highly recommended.,gmhutchins7,n/a,16/08/2025,"A really well made, delightful, eye-opening and touching film. I loved the journey that Belmaya went on and the soundtrack is also a belter. I'll be keeping my Brady eyes open for the filmmakers next project. A must watch.",False
11,10,Powerful and personal documentary about the multiple challenges facing a woman in Nepal searching for independence,karishmagic-30660,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very personal film about the challenges faced by one particular young woman looking to be independent socially and economically in Nepal. It is shot and edited with empathy, skill and care backed by beautiful music and scenery. It could be mawkish but it isn't.I was transfixed from beginning to end .",False
12,10,Touching and Uplifting,katieisbester,n/a,16/08/2025,"Despite the grim topic, Belmaya is so resilient a character with such a drive and an intellect, that this film ends up being quite a positive watch.It also nicely showcases the sensitivity of British filmmaker, Sue Carpenter, and what that achieve in film: a trusting relationship of sharing and partnership. More films should be made in this fashion where the person being filmed is genuinely directing the end product. It strips away any suggestion that this has been exploitative in any way.I also quite liked that they decided to leave in enough of the husband's story that he also comes across as a three dimensional man, trapped in a culture that is also vicious to him. He is no monster but rather a man of his time.",False
13,10,So inspiring!,vzmzwg,n/a,16/08/2025,This film was very moving and informative on the life of Belmaya.

15,10,Sensational movie!,mayagur,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best films I've ever seen. It was absolutely amazing and so multi-layered. The balance between the emotion, the humour, the entire narration, was perfect. Thank you!",False

It opens an objective window on women's conditions in Nepal, as it could be in many other countries, but it also gives hope and an proof that creativity can save.What a life and what a woman !! Belmaya has got a destiny, undoubtedly she is someone special, a internal light and she could become a lighthouse for other women...

20,10,Beautiful and moving film,charlotteffry,n/a,16/08/2025,"An insightful and inspiring film that will iempower young women everywhere. Battling against all the odds, Belmaya's tenacity, intelligence shine through. The scenery is breathtaking and provides a counterpoint for the harsh living conditions endured by so many people, in particular the women. Belmaya's passion for photography and film-making and her determination that her own daughter be provided with the education she herself was denied, makes one silently cheer her on. I would recommend I AM BELMAYA to everyone, but in particular to young women. This is a visionary film that will leave an imprint on my mind.",False
21,10,Absorbing & important,vivienne1066,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this film by and about Belmaya . It is a touching and important film revealing another culture and the struggle against the patriarchy on all levels of the society . The soundtrack was also well- woven into the flow of the film - brilliant . And the director has created a cinematic experience of the highest quality .I, and my group of friends of all ages , felt transported from my comfortable sitting room in the centre of Copenhagen to the grim hardships and also the soaring mountain tops and lakes of the Himalayas .

22,10,Really powerful story very beautifully told,rachelj-61283,n/a,16/08/2025,"A really powerful and moving film. I didn't know much about the subject matter before I started watching and was really blown away. Loved the way the story was pieced together from Belmaya's perspective, really giving us an insight into her life and experiences in a very personal way. Felt a very honest and heartfelt telling of her story, allowing her agency to tell her story her way. Combined with that, the cinematography is beautiful and I was also particularly struck by the soundtrack, which really adds a lot to the narrative. I would highly recommend - this film is definitely worth a watch!",False

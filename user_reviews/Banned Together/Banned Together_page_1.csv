1,9,"A Timely, Courageous Film That Gives Voice to the Future",addison-witt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Banned Together was the first film I watched when I joined the Defense of Democracy Film Festival, and I couldn't have asked for a more meaningful entry point.With so much public debate around banned books and the erosion of public libraries, I was eager to understand the deeper, more personal layers of the issue. What this film delivers is nothing short of extraordinary.The young people at the center of Banned Together, particularly the groups of teenage girls who lead with passion, clarity, and a love of literacy, were inspiring. Watching them advocate for access to books and ideas reminded me of what true civic engagement looks like. Even more powerful was seeing adults standing beside them, helping to amplify their voices and guide them to public forums where dialogue could flourish.The film's diversity is another vital element. It reflects the truth that this battle for knowledge, inclusion, and representation affects all of us. We are in this together - and Banned Together doesn't just say that, it shows it.As someone on the inside of a film festival, I know I have the privilege of early access. But this is a story the public must see. The issue of book banning is not symbolic, it's actively reshaping communities. And this documentary answers with clarity, urgency, and heart.Highly recommended.",False
2,10,Eye opening perspective on censorship,imdbfan-8039975541,n/a,16/08/2025,"Literature has to the power to educate, inspire, challenge, create dreams and change the world. ""Banned Together"" is a real world perspective about the trials and tribulations of censorship. This documentary addresses book bans and curriculum censorship. Following three students and their adult supporters as they navigate the process to be heard is fascinating. It is refreshing to see our youth in action, eloquently supporting their views. You will experience elation, admiration, incredulity, desperation and many other emotions. A must see! A testimony to why stories and voices should never be silenced.",False
3,10,Wonderful (and necessary) movie,imdbfan-4940631063,n/a,16/08/2025,"Banned Together is an incredibly timely, important film filled with powerful characters- beloved authors, passionate students, and voices from all walks of life resisting acts of censorship that are happening all around the US in this very moment.It is wonderful to experience advocacy in action, and I felt that I really learned on a very personal level, who is affected by the attack on public education, and more importantly - what can be done to stop these attacks. Extra kudos to the volunteers from Defense of Democracy who were featured in the film!This is a wonderful and necessary work, and I highly recommend it!",False
4,10,Timely and critical,imdbfan-1312321019,n/a,16/08/2025,"Banned Together is an excellent film documenting the challenges faced by students, community members, and librarians as censorship in the US increases.No community is immune to book challenges and bans. It is happening everywhere. The antidote to the fear based tactics used to censor the right to read is education. Each of us has a responsibility to be prepared to defend the freedom to read. Each of us deserves to be able to read books where we can see ourselves and our experiences represented. The attack on books disproportionately affects BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ communities - the very same communities that need representation in these trying times.This film provides necessary knowledge as well as a good dose of hope. It is heartening to know that people from all walks of life are standing up for the freedom to read. I hope that you will watch this film and that it will spark conversations in your circles about the importance of reading and how crucial it is we protect the right to read.",False
5,10,"We can change the world, one by one",imdbfan-0274725240,n/a,16/08/2025,"In this moment of political upheaval by a radical minority, we witness 3 young women who will not accept the destruction of books and the core of their education.Books inform, books can change lives, and books liberate our minds. These young women inspire and create a movement for all of us to join.Where are young people supposed to turn when counselors are in short supply, libraries are being censored and adults are commanding the floor with nonsensical, inaccurate information? If we don't all speak up now to stop this, there will be no cause for us to defend. THIS is something we can all do now.",False
6,10,Should be required viewing!,imdbfan-7348698711,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a high school librarian I'm aware of what's happening in our country regarding books being banned and challenged. But the vast majority of Americans have no idea about the storm that is brewing between the 1st Amendment and far-right groups like Moms for Liberty.It's so depressing to read the news each day and see that yet another state has banned books such as Fahrenheit 451 or George Orwell's 1984. They are passing laws that not only can't the books be taught in the schools, but that students can't even be in possession of the books while on school property.Watching the teens in Banned Together will give you hope for the future.Please watch this powerful and engaging documentary!",False
7,10,Fighting for the Right to Read: A Review of Banned Together,imdbfan-5569868392,n/a,16/08/2025,"Banned Together is a powerful documentary that lingers long after the credits roll. It follows three high school seniors from Beaufort County, South Carolina-Isabella Troy Brazoban, Elizabeth Foster, and Millie Bennett-as they fight against book bans in their district. Nearly 100 books, many featuring LGBTQ+, BIPOC, and female voices, were pulled after complaints from a very small group of parents influenced by organizations like Moms for Liberty.What makes this film so compelling is its personal nature-you're not just watching a policy debate, but real students with real stakes refusing to be silenced. Their journey through school board meetings, protests, and national advocacy highlights their passion for free speech and representation. If you think 'today's generation' is only interested in TikTok trends, these students tenacity will surprise and inspire you.Beyond their local battle, Banned Together connects to a nationwide wave of censorship, forcing viewers to ask: Who decides what students can read? What are we really protecting them from? And why are marginalized voices often the target?Critics have praised the film for good reason-it's inspiring, eye-opening, and, at times, infuriating. It showcases both the courage of these students and the creeping threat of censorship in public education. If you care about free speech, education, or youth activism, this is a must-watch.",False
8,10,Amazing documentary!!,imdbfan-9417420516,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was such an amazing documentary about the importance of free speech and the right to read. It was told beautifully through the eyes of high school students in South Carolina as they worked to reintroduce books that were banned in their school district. It highlights the importance of books in our society and really peels back the curtains on why people are trying to ban books which I found fascinating. Unfortunately, it does end right before the current administration took office so obviously things are even more volatile in this area right now. But if anything that just reinvigorates me more to stand up for what I believe in.",False
9,10,Refreshing and Hopeful,imdbfan-1671024567,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sometimes it takes youth, not yet jaded, not so beaten down, to stand up for what is so obviously right... to call the fanatical, un-American book banning what it is, and to actually do something about it. As an adult battling for the rights of parents, students and teachers against the faux-""parental rights"", astroturf groups, it's often exhausting to face the same nonsense arguments again and again. These kids show the power of community, of supporting and encouraging one another, and the power of hope. The film does a great job of showing the scope of the issue -- talking to authors, educators, even letting the censors speak for themselves.",False
10,n/a,Do not miss this film! It's spellbinding!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"To say this film triumphs in highlighting local issues representative of a national crisis is an understatement. Witnessing three teenage women from different school districts in Beaufort County, SC come together to confront their local school boards, the state, and national forums with such intelligence, grace, and aplomb is breathtaking. Their high school efforts would seem nothing short of miraculous were it not for their keen and astonishingly mature awareness of the social, educational, and legal implications of book banning. ""Banned Together"" beautifully guides us through their journey, illustrating how these young women galvanized other students and the community through their unwavering commitment and hard work to protect intellectual freedom, to advocate for teachers, librarians and education as a whole, as 97 books were removed from their school shelves. The fact that this film was produced and filmed well before the current dismantling of public education and outright ignoring of truth is telling, serving as an unfortunate prediction that highlights a dangerous pattern emerging and calls for immediate attention to a much broader societal issue. Don't miss this - it's spellbinding.",False
11,n/a,The usual bunch of far leaning radical youth activists.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI mean how impressed is one to be with misfits who prefer to spend time railing against self importance and adult authority and structure while issuing predictably emotional profanity laced noncommunications during formal civil meetings.This is just the usual youth big i am billed as def not the radical political activism it is and certainly not biased in any way nor omitting critical contended details and points of debate for the other side in standard practice.I mean they wanted to get this pig over the line in 2024 but for obvious reasons one might easily conclude such radical members of society seem to have been delayed likely a half to full year from their own plans to... go sulk in hawaii or whatever crazy radicals do when they don't get their way.Likely they go to their rooms and throw sulky fits without dinner.On the other hand if that had been the parenting method of self control structure and discipline i doubt we would have these kinds of kids in the first place.At the end of the day they want to force non educational school materials onto ALL their peers at the taxpayers expense for the fewest while clearly exposing minors to age inappropriate content in the first place all hung upon the premise that the first step to accepting crt and healing racial wounds is to accept your inherent automatic racism from the womb based on your own skin color.Even the title feels like a tire with a massive hole just leaking air with its terrible play on words for banded together banned together.Typical unimaginative mediocre childrens games given far too much spotlight.As a documentary the production qualities are incredibly low. I can't see this selling even to on the fence youths or anyone on the fence.Its execution feels like tired lip service to already entrenched ideological allies that has little substance to sway anyone challenging or at all opposed.Its purely furthering the mission of grouping for political purposes because as individuals in politics you are less than worth realizing.As convenient growing aligned shared missions and groups you almost rate enough to service through active politics.Thats the quiet part dems don't say out loud.,True

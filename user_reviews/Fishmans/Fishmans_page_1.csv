1,8,A very good music documentary,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a very well-made and comprehensive documentary about the Japanese band Fishmans, who've got a cult following online, and not just among Japanese listeners either.I've liked their music for a while (discovering them was a rare positive consequence of spending a lot of time online), but never knew much beyond the band. I know last time I checked, there wasn't much English language info about them, and very few lyric translations (it's a little sad the lyrics aren't translated in this documentary, even though interviewees often mention Shinji Sato's lyrics, but I still enjoyed the music), so getting a rundown of their short but impressive career was valuable.The three-hour runtime may turn off non-fans, but at the same time, it feels like it was largely made for people who are already at least a little familiar with Fishmans. For fans, it's a must-watch.",False

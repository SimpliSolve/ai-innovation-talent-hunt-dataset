1,9,A very enjoyable presentation of Julia Child the woman and the cultural figure,richard-1787,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm surprised that on 18 Dec 2021 I'm only the third person to review this movie. And the first two reviews read very much as if they were written by the pr company handling the marketing of this film. Unlike them, I don't think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread (which wasn't so great), but it's a very fine documentary that does a solid job of presenting the life and achievements of a very interesting American woman.It starts out not slow, but somewhat bloated. There is too much unnecessary filler, and too many people exaggerating both how bad American home cooking was in the 1950s and 60s and how much Child changed Americans' way of life.Child grew up in an America where the wealthy, such as her family, had cooks, so that the wife did not herself get involved with daily meal preparation. The rest of American housewives did not, by and large, see cooking as a chance to be creative and develop their own personalities.My mother, for example, only relied on frozen tv dinners as a last resort, unlike what you see in the tv ads from the 50s in this movie. She, like most American housewives of the 50s, felt they were shortchanging their husbands and especially children if they did not provide a home-cooked meal every night. I still make some of her recipes, and they are still good.Child's real innovation was not, therefore, that she convinced American housewives to actually cook dinner: they were already doing that. She introduced the French idea of cooking as an art. Housewives certainly took pride in presenting good meals to their families before her, but the range of what they cooked was more limited, and the recipes were not that fancy. It was pretty much meat, potatoes (or pasta), and veggies. The highest praise was that it was filling.Child gave women-middle and upper-class women, at least-the idea that there could be something intellectually rewarding about preparing a variety of different dishes. Going past meatloaf could be rewarding, even if hubbie was perfectly satisfied with it.Once we get past that part of the movie and into Child's life, it's really pretty much all gravy. I was amazed at all the photos and home movies the staff found, some even of intimate moments. (I gather Child's husband, Paul, set up cameras in their homes to take pictures of them together.) The talking heads in the center of the movie know what they're saying, speak authoritatively, and don't go off on dithyrambs of encomia.If you want real detail on how Child wrote her first, best-known book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, you'll need to read her book about her life in France, which is a great read. 90 minute documentaries can't get into that sort of detail.On the other hand, this documentary does a nice job of covering other, non-culinary aspects of her life, such as her support of gay and abortion rights.Good use is made of both diaries and letters.In short, a very fine movie.",False
2,8,Down to earth documentary,mahashakir,n/a,16/08/2025,Thoroughly enjoyed. To the point and no time wasted repeating the same info several times. The story is very interesting to anyone who enjoys cooking.,False
3,9,Julia... Julia... Julia,scharolina,n/a,16/08/2025,"By far the best documentary on Julia to date. Julia was such an influence on the culinary culture and that was highlighted. Julia Childs was such a phenomenal woman and this documentary confirmed that! There were more 'fillers' than I would have like to see. I personally feel they could have added a few more facts or footage but overall the story was well told. There were a lot of amazing food shots throughout the film that made me want to go and try to prepare what I saw (LOL), but I guess that was the point. The story itself was very inspirational and uplifting. I appreciate the honesty of the documentary as well. Julia's friends were pretty candid on the type of woman she was.",False
4,n/a,Solid Doc gives an overview of Julia Child's life,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Julia Child was such a larger than life person that it's no surprise that she has had a theatrical film (JULIE & JULIA) and a current TV series (HBO's Julia) made about her in the years since her passing. JULIA is a feature documentary that sort of bridges the gap between those two projects.Directed by RGB filmmakers Julie Cohen and Betsy West JULIE paints a pretty clear picture of Child's life story. Like RGB, this plays very much as an authorized biography (Child's books and her foundation are credited) so don't expect too much in the way of deep critique; Although it is mentioned that Child wasn't the greatest in sharing credit with her co-authors on her breakthough book, Mastering The Art Of French Cooking. Child was also seen as slow to accept social progress and modern cuisine.Child (who was also a local hero in Boston where her PBS show originated) is seen as a lively presence who was both driven by her evangelizing over her cooking and a devoted wife. Indeed, JULIA is really two love stories: with her husband, Paul Child and with French Cooking (well, maybe three - Butter!).",False
5,10,Simply marvelous...,thatmanstumotoconcepts,n/a,16/08/2025,"The love, enjoyment and wonder that filled the life of this remarkable lady is shared and felt as you watch and listen. It also makes plain that the (mostly) well intentioned parodies of her voice, mannerisms and actions are as much a pale imitation of her as the various attempts to showcase her achievements and impact. This film does a wonderful job of seeing her as she seemingly was. What she felt, how she felt and what she did and why. Watch and enjoy and share the love.",False
6,10,"A Fun, Yet Informative Documentary Showing What A Strong Independent Woman Julia Was",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're looking for a fun, yet informative documentary, then Julia is a perfect film for you. This documentary is great both cinematically and educationally. The detail and effort put into this documentary is seen throughout the film.Julia is a new documentary about famous cook, author and television personality, Julia Child. It follows her through the struggles of being a woman in the film industry, her 12 year struggle to publish Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and her fight with breast cancer. This film talks about how Ms. Child changed the cooking industry, and America in general - forever.This film takes an extra deep dive into Child's life, going from where and when she was born all the way through her cooking career, up to her tragic death. It has great detail, exceptional archival footage and sound bites, which add to its interest. Some of the information about Julia are so fascinating that I really just had to learn more. She really was a hilarious person! Julia was such a character and that is what makes this film really fun to watch. My favorite part is when it talks about Child's love life, because I really love learning that Julia was such an independent woman. She didn't get married until she was 35! I thought that was really cool.The message of Julia is that dedication and hard work will help you achieve your goals. Julia had some struggles as a woman in the television industry, but with her hard work, she was able to overcome all of it. There are a few sexual references in this documentary and a very small bit of profanity to watch out for.I give Julia 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The film releases in theaters November 19, 2021. By Kendall B., KIDS FIRST!",False
7,7,People wil leave cinema hungry! It provides an extra oomph!,gregorymannpress-74762,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Julia""Julia was more than a cook. She was a cultural force. That summation of cooking and TV phenomenon Julia Child begins an exploration into how one of America's most unique television-era and literary figures jump-started a food revolution. ""Julia"" brings to life the legendary cookbook author and television superstar who changed the way Americans think about food, television, and even about women. Using never-before-seen archival footage, personal photos, first-person narratives, and cutting-edge, mouth-watering food cinematography, the film traces Julia Child from her well-to-do childhood in Pasadena, California, to the 'Far East' during 'World War II', where as an OSS worker she met her future husband Paul Child. One of the few women to attend Paris 'Le Cordon Bleu' school, Julia Child became a bestselling author in her 50s thanks to the seminal cookbook 'Mastering The Art Of French Cooking'.An appearance on Boston public television led to her mega-successful public TV show 'The French Chef', decades of celebrity, and a dedication to teaching Americans the joys of cooking. ""Julia"" is the story of a woman conquering the male-dominated food world, but it's also a feminist love story; Paul Child served as his wife's fiercest advocate and loudest cheerleader. ""Julia"" unwraps how one of the modern era's most entertaining and vibrant personalities sparked a re-evaluation of the culinary arts and a love of food in the United States as she seasoned her days with romance, curiosity, and a recipe for living life to the fullest. It's the empowering story of a woman who found her purpose, and her fame, at 50, and took America along on the whole delicious journey.The love of cooking is now central to American culture, with an appreciation for the artistry of preparing delicious cuisine filling 'Instagram' accounts, 'Twitter' feeds, airwaves, blogs, and bookshelves. It's a complete generational shift from the way Americans used to see food, which in the 'Mad Men' era of 60-plus years ago ran the gamut from blood-red meat and potatoes to unimaginative processed food. That's, until one woman changed American palettes; Julia Child brought continental recipes and an excitement about the experience of cooking to kitchens across the United States with her bestselling 1961 book 'Mastering The Art Of French Cooking', and then brought her playful and unique personality and her love of food into homes with her groundbreaking syndicated program 'The French Chef', which ran from 1963 to 1973. ""Julia"" shows how the standard at the time for local television programs was low-budget academic shows, with stiff and academic hosts seemingly. We're going to be comprehensive here and do a magnum opus of French cooking as it had never been done before. It was a big, serious book by a woman, an encyclopedia of food from another culture.The book meant a lot to people and symbolized something in the culture and especially to American women. And when she bursts onto the airwaves in the 1960s, it was a time people thought there was a certain way a woman on TV was supposed to be, they should have a quiet voice, be demure and petite, preferably blonde, certainly young, and either a sex bomb or a quote-unquote housewife type with every hair in place. Julia was the opposite of all of that, and it was because she became a television star by happenstance. She was a real human being with a great wacky personality, and it turns out, people really liked that. She brought a very French philosophy that food is sensual, and eating meals isn't a boring thing you have to do; it's one of the great pleasures of the world. That's a fairly new idea for a lot of Americans. We take it for granted now that we've all of these cooking shows, but before Julia, there wasn't much. She was unique as a personality in the '70s, and then in the '80s, as cable television took off and the 'Food Network' and other channels began to see people responding to cooking, the genre grew. It cut across generations to people who aspired to cook and who enjoyed watching other people cook. In 2004, Julia Child succumbed to kidney failure, passing away at the age of 91.When you think about the great food personalities on TV now, Julia's idea about cooking is very much a part of it. Food is not just a series of steps to prepare a meal. It's about making a festive, pleasurable experience for us all to share. The emotional impact of food is huge. When you're looking at food, it's as a combination of all the senses: The visual, how you're smelling different ingredients, the way they dissolve on your taste buds, the texture of it. When you're cooking, it's about anticipation and understanding how you're building the meal. Through the macro food photography, the film brings the audience up close and personal in order for them to see the steam, see the bubbles bursting in gravy, see mmmmmmmm slowed down, gives us inspiration. It's amazing how alive those food sections feel, partly because of the sound design. Something about seeing those dishes being made just bring to mind a delightful, rolling river.Written by Gregory Mann.",False
8,10,Julia-A Love Story,bmccarthy-41135,n/a,16/08/2025,"At is core, this doc is a love story. Love between Julia and her TV audience, love of food, and the love she shared with her beloved husband Paul. Julia Child had an amazing back story. There is much to learn about her childhood and career before she went to France. She was a woman before her time. In my view she was the culinary version of Eleanor Roosevelt. Wonderful home movie footage and interviews provide color to her story. It was lovely to learn about her activism in the women's and gay rights movement. Best of all is her love story with Paul Child- a story that is heartwarming and sexy!",False
9,7,A show about a beautiful personality ruined by the producers politics,hhbezc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Julia. Everyone loves Julia.It's too bad that the director made it a political piece for today, when Julia was not trying to make a political stand for the year 2021. All she wanted was to inspire cooks 1912-2004. Please let cooking be about food, not politics.",False
10,10,julia,mossgrymk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wonderful documentary/bio of the culinary genius who more than any other person dragged America out of 1950s TV dinner hell and put it on a path to where its cuisine is now comparable to that of any other country (well, except, maybe, Italy). Among this film's many virtues is fast pacing (it manages to cover all the salient points in 90 min), judicious use of the subject's own voice, a good assortment of, although not over reliance on, talking heads that include friends, colleagues and family, and a balanced tone that brings out the subject's warts...homophobia and venality being the two most egregious, in my view,,,as well as the virtues, chief among which is a generosity of spirit and an inexhaustible enthusiasm and energy. Bravo to directors Julie Cohen and Betsy West. Definitely an A.",False
11,10,Dedicated Capture,JoshuaMercott,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs documentaries go, this one was long overdue. Celebrating the life of one of the greatest most passionate chefs to grace our time, ""Julia"" tapped into nostalgic archival footage and delivered a crisp perfectly 'cooked' documentary that was as meticulous and delicious as Julia Child's culinary brilliance.Julie Cohen and Betsy West directed this amazing addition to the hall of celebrity documentaries. Various prominent names featured in it, including José Andrés, Jacques Pepin, Ina Garten, André Cointreau, Susy Davidson, Danièle Mazet-Delpeuch, François Simon, and others.Rachel Portman's musical scoring was amazing. Great work all round by every crew member who was part of this project. Special shout-out to Carla Gutierrez's editing, which made the docu flow like a charm.This documentary did more than capture a TV sensation and cookbook author, it highlighted the hard work of a woman who became a legend, and for all the right reasons. Few people will deny that Julia Child changed the way we see food - especially French cuisine - and the business behind it. She was, and still is, an inspiration to women.Let's also not forget that this masterful chef was a true foodie at heart, thus inspiring the so-called trend way back when, when social media was not yet conceived. Julia Child is most certainly an icon and cultural phenomenon.If you haven't seen Meryl Streep's take on this outstanding person, go check out the movie ""Julie & Julia"". Meanwhile, add this documentary to your watchlist - it was evocative and excellent in every way.",True
12,3,Saint Julia and her Magic Rolling Pin!,ldavis-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"The makers of this ""Girl Power"" stomach bomb would have you believe that no harried housewife in human history had ever made a meal from scratch until Julia Child burst into living rooms across America on July 26, 1962 to save humanity from the horror of Swanson frozen TV dinners; I had to look up the date because the makers of this ""Girl Power"" stomach bomb couldn't be bothered to slap it on the screen. The upshot (and I doubt anyone has ever realized this) is that Saint Julia wanted to have it both ways: she poo-pooed the patriarchy (in the form of her stiff-as-a-starched-shirt papa) which ""kept"" Harried Housewife chained to her unhappy home, yet the heretics at Swanson never came out with a Boeuf à la Bourguignon frozen TV dinner -- she expected Harried Housewife to make THAT one all by herself!The irony is Saint Julia was ""saved"" from becoming a Harried Housewife (albeit, an Über-Privileged Harried Housewife) by a man. Better yet, Paul Child ""saved"" Saint Julia ""from"" Stiff-as-a-Starched-Shirt Papa. As this IS HBO, John McWilliams is depicted as a Leftist Boogeyman: über-wealthy, über-conservative, über-bigoted, and (gad!) a Nixon supporter! Indeed, so taken are they with their Stiff-as-a-Starched-Shirt Papa Bashing, the makers of this ""Girl Power"" stomach bomb couldn't be bothered to give props to the three woman who helped make Saint Julia a household name: Louisette Bertholle, co-author of Mastering the Art of French Cooking; Knopf's Judith Jones, who pushed to get said opus published; and Knopf's Avis DeVoto, who edited and guided said opus.Anyone familiar with Julia Child's life will find no big reveals here; anyone not familiar with her life will find even less.",False
13,10,I wish all bios were this well made.,planktonrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Julia"" is a new biography about Julia Child and it currently is playing on HBO Max. I was looking for the new TV series on Ms. Child but was suprised to find this film as well.The film follows the life and career of Julia Child and is filled with lots of film footage of her on TV...which isn't surprising considering how prolific she was on the small screen. However, in addition, they include a lot of very nice interviews with folks who knew her as well as photographs. Put together, they present a very loving portrait of the lady and make you love her and her work. Well worth seeing.",False
14,9,Her story has moved my soul,ljohoo,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a remarkable woman, and this doc does an excellent job of portraying Child's humanity, passion, and cultural impact. Well-paced with a lovely score, visually pleasing B-roll, heaps of archival footage, and talking-head testimonials from people who knew or were impacted by Child, all poignantly punctuated throughout with the voice of Julia herself in the form of voiceover narration taken from interviews given during her lifetime.My only complaint is that frequently there are shown passages from journal entries and letters written by Child and her husband Paul, but they are displayed in a handwritten font that was a bit too small, such that I found it somewhat difficult to read at a glance. I had to often pause and/or skip back to catch what was written.Overall, a definite recommend for anyone interested in the learning more about the life of the original celebrity chef and an undeniable American cultural icon.",False
15,9,"Excellent, but missing a crucial component",spartanbuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a properly fitting film about Julia Child, and it captures her spirit and what she was all about faithfully and indelibly.However, I was greatly disappointed that absolutely no mention was made of Julia's closest friend Avis DeVoto, who was largely responsible for the book Mastering the Art of French cooking into the right hands. And played a huge role as Julia's confidante during the whole cook book's process. In fact the negligence to include Avis is in the gross category. Therefore the film remains slightly incomplete, however wonderful it is.",False
16,10,Delightful,cockezville,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was perfect. I really felt I got to know Julia Child and her love for what She did.

17,1,Produced by the Woman Who Brought Down CBS News,theaudionotch,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first thing anyone should know about this documentary is that the producer, Betsy West, is the woman who used false documents for an exposé on George Bush. Her actions brought down the CBS news division and ended the career of Dan Rather. Despite this, the executives at the well-respected CNN somehow thought it would be a good idea to employ her for this project. Big mistake.In watching this show, one must assume that West once again checked her journalistic integrity at the door. A case in point are the added sound effects over footage that didn't originally contain such audio. Or perhaps it's the questionable treatment of foreign speakers whose original voice is muted only to be replaced by that of a voiceover artist.West's producing abilities don't stand the test of basic logic. The viewer is left to squint throughout the show as she constantly uses difficult-to-read handwriting samples from Julia Child and her husband. Worse yet, the text is far too small, even on a large screen. That's one of many rookie mistake made to be ""artistic.""HBO is currently running a scripted version of Julia Child's story. Although it elapses over multiple episodes, it is far more interesting.This CNN show is based on three books but doesn't serve them well. I made several attempts over three days to get through this documentary, but West's stale approach to storytelling had me falling asleep repeatedly.Ultimately the audience is treated to a taste of Julia Child's life, but it's sour, suffering from poorly created ingredients.",False

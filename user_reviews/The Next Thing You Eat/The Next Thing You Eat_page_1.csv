1,8,"If you're a fan of Dave Chang, you'll enjoy this.",jasminee-16852,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a fan of his podcasts and I've found that this show gives the same vibe. Dave is so passionate and thoughtful about all aspects of food and it comes though in this show. For those complaining about the profanity, get over it. He's just being himself and it's fine.",False
2,7,David Chang continuing to become more aware and concious about the impact of climate change on the food industry and everything we know about it.,noominuggs,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show brings up the heavy subjects of our soon to be reality where meat, fish and dairy-industries have become too unsustainable and too little to feed the very fast population of humans on this world.It's just too bad the makers of the show continue to make excuses to continue their own contribution to the habits of eating meat as an example.You might hope they would start to actually implement these changes we all need to do in our daily life. Especially being restaurant owners and influencers on how and what to eat.I really like David Chang, in this series you also see him confronting the issue of climate change head on. Which is interesting and good. And I guess you also see the human psyche trying to cope with it. The anxiety that comes along with it. It just would've been nice to see him actually go ""Ok thats it, I'm using lab fish. No more ocean fishing."" when they try it and actually say ""99,9% of th people would never know the difference when they ate it"".Good series overall I just wish it'd actually make them take that extra step we all rather soon have to take.",False
3,6,Entertaining until it's NOT,alvstair,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was really excited for this show because I've been a big fan of David since Mind of a Chef. However the hipster/trendy chefs this show features is just cringy. The United States just honestly has such a toxic ""foodie scene"" which seems like some overblown fusion bubble.",False
4,n/a,Have You Never Worked in a Kitchen?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Anyone who's ever worked in a professional kitchen knows the expletives fly all the time. Big deal. The content is far more important than a few swear words. I'd bet good money that the majority of wowsers here whining about the bad language voted for a president with yellow hair and a fake tan.,False
5,10,Complaining about a chef swearing is ridiculous,jsc-00881,n/a,16/08/2025,"Have ya'll ever talked to a chef in real life? Good, interesting show. Fun to watch and think about. It explores different trends in cooking and discusses some of their rammifications.",False
6,1,Good chef sabotages himself with bad language,irismckay-07445,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a shame that such a talented chef comes off as a narcissistic adolescent with the constant swearing and unfocused treatment of this topic.It's always sad when someone extremely talented doesn't follow simple courtesies--like thinking about families that might want to watch this, and instead treats it as a vanity piece. Maybe stay in the kitchen and cook and leave the speaking to someone more polished.",False
7,3,In your face profanity,family_arroyo,n/a,16/08/2025,I agree with the other review about his language. This does seem like an interesting topic but I couldn't get past the opening credits with all the swear words. Certainly not a family friendly show. Really? A food show that's TV-MA?,False
8,1,Why the swearing like a teenager trying really hard to be cool?,saramarion-45474,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really?!? Be an adult and expand your vocabulary, so you can create something everyone can watch. Really interesting topic, which makes it even more sad. If it wasn't peppered with this guy's attempts to fit in with the cool crowd, I'm sure it would have been a great show. Unfortunately, I didn't make it past the first episode out of sheer annoyance.",False
9,3,Trash Talkin,specialsiren,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had really high hopes for this series, but I couldn't make it past the first few minutes due to all the swearing. Is that really part of his branding? It's just impossible for me to take this guy seriously. Maybe David Chang is under the impression that swearing elevates his ""street cred"" among the target audience - young urban kids ('yukkies'). He sounds like a pre-teen trying to appear edgy and ""tough"" in front of older high school kids by dropping F-bombs as much as possible. In reality, peppering your language with expletives only results in having all your credibility and respectability thrown out the window. It might be an interesting series; too bad it panders to the gutter-mouth, trash talkin', ghetto 'hood mentality. It leaves a bad taste in your mouth and is wholly unappetizing. Skip it.",False
10,1,Might Have Been Good,jhuebel,n/a,16/08/2025,"This might have been interesting. But 60 seconds into the first episode we've got an F-bomb along with several other swear words. Why?This review is based on that 60 seconds only. So if you're OK with unnecessary profanity, you might enjoy this. I'm not OK with unnecessary profanity, so I'm out.",False

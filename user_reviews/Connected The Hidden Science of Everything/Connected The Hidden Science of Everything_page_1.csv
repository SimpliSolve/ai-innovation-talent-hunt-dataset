1,8,Not as bad as the reviews are saying,fmwittmann,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been following Latif in the podcast Radiolab, so I am already used to his style. It was nice no see something that was not only audio but also visual. If you are expecting an typical documentary, skip it. This is going to feel more like a ""video podcast"".",False
2,8,"Intriguing, and so innate",santoshambekar19,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a wonderful series, it was so intriguing and interesting to keep us glued on it,. With only 6 episodes on different topics that are connected in some way, the series hold is unto it,.
Waiting for more...",False
3,8,"The host seems a bit annoying in the first 1-2 episodes, but he quickly grows on you, and the show is surprisingly interesting and engaging.",garnet-suss,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm 43.The host is a bit like a young Bill Nye, meaning his enthusiasm seems kind of fake/rehearsed. Obviously the show is heavily scripted though, so a fair amount of acting is required of him. That being said, he does a good job of presenting the information in a way that would appeal to inquisitive tweens and teens, and still manages to be engaging and entertaining for adults.I learned a great deal from season 1, and I genuinely enjoyed it as a source of engaging entertainment. If you're a teacher, have kids, or are an inquisitive adult, check this show out.",False
4,9,Must watch.,sunvalleycats,n/a,16/08/2025,Outstanding and very informative. Don't shoot the messenger; some of my best teachers were whacky.,False
5,9,Seems like everyone is losing their sense of humor.,strandaliss-52128,n/a,16/08/2025,"To all the people who wrote reviews saying ""I couldn't get through the first episode"". Stop reviewing things. You owe any show more than 1 episode to develop. That being said far too many people judged Latif without getting to know his style. His enthusiasm is real and by the third episode I was nerding out.",False
6,7,Connected : The Actions of Latif Nasser,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,n/a,16/08/2025,"To be honest, I would like to see more episodes. There were also topics that seemed completely absurd. The digits episode was extremely bad and ridiculous. However, I enjoyed the other episodes. Latif Nasser clearly enjoys science, as evidenced by his actions. However, their behavior can be bizarre at times. Shaking his head very quickly, saying ""wooooow"" or his eyes, etc. Overall, I enjoyed this documentary series. I think the topics chosen were also good. As I said, I wish it had more episodes. Three years have passed; I am curious if there will be a new season. It was a great idea to show animation while talking about the past or something that happened in the past; I really enjoyed those parts.",False
7,9,Very interested,michaelnicholasluciano,n/a,16/08/2025,I like Latif Nasser a lot. I think he is going for a Bill Nye type persona but can understand some of the other reviews here.As for the concept and execution of the show it was really great! The episode on Dust was fascinating,False
8,6,(Latif Naseer is so annoying)¬≤ X 5,tygertygerburningbright,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting and good topics and nice production and unfortunately ruined by the host.I MEAN OMG. LIKE UNBELIEVABLE. I CAN'T EVEN
...This needs to be at least 150 characters so here is unnecessary words to just fill in the empty space just like the host does in this production actually. So there you go...",False
9,10,The host is kind of a comedian and the show becomes more interesting,kompong_jy,n/a,16/08/2025,Many people blamed about the host but I think he is apparently interesting. For such way to watch a science documentary is kind of a new experiences which is nice.Be kind everyone! I also respect everyone's taste maybe different.,False
10,n/a,"Interesting topics, insufferable host",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I've always been a science geek and the topics are great. However the show becomes unwatchable because Latif seems to have an irresistible urge to constantly play himself up as some cool eccentric hipster. However he ends up coming across as a dbag poser. It's grating.,False
11,7,Nice Travel Budget,Erik_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"First 4 episodes are pretty good, even though the host sometimes acts over the top, like a big-eyed elementary school teacher/kid.The last two episodes go wacko Leftist and get very Kumbaya-preachy.I was mostly in awe of the show's travel budget.",False
12,10,"Interesting, funny, captivating, can't wait for another season",sportsto3,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no idea which host some of these comments are referring to because I don't think this show could have had a better host!!Latif is brilliant, he is funny, he is fun to watch and is amazing at delivering key topics..I for one love his expressions and way of presenting. Rock on Latif!The show it self left me thinking about things, I didn't even know existed. It makes you stretch your imagination in regards to the number of things in this world that are connected. This is a MUST WATCH, get your popcorn ready because you are in for a treat. Netfilx made a great decision in having a show like this up.Awesome job and Kudos to the whole team..If you are reading this review and haven't watched the show..check it out! My fav episode was on ""The cloud""",False
13,7,"Good concept, okay delivery",IllyJoa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't think the host was annoying. He tried to make the topics fun and tried to get the scientists out of their comfort zone. Others here are clearly overreacting.The serie itself had interesting elements to it. For me personally I would have wanted more of a deep dive on each topic but that's not the premise of the series. It's a little bit superficial but brings interesting topics to light that you can then research more in your own time. Therefore I give it a 7/10. I think the delivery could have been better. There were 6 episodes . With +/- 40 minutes each they could have given us way more information or set a central theme. Either way, the series was okay.",False
14,5,What a waste.,eshmana,n/a,16/08/2025,"I got through three-quarters of the poop episode and bailed out. The subject matter and sheer scope of this documentary is top-drawer, but I simply couldn't stand him. The producers need to employ an adult to present this if there's a second series.A real shame.",False
15,8,Beautiful Angel to relook and appreciate many thingsüëçüèª,rawork-26132,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoy almost every minute of the show. Yes, I believe some of the connections were a stretch, but over all amazingly done.",False
16,9,I simply don't get the hatred behind the narrator,savvehiclecrazy,n/a,16/08/2025,"As with Netflix's reknown documentary making antics, this is one another extremely well made docu-series with a great outline on each episode. It was beautifully carried forward by L Nasser. I simply don't get the hatred he gets, especially because he has risen to this level not through the entertainment business but, him being a research journalist himself with the sublime podcast under his belt. Worth the sheer effort! Cinematography & music couldn't be better and suited this series to a T. The topics discussed were also very different from the rest and a unique twist on each of them, connecting them together in the end. Brilliant!",False
17,6,Connections for the 21st century,badidgalinkin,n/a,16/08/2025,"This reminds me of James Burkes Connections. I loved that show and it still lives on youtube. Science and history and connections between the two done in an engaging way. Some don't like the host but I think anyone who can get someone interested in science even if that science is watered down has accomplished something. Enjoy, then go look up the topics and learn more.",False
18,9,Give Latif Nasser a chance. It's awesome content.,massee-11036,n/a,16/08/2025,"So I've been seeing a lot of negative feedback in relation to the quirky style that Nasser brings to the series as a narrator. I've been a long time supporter of Radiolab, so I'm used to Nasser's style of presentation, as well as his in-depth reporting.That being said, this series is great. The content and the topics of discussion are all pretty interesting. Each episode expands on relatively uninteresting topics, but presents them in a way that sparks intrigue. The investigative reporting is also quite good and the sources involved, on and off camera, bring a great deal of credibility to the show. This series is great for any age group, probably more so ages 12+.
I'd say you'd particularly enjoy this series if you're open to new ideas and interested in all things science. The cinematography is amazing and the visuals included in each episode keep the attention and intrigue flowing.",False
19,9,Balanced Approached,finegalal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great host, people who rated him poorly don't understand the power of enthusiasm.Besides, let's be honest most people need things to be explained simply the way that he does.Also he's trying to be balanced and PC in the way he presents things.People are ruining the planet and he could be depressing about it but he chooses to stay balanced and present the facts.",False
20,9,Feels like a radiolab videocast,Simon13-66-887748,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can understand that it's maybe an acquired taste, but if you like the radiolab/ this American life style of podcast and story telling than this is the show for you.Though, the visuals don't add much for me, I could have listened to it as an audiobook and enjoyed it exactly the same, I do like that Latif Nasser gets this chance to present himself to a larger audience. He stays true to his own tone even with cameras on him.",False
21,5,"Interesting topics, but I agree with some reviewers about the infantile host",mapika,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nevertheless I watched all episodes. Great topics, some things you might already have heard of, some not so much.Sometimes there was very important information missing. Like in the episode about clouds. It's crucial to know about the downside of using chemicals to make artificial rain since over more then 50 years! This effects the nature of course in a bad way! Would have been nice, if he could provide more information from all sides.But instead Latif Nasser's only comment on this was something like: ""Wow, can you imagine, we can make the clouds rain!"" ...
That's about the way he ends every conversation with his interview partners.
His voice not only sounds annoying to me, but the way he talks makes this show seem to be made for under 8 year old kids.
With his over and over repeating phrases like ...Oh, wow, can you believe this?!... Oh, wow... really?! ... He comes across like an idiot, totally unnatural and exaggerated. I have nothing against goofy or wacky, like some reviewers call his way, but if you go for it, there needs to be a bit of good humor too.That's just not the right way to talk to adults and teenagers.My conclusion: Latif Nasser would rather fit in a children's show, even then the target group should not be older than eight years.
With more depth to the topics and an adult host, let him/her be serious or a comedian, I don't care, this show could become more popular. Everything else was really good, the topics, the camera, the editing, the interview guests...Netflix, it would be worth a try and change the host, please!",False
22,10,liked the show liked the host,pambreesh,n/a,16/08/2025,Topics are really very comman but the investigative reporting and some of facts presented never known before are really jaw dropping . i liked the narrating style of latif nasser. this show is suitable for any age group .,False
23,10,Well-Researched and Executed Expertly!,henryshear,n/a,16/08/2025,"My curiosity for the show was piqued when my father began describing the first episode, specifically the birds. I became enthralled and found that I was amazed at the wide scope of a certain subject. Each episode focuses on a global perspective and discusses a multitude of solutions to global warming, natural disasters and patterns.I can truly say after watching this show that my view of the world has changed forever. Truly everything is connected in unforeseen and unexpected ways. I was shocked by episode 4 specifically. I don't know how anyone could watch that episode and not re-examine the world around them differently. If you are reading this review, it is critical that you watch episode 4.I am a newfound fan of Latif Nasser too. He is very accomplished and clearly a very educated man. He attended Dartmouth for undergrad and then Harvard for graduate school. I know he has a team of researchers and writers who are finding interesting topics and studies, but he is an amazing host and is able to have friends or former professors on the show.This has been one of my favorite docuseries to watch. I am not typically a fan, but I am so interested in both Latif Nasser and other topics that I will continue to follow his work. I was thrilled to find out that he narrated Rotten, another docuseries on Netflix, so that is what I will watch next! Please watch the show, it is amazing!!!",False
24,9,Don't Believe the Negative Reviews,suman_bhaumik,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't understand what's with all the negative reviews. I liked the documentary series and the information presented there. The host is not that bad as the reviews are stating. We need a fun guy to present scientific information so that it will a fun to digest instead of a serius guy hosting them. Please go and watch it.,False
25,10,So interesting and so well presented!,aparnasachar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I got completely hooked on to this series from the get go! Latif Naseer is an amazing presenter. If you find him surprised all the time, that is because he is! I was equally surprised to hear all the amazing things he researched and presented. His humour is spot on! I am just awestruck to see the connection in everything in the universe. We are all more connected than divided and the world leaders fail to see that. I loved each and every episode but my favourite episode was episode 4.",False

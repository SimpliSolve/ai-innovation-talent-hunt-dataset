1,5,Misleading title,HenrikBakke94,n/a,16/08/2025,"If the point of this documentary was to portray the lives of the mercenaries involved, it would have been a decent film. I've gained a deeper understanding of what it means to be a mercenary, but when it came to the point of the film, I realized that there were no bottom line to be found here.Pablo Escobar is just a footnote in this documentary, making it kinda pointless to watch. Most of the film is about how the mercenaries got into their profession, while the assassination ""attempt"" is saved for last.",False
2,1,Pointless,Zaraki_Kenapachi,n/a,16/08/2025,One of the most pointless things made. People hired for what could have been an awesome mission but instead a mission that never happened and certainly didn't deserve a 90 min feature.,False
3,2,WRONG IN SO MANY WAYS,philip-00197,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where to start...
Why not with the title - it's misleading.The rhetoric- it's boring.The ranting - going on and on...Arguably most importantly - the way their conduct is, not, scrutinised. These are not soldiers - they are simply murderers for hire. By their own admittance; they were hired by a group of ""businessmen"", agreed to kill a guy, traveled to a foreign country not knowing who it was and, once there, found out who their target was.The mission they accepted was to assassinate a random guy. Talking about their undertaking as if they were an elite, special forces, outfit falls nothing short of pathetic.",False
4,8,Intriguing story about a virtually unknown episode,alexjhillman,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAnyone who has read related books/articles or watched the Netflix series ""Narcos"" will already know that Pablo Escobar did not die at the hands of British mercenaries in 1989.However, this is a gripping tale of how close those men came to actually making that happen.The story is told from the perspective of three of the surviving members of the team, including the head of the group (Dave Tomkins) and the leader of the assault team (Peter McAleese).Various other key contributors are interviewed, such as the DEA agents portrayed in the ""Narcos"" series - Javier Pena & Steve Murphy - who provide valuable background on the situation in Columbia at the time.The team was made up of tough and battle-hardened hired guns; many coming from Special Forces (SAS) backgrounds and all having that fatalistic (British) battlefield sense of humour.McAleese, in particular, gives a fascinating insight into his background which adds to the human element of the story.The fact that their assassination attempt on Escobar was undone by a helicopter crash in bad weather during their required low-level incursion, does nothing to take away from the excellent build up, recounted by the main protagonists and aided with actual footage shot by Tomkins at the time.I found it fascinating to watch and knew nothing of this episode of history prior to seeing this. Other harsh user reviews seem a little unfair to me.My advice - give this a watch.They may not have killed Escobar, but there was every chance they may have done had their mission gone to plan...",True
5,3,Misleading title,d3lta_mike,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is not about Escobar, it is rather about the fight for redemption of the leader of a group of mercenaries allegedly hired by the rival Cali cartel to eliminate him after discovering what a nasty person he has been all his life. Rather boring viewing certainly not worth the long duration.",True
6,1,Like listening to a drunk in a pub,jps-83322,n/a,16/08/2025,Over an hour of some guy telling you stories that sound ridiculous.,False
7,2,Tiresome bar stories.,bctabbert-53323,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIf these blokes were in my local pub and telling these stories, I'd move to the other end of the bar. ""Ex-SAS"" and ""best soldiers in the world"" but they can't stay sober and they are so out of shape they have to do basic exercises for weeks on end to get ""ready"".",True
8,2,Abit disappointed.,kieranthomas-89641,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBit of a pointless story, sent to kill Pablo, didn't and ended up a helicopter crash.",True
9,1,Really though?,susieandmatt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFunnily enough this programme, as it turns out, had absolutely nothing to do with the killing of Pablo Escobar. Not even close! This was a pedestrian attempt at idealising a bunch of A-team wannabes, who tried to get fit, gel as a squad, spray painted a helicopter then crashed it ... on the same continent and then had to be rescued. You had one job! ;-)",True
10,1,"Waste of time, what a joke, they haven't even encountered Escobar",mohammadmedawi,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerA story of not even encountering Escobar or his men....... Why make a documentary of how they planned and failed... Waste of time.. very disappointing.,True
11,1,Waste of time,guypid,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDon't get drawn in by the title. This is nothing more than a a group of people spinning a story that has so much promise, only to find out that nothing happens. I was so taken in with the build up, and then they crash on the way and get injured. Big deal. What a waste of time. Who cares.",True
12,n/a,So They Didn't Kill Him Then ?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have known two old friends, sadly now both deceased, who guarded Rudolf Hess in Spandau Prison ! Their stories were far more riveting than this drivel !",False
13,3,Misleading title,jrichardson-49239,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA group of mercenaries try to assassinate Escobar for a million zzzzzz
They brag on about their macho lives
Go to the jungle train for the mission and then crash helicopter on the way to escobars place the end
Waste of nearly two hrs of my life.",True
14,1,Dreadful,videocpd,n/a,16/08/2025,I can't believe I just wasted an hour and a half watching this drivel.,False
15,1,Bunch of losers,asadislam-87095,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis loser from Glasgow narrates this pointless movie using Escobar's name, just to sell the movie. Him and his crack group of mercenaries allegedly attempted to assassinate Escobar. Except, they didn't even get off the starting blocks. Crashed their helicopter and then had to be rescued by Colombians in the jungle. They were allegedly hired by the Cali Cartel. Someone was surely pulling their legs selling them these morons for hire. This story was never featured in Narcos (Brilliant Netflix series). That's because it's a load of old tosh.",True
16,2,Misleading title!!,rene_isager-01548,n/a,16/08/2025,Escobar is just secondary. Don't spend your time watching this documentary!,False
17,2,Misleading,bloodyjackuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAnyone that knows anything about Pablo. Know he wasn't killed by the brits. Let alone has-been soilders.I have a feeling this title was given to mislead viewers into thinking this is the other documentary where they follow dea agents and ultimately leading to killing PE. This documentary has some comedic values. There's a scene where the team are planning the attack by colouring in map. Suffice to say. This documentary isn't about killing PE, in fact it's a mini biography on Peter McAleese. Some say... SAS Captain John Price was is based on McAleese.",True

6,10,REMARKABLE FILM,sscidmore,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very moving film and I highly recommend it. It is a love letter to Gianni Versace for his artistic genius and his kindness and generosity to those around him. The film also describes a special time in South Beach when it was normal to see Versace walking on the street and Madonna, Prince and other celebrities partying in the clubs. Some of Versace's top male models describe their experiences working with him, and the models are smart, funny and very engaging. A female model turned artist describes her admiration for the enormity of Versace's talent and personality, and a docent at the former Versace mansion describes the beauty of the house. The passionate way the speakers describe Gianni Versace keeps the film lively and entertaining. There is also a good interview with Versace talking about his work and inspirations. Full disclosure: I am the docent in the film but think I have been objective. I saw the film twice, at the Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival and the Italian Embassy in D. C., and it was just as absorbing the second time around.",False

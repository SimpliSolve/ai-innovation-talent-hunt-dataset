1,10,A very well made capture of reality!,culturish,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI LOVED this documentary. The fact that is entirely made of photos was even more interesting because that gives us the opportunity to see the reality behind the events that happened in Czech Republic and the rollercoaster of experiences that she went through.I also loved the story of her life and the journey of finding herself throughout the years, in multiple countries. It really is a documentary that, once you see it, it makes you to think about all the aspects in your life and to question if you're really everything you want to be.Highly recommend for watching, it is an unforgettable and very interesting done documentary! :)",True

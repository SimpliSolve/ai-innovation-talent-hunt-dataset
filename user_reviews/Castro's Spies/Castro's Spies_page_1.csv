1,8,Castro's Spies - A very Irish perspective,simonpmcguinness,n/a,16/08/2025,"Castro's Spies is not just a very good film about Cuba, it is an important milestone in Irish documentary filmmaking. Taking the kind of insight normally reserved for Irish subject matter, Ollie Aslin and Garry Lennon have got inside a story to reveal truths that others have never even looked for, let alone attempted to capture on film. As a piece of documentary making it is entirely devoid of ego, whilst revealing egos larger than life, egos worthy of a historical canvas, egos as humans. A rare and beautiful thing.The protagonists tell their story, in their own words, sitting in the security of their own chairs in their own rooms without interference, without prodding, comfortable in their own skins. And what skins they are. What times they lived. What truths they speak.The narrative, which stretches from 1500 to 2015, involves perhaps 15 different storytellers, some of whom have three on-screen personas and even multiple identities, is illustrated with everything from news clips, cheesy 1970s docu-dramas, hammy reconstructions, mobile phone footage and family photographs. It should be a car crash, but it works. The variety of sources actually reveals the scale of the canvas, the breath of the evidence, the depth of the scholarship. It does all of that, whilst remaining true to the human beings involved. It is a rare service to the audience to take such diverse ingredients, such a complex story and never lose focus on the human beings involved.Much will be made of the never-before-seen archival footage: FBI surveillance film, rare colour film from the triumphant arrival of Castro into Havana. These are indeed noteworthy, but noteworthy for never having been looked for before. Others have not invested the time to search out such sources, only needing a quick gloss over to confirm their pre-programmed narrative. Not these guys. These guys are the read deal.Fascinating, enlightening and touching, the film is a rare glimpse into the reality of lives lived under the tyranny of imperialism, deformed by the legacy of colonialism. A very Irish perspective.",False
2,6,Castro,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn elite group of Cuban intelligence agents - recruited and trained in the U. S. - are released in America in this film that shows what it's really like to be a spy. Using never seen before footage from the Cuban Film Institute's archive and first-hand testimony from the people who actually lived to tell, Castro's Spies is an intriguing doc about the era of Cold War espionage.This film tells the true story of the Cuban Five - Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero, Ramón Labañino, Fernando González and René Gonzále - agents who were given new identities and sent to Miami to watch over people of interest for the Cuban government.Meanwhile, their families were told they were deserters and traitors.In September 1998, the Five were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, acting as an agent of a foreign government and other illegal activities - including failure to register as a foreign agent, which seems like a strange crime when you're a spy. Three years later, the Cuban government admitted that they were intelligence agents looking at the Cuban exile community, not the U. S. government.The Five appealed their convictions, which were overturned in 2005, then reinstated shortly afterward. The Supreme Court refused to review their case and it wasn't until 2014 that the last of the Five was able to return to Cuba.Directors and writers Ollie Aslin and Gary Lennon have taken footage from the past and mixed it with interviews with the Five, their compatriots and their enemies. This is a story I'd never heard before and I was so interested to learn more about this secret tale.",True

4,10,Watch this.,paulscib,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well presented account of a very important piece of world history. It shows the human side of conflict, but also the polarisation of nationalism and the need to go beyond the sense of immediate family.",False

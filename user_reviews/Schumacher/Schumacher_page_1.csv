1,7,Good but a missed opportunity!,Lewis_Heather787,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAnybody who is an Formula 1 fan is going to watch this plain and simple, no matter how long you've followed and enjoyed the sport. I am no different, I became an F1 fan at a very early age when Michael was winning at Ferrari. I was really excited to see a deeper look into the past and give me that nostalgia feeling.I feel a bit odd after watching this though! There are parts I really liked and enjoyed, however there are huge chunks of his career that are missing. I feel that the team behind this picked and chose material that would give them the best narrative. I would have much preferred it if they had made this film twice as long and forget trying to condense his entire life story into just a few moments.It does a great job of showing Michael at a young age and just getting started into F1 with Benetton. Winning early on and then the switch to Ferrari. Loved all of the time we spent with his fight with Mika Hakkinen. Eventually winning the first championship with Ferrari in 2000. However after that the film then cuts the rest of his life into the last 15 minutes especially the skiing accident. This left a bitter taste in the mouth for me and a bit of sadness. We don't get to see any of the other world championships he won with Ferrari dominating the sport for years and the fantastic races throughout that period. The big disappointment of not seeing anything about his on track fights with a young Fernando Alonso (who I actually supported at the time). His retirement from the sport was not made that big a deal? The film more or less then cuts straight to his comeback with Mercedes years later.Everything at the end felt rushed, crammed in and in a weird way a bit staged. This could easily have been a 2 hour 30 min epic documentary detailing everything and I bet you every F1 fan still would have watched it. This feels like a partially watered down version.......is it just me?Now I know I shouldn't compare but of course comparisons will be made between this documentary and ""Senna"" which was made almost a decade ago I think. That documentary is by far and away the superior film in my opinion, it gave me much more of an interesting, informative, emotional and powerful punch than ""Schumacher"" did.Now I know I've complained, moaned and whined a lot in this review lol. I did still enjoy this film, 70% out of 100, however for it to be about the great Michael Schumacher it felt a bit short compared to his legend status within the sport. If your new to F1 you'll get a buzz out of this and I encourage you to watch it, however if you are a bit more of an older fan like me you might be left wanting a bit more.Lastly, I think its safe to say that Michael Schumacher will never be seen the public eye ever again. This world can be very cruel at times!!!",True
2,7,Falls short of presenting a picture of the guy beyond what was already known,Sir_AmirSyarif,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hanns-Bruno Kammertöns, Vanessa Nöcker, and Michael Wech's aptly-titled Michael Schumacher documentary, Schumacher, speeds through years and titles without diving too deeply into any significant details. It is a heartwarming and riveting reflection on the Formula 1 icon, supported by the Schumacher family and hugely benefits from their database of photographs and home movies, but it falls short of presenting a picture of the guy beyond what was already known.",False
3,7,Interesting documentary,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary on seven-times Formula 1 World Champion Michael Schumacher. Through race footage and interviews with teammates, rivals, friends, family and himself we see his history and get a picture of a man who dominated the sport of motor racing.An interesting documentary on a man who is synonymous with Formula 1 and is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, F1 driver of all time. Shows well his history, his humble beginnings, how his experience as a child racing go-karts shaped him into the champion driver he would become, his ups and downs. The struggle years with Ferrari, the first few years he was there, are covered quite extensively and show his perseverance and the rewards for it.I could have done with more details of the races and championships though. Through narrowly focusing on Schumacher you miss out on the broader F1 history. On several occasions I had to reach for my phone and look up how a championship season ended and who won. Even in individual races the film just concentrates on a controversial Schumacher incident and then just leaves it at that, rather than tells us how the race ended.This also extends to Schumacher's golden period, 2000-2004, where, other the 2000 win, nothing much is said about the other four years. After showing us in grim detail the struggles of the early Ferrari years the producers could at least have allowed us to enjoy the pinnacle of his career. Once again I had to look up the details myself.Through interviews with his wife and children we also get to learn more about his private life. This is reasonably interesting and shows another side to Schumacher. However, this aspect is overdone, overly sentimental and starts to feel like a promotion.The lack of detail mentioned before then carries through to the conclusion. The skiing incident and aftermath is told in very cryptic terms. No details of what happened, no details of how he is now. It feels quite empty and once again the producers turn to sentimental interviews, rather than details, to fill in the space.Overall it's still quite interesting and does give you a decent picture of the man, his personality, history and achievements but falls short of being comprehensive or brilliant.",False
4,n/a,A tiny glimpse into one of F1 Greats,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary is far too short to even cover half of what happened in Michael's Career spanning across over two decades. It feels the most controversial moments are mentioned in passing, the biggest triumphs once again mentioned in passing. I find what Netflix does with Drive to survive allows you to fully understand what it was like to a far greater degree than the few hours this documentary allows us to see. Watching it I had not heard about Michael's skiing accident and watching it, it felt like he had died, and by the sounds of it part of him did. I agree with the obscurity left on it because he deserves to have the privacy.Overall it isn't a bad documentary by any means, and I do think it does well with the time it had. But I would have much rather had something twice as long going more in depth about the races, and title fights.",True
5,10,The last 10 minutes had me in tears,ankank-38910,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautifully told story of his racing career, taking a look at all the key highlights including his battles with Senna, Villenueve, Hill & Hakkinen. His wife plays a predominant role in telling the story, giving great insight as to how Schumi was behind the cameras. Credit to anyone who can hold their emotion back for the ending of the documentary which talks about his current well being, a racer he was, but above all he was a Father to two beautiful children - a must watch for any sporting fan.",False
6,9,"Yep, this ends up in tears",kalasnikof-53265,n/a,16/08/2025,"I won't say much, the film reminded me why we still miss this guy. He's one of those few chosen ones who are legends on their field and for a good reason.This is a beautiful tribute to him and I wish for his family to remain as beautiful as I saw them, united and proud. He built a strong, protective shield through out the years, one which he now needs the most. I hope for his recovery, to never see Corinnas tears on her face, or his childrens' sad eyes ever again.",False
7,7,A great recap of a fascinating character but poorly paced,bendyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI grew up during peak Schumacher and Hill, as a big F1 fan this was a real trip down memory lane. Kudos to the film makers and family for not hiding away from his ruthless streak. Schumacher was a real villain at times, this documentary doesn't hide from that.The early story of his rise to F1 was well explained and the pressures to get that World Championship for Ferrari is easily forgotten after he won 7!However championships 4 to 7 are hardly mentioned which is a shame as this was peak MSC, brutal in his efficiency at converting races to wins, wins to championships. I would have liked to have seen more of the passing of the batton as well to Alonso who stopped his winning streak.Very emotional at the end as the family talk quite openly about the challenges of recent years.All in all a great watch for any F1 fans.",True
8,9,Well put together but a bit short tribute to a true legend of the sport,naushad_7,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very emotional and well put together documentary covering Micheal's journey and showing his life on and off the track. It focuses not only his success but also his struggles.Personally I felt it was a bit short and could've been a multi part documentary series like The Last Dance , but regardless still a well made documentary ,credit to the team and the Schumacher family for this. A must watch for every formula one fan.Keep fighting Michael , hope you recover soon to witness Mick making you proud.",False
9,6,good but not that good,djurrepower,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of times the information given felt very spread out. This gave the docu an overall very slow feel. On top of that, everyone interviewed felt a little too positive about schumacher. Even if it's all genuine, I don't want to hear people talk about how great a guy he was for 1,5 hours. Overall a compatent docu, but could have been a lot better.6/10: good but not that much.",False
10,9,A must for F1 and Schumacher fans. A love story,Njs2016,n/a,16/08/2025,"I admit I am a Michael Schumacher fan. I didn't expect to be quite as moved by this as I was, what shines through is a real love story between Michael and Corinna, every shot and every picture tells that story. It underlined his career at every turn and every moment of his success.It is biased to the extent that it skims across his on track antics at the height of his career, but this isn't really a movie about that. It's a movie about passion, never giving up and also being humbled by life and acceptance of change.The star is really Corinna, the last interview section is from the heart and for those of us who grew up idolising the sporting hero we can only be happy that he has such a proud, protective and loving champion in her. Yes he had luck on the track as well as historic skill, but this movie makes you think that his marriage was the real luck and the real achievement and that carries on to this day.Keep believing MS.",False
11,6,"A nice eulogy, but lacked focus on racing.",wolfghostninja,n/a,16/08/2025,"By accounts Schumacher was not only one of the greatest drivers, but also one of the most ruthless. This documentary does a poor job of examining that ruthlessness, leaving us with a familial legacy rather than a racing legacy.",False
12,10,SUPERB! Took me back to my childhood...,andi_berisha94,n/a,16/08/2025,"Knowing the situation Michael is those last 8 years, I couldn't stop crying from the beginning until the end of it. An absolute masterpiece documentary and the perfect tribute to a legend like Schumacher. After watching this, I'm even more happy I've started following F1 in his time and proud becoming one of his millions worldwide fans.P.s. Hope he recovers as soon as possible and comes back to circuits watching his son Mick racing in F1 :)",False
13,6,DON'T WATCH FOR UPDATES ON SCHUMACHER'S STATUS,toddsgolfin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSomewhat interesting biography on Schumacher's rise to greatness with touching insight from family members. I watched this only in anticipation of an update on how Michael's doing today and more details on ""what happened"" in the skiing accident. I was deeply disappointed as you'll be too if you're looking for that.The final 10 minutes was extremely touching with his children talking about their father while showing highlights of their time with dad when they were younger. However, there was nothing revealed about Michael's condition. I sense his wife, whom we see talking about the love of her life, controlled virtually every aspect of the content.Due to Michael's long standing desire to protect his family's privacy...and don't get me wrong, as a father I totally get it...his wife will fight every attempt to produce an insightful biography of this racing legend's life...including details on his extremely heartbreaking accident and resultant life. Those who've seen the result of traumatic head injuries know it's not a pretty picture. But Michael's story could be used as a cautionary tale of how fragile life truly is.",True
14,5,What a missed opportunity!,theped,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCould be great, like Michael. But the film started good and then get worse and worse. Not enough fundamental episode that could totally unfold Schumy (like his comeback in 99!). Near zero story about his failure: it's how you became the greatest, overcoming them! (Not even Hakkinen's spa overtake has been shown). Nothing about the challenge vs Alonso (whaaat?!), not even a word about his last pole in Monaco. What a shame.Miles and miles worst than the film about Senna. Could be just as good. It isn't.",True
15,10,"For racing fans like me, a lot of nostalgia and inspiration",resireg,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, I am a Schumacher fan since 7 years old, when I betrayed my parents and pretty much my entire country that was supporting his rival back then in 1993.I liked him because he was punching above his weight and I just admired him as a person and racer. Sometimes it is hard to explain rooting for a team or athlete. It is a very subjective choice, but I was with him all the time.The film focus on his career from 1994-2000. Those were the years that his races were the most competitive. Also it marks a transition when F1 reverts its course from being a sport with bitter rivalries, betrayals and plots in the 80s to the more sanitized and professional league that it became in the 2000s.Schumacher was part of this transition and it is nice to see a documentary remindining us of his achievements and failures.Europeans and South Americans will enjoy this movie, but if you are North American, I don't recomend because F1 is not very well known in those markets.",False
16,10,The GOAT!!,boz_alkan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved it and I'd recommend this to everyone! His early days with Benetton, his struggle with Ferrari, his rival with Haikkinen. This had everything. I forgot how big Mika Haikkinen was as a rival and how great person he was. Michael Schumacher simply is Michael Jordan of Formula 1. Absolutely. Both are mentally same. No fear no nothing. I hope you get well Michael! We wish you a speedy recovery! We love you! And thanks to Schumacher family for this beautiful documentary.",False
17,7,Right down to the nuts and bolts.,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Schumacher. Everyone knows the name. Whether you're into motorsport or not. The trick here in this new documentary is what all documentaries strive for, to be more than the headline, to dig deeper into the story. Motor-racing and F1 is the vehicle if you'll pardon the pun, but this is very much a human story. Now I'd consider myself a motorsport fan, but only of more recent years. I never followed Formula 1 while Michael Schumacher was in his prime. We get the likes of James Allen, Eddie Jordon, Sebastien Vettel, Damon Hill, David Coulthard, Eddie Irvine, Mika Häkkinen, Jean Todt, Ross Brawn, Mark Webber, the family Rolf, Ralf, Corinna, Gina and Mick, Michael himself... and Bernie Ecclestone, I guess inevitably. All telling the story of the wonder kid who burst unexpectedly into the worlds most famous race series. Struggling with the fame. Going head to head with hero's and getting his elbows out. It's not as well crafted as Senna, that tells Ayrton's story beautifully through archive footage. There's is a lot of archive though, it covers the lions share of the heavy lifting, but there are new interviews too, largely with the family. The archive delves deeply into the early history. Family filmed footage of karting. The Senna rivalry and the crash that took his life. The Senna crash when you see it, doesn't look too bad. I mean it's still bad, but certainly by modern standards, the driver is getting out. Senna didn't though. Stretchered off to hospital in a coma. This isn't Senna's story, but Schumacher went on to win that race and clearly is shaken by events. Maybe the only time he ever was. He's a steely guy. Schumacher's current condition isn't addressed much, but in the telling of the Senna aftermath, his wife Corinna talks about his mental strength. The ability to block things out and focus. ""He shows me this every day"". It's the clearest indication the Schumacher is a fighter still fighting, but after that skiing accident, he's now ""Different"". It's an interesting story. Undoubtably one of the best drivers in motorsport history. Also undoubtably absolutely ruthless, determined or dirty some would say. Me included, it's undeniable. He's a great driver, but there's to many incidents that clearly illustrate he was a hot head. It's to it's credit that the film, heavily endorsed by the family doesn't pull these punches. Focusing as much on this as his part in rebuilding Ferrari. Race footage. Dramatic music. The dominance he achieved, it's all here, but there's so much more for fans of F1 or just captivating human ambition.",False
18,8,"Not a complete bio, but a strong emotional trip",dim_zax,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt almost two hours long one should think that this documentary would be a complete Michael Schumacher biography. And that would be far from the truth. The film seems to dwell on some topics while not even mentioning others.* Michael's younger years, a not so very well known time of his life, was a very welcome starting chapter. Really well made with a lot of unseen until now footage.* His Benetton years and the 1994 tribulations were not covered enough. For example there wasn't even a mention on Schumacher being disqualified by a number of races, for the championship to go to the wire. A very significant ""detail"" in order to understand his mindset for the Hill collision.* The Ferrari years monopolized the middle part of the documentary, and rightly so, but the level of details provided was not enough to really understand just how tough things got for him. The events after he broke his leg in 1999, again very significant, weren't even mentioned.I think the best part of the film were the inputs from his family and especially those from his wife Corinna. The focus on his personality not only on track, when he got into his super strict and professional persona, but also off the track away from the lights where he was more relaxed and emotional, in my opinion those were the highlights of the film and, thankfully, there were a lot.My rating will be a solid 8/10 and i strongly recommend for everyone to watch the film but not take it as a Michael Schumacher complete bio, but rather as an emotional trip on a legends life.",True
19,6,Not much we didn't know already.,daylewatson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping for a bit more than what we got, it doesn't really tell you much about him that we didn't already know, apart from clips of his family speaking if you've watched F1 since he came to the scene then there's really not a lot of new things we didn't already know.Certainly a little disappointing in my opinion.",False
20,10,An emotional rollercoaster.,florianacar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Michael was the hero of my childhood. He got me into F1 and growing up, my room was plastered with posters of him and my wardrobe full of Ferrari basecaps. Some of my fondest childhood memories were watching him race on sundays together with my family.I do like the approach of this documentary focusing on him as a person. Of course, some of the greatest racing moments are missing such as his comeback in '99, the battle with Hakkinen in Spa or his last pole in Monaco, but I'd argue that most of the people that have followed his career do already know them and those who don't will find them within seconds of looking up any compilation on Youtube.Then there is the last chapter of this documentary that left me devastated. I was so occupied with remembering all the great and controversial moments of his career that I almost forgot this chapter. His accident was and still is tragic for me but seeing his family carrying the burden of losing the loving husband and father that he was, was something different and I had to pause a few times to compose myself.There isn't a lot that I'd rather wish than him being able to fully recover. It's one of my biggest dreams that one day, there'll be a moment when we're going to see him and his family happy and healthy together.I hope this becomes reality.",False

22,9,Tribute to legend,darshanr23,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to experience schumacher evolution from promising upstart to unbeatable winning machine from a more human perspective, go watch right now. Mind you that it's not perfect there are few shortcomings but you will not be disappointed.",False
23,5,Underwhelming performance,AdrenalinDragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A bit of a meh Documentary about Michael Schumacher. Most of the runtime is just people saying how great he was at racing, which we already knew from the start. Even his prime years of racing are skimmed through fairly quickly, and you don't find out much about him outside his racing career. I wanted to learn more what Schumacher was like outside his career, but it's mostly archive footage and interviews about how awesome he was as a racer. Very little is covered about the issues and conflicts he had, and it felt kind of artificial and sanitised in many places.5/10.",False
24,8,I'm starting to equate Netflix with great documentaries! [+76%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wonderfully inspiring sports documentary that focuses on the racing legend's iconic rise, Schumacher is a shining example of the good stuff that Netflix is capable of producing. The documentary really humanizes the larger-than-life Schumacher - as a friend, a colleague, a family member, and an excellent racecar driver - all perspectives well-rooted and covered in equal measure. Even his competent peers only had the greatest things to say about him. The makers thankfully do not relegate it to a sheer puff-piece by also showcasing Schumacher's vulnerabilities and struggles before he became 7-time World Champion. It also doesn't resort to excessive melodrama and focuses less on the accident that rendered him catatonic. Private matters stay strictly private. It's a competently made tribute piece that mires millennials in beautiful nostalgia.Is 1h 52m enough to cover Schumacher's life? Not at all. Is it still worth a watch? Definitely.",False
25,10,Two Faces/Phases,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Michael Schumacher - how well do you know him? Well if you say you don't really know him - the movie will change that. First things first though: if you are looking or expecting this to be focused on his current status ... well you will be dissapointed. This is a documentary about the man, the human and the sportsman ... his way to the top and his retirement/personal life.Schumacher is one of those icons in Germany - but he also transcended that. He became an icon in the motorsport world. He made a lot of Italian (especially the Ferrari loving ones) happy. There is another documentary, that has a broader focus and has some of his rivals in it - though that documentary is about the motorworld in general, it can be a great companion piece to this.I still have not seen the Senna documentary and I'll be the first to admit, I do not have a lot of knowledge when it comes to cars. Or the racing circuit for that matter. But this was more than that and it really dives into the many facets of Schumacher. Who he was when he raced and who he was as a private person. I like his private persona even more than the racing one. Although of course he became famous for the racing and his ultimate will to win ... his drive if you forgive the pun.Really well made, let's everyone talk who knew Michael ... and while it has little to say about his current status ... I did not expect this to be that kind of movie/documentary anyway ...",False

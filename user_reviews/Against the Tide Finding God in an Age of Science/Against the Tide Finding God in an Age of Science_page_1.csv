1,10,A Fascinating Documentary,njamesnc,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well done and thoughtful film delving into the mind of the intelligent and honorable Dr. John Lenox, narrated and interviewed by the bright and vigilant Kevin Sorbo. Designed to reassure faith in a time when the worldview of Christianity is marginalized with extreme prejudice, it delivers on its promise with heart, style, and intellect. And hopefully, to a nonbeliever, it's message is a thought provoking as it is intellectually and morally intact.",False

3,10,Incredible and thoughtful journey,echobabies,n/a,16/08/2025,"This has exceeded my expectations. It is filmed on location in Oxford and Cambridge and shows you the pub where CS LEWIS and RR TOLKIEN often sat down for years. Then they fly out to the Holy Land to visit numerous land marks from the life of Jesus and his tomb.In between Kevin sorbo does an excellent job of being our host and guide to navigate the world of the amazing John Lennox.Peppered throughout the film is quotes and clips from famous atheists such as Richard Dawkins and Peter singer, Christopher Hitchens and many moreWhether you are a believer or atheist or doubter, you need to watch this film.",False
4,10,Engaging exploration of science and faith,isaackimmd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Both Sorbo and Lennox shine in this thoughtful and well-done documentary.Sorbo provides an authentic and natural dialogue as he pursues a better understanding of scientific objections to Christianity. His voiceovers and series of questions were logical and well-paced for this format. The cinematography was respectful, beautiful and enhanced the subject matter at hand.Despite some familiarity I had with Lennox, this documentary brought out some of his finest: first, selected core arguments from his public debates with various famous atheists, and second, his well-reasoned faith and trust in Jesus of Nazareth through Biblical accounts. In addition, elements of his childhood, his engagements with CS Lewis, and his years of apologetics work in Eastern Europe are also shown. Somehow his unflappably winsome British (or Irish) warmth seems to make this a deeply gratifying and edifying film to watch.For anyone thinking about science and Christianity, this is an excellent documentary for starters - an overview. (Their website has a guide for discussion.)",False

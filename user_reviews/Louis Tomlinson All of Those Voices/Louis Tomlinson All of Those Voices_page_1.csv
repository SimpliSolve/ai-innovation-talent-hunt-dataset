1,10,amazing documentary; gay as hell,Markjom33,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary shows Louis' journey in becoming the person we know as today, the sweetheart of Doncaster. He is very in depth and honest with what he showcases. He goes into detail explaining his struggles as an artist but as a grieving son and brother as well. Louis is a very sensitive and emotional guy, and I admire that. It is refreshing seeing a man being confident in his self but his emotions as well. He is unknowingly breaking such a deep rooted societal norm and he's doing it in a way that is real and raw. I'd also like to point out how gay his shows are. I know this doesn't have anything to do with what I said before but it's beautiful seeing how happy and safe his fans are with him. There wasn't a scene without a pride flag being visible, good for him üëç",False
2,10,You will want to watch it again and again,notenough1,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's both moving and inspiring to see a musician devastated by the end of a chapter of his career and heartbroken by personal loss rise above his self doubt and create a symbiotic relationship with his audience. I wanted to watch the documentary again immediately after, to feel the energy and be inspired again. The insight into his relationship with his kid is heartwarming and the synergy between him and his band is amazing. It was also great to see family members sharing their perspectives. It doesn't seem that fame or success have had any impact on his character. What an amazing artist and person Louis Tomlinson is!! He deserves all the recognition!",False
3,10,"I'm Talking Academy Awards! Emmys, BAFTAS",dianascarlettaprilmason,n/a,15/08/2025,"Have you ever seen Forrest Gump? Better than that. Have you seen the Hangover? Funnier than that! Have you seen the Titanic? Sadder than that.In all realness, Louis is super underrated and I'm really happy he got to share his story in such a large scale. I think he is probably the most unseen member of one direction but has been my favorite since the beginning so after watching the film I'm glad I have been able to follow him and listen to his music all these years. He is truly talented and no one really knows. This film was beautiful and gut wrenching and I'm so happy I'm a Louis Tomlinson fan.",False
4,10,Heartfelt emotional roller coaster,iamtheuniverse-12678,n/a,15/08/2025,"The man in the moment , path he took , choices he made, people he lost and grief he processed. Heart warming , gut wrenching documentary that travels through real life emotions. Inspite of having a difficult journey than most of his counterparts, Louis is neither whining nor preaching. He does not say justify why he did something, or dwell on the negatives. Most celebrities dont understand what it means to not have money, or grind 14 hours every day to just put a meal on the plate, but Louis acknowledges this. This is what makes Louis' documentary very unique and special. We watch Louis as a boy from small town with lot of curiosity and questions. We understand that life hasnt always been fair to him, but he eludes positivity in every situation. The best thing in this documentary is that we have always known Louis to articulate his answers better, but here we feel it in our bones. His relationship with family , friends and fans are phenomenal. The scenarios that he passes through, absorbs and how he reacts to them, makes him very relatable. We dont see the journey as a celebrity, but as a teenager who questioned a lot of his abilities and contribution in the band. We see him in his insecurities, sadness and hope. We celebrate him in his achievements and self-content The friendship with his team and band members shows him as a person of loyalty and down to earth. One of the best celebrity documentaries that shows all facets of life - of a boy we loved, the man we admire. Even if you just know 5% of his life, grab those comforting napkins and run to the cinemas!",False

6,10,You used to read me like a Headlineüéµ,princessniki-32708,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amazing, amazing film. To know this has been in the making for a few years now. Captures the lows and highs of Louis' life. Charlie did a great job at the cinematography. Seeing Louis grow from when One Direction went on Hiatus, to his journey as an individual artist. Louis' relationship with his band, his fans, his family is explored in the film. Really felt the energy from the live shows and what it meant to Louis. The songs from Faith in the Future acted as the perfect Background score for the movie. I have a feeling I'm going to watch it over and over again. Hoping it's made available to stream soon!!",False
7,10,beautiful and inspiring,vaishp-23109,n/a,15/08/2025,This movie is the most honest and raw work of art ever created by louis. Everything about this was screaming sincerity and vulnerability and everyone could not just understand but also feel every word he said.

8,10,best thing i've ever watched,samrichiesr,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was such an emotional rollercoaster but i had the best time ever!! You get to see loads of behind the scenes and louis tomlinson's emotional journey. Even if you are not particularly the biggest louis tomlinson fan ever, it still gives you more of an insight to the musical journey that many artists have. You get to see both the good and bad sides of celebrities lives in general and it was honestly quite eye-opening. I was honestly so focused on the screen the entire time. If you do end up watching it, i hope you having an amazing time. It's so lovely to have the entire cinema laughing along and crying with you. I hope you all enjoy!!",False

10,10,"Always vulnerable, especially with fans",gobebago,n/a,15/08/2025,"The vulnerability Louis displays is nothing new and positively beautiful. He's always been vulnerable, through his lyrics, his interactions with fans, and the choices he makes, and seeing him vulnerable in this film just shows that since day 1, he has been the authentic, down to earth, talented artist that is vastly underrated and deserves so much more. Absolutely loved this insight into his life, and seeing how his touring band feels in regards to their relationship with him is positively heartwarming. He might be famous, but he's real.He is just a good guy. He needs us and we need him. Simple as that.",False
11,10,Most genuine artist documentary,aryaaakaya,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was the most emotional, sincere and moving artist documentary I've ever seen. Started crying from the first minute and I felt so connected to Louis. His journey as an artist but also as an individual were so heartbreaking but full of hope. He definitely deserves where he is right after all of that hard work. The connection between him and his fans are so easily visible. I've never seen an artist talk about their fans the way that he does. Even if you're not a fan of his I suggest you to watch it. It's a beautiful emotional rollercoaster. As he beautifully put it, ""I need you and you need me"".",False
12,10,Best documentary ever,anagdacostaa,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was the best documentary of an artist I have ever seen, it wasn't just about his career and what he did backstage like many documentaries are, it expressed who he really was, his insecurities, his highs and lows, his fears, his joys and all the hard work that led to where he is now, all the hard work he did to be proud of what he did and deserving of all his success, everyone should see this documentary to get to know the real Louis, so genuine, kind, spontaneous and charismatic. I have a lot of admiration for Louis both personally and artistically. Thank you Louis. We are so proud of you, we love you so so much.",False
13,10,Outstanding!,gzqdt,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was basically a love letter to all us louies and i never felt more appreciated. I cried and laughed and cried again the whole time, like liam said, watching louis' life trough his eyes was such an overwhelming heart wrenching experience! I'm so glad he showed us this side of himself, and i just love this man even more. I'm so excited so watch his show in October and follow his journey. I never knew how hard this was for him, how everything just went down again and again and again. He felt so out of luck, it was heartbreaking to watch. I'm so happy we showed him love constantly day after day, so he realised his worth in the end. I will defend this man with my life til' i die, i swear to god. He's just to precious for the world.",False
14,10,Honest! Heartwarming! And Story of Resilience,ojaswi-39095,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie beautifully captures Louis' journey from a small town boy from Doncaster to fame of one direction to sudden and ongoing hiatus, the occurrence of devastating events in his personal life losing confidence in himself to gradually rediscovering his passion for music to an ongoing process of growing as an individual and as a solo artist finding his music. And the most mesmerising of all: the connection, the relationship he shares with his fans and how we uplift each other almost like a bond for life. Everything was worth watching while drinking the potion of emotions. A Must watch unapologetic, honest and heart pouring louis's Voice.!!",False
15,10,It was a masterpiece & I'm beyond proud!,ynehir,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst time doing a Rezension bc I couldn't help myself, this documentary deserves all the praise and acknowledgmentüôèüèºI'm gonna be honest it took me a couple of hours to be able to write this after watching Louis Tomlinson's documentary bc I needed it all to set in.First of all, I am blown away by his bravery to open up, for being vulnerable and allowing the audience to have an insight of his feelings & thoughts. That isn't the easiest thing to do and it must be harder and so much more frightening for him since he is in public eye, comes from a world wide Band called One Direction and everyone think they have something to say about him. So shout out to you Louis and thank you for being an inspiration!Watching the ""All Of Those Voices"" documentary of Louis was really cathartic! I cried & laughed a lot, I reminiscent old memories/ moments, I was able to reflect my own life and the struggles I went through & I got goosebumps all over my body and I was so in awe with Louis. He has been through a lot in life and his journey was definitely a rocky road but he managed to stay focused, fight his way through and I honestly never thought it was possible to be so in love & proud with an artist but he baffled me with his strength, his dedication, his bravery, his passion, his talent and his vulnerability. We got a lot of insights of how he was treated, how he felt, what he thought and was affected him so much that it took him a while to fight through it to become the artist he is today. Seeing his journey how he fought to own his place and voice, to fulfil his dreams is truly inspiring! It fills you with hope and strength to do it yourself. Seeing him giving other musicians chances to be seen or heard, being so down to earth and treating everyone on the same level without any ego is just admiring. I left the cinema with teary eyes and a huge smile on my face bc I know that this is only the beginning of something great, of something bigger for an artist that deserves to be acknowledged, respected and loved and I don't think that anything can hold him back or drag him down anymore. Him saying that he finally felt worthy just after finishing an highly successful world tour even tho he is credited for writing the most songs for One Direction or breaking a World Record with his Livestream during lockdown etc broke my heart but at the same time filled it with so much warmth and happiness bc now he finally seems to know what he means to his fans, what he is capable of and that there is nothing he can't do if he just wants to. His connection to his fans and the way he always includes them is so beautiful. Giving them a chance to speak up on his documentary, hearing him and his team talking about the fans etc shows you how much he cares for them and how much they means to them. Louis and his Fans are a unit, a team and you could even feel the love and support through the screens. I just know for sure, that his fans will be always by his side and support him all the way. And the way he treats his family, his fans, his team and everyone he works with says a lot about Louis as a person.Also a big shout out to Charlie for this masterpiece. The way he captured all these beautiful moments and put them all together in a heartwarming way was honestly amazing. The cuts, the audio, the things they focused on literally let you dive in into Louis world and explore so may emotions. You can't help it but being captivated and blown away.THIS DOCUMENTARY IS RAW, HONEST, CINEMATICALLY AMAZING!I will definitely go watch it again and would definitely recommend it to everyone!All the love, SK.",True
16,10,"Incredible, inspiring, entertaining",sarahcarlson-63285,n/a,15/08/2025,All around amazing. To see Louis change his viewpoint of himself from the beginning to the end was amazing to see. He's truly one of the most inspirational people and to see his growth throughout so much hardship leaves viewers with so many emotions. This was perfectly done. It told the story in a way that didn't fixate too much on the highly emotional aspects but made sure to include those aspects into the story as they are important. The tour footage was so high energy and incredible to see the backstage footage. Left me feeling inspired and in awe. I've always identified with Louis for multiple reasons and this film just set that into stone. Truly a must see.,False
17,10,Such respect for Louis,jmetz-07377,n/a,15/08/2025,I laughed and cried during the film. Louis seems like such a genuinely good and down to earth person and he deserved better during One Direction. It's amazing to see his success and happiness after so much tragedy in his life. His relationship with his son is beautiful. I saw this with my husband. We are in our forties and fully expected to be the oldest in the theater but we weren't. Louis has successfully created a fan base of all ages. Despite my husband not knowing much about Louis or his music he also enjoyed the film very much. I will likely watch it again if it comes to a streaming service.,False
18,10,Inspiring and powerful,twoghostsdancinginaroom,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary shows raw emotion and struggles, but most of all it portrays hope. It brings a wonderful story about fighting through, feeling like the world is coming for you but then being able to rely on your surroundings and coming out of it stronger. My respect for Louis as a person and as a singer songwriter/ performer has immensely grown. The visuals and music were beautiful, the story gorgeous. You get a laugh and a cry out of it. I watched it in the theatre, and everyone felt so connected, tears collectively slipping off our cheeks while sniffling one moment and the laughter rumbling off our chests the next. This was such a unique experience. I will watch this emotional masterpiece again as soon as it's available for streaming. It's incredibly inspiring, I'm in awe of this man.",False
19,10,absolutely must watch,baumeerin,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a beautifully filmed and carefully crafted deeper look into Louis and his journey as an artist. The vulnerability and rawness that was conveyed through this film shows so much about Louis as a person, about what he has had to overcome and what he has worked toward. The world is so lucky to have someone as wonderful as Louis Tomlinson and this film is only a small window into his beautiful soul. I can't put into words just how proud I am of Lou. To be his fan means the world to me, and he never fails to make us feel safe, loved, and special just the way we are. Such a beautiful movie about such a beautiful person.",False
20,10,"Beautiful, inspiring and nostalgic",koraymavaldez,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary is beautiful, the way it is narrated and produced makes you enter the moment, I cried like three times, I could not help it, some parts of the documentary are very sad, it feels very deep, I loved the way Louis opened up with us, I loved every line, I came out of there with an apprenticeship, grateful for life, with faith in the future and especially admiring Louis Tomlinson more, I am very proud of him. At all times I could feel a pure energy, I could fully empathize with him, I could understand the world from his eyes, for everything he fought, he deserves all the good in the world.",False
21,10,Absolutely Amazing!,fifimojo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Louis really opens up and tells his story from a view we've never seen before. So raw and emotional, I'm speechless honestly. I thought I knew a lot, but obviously there's always still so much you can learn about a person. Especially one in an industry such as this. You tend to only see one side of things, the side the cameras show you. This takes things not only behind the camera per-say, but very much into the most meaningful and deep parts of his life. I am so glad he decided to share this with us and as a fan, I'm so proud of everything he's accomplished. I'll always, always be a fan! A must watch for sure!!",False
22,10,The greatest movie of all time,ayarliza,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's the best movie I've ever seen, I managed to see certain points of view of Lou that I never imagined I could meet, I cried, laughed, smiled and even got angry because he didn't play concerts in Mexico but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's the best documentary that exists, in the part of 1D and his family, it Example to follow, he is too strong and brave, that part in which he mentions that he was not heard in the first 1D singles, that whatever he does he would never have control, it makes me think that being a soloist, he improved too much in the aspect of control. The documentary only makes me think that he deserves to be here where he is and deserves to go even All this that he is achieving and that he is about to achieve and will achieve many more things, not thanks to us, but thanks to himself, his talent, his courage and his willingness to know what to do and how he wants to do it so that the world in general pleases him as long as he likes it <3Lou is a person who knows very well how to decide, that leads me to 1d again, he no longer has to ask a producer to make his voice appear in the single, he no longer has to write so many songs to make him feel important, they do not decide for him or tell him what to do in the musical aspect, he now knows very well how to decide and howThere are really no words to describe how proud and happy I feel about Lou, that he himself has realized those great leaps of faith, all the more so I understand why his album is called Faith In The Future, he always had it clear <3I really love Louis too much and words and time will never be enough to tell him everything I want to tell him <3.",True
23,10,big recommendation,beckernina-22406,n/a,15/08/2025,"An beautiful, interesting and vulnerable insight into louis' life and career - a chance to get a glimpse what's going on behind the scenes. Emotional & heartbreaking scenes, followed by laughter & impressive scenes - a great mixture!Insights into his childhood, his private life, the beginnings of his career up to where he is right now. Louis talks about being a father, his hardships in life, his self-doubt and how he found and kept being himself afterall.

24,10,BRAVE. STRONG. LITERAL SUN.,arunadlarry,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't think words will ever be enough to describe what I felt during the movie. It was a rollercoaster of happiness,anger and sadness But in the end it filled us all with warmth and safeness. All throughout the movie there were times I thought ""God what i would do to protect this angel of a man. I would literally take all bullets for Lou and shield louis from all the bad parts of life"". Ultimately louis taught us that there's hope and goodness even in the most hardest parts of life and gave us strength to face the real world and rise even when the whole world's waiting for you to loose. In conclusion louis deserves the entire universe and beyond.",False
25,10,Louis Tomlinson All Of Those Voices,liyajoosu,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seeing his raw emotions and voice regarding everything that's happened in this fandom but in his side is an emotional thing to watch. He was talking about his voice but if he only knew how he sounded in our ears and eyes. He felt he wasn't enough but he was and is always enough. We love him. Proud of you Louis üíô
From the unseen footage of one direction to the seen and even the home footage. Wow. I'm always mesmerized by this man and even seeing how his band talks about him like family. I love how this is going. Keep going üíô

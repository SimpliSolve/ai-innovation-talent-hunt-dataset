1,5,PI. Moms had potential to be more exciting,ZoeJordanN,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI truly enjoy the Trainwreck documentaries almost always immediately watch it as it comes out.I felt that this particular documentary didn't grab my attention as much as the other ones. I enjoyed the story, and did not expect the twists and turns of it, which was great.However, I didn't really feel connected to the moms, I feel like their back stories or even explanation of who they were back then or are now, were very brief.Additionally, the pace of the documentary was to fast and brief, which in turn you could say would keep your attention. But it lacked in substance.So it was hard to connect with them as the main characters. I felt that the watcher was being told more about Carl and the type of person his is, than the moms.I do understand that the moms are probably more private and appreciate Ami finally getting to share a personal trauma with the world. But, something lacked in this documentary where, unfortunately the PI moms weren't the focus of it..coincidentally like the actual attempted PI moms production..Yes, the story is factual and we can't change that Carl sabotaged the show and the spotlight of the women. But Trainwreck really kept this one short and brief, which ultimately lead to a lack of interest in watching.",True
2,1,Absolute manure,kevinbutlereire,n/a,15/08/2025,"A bunch of fame seeking troglodytes. People in this show are what's wrong with this world. What a pile of utter rubbish. All these so called PI moms looking for a missing girl to ""save the show"" without giving a hoot about the wellbeing of the girl they looked for just sums up the absolutely horrible and vile human beings they are. The whole show is a few idiots screwing each other over and trying to make a quick buck out of other people's misery.I did really enjoy all of the other train wrecks but this just demonstrated that the producers were clutching at straws by taking this on. The storyline and the characters are horrendous.",False
3,3,Probably the worst of the trainwreck series,stephaniequarmby,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honestly just not interesting. Found my attention wandering and it did nothing to keep me engaged. Just a story about a drug bust and not up to the usual standard of the trainwreck series. There has been a lot of failed reality tv shows so I'm not sure why this was targeted to make a show out of.Don't waste your time. I hope they either stop making trainwreck shows, or go back to the drawing board because the originals (Woodstock etc) were just a completely different class to this. It seems the producers are just making shows for the hell of it now. We're staring down the barrel of 'Trainwreck: Trainwreck'",False
4,2,Pass on this one,ericglaas-73714,n/a,15/08/2025,"Overall, I like the ""Trainwreck"" concept. The Woodstock 99 episode was particularly enlightening, as I remember when it happened. The show served to add dimensions to a complex story and the personalities involved.PI Moms is a different animal entirely. While I'm not a fan of reality TV generally, I do think they could've made PI Moms a bit more engaging. There's an inherent contradiction between the actual messy work of crime-solving and the contrived antics of reality stars, something which the show could've explored. How did the PIs plan to reconcile their stated goals with the results of a successful show, namely that they'd lose their privacy and ability to do actual investigations? Doesn't a successful PI have to have a certain amount of anonymity?This guy Carl comes off as an opportunist, but frankly, everyone in this show does, so it's not really a critique. Moreover, if caught up inadvertently in drug dealing, most rational people would cooperate with the police as he did.As a show, PI Moms is very disjointed and misses the opportunity to tell a compelling story. Netflix will want to step it up for the Trainwreck series to continue.",False
5,1,Blame Game,TerriS-99,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt seems everyone wanted to blame Carl for the failure of their Reality TV show, P. I. Moms. They showed they were too happy to drag someone else's reputation through the mud in order to make themselves look better. I think they failed in this and just made themselves look bad. The producer and the moms seemed to want a show no matter what. We only have the director/producer's (?) word that Carl approached him about being the star. Him and the women came across as vindictive and tried to keep Carl from reporting the illegal activity. The police who were conducting the investigation on the drug theft and a corrupt cop even said the recordings they had showed the show and the women didn't care about anything except the show. They'd overlook a cop stealing confiscated drugs, so their boss could sell it just so the show would be produced and they'd be ""famous and rich"". It seems to me the only person with any morals and ethics was Carl, the local reporter, and the cops who investigated to crime. The rest of them came off as morally corrupt and money hungry.I'm sorry one of the women suffered from trauma in her life, but that doesn't excuse her acting this way. Even though she knows how it feels to live through trauma, she had no problem trying to use a missing child to try and save the show. They all should be ashamed. They were even mad that Carl found the child and took away their chance for the fanfare of returning the child. I've lived through a lot of trauma and I'm happy Carl saved the child from being exploited by these people. This review is my take of the situation after watching Trainwreck. You may have a different one. I'm disappointed in it because it wasn't up to the quality of the other episodes. As I said, tt was just a bunch of whining, blaming, and them being clueless about their actions being wrong.",True
6,1,"Netflix, this was unforgivably bad.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"We didn't want to do reality TV, but....This was painful; honestly, this is one of the most awful things I've seen in quite a while. I watched it out of curiosity. I'll put it out there that I detest reality TV, especially bilge like the Kardashians.All I saw in sorry was egotists, one after the other, the kind of people that talk at you and have only their own selfish interests at heart. Am I just a grumpy old Brit? Would anyone genuinely want to watch a show called PI Moms? I should imagine that trying to tickle the belly of an oceanic whitetip would be a more pleasurable experience.Undercover Carl? Was he quite as bashful and dumb as he made out to be? I think he seemed to be the smartest one of the lot. Regarding the missing girl, nobody was interested in her; they were more concerned about their careers and the fact that Carl, who had actually made something of a career for himself, found her. Come on, what the actual?1/10.",False
7,9,People are Confused,chopperDavo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was surprised at the lowly rated reviews. I enjoyed this, I thought it was super entertaining.People seem to rate/review the people in the show and what they did. They don't seem to be able to separate fact from fiction and review the show - in this case Trainwreck:PI Moms.Yes they're all pretty shallow. The whole PI Moms project is just tabloid tv. They even said they were going to solve real cases, then set about drumming up new and more interesting ones. So the producers were pretty dodgy in my opinion.But the way all that was shown, the opportunism of Carl, the corruption of Butler and whatnot was done pretty well. I thought Netflix did OK on this, and, as I said, I found it entertaining.In countries outside of the US, we say ""Only in America"". Because people in the US do seem to be nuts a lot of the time.And this programme showed that really well.",False
8,1,"Shame on you Netflix, this was utter trash.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"We didn't want to do reality TV, but....This was painful; honestly, this is one of the most awful things I've seen in quite a while.

9,1,So boring,praneeth7777,n/a,15/08/2025,"Most useless one in the trainwreck series. Just a bunch of moms getting upset for not becoming popular. Why do they want to be popular on a tv show if they are so passionate about investigation.Boring as hell. I wonder how boring that tv series was originally ðŸ˜‚
Trainwreck series should focus on producing interesting stories and not useless story like this.",False
10,1,"Empowering, Inspiring, blah blah blah",fdsafdsafd,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Trainwreck: P. I. Moms"" arrives on the scene with a title that promises chaos and delivers... well, mostly just a mess. What could have been a genuinely entertaining or even insightful look into amateur sleuthing by suburban parents quickly devolves into a parade of reality TV clichÃ©s, leaving viewers less amused and more bewildered.The fundamental premise, while quirky, is stretched thin to the point of transparency. The ""investigations"" often feel contrived, lacking any real stakes or genuine mystery. It's as if the producers handed the ""moms"" a list of pre-determined scenarios, then filmed their awkward attempts to ""solve"" them. The result is a series of forced encounters and manufactured drama that fails to convince even the most forgiving viewer. The ""P. I."" aspect is largely superficial, with little to no actual detective work shown. Instead, we get a lot of gossiping, ill-advised stakeouts, and ""aha!"" moments that feel utterly unearned.Character development is, predictably, sacrificed at the altar of caricature. Each ""mom"" is reduced to a single, exaggerated personality trait - the overbearing one, the ditzy one, the perpetually exasperated one. This makes it impossible to connect with any of them on a meaningful level, and their interactions often feel less like genuine relationships and more like actors performing for the camera. The ""trainwreck"" element, rather than being an organic byproduct of their amateur efforts, feels like a deliberate, heavy-handed attempt to generate conflict and low-stakes drama, often at the expense of any potential humor or authenticity.Furthermore, the production values are exactly what you'd expect from a show leaning heavily into its ""trainwreck"" moniker. The editing is choppy, the music is generic, and the overall aesthetic screams ""budget reality TV."" While this might be an intentional choice to lean into the ""amateur"" feel, it ultimately contributes to the sense that the show isn't taking itself, or its audience, seriously.In the end, ""Trainwreck: P. I. Moms"" is a show that lives up to only half of its title - the ""trainwreck"" part. It's a frustrating watch that squanders a potentially fun premise on tired tropes and a lack of genuine substance. If you're looking for compelling mysteries or relatable characters, you'd be better off looking elsewhere.",False
11,1,"By far, the worst trainwreck",jppesantesbriz,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm a big fan of documentaries, but to say this one was disappointing it's too short on adjectives. Even though it's a ""fast-paced"" documentary, it felt eternal because there was no good story in it. It lacks on substance, on good personalities and even on decent edition.The worst episode of the trainwreck series and probably one of the worst documentaries ever.",False
12,2,The trainwreck episode is a trainwreck,marshalljaykaplan-469-186131,n/a,15/08/2025,"They seemed to have really tried to stretch a story that is not a trainwreck into something....that is not a trainwreck. Too much effort using real people in re-creation scenes about a story that is soooo boring. There is no real arc nor explanation as to what the actual trainwreck is and when the story is explained, completely disjointed.",False
13,1,Why was this made? It's so boring.,heatherworkmanrios,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBy far the worst of this ""Train Wreck"" series.I can't imagine who would find this interesting, except for maybe the people involved and some random TV show producers?But for the average person, it's not relatable, shocking or funny in any way.I'd rather hear an old drunk man at a bar telling nonsensical stories.Summary:
Dude sells some drugs and ruins the production of a reality tv show. People who were going to be on the show are sad. No trains were harmed or otherwise wrecked.",True
14,1,"Reality TV, Not Real Disaster",Scotslad_007,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show has no business being labeled as part of the Trainwreck documentary series. Unlike the original Trainwreck entries-which exposed large-scale disasters with serious cultural and human consequences-this installment plays more like a petty reality TV episode.Where past Trainwreck episodes focused on genuine disasters-like the cruise episode that spiraled out of control or the infamous birthday party in Norway that turned chaotic-PI Moms is a low-stakes, internally sabotaged vanity project. It fixates on a couple of individuals in a failed reality show who ultimately ruin their own opportunity to have one. The ""conflict"" is superficial, the drama forced, and the overall story feels like a drawn-out complaint about not getting a TV deal.If you're expecting another intense, sobering dive into a real-world implosion, this isn't it. There's no real trainwreck here-just a fender bender dressed up in Netflix packaging.",False
15,3,Trainwreck: Diminishing Returns.,FONYMAHONEY,n/a,15/08/2025,"Their Woodstock series was pretty great - as a Brit barely into adolescence when Woodstock '99 happened, I found it fascinating, intelligently done and powerfully objective. When I saw they were spinning off into a series, I was eager and hungry for more - finally, a production banner for magazine-documentaries with some real quality behind it. Something to look forward to.Man, how wrong I was.Astroworld was decent, for the same reasons as above really - it's a story I didn't know. Not as gripping or as detailed as ...Woodstock '99, but still interesting and entertaining. The Toronto mayor one wasn't anywhere near detailed enough - still a great story but given the tragic end he met, frustratingly superficial.Since then, they've ALL been trash - entertaining, but absolute trash. A real departure from the brutal brilliance of their debut - and I didn't think they could get more cloying and heavy-handed than the balloon boy episode. Then they dropped PI moms.What a load of garbage. It felt more like a propaganda piece than a documentary, like who is this for?! It wasn't remotely an interesting enough story - shock horror! Fame-hungry actor treads on others to get ahead! Not worthy of an episode of Dateline, let alone a Netflix documentary.Don't waste your time.",False
16,3,Leave Carl alone,derekmcauley,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show is absolute blasphemy.Joe Kenda is a god in his own right, and it's painful to watch him be dragged down by these fame-hungry women who clearly just want attention.They should leave him alone.Why must good men constantly suffer in this world?

17,2,Self-serving bull$&@!,Adams0509,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have enjoyed the train wreck series until balloon boy and this P. I. Moms episode. I don't know if everyone interviewed has seen how the episode turned out, but if they have, they should be embarrassed. They all seem to be throwing a pity party and blaming the wrong person (Carl) for their sought after fame not coming into fruition in stead of Chris; everything they say seems extremely self-serving. I couldn't believe that they all said they were pissed when they found out that Carl not only found the girl but knew where she was but didn't tell them?!?! So according to y'all, he was supposed to leave a young girl in a potentially dangerous situation so you all could get your cameras in place and be the heroes?! I am disgusted by all of you! And while I have deep sympathy for the trauma that Ami experienced, to blame Carl for the show being cancelled and now she can't share that trauma on national television seems misplaced; there are many ways that she can share her story and be an inspiration to others without ""reality"" television. They need to get over themselves.",True
18,1,A document about someone's dissapointment. Could be a phone call.,majaguara,n/a,15/08/2025,"What even is this? I don't understand. I consider myself an intelligent and well-read person - and I'm sorry if that sounds inelegant, but let me explain: I have a master's degree in economics, another in political science, and a PhD in economics. I had this show playing in the background while cleaning, like a radio, and I didn't understand a thing. Not a single thing. So I think the blame lies with the creators - the message just isn't clear.From what I could gather, it seems like some guy was faking something and the show didn't work out? And this is... a series? That these women are upset the program failed? What is this even about? Who paid for it? And why is this being served to us as content? This feels like something your neighbor would tell you in a 10-minute chat - not something that needed to be a whole production.",False

2,1,Waste of Time,BTweezy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was awful. No real footage, just stock/file
Images and videos of generic airplanes with 9-11 timeline narration voiced over. Done waste your time.",False
3,1,This documentary crashed fast,james_holst,n/a,16/08/2025,Dear god what is their piece of garbage. They can't even get the right footage on here. Showing modern technology instead of what was in the period. Please this is garbage wrapped in a ham sandwich wrapped in garbage. This is making the film Ishtar look really good. Crap crap and more crap.,False
4,3,Fire the Graphics Department!,wicj,n/a,16/08/2025,"The script and narration weren't terrible...nothing really new here though. The real failure is in the graphics. Aside from the all-too-common misuse of footage of technology of an incorrect period as well as other anachronisms, I observed stock footage of a woman wearing shorts that were way too short or not short enough, depending on your point of view and a smiley face on an illustration of the first two terrorists entering the cockpit of American 11. I spent way too much time focused on the ridiculousness of the background images that I lost the narration a few times. This production is a lesson in laziness and perhaps even apathy.",False
5,1,Sloppy Documentary. Couldn't even keep the airlines involved straight.,dogeatdog7,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sloppy Documentary. Couldn't even keep the airlines involved straight.In the first few minutes of this poorly produced documentary, the narrator states that American Airlines Flight 175 left Boston Logan airport. I had to rewind and listen again because I thought I must've heard incorrectly. It was United Airlines Flight 175 that left Logan airport, not American Airlines.As someone who's worked in television production, I'm baffled that a professional producer could make such an egregious error AND that no one caught it during post production. It's inexcusable.The rest of the film isn't any better.",False

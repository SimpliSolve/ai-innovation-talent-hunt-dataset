1,6,Red Heaven is a place on Earth,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn preparation for the first human mission to Mars, six volunteers take part in the ultimate dress rehearsal, living inside a year-long NASA simulation to understand the effects of isolation on the human mind. Red Heaven puts you right in there with them.The creative team behind this film, Lauren DeFilippo and Katherine Gorringe, were intrigued by the human side of traveling to the red planet, or as they said, ""...the intensity of living in a place that is totally inhospitable to us as a species all the while being completely isolated from everything you've ever known. We felt that was the most fascinating part, yet it was being repeatedly overlooked in the race to get to Mars.""They found the answer with the Hawai'i Space Exploration Analogue and Simulation (Hi-SEAS), where six people would enter a small dome and be isolated from the rest of the world for an entire year as if they were on Mars. This crew was filmed for the entire year and DeFilippo and Gorringe spent five years editing the film.The result is an intriguing film that presents what it really would be like and how people would be impacted by so much time cut off from the rest of the world. This is incredibly relevant in our pandemic world, right?",True

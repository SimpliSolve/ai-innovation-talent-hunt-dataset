1,9,Very touching and beautiful dive into the matter of everything.,rauhfaser-77441,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie really struck me as a beautiful trip to the borders of perception and the interconnection of everything. It evokes some of the deepest questions of our existence and leaves you contemplating them in a very blissful way. It has a hauntingly beautiful imagery and a great cast of people from various disciplines from science to philosophy and religion. Although it's a field that is still rather new to western culture, I think we all should take a deeper look into it. Also it's very refreshing that it includes studies about the link between psychedelics and consciousness in a very broad-minded way. Throughout the entire movie I had a smile on my face. I loved every aspect of it and highly recommend to see it for yourself.",False

1,10,Must watch documentary!,whiteheadmatt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tiger 24 is a riveting, thought provoking, emotional and relevant documentary exploring the intersection of man and wild animal. My heart was torn between the loss of human life and Tiger #24 having his freedom taken away for no fault of his own. You should watch this film not only because it's beautifully shot and edited, but because we need to understand how government policy is threatening human life and our worlds most beautiful and endangered animals.",False
2,9,Layered Story - Great Looking Tigers - Great Messaging - Gripping,sienna_corcoran,n/a,16/08/2025,Extraordinary documentary that is riveting from start to finish. Shows the ground reality of tiger conservation in India. The story centers around a massive male tiger called TIGER 24 / T24 / Ustad and his alleged killings on humans in and around Ranthambhore tiger reserve. His story has a lot of nuance and layers and the film reflects this in a gripping manner.The footage is awesome. I have never seen tiger footage that looks so great and is so unguarded with long takes that lets the natural action unfold as opposed to the usual Nature Documentary editing.TIGER 24 is not a Nature Documentary. This is more of a narrative documentary with a murder mystery and a message about the ground reality of conservation.Definitely watch on a big screen or projector to appreciate the photography. My partner and I have a small home theater system so the film looked and sounded awesome. Music is really great too.,False
3,10,A TRUE CRIME WILDLIFE DOC,lederrosen-17875,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like wildlife documentaries? What about true crime? This is the perfect fusion. An in depth investigative look into a tiger who was wrongfully removed from his territory, and the complex circumstances surrounding the forest department's treatment of India's dominant male tiger.The craft of the filmmaking is very on point. The director won a Wildscreen Panda Award for best on screen talent, beating out the likes of David Attenborough!It's a very enjoyable and heart wrenching ride of a documentary that ratchets up nicely and leaves no stone unturned. The film does a nice job of exploring both sides of the argument.",False
4,10,A stunning documentary that challenges and educates the audience!,danielraffel,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you haven't already seen it do yourself a favour watch Warren Pereira's Tiger 24. Seriously one of the best documentaries I have seen in a long while. It's not leading. Tiger 24 is probably one of the best arguments for responsible conservation. It broaches a controversial subject with great humanity. The film sheds lights on the many obstacles the conservation movement faces. Truly one of the greats. Warren's investigative handling of the subject asks the relevant important questions and seeks to gain insight from all sides. Tiger 24 educates it's audience into the nuances of India's conservation efforts. The cinematography is breathtaking. The questions asked are poignant. One can't help but feel sympathetic to both the tigers, and the victims. It's a documentary I know I'll watch multiple times. Available on Apple TV, Amazon Prime and other streaming services.",False
5,9,Never thought I would be so moved by a documentary,anne_bloom,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw it at Wildscreen (on the hub) where this fine doc took home the Panda Award.TIGER 24 surprised me, in a good way. Usually these docs are about their pretty shots of animals which this doc does have but it also has an actual story, a murder mystery and an educational component as well.I found myself on ride from the activist point of view to the governments point of view. Is T24 a man eating tiger? Did T24 kill and eat the men or was it another animal?Kudos to the team behind the editing of this film. The shots are quality but putting together this layered story in way that is simple enough to hold the audience attention is a challenging feat.I feel like when I watch this doc again I will probably enjoy it further as it does have a lot of layers so there is more to take in and explore.I recommend it and will be looking forward to the Digital Release.",False
6,10,TIGER 24 : Powerful Sensitive Beautiful,Yorgoconstantine,n/a,16/08/2025,"TIGER 24 shows us the delicate balance between man and an alpha predator trying to live in harmony. I was captivated immediately by the opening shot. I became riveted as the story unfolded. The film follows Ustad, a dominant male tiger, who may have been wrongfully accused of killing men who wandered into his territory. And the debate of which is the correct action to take. TIGER 24 does an exceptional job of giving the multiple viewpoints with a fair and even hand. Regardless of who the viewer sides with, everyone can agree that we as humans must do our very best to preserve, protect and respect our planet's endangered species. Director Warren Pereira has made a powerful film on a sensitive subject in a beautiful way.Watch TIGER 24 Now!",False
7,n/a,A wonderful ode to T24 who passed away in Dec 2022,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is a beautiful documentary by Warren. My heart goes out to the departed T24 and his cubs. It is an eye opener how the tag 'man eater' is given to Tigers by pot bellied bureaucrats who have zero expertize in tiger management. Also shows that the illiterate villagers are not that innocent in causing harm to wildlife. What's the need to go to a temple right inside a tiger reserve? Just build a new temple! The music is beautiful and Warren has showed arguments from all sides to bring in a balanced perspective, though which is not enough to rankle the ranks of the babus sitting in Delhi warming their seats.",True
8,10,Excellent Documentary!,schwaaaz,n/a,16/08/2025,Tiger 24 is a fantastic story that is extremely relevant for our times. Who defines space and how can we protect the animals in their habitat. A finely well directed film and a must see just for the footage of the tigers in the wild. As I watched this excellent film I felt like I had traveled across the globe to involve myself in the controversy. While I can sympathize with the villagers I felt more empathy toward the tiger and his unfortunate situation. Hopefully this documentary will shed light on this tiger's plight and convince the powers that me to release him into a more humane situation with the time he has left on earth.,False
9,10,This is not your standard nature documentary,stu471,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really was fortunate to find Tiger 24, with no publicity or release on a major platform like Netflix or HBO it is hard to find. I found it only by luck as a friend of mine pointed it out, raved about it and pushed me to watch it. I am very glad that I was one of the few fortunate enough to see this well crafted and enthralling film that presents a lot of questions not just on Tigers in the wild but also our humanity. The film opens new complexities on conservation not just for the diverse creatures and ecosystems that we share this earth with but also ourselves. Initially I thought this film would be standard nature doc, a film documenting the life of a few tigers in the wild of India and the struggles that these creatures have in our modern world but this film is much more that that. This film is a murder mystery, a legal thriller and a historical review.First a technical review of the film.Cinematography: The cinematography is unparalleled, every shot in this film is well crafted and could stand out on its own. The effect of this is that it really draws you in and keeps you engaged. The use of warm browns is even and well incorporated throughout. There are multiple shots that are just breathtaking. I wish I could have seen this film in the theatres as it would have been incredible to see some of these shots on a big screen. I would also highlight to watch this film if you are watching it digitally not through a web browser as it will be capped at 480p due to streaming capping. Make sure you see this film in at least 1080p.Sound: The sound is crisp and clear throughout even during interviews and discussions that are far from the camera. A lot of work was done to keep sound levels consistent and clear throughout. If you have Dolby 5.1 you are in for a treat, the jungle will come alive.Editing: The editing in this film is tight, each scene is given just the right amount of space to convey the idea presented while keeping the audience interested.Music: Top tier soundtrack, very modern and a great mix of intense vibrational sections, gentle piano melodies and harmonious orchestral pieces that feed each moment of the film beautifully.Now for the story itself, Tiger 24 as stated above is not a nature documentary and I think the film maker originally intended it to be that but it turns into so much more. There is a very nice historical section that reviews the history of Tiger conservation in India which really enlightened me on the subject. The history of Tiger conservation in India could be a whole separate film but Tiger 24 is able to give the highlights very well. The interviews are very interesting, its really amazing how the filmmaker was able to transition from English speaking, to Hindi speaking with subtitles and back again so smoothly. The interview with Valmik Thapar is exceptional, when I first saw the trailer he came across as a rough egotistical alarmist but his interview really opened my eyes to a realistic standpoint for the issue of Tiger conservation and he became one of my favorite characters in the film. The whole movie evolves beautifully from initial fascination of tigers through investigation of key events and poignant conclusion. I highly recommend Tiger 24, if you give it 5 mins I guarantee it will pull you in and you won't regret it.",False
10,10,A COMPELLING STORY THAT WE ALL NEED TO WATCH,annaliza-galo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been tracking TIGER 24 for a decade because I know the filmmaker Warren Pereira and the ordeal that this project has been for him. Although I have seen snippets of his rough cut over the years I was not always sure if all the work, time and money he put into it was worth it. But now having seen the finished film and being so moved by the story, the top-notch cinematography and the message I do believe that his efforts were worth it. TIGER 24 is a compelling watch but also an important watch for those concerned about the future health of Mother Nature. Congratulations to Warren Pereira and the team behind TIGER 24.",False
11,10,Excellent,caesarfernandes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent, need more like this and it is a fact we all animal lovers should accept. In real sense we behave like animals and animals behave like human being.",False
12,10,Beautiful. Compelling.,shane-04595,n/a,16/08/2025,"T 24 asks questions about our role not only in conservation, but observation. The film took us to places that it didn't plan on. More people should see this film. One of my favorites this year.",False
13,10,Stunning and Intense,atkinsonethan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is like a true crime story in which it's never clear who is the true criminal. It's fascinating the way this documentary changes to the surprise of the filmmaker, who started filming before Tiger 24 became famous worldwide and massive political issue in India. It's beautifully shot and unflinchingly graphic.",False
14,10,A compelling watch,darabrtalyarkhan,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film Tiger T24 is a fascinating insight into current human behaviour and has been brilliantly depicted by producer Warren Pereira through the metaphor of a magnificent tiger ""Ustad"" -T24.It is a not to be missed film that is compelling viewing, and deserves a 10/10 score for its theme, originality, content, performance, music and direction.Tiger T24 is a film about the two primary laws of nature - a territorial imperative and survival of the fittest. With the unrelenting and geometrical growth in human population, invasion into the traditional territories of other living beings and conflict becomes inevitable, often resulting in the death of the weaker opponent. Natural laws are now being overturned by artificially created human laws which mandate the capture, incarceration and humiliating submission of the victor.Revulsion of such draconian artificial laws is beginning to rise up against such 'inhuman' behaviour, and Tiger T24 demonstrates how such changes are beginning to take place.",False
15,10,Incredible Experience!,DrLeePDX,n/a,16/08/2025,The quality and footage of wild tigers in this film is unrivaled. The storytelling is thoughtful and multifaceted. The story is compelling. Tiger 24 sets a new standard for animal documentaries.,False
16,9,Breathtaking!,meghanmagoun,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to go see this movie in the theaters in North Hollywood Laemmle - caught it on the last week! This was a beautiful, well done, cinematic work of art. I'm happy I went to go see it on the big screen because these shots were phenomenal! It takes you on a journey and gives you insight that you can't find anywhere else. Warren has captured the essence of this gorgeous tiger. It will definitely make you see many perspectives, and see a world outside of your own. You can tell that a lot of work and care went into crafting this film. I can't wait until it comes out for digital release! I will definitely be buying it. Well done to everyone that worked on this film!",False
17,10,A Unique And Stylish Telling Of A Powerful Tiger Tale,tessa_jensen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Are we in still in the Golden Age of documentaries? I think we were from about 2010 till 2015 with streaming services paying handsomely for independently made documentaries and promoting them. All of a sudden docs that were supposed to be good for you to watch also became fun to watch.But past 2015 the streamers and prod companies seem to manufacturing documentaries like a factory in a formulaic manner with same hooks, same players, same sound effects and even the same marketing tactics!Breaking out this factory documentary film making is ""Tiger 24"" a documentary that actually has a distinctive style made it seems by one man Warren Pereira on a tiger that he was passionate about. The film actually has a voice and does not suffer from the interference of companies which plagues most of the docs I see today who gravitate towards what is trending or salacious.""Tiger 24"" examines the controversial removal on a wild tiger from his wild territory for killing and eating men who invaded it. The film is superbly crafted blending natural history with true crime all told cinematically in a non-linear narrative elucidated with clear voicevoer narration and graphic timelinesAlthough quite different from Werner Herzog, Pereria's filmmaking shares that independent bold attitude. You know you are watching a great story but more importantly you know it is being told uniquely not because anyone is trying to be unique, because it is.And, oh did I mention it has some of the rarest tiger footage out there! It is like he was allowed to observe these animals as if he was part of their habitat.",False
18,10,A powerful story comes life in a cinematic masterpiece,vaughnphoenix,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen quite a few documentaries, but not many as cinematic as this one. This movie draws you right into the story and never lets you go.I found all the elements of the filmmaking to be done at a high level: the directing, cinematography, score, voiceover, etc. It's clear that someone took a lot of time crafting this film with care, ever step of the way.I like that this felt like a very personal story for the filmmaker. The fact that the director did the voiceover drew me even deeper into this tiger's story. It was great hearing about the backstory and how this film came to be. It made me care even more about the story.It was hard not to get emotional listening to everything this tiger has been through. There is human suffering also, which was sad as well.After view the film I feel compelling more than ever that we need to fight to save the tiger and other animals from extinction. It is imperative for the future of the human race and of the environment.Great film for any animal lover. And also for any cinema lover. This is truly a cinematic experience. Even if you're not a big documentary fan, I think you could love this film. This is storytelling at it's finest.Such an important film. A must see for sure. One of the best animal docs ever made.",False
19,10,This documentary film is beyond Amazing,marierod-35487,n/a,16/08/2025,Tiger 24 is an absolutely amazing movie. Just watched it. Those beautiful animals deserve recognition and so does W films who showcased them.Tigers are now a rare species in our world today. The few that are currently alive should be protected from government policies that wish to eliminate them.These beautiful animals should be left to live their lives in their own habitat. Create their own families and enjoy their offspring like we humans do.I found this movie so captivating and educational for me. Loved every minute of it and wish there were more movies like this that future generations could watch and learn from.,False
20,9,Fabulous Documentary About A Glorious Animal,danadana-09967,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky to catch TIGER 24 on the Big Screen during its US Theatrical Release. For me that was at the cinemas a Living Room Theaters in Boca Raton, Florida.Although the story of T24 is ultimately the most moving part of the film seeing the unguarded footage of wild tigers in a theater made for additional impact. In fact I have never seen such strong footage of tigers in the wild.The story telling holds your interest. Just when you think the Director Warren Pereira is taking you down a pro-activist path as so many docs do he tactfully pulls you into the POV of the government who declare T24 to be a man-eater.A great watch for anyone who loves a great story but a must watch for doc lovers and natural history lovers. This is not wall paper like OUR PLANET and PLANET EARTH, this is riveting film-making with backdrop of gorgeous natural history footage.",False
21,10,Powerful Tiger True Crime Saga!,Tash11,n/a,16/08/2025,"What started out as an immersive nature documentary that displays never seen before candid footage of tigers becomes a compelling true crime saga in TIGER 24. While the conservation message in the film is powerful and important, the true crime element and honest tiger footage makes this fine film standout amongst the rest of the pedestrian or formulaic documentary fare out there. Documentaries these days are either plain boring or factory made formulas for Streaming networks unlike TIGER 24 which is a true passion project with a distinctive filmmaker voice. TIGER 24 questions our admiration for predators as we squeeze them out of their territories; I welcome this line of questioning as I do this well crafted documentary.",False
22,10,Documentary Masterpiece!,mary8699,n/a,16/08/2025,"The cinematography captured a vibrant story of T-24, a culture of people have overlooked due to possibly false accusations. As an audience goer it journalistically embraced this tiger's innocence. This documentary has reached a new level that masters all grounds of T-24 story. It's covers all thoughts of how T-24 has a challenging time to reclaim his innocence in a society that doesn't function logically. Yet it's humbling to watch everything connect at the end. Exquisite documentary well done. Definitely want to watch it again. It should get released in 4k soon since it's too good to pass up.",False
23,10,Great Documentary,kyckkdgq,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been waiting to see Tiger 24 documentary for months after the release date. After learning about a premiere in California, I couldn't wait to see the documentary. The filmmaking and the message carried were crucial in learning about Tiger's natural habitat and conservation systems in India. I'm a huge animal lover and learning about various species help me develop additional knowledge of our planet. The Director was present before and after the screening which was refreshing and surprising at the same time. The Q&A at the end was very interactive and informative. The questions were answered throughly with a humor in it. Recommending to everyone who is interested in learning more about Tigers and India.",False
24,10,The Boundary which divides nature and us,gautamthedevil,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tiger24 is a highly encouraging movie about the borders we are crossing into the natural habitats of our co-existing breeds. Why a Tiger becomes a man-eater is often a question raised by many, but it is never understood that the territorial sense of us being human beings owning it all actually disperses multiple other things, a ferocious carnivore amongst them. The blame is on the animal but this movie actually points out where the fault lines exist. A must watch for all. The director has dedicated a lot of his time and energy to capture some of these brilliant moments in film.",False
25,10,Impressive documentary,vipwtc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed this film. It is a compelling story on conservation that makes us realize the importance of maintaining a perfect balance in the ecosystem. Directing, editing, sound and music are excellent. Highly recommend to watch it.",False

1,10,Rethink public examination in Hong Kong,herbertman,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhether you are a parent, student, or teacher in Hong Kong, this movie is an easy way to understand the moment of Hong Kong's public examination. The real-life stories of Ah Hong and Hui Yin, as well as the perspective of YY Lam, one of the famous tutors in Hong Kong Cram schools, make you rethink what the public examination is all about. The dialogues between Hui Yin and his mom and between Ah Hong and his parents make you rethink what the public examination is and how it negates one's life. I recommend you watch this movie so that you can learn more about the public examination in Hong Kong and the experiences of two young people, Ah Hong and Hui Yin, and rethink yourself.",True

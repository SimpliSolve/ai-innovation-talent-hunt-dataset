1,10,Painful Truth,peri-74036,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film evoked a lot of emotion out of me. The terror experienced by Big Cats, along with many other species, in the exotic animal trade is heartbreaking and unnecessary. I believe everyone should see this film to understand the cruel consequences of the selfishness of private ownership of animals who should be living wild and free. While it is not surprising that people continue to put money and fame before animal welfare, it is disgusting to watch. Tim Harrison did a great job investigating and I commend him for his dedication to end exotic animal exploitation.As a supporter of the Big Cat Public Safety Act, I urge everyone to support it as well. It is time for these animals to get the respect and consideration that they so deeply deserve. The work of Carney Ann Nasser, Carole & Howard Baskin, Tim Harrison, and more is truly inspiring. I was already an advocate for Big Cats and other wildlife, and after watching this film I've become even more passionate about this cause.Everyone should be aware of this cause and want to do something about it.",False
2,10,Tim Harrison and crew ROCK!,thetwig-30919,n/a,16/08/2025,"10 minutes in and I was hooked. I had assumed that animals appearing on TV talk shows were actually cared for and that there were zoos that insured their safety when they ""grew out of cute"". Wait 'till you see what goes on in the exotic animal industry and why federal legislation is essential. Great editing, pacing and development. Harrison's law enforcement background makes for compelling dialog. His team is a collection of dedicated professionals who turn their talents to cracking the wall surrounding the corruption, abuse and secrecy within the exotic animal industry. Find out for yourself why ""The Conservation Game"" needed to be made and viewed.",False
3,10,Phenomenal Doesn't Begin to Describe This Documentary!,mb-31293,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPhenomenal doesn't even begin to describe this documentary. It is the best documentary I have ever seen. I started it sometime between 7:00 and 7:30. I finished it at 11:20, yet it was only a 2 hour documentary. I had to keep pausing to take notes as well as rewinding to hear or see things again. I took 13 pages of notes.It was incredibly educational. I left it infuriated with the people who are abusing and exploiting big cats especially those who are using them as ambassadors for CONservation, like Dave Salmoni and Grant Kemmerer. Those guys use cats and then throw them away, usually never to be seen again. Cats routinely disappear with no way to ever find them and they have no remorse for doing so. All of the cats that are used, abused, and killed just so they can make money are worth nothing to them. They're just objects. It exposed Jack Hanna, The Columbus Zoo, and even the AZA's Animal Welfare Committee for doing it as well, even though people put their trust in those facilities and organizations not to do that! And it has caused the AZA and The Columbus Zoo to make changes for the better (ie revoking the Zoo's accreditation and parting ways with those exposed in the documentary). We also saw Grant Kemmerer working with 2 Leopard cubs on a talk show alongside Robert Irwin, son of Steve Irwin, so it even exposes the Irwins!I also left the documentary with a deepened love and appreciation for everything Tim Harrison, Jeff Kremer, Carole Baskin, Carney Anne Nasser, and more do for the animals and the immense struggles they face in doing it. I have known for a long time how good the bad guys are at covering their tracks (and how good the good guys are at investigating thosw wrongdoings), but not to the extent shown in The Conservation Game. Seeing how hard it is for them to track these people down, but also track the cats down (in the few cases they even can do so) gives me a whole new level of respect for what those guys do day in and day out. They put their lives in danger every day, but they keep fighting regardless, which is inspirational. They have been threatened, slandered, and everything in between but they still push forward. I can only hope to be as strong of an advocate for the animals as they are!The Conservation Game is powerful, emotional, educational, and is changing the game in the fight to end the plight of the 10,000 Tigers (plus other big cat species too) that are in captivity in the United States. Everyone needs to see this film!",True
4,10,Must see documentary if you love big cats.,dmkubacki,n/a,16/08/2025,You need to watch this. This made me cry many times. If you love big cats you need to see this. What Tim Harrison and the team have done is outstanding. A good example of what you see on TV is not always what it seems.,False
5,10,Powerful Documentary,MerryMam,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film shatters ideas and beliefs about practices that have been passed off as ""conservation"" on an American public apparently willing to take celebrities at their word. Excellent piece, chock full of facts that anyone concerned with the preservation of these beautiful animals needs to be aware of.",False
6,10,The More You Know...,apollogreekgod-misc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw the documentary in the theater when it came to San Diego. I had no idea what to expect. It blew me away. I had no idea that the famous so-called Conservationists, we're involved in the exotic animal trade. This is just the tip of the iceberg.I came away with a new found ""fury"" that this is happening all over the world. Truly saddens and angers me. We have to stop the pay-to-play that is happening in AZA zoos and roadside ""zoos"" and hold these people accountable.",False
7,10,"Like Dragnet ""just the facts""",Joemery-26490,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film stays with the facts - that what I love about Mike's approach to his work. The utter, bare bones truth is what makes this interesting. It takes discipline and conviction in your direction to stay the course and let the truth tell the story. Really well done. It could have been an overglamourized hit piece on pop culture celebs but it stayed focused on the correct intent and meaning. Webber does it again.",False
8,10,Disgusting irresponsible people...,earitlit-87718,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerAll private facilities that put money and personal wishes before the welfare of the animals need to be shut down. It's time to put the animals before the ego and money.Ignoring where animals are kept and turning a willful blind eye to big cat animal welfare. 'We have are own set of criteria' is an irresponsible attitude.Jack Hanna....shame on you. Jared Miller...shame on you. Dave Salmoni.... shame on you. Boone Smith....shame on you. The Columbus Zoo....shame on you. U. S. Department of Agriculture limiting information and renewing irresponsible facilities.... shame on you. Too many irresponsible people to list.Congress...shame on you.Watch this documentary and be disgusted.,True
9,10,Eye opening,aimzy_d,n/a,16/08/2025,"Exposes the horrible exploitation of exotic animals taking place in this country by famous people all under the guise of ""conservation"". We must put an end to this! Very informative and eye opening. If you care about animals at all you should see this movie!",False
10,10,Don't be surprised if you see a big cat in your backyard,sergiobentim,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are more of them here in US than in their habitats. Powerful documentary, it's time for the authorities to start doing something about it. And it's also time to stop torturing those animals in TV shows and public appearances, the are afraid of humans and for a good reason.",False
11,10,"I gave it a 10, but...",b4blue,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTim might be a good investigator, unless it involves people that might have the right information, which is also incriminating for them. He starts these angry conversations with complete strangers, without any setup. Perhaps this is why he is so into animals (bad with people?). If wellbeing of animals comes first and making a shocking documentary second, why not put some effort to establish a rapport first and dig around gently, before declaring frustration and throwing accusations? He was a police officer... I was glad to see Carole Baskin back in the spotlight, without the trashy country soundtrack that claims she murdered her husband. All in all, this is a very revealing documentary that everyone in the world should see.",True
12,10,Explosive documentary,andreablanca-84992,n/a,16/08/2025,This is an amazing documentary about the disturbing lengths people will go to for their own selfish reasons. Tim and his crew do an amazing job at exposing the exploitation of animals done by so called conservationist and tv wildlife personalities. Along with the industries behind them including almost every late night talk show and Columbus zoo. Everyone involved in this animal exploitation should be in jail. Please watch this and educate yourself. These people on TV are not always who they say they are. I'll never understand how people can be so reckless with animal lives. Absolutely disgusting and heartbreaking to watch but so worthwhile and important.,False
13,10,The Best Awareness Documentary Of 2022,JoshuaMercott,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best conservation and awareness documentaries I have seen in 2022, this is definitely one title you should not miss.Watching it made me realize just how little we are doing to ensure that animals are kept safe from human depredation. Watching it also made me understand that there are people out there making a significant difference toward helping the voiceless.Michael Webber did outstanding work on direction. Major names who featured in this enlightening documentary include Carole Baskin, Howard Baskin, and Tim Harrison.They did not shy from naming names like Jack Hanna and more. This in itself proved that the makers of ""The Conservation Game"" weren't kidding around.Musical scoring by Paul Brill and Michael Leonhart added to the engaging and educational value packed into this brilliant docu, which in my eyes doubled as a powerful exposé.I hope this title creates waves of awareness and brings about global policies geared toward ensuring a co-existential future between fauna and humankind. In this day and age of Climate Change, this is one of the least things we can do to weave a more humane future.",False
14,n/a,Rising to humanity's call of duty.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"At times, there are efforts so great with results so profound, one feels unworthy to give any form of criticism. The ""who am I to judge card"" comes into play here. Writing reviews can, at best, be helpful to others - documenting and rectifying crimes committed ""by humanity"" is leagues apart.The Conservation game is a must see - more to the point it is a must do. Unfortunately many of the ""must dos"" never get done... yet somehow we always expect somebody to pull through, to stand up, to have the true grit and courage to deliver; deliver what we feel we have the right to know., deliver when blatant wrongdoings are somehow missed out.Tim Harrison, Michael Webber & co have performed their must do. If they have the energy one can hope they have more must dos on their bucket list - if they have not, they can rest assured that they have, well and truly, risen to the call of humanity.This is an extraordinary documentary. Documentaries record events, often sad and tragic events. It takes something extra to go beyond taking notes. To not merely settle for documenting a sorry state of affairs - but to also be instrumental in change for the better.In the best of worlds The Conservation Game stretches even further - inspiring others to turn ""must does"" into ""have dones"".",False

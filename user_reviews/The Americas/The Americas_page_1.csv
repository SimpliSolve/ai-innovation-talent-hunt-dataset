1,8,Not AI,Techmama68,n/a,15/08/2025,"NBC's website addresses the question of whether or not AI was used in the show. The following text is from NBC's website:""Anyone who tuned into the first two episodes of NBC's The Americas may have questions like ""Is this real?"" or ""Am I just seeing AI or CGI?"" While it's a testament to how incredible and unbelievable the footage is, the truth is the fantastic nature footage is just the result of innovative filming techniques and clever, dedicated camera operators.Is The Americas show AI? No. While AI imagery can produce some pretty surreal-looking things, the footage found in The Americas comes straight from real life, which makes it all the more impressive. Artificial Intelligence still can't create some of the wonders that are found right in our continent's backyards.The footage captured by The Americas crew is not the generated by AI or CGI. Instead, it's the fruit of more than 180 expeditions to some of the most hostile and gorgeous places on Earth, according to the BBC. The team behind the show was dedicated to capturing some of these natural wonders in unrivaled detail in ways never seen before. So, if it looks like something totally unreal, it's probably because no one has ever shot nature quite like this before.How was The Americas filmed?The BBC, which co-produced The Americas, notes it wanted to create an immersive viewing experience with the series, which meant going to faraway places and getting a look at some of the more difficult-to-see spots within them. The Americas will take viewers up into the sky with helicopters and drones, under the sea with rafts and rebreathers and even underground with computer-controlled camera rigs and 360-degree probe scopes.In total, roughly 35 camera models were used for specific applications that brought nature to life in The Americas to help tell the story of wildlife in never-before-seen and visually stunning ways.""",False
2,9,Music,bgqrpcby,n/a,15/08/2025,"The content, visuals, and narration are OUTSTANDING!!!! But, everything would be perfect if the music didn't drowned out Mr. Hanks wonderful narrative!! The music is lovely but too loud!!!! I want to hear the narrative as well! The visuals are so full of color and expressive action! The narrative tells an impressive tale giving the viewer background stories and remarkable details. I could watch these over and over catching new details each time. Mr. Hanks is absolutely amazing the way he delivers the information!! The production is thoughtful but not forced. There is humor, emotion, excitement, and danger. All the elements are presented in perfect balance, except the music level.",False
3,7,Sack the sound guy!,atideswell,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having been brought up on BBC wildlife programs narrated by the incomparable Sir David Attenborough, I was curious to see if this American made program showed anything new and if it was any good, well there wasn't much that I haven't seen before, but the camera work was glorious and Tom Hanks have it a good go, although I do find his voice a bit irritating, over all the program probably would have been great, but found I the music and background sounds too invasive, could hardly hear the poor Tom and he wouldn't have been cheap. Anyway this was so distracting from the visuals I gave up with it.",False
4,n/a,"Outstanding Visuals, but Music can be Interruptive",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The stunning visuals for this series are exemplary. This is a mind-blowing, informative experience. As with most nature programs, this puts our humanity into perspective. The script takes a traditional approach: it's a blend of intriguing facts, anthropomorphism, and humorous quips to keep the viewers coming back.Here's my main disappointment: the audio mix is frequently imbalanced. As others have mentioned, there are moments when the narration is gobbled up by the heavy-handed music. This is a common occurrence nowadays. They want the viewers to feel a certain way, so they attempt to sway us by either increasing the volume or using songs which trigger heightened emotions. It's an old trick that doesn't work for some of us.Aside from the above, I still recommend this series. Here's a workaround which I prefer. I turn the volume off and tweak the Caption settings to my liking. When an animal sound comes on, I temporarily turn up the volume.",False
5,10,Amazing,debree-51826,n/a,15/08/2025,Do yourself a favor and watch this. Surreal images & things you've never seen. Great narrating. Amazing information and pictures. I can't even wrap my head around how they got all this video. You will be amazed at the nature and the wildlife that you never knew existed. This is a great series for the whole family to watch. You will be educated as well as your kids. I can't get this show enough praise and I hope it wins a lot of awards. Watch it on a big screen TV and turn the lights out and you will be totally mesmerized and your mind will be blown. This is the best non-regular program I have ever seen in my life.,False
6,10,Wow!,lou-richards,n/a,15/08/2025,"This series is amazing. The photography is sensational. I hope there is a sequel showing how it was produced. The production values are amazing. Was all the photography done from a helicopter? Did they scout the locations a long time before the producers and director put it together? I am amazed by the quality of the film, the graphics and the narration. Over how many years was it produced? How did they find that snowshoe rabbit or the dead polar bear? How did they get such marvelous closeups? It looks like it took a long time to put this together. When did they start filming? It is certainly worth watching. Give us more.",False
7,10,Outstanding,binnigirl,n/a,15/08/2025,One of the best nature shows ever! And Tom Hanks is a great narrator! Spectacular photography and some things weve never seen before on a show. So very impressed and in hopes of more to follow. Thank you BBC or whoever produced this fabulous series. One of the best nature shows we have ever watched. Photography was beyond amazing and we discovered some wildlife we have never seen before in a nature show. Tom Hanks did an outstanding job of narrating the film. We will be saving this to watch again several times and sharing with family and friends. Would be wonderful if more episodes were created.,False
8,10,Incredible,pmpmn9,n/a,15/08/2025,"I genuinely enjoyed this series and looked forward to watching it every week. It captured so many beautiful places and creatures in the wild spaces of North and South America, from the largest to the smallest. It was also very well narrated by Tom Hanks.I highly recommend the last episode, which highlights how the series was made. The camera crew seem to be well suited to the kind of work required to produce the series, which was very complicated and adventurous. They needed to work in many different types of environments and climates and operate their equipment in all sorts of weather conditions. They also had close encounters with wild animals, often unintentionally when they were unexpectedly approached.If there is a DVD version of this series, I would definitely be interested in purchasing it and gifting it to my grandchildren.",False
9,10,Amazing,debwalsh-58864,n/a,15/08/2025,"Love Tom's narration of this series,. Sometimes quite comical, in his style, love it. I hope they do more of our beautiful planet. This has been the best thing to watch. Fun and educational, every school should show these episodes. The drones and photography is spectacular. Amazing, the events they captured,.some being a first. The underwater was done very well. I just loved it!! Gonna really miss seeing these episodes. I learned a lot about the beautiful areas of North and South America. It's hard to pick a favorite episode but seeing the whales was a treat. Amazing what these creatures do to survive and thrive.",False
10,10,An Incredible Series Narrated by Tom Hanks Who Brings The Beauty And Struggles Of Nature To Life,rannynm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow! The Americas is an incredible docu-series about North and South America with breathtaking views of the land and the animals that live there. I really enjoyed Tom Hanks' narration; his unique storytelling brings the beauty and struggles of nature to life. Every episode is filled with jaw-dropping shots that made me appreciate the wild world around us.The Americas is a ten-episode television series that explores the unique animals and landscapes of the vast North and South America. Scored by composer Hans Zimmer and narrated by Tom Hanks, the series shows how different species survive and adapt while also highlighting the effects of climate change and human activity. Each episode focuses on a different region, giving a close look at the fascinating wildlife and environments that make it special. From the fast-paced lives of ants to the mesmerizing creatures of the deep ocean, the documentary captures nature's wonders like never before.This series is visually amazing with its groundbreaking cinematography. The filmmakers use advanced drone technology to glide over vast landscapes, night-vision cameras to reveal the secret lives of nocturnal animals, and slow-motion footage to capture the precise moment a predator strikes. These techniques made me feel like I was right there in the wild. Tom Hanks' narration adds warmth and curiosity to the show. Zimmer's soundtrack builds tension during dramatic moments and enhances the wonder of peaceful scenes. My favorite part is when the mother snake goes above and beyond for her baby snakes, showing the incredible instinct and care animals have for their young. The filmmakers also capture a massive storm in stunning detail, showcasing the sheer power of nature in a way that feels both terrifying and beautiful.The show's message is about protecting nature. It shows the dangers of deforestation, pollution, and climate change and encourages people to take action. The series raises awareness and makes viewers think about how each one of us can help preserve the environment. Be forewarned that some scenes of predators hunting their prey are pretty graphic and unsuited for younger viewers.I give The Americas 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The show premieres on NBC on February 23, 2025.By Eva M., KIDS FIRST!",False
11,6,Hanks make this unwatchable for me,numba023,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm sure I'm in the minority here but the narration from Tom Hank's is just not right
for this kind of programme, maybe I've been spoilt with the Goat Mr Attenborough for too long but this is so disconnected and clunky its really put me off watching it. Shame. It's so scripted which I know is how it works but the trick is to make it sound like it isn't scripted. You want the narrator to say things from an experts POV and that they are telling you things from knowledge not a rigid script. I love Toms acting work and rarely see a bad performance in anything he does but I think he needs to stick to the big screen sorry.",False
12,10,This is a Masterpiece!,Mika_US,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Americas is a truly outstanding work that reveals the beauty and majesty of our continent's natural beauty with unrivaled precision and aestheticism. Tom Hanks' superb narration, filled with depth and emotion, gives each frame a special significance, allowing the viewer to feel connected to every corner of nature. His voice, of course, is an important part of the magic of the series - it makes the story alive, deep and touching.Unique footage, shot with incredible skill, captures the beauty of America's natural landscapes - from majestic mountain ranges to pristine rainforests, from rugged deserts to majestic ocean expanses. Every frame is awe-inspiring, and the footage emphasizes not only the beauty but also the fragility of the ecosystems.As for Hans Zimmer's soundtrack, his music is simply stunning. It is not just a background accompaniment, but a real musical hero of the series, enhancing emotions and creating the right atmosphere for each episode. Zimmer's melodies fit perfectly into the large-scale picture of nature, creating depth and harmony.Many thanks to NBC for the opportunity to broadcast this masterpiece, which not only gives viewers an aesthetic pleasure, but also inspires them to cherish our planet. The Americas is a series that everyone should see. It inspires, enlightens and leaves an indelible mark on the soul.",False
13,7,Fascinating but...,imdbfan-3352056556,n/a,15/08/2025,As with programmes such as Planet Earth the photography and filming is stunning. Almost too true to be real in some scenes. Please tell me AI hasn't been used (the bee scenes in the orchid forest would suit 3D glasses and looks superimposed).In some featured sections it's almost like watching a Disney film with the music and Tom Hanks expressive narration. A touch over done to my taste. Such a shame David Attenborough is missing from this series.The graphics of the landscapes are excellent and realistic. Thankfully The Gulf of Mexico still exists - hooray! (I wonder if it's been edited already for the USA audience),False
14,3,Done to the Death,farshidkarimi,n/a,15/08/2025,"The good thing about documentaries produced by BBC Natural History Unit is that no matter how many times you have watched a scene before, you still enjoy it when it is produced by the said unit. BBC documentaries are supplemented by the soft and pleasant voiceover of the legendary naturalist, Sir. David Attenborough. He is innately wired to enchant the viewers filmed by professional cameramen.The visuals in this documentary (The Americas) are stunning, the scenes shown are awe-inspiring and the job done by the filming crew is admirable. BUT, there is nothing we have not seen before in this documentary series. It is just like a copying of scenes from other documentary series and splicing them together to produce this documentary series.And, this series does not have the attraction, the pull that documentaries produced by BBC have.",False
15,n/a,A glimpse of the Americas most of us have never seen.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I suspect they got Tom Hanks to narrate this because he is such a popular actor. But frankly, who narrates is mostly immaterial. Some complain about him but to me he does a fine job. Others would have also.To the meat of the programming. When you consider how extensive ""The Americas"" is - North America, Central America, and South America - no program, no matter how detailed it is, could cover everything about all of it.So what they did here is first, select regions, like the Gulf Coast or the Andes, etc. Then second, in each region focus on a very small number of very interesting aspects. Things we, the audience, would likely never learn about otherwise.So what we get are, for a few examples, frogs that live at high elevation and die each night by freezing, then thaw back alive the next day. Or hummingbirds with two very long tail feathers, doing its mating dance. Or a duck that has special armor on its legs so that it can dive and feed safely in very hot water.My own favorite is the piece on the red land crabs of Cuba. At the right season millions of them come out of the ground in the forest, find a mate, incubate for 14 days, then make the several mile trek to the sea to disperse their billions of eggs. A few thousand don't make it across the coastal highway when big vehicles come along but there are so many it hardly makes a dent in the numbers.Each episode has things, fascinating things, that we would likely never be exposed to otherwise. The script is interesting and humor is injected occasionally at opportune times. And the photography is stunning.The last episode is a ""making of"" presentation, showing behind the scenes how the teams were able to track down and capture the video they did. It is fascinating in its own right.We normally watch the weekly episode streaming on Peacock, the commercials are fewer and easier to handle.",False
16,10,Amazing shots and Hanks gets in great plots,burntorangeboy,n/a,15/08/2025,"The show Tom Hanks brings to us a nature show with amazing views of our world here in the Americas, with amazing lifelike views of wildlife and nature. Tom Hanks' narration brings understanding and life to what we are enjoying on the screen. It is a positive program, something uplifting and powerful. With Hank' theatrical background, he brings a clever, unique perspective to the narrative duties. My entire family loves it! I would highly recommend the program to anyone who loves nature, anyone who wants to watch inspiring programs, or anyone with brains. It is beautifully photographed and the cinematography is amazing too.",False
17,8,Blue Bees - Who Knew?,csdcsdcsd2003,n/a,15/08/2025,"My husband and I love nature shows - we haven't seen any in quite a while so we were happy to find this Tom Hanks narration of The Americas. What I don't understand is the order of subjects - we start along the East Coast and then swing all the way down to Mexico . . . And then back up to the Great Plains. Although I'm not complaining because the images are wonderful and explanations are clear. I just love watching feisty male blue Mexican bees gathering ""cologne"" from gorgeous orchids to attract a mate and spread pollen - who knew there were such creatures? It always puzzles me how camera work is done in such tiny obscure locations such as 9 feet underground to view unusual desert ants sucking watery nectar from living ant-balloons.",False
18,10,Beautiful!,jjaredjenson,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Americas is one of the most beautiful and fascinating nature shows I've seen in a long time. It takes you on an incredible journey through North, Central, and South America, showing off everything from snowy mountains to tropical rainforests, and the wildlife footage is absolutely stunning.Tom Hanks narrates the series, and his voice fits perfectly-calm, familiar, and just the right mix of informative and emotional. You really feel connected to the animals and their stories, whether it's a bear teaching its cubs to fish or a jaguar stalking prey in the jungle.What I really love is how the show balances amazing visuals with real, meaningful stories. It touches on big issues like climate change and habitat loss, but it doesn't feel heavy-handed-it still leaves you feeling inspired and hopeful.If you're into nature documentaries or just want something visually jaw-dropping and surprisingly emotional, definitely check this out. The Americas is a must-watch.",False
19,10,This show deserves every award!,Rogerstella,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's so much garbage content on TV these days. Then you see a show like this that makes you gasp, feel emotions, and just stare in wonder at this amazing continent. It becomes very clear that animals are the most amazing creatures that deserve every ounce of our respect and protection. I was very emotionally moved by the whole series. Seeing never before seen footage and even getting involved in the emotional battles of a little beetle. All God's creatures, great and small. I'm grateful that this production was brought to our TV screens. The producers, film crew, biologists, researchers, Tom Hanks and the REAL stars (the animals), all deserve to be recognized and awarded the highest honor for this masterpiece.",False
20,10,"Never-before-seen, Breathtaking shots",gmcclain-25518,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some of the most amazing shots I've ever seen in an animal documentary, to the point where the ""How It Was Made"" episode becomes increasingly exciting each time. It's truly remarkable what this team was able to accomplish, and their years of hard work is on grand display in the best way possible. This is a love letter to nature and animal enthusiasts across the world, especially here in the Americas. I have one gripe with the whole show. The narratives usually told of the animals gets rather predictable after the first couple episodes. The classic ""Oh no..."" to ""Just kidding"" is used in about every episode it seems like. Also, I guess a second thing, the audio is sometimes mixed in a way where it sounds a little ""off"", like it's lower than it should be. This one noticeable in the first few episodes, but either I got used to it or they improved later throughout. Anyway, enough of that. This is one of the most incredible, jaw-dropping documentaries I've ever seen. This is a must watch for any animal lover.",False
21,7,A Bit Superficial When Compared To Other Nature Shows.,Turk-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"First, thanks to NBC for attempting this. But Tom Hanks is a bit boring and singsongy in the narration. When you can hear him. It's the also a bit too kitchsy. The voice over has a volume far too muted for the overbearing music. That music is too loud and too much like bad elevator pop or Fourth of July Pops Concert.The animal segments are well-filmed but way too short to provide memorable, informative explanations. This almost seems like outakes from more comprehensive nature shows on the BBC, PBS, Netflix,
National Geographic or The Smithsonian chanel.It's as if they didn't trust their audience to stay with them for a deep and pleasurable ride.",False
22,3,Could have been better,frasierkaren,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all, I cannot hear Tom Hanks' narrative over the volume of the music that seems to be more important than the narration because of its overwhelming and overbearing music. It is definitely not ""background music"" as it takes control over everything. I have lost interest in further episodes because I cannot hear Tom. It's a shame, I thought this would be a Sunday Night staple for families. I really wanted to like it, but the two screaming issues, low volume narration and overly loud over music. The footage is amazing, but not amazing enough. So sorry then presentation is so flawed. Keep trying.",False
23,2,Great cinematography,pseudonymforcl,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat cinematography, I honestly have no idea how some of this was done. It is over the top great, hats off to the film crew and editors, the rest is not very good. Hanks is sleep walking through this.There is nothing we haven't seen before and I'm not certain what is being said is acurate.Bald eagles sure are amazing but this episode doesn't reflect the reality of how they survive or that some statistics report their numbers are soaring they always seem to run into a road block, but back to the boredom of the show. I was expecting greatness. Hanks is one of the most highly paid actors out there. I assumed they would provide something to embellish him. Wrong.",True
24,3,Looks: 10; sound: 3,bthrock,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are many fantastically sharp and beautiful images, but I am tempted to recommend watching with the sound muted. There is scant information in the narration. (For two scenes, the sum of the science was ""the little fish hide from the medium-size fish behind the big fish"" and ""the fireflies are so pretty, especially when they flash at the same time."") The choice of Tom Hanks as narrator reinforces the notion that the show is about surface glitz, not learning or insight. The music is working very hard, providing more energetic bombast than is needed. The sound-effects dubbing is shamelessly overdone, loudly insisting on the supposed sounds of that osprey's wings 200 feet away from the camera, or leading us to imagine that cicada feet make thundering clicks with every step. This would be a good first exposure for kids who have never seen a nature documentary, but for the rest of us, it is somehow both thin and overproduced.",False
25,n/a,Music is too loud,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was really looking forward to seeing this series and looking forward to Tom Hanks narration. The cinematic photography is great and it would have had some interesting moments but what isn't great is the dramatic music that underscores every scene and aspect of the series that drowns out Toms narrative. Toms voice is very soft and isn't normally dramatic, and his voice is easily overpowered by the music. There's really nothing more to be said about this series. It's obviously been made for the American audience and market who like drama in their wildlife documentaries, unlike the UK audience who are more used to David Attenborough and his natural approach.",False

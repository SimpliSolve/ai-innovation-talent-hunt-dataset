1,7,There are only losers in this tragedy,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna"" (2025 release; 90 min) opens, it is ""October 2021"" and we are on the set of a western movie. The unthinkable happens and Alec Baldwin accidentally shoots a live bullet, killing the movie's Director of Photography Halyna Hutchins and wounding the film's director Joel Souza. How did this happen? Rachel Mason, who directed this documentary, informs us that Halyna's husband has asked her to make a film about Halyna's life (and I cannot do that if I don't understand how she died"". At this point, we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: I was generally aware of this story as it was in the headlines everywhere when this happened. But I was completely unaware of the details behind it, and this documentary fills most of those holes, while at the same time reflecting on Halyna's life and works. The film makers apparently found a bunch of unseen footage that was shot on the movie set in New Mexico, which is quite helpful. And while certainly the neglect and/or incompetency of several people at undeniable, the bigger picture is that the entire production was being done ""on the cheap"", cutting corners (including safety corners) left and right, time and again. Just the day before the fatal shooting happened a number of the film crew walked off the set, concerned about the unresolved safety issues on the set. Yet everyone plowed on, And then it was too late. Let's be clear: this is an immensely tragic loss of life, completely preventable. There are only losers in this tragedy. Kudos to the film makers for bringing us this documentary.""Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna"" started streaming on Hulu a week or so ago, and I watched it the other night. If you wonder what actually happened that led to the death of a film maker on the set of Rust (and the aftermath of those events), I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,7,"Insightful documentary, but wanted more",onbrightonrd,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was an interesting examination of an on-set tragedy, but they could have put more focus on Halyna Hutchins herself. The director mentions at the beginning of the film that Halyna's husband asked her to make a film about her life--this doesn't feel like that film. We get bits and pieces of Hutchins' life and work--details such as growing up in the Arctic Circle and loving to watch movies, that her mother still lives in Ukraine, and that Halyna was a rising cinematographer, wife, and mother--all of which make you want to know more. It's evident she was a passionate artist and her loss means so much to her family and fellow filmmakers. And undoubtedly it would have been hard to include so many details in an hour and a half documentary, but you come away with the feeling that the world--and even we as viewers--never really saw who she was.As an examination of the on-set shooting and aftermath, the film does a decent job of interviewing crew members, investigators, and showing bodycam footage from that day. The documentary does give you multiple perspectives of the event. One surprising detail that is left out is reports of target practice with live rounds on the set, which were circulated in the media in the days after the shooting. Perhaps those reports have been proven to be unsubstantiated, but the documentary notes six live rounds were found on the set, while no possible explanations for this are mentioned.In the end, there have been and will be more documentaries that cover this tragedy in some respect--I just hope this filmmaker gives us more of a personal look at Halyna Hutchins at some point to appreciate the human being and artist who was lost.",False
3,10,"Great documentary, thought provoking too, who really is at fault.",Sean26,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler1. Alec Baldwin shot the gun unintentionally, but he did shoot it.2. Alec Baldwin was a producer on Rust, producers are in charge of things like props, such as, for example, GUNS.3. The Armorer should have shot the gun, as a test, away from people, to make sure that dummy bullet wasn't a real bullet, which it was. Not just clean it. I think these two people, plus the director should be held accountable for their obvious disregard for safety4. Halyna's photography crew that left the day before her death, need to go back to school and get re-educated on taking care of the whole crew. I think that's what made me upset the most. They just up and left Halyna and left her alone without thought for HER safety, now they all will be regretting their hasty abandonment of their beloved chief of photography, Halyna.",True
4,10,So many mixed emotions!,bamafan-25404,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, I would like to start with this documentary was filmed very well. I think it was very careful and what they put in the documentary and what they left out and they leave a lot for you to make your own assumptions, but it does contain live footage interviews and it covers a very sensitive story that everyone knows because it was all over the news for months and it's still ongoing. I'm very excited to see if there's gonna be a part two covering trials and stuff like that after it's all said and done.I dislike how the story of Halyna was covered in this documentary and I hope they find justice for her life. She was very good at her job and this film will shine some light on the tragedy in a positive way.",False
5,5,Not enough Halyna,AdoptDontShopPets,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sadly this documentary shows just a few glimpses at the work of Halyna Hutchins' prior work. I would have better appreciated this doc if it shared more of her prior work and the growth in her artistry. If someone just wants to hear about what happened with Rust and a little on her life, they will enjoy this documentary. With her husband as an executive producer, I thought we'd get a little more celebration of Halyna.",False
6,5,"Badly Done Documentary, Nice Memorial RIP Helena",bpb99,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have a lot to say about this documentary and not very much of it is good. The only redeeming quality of this doc was the memorial to the victim Helena Hutchins. It should be watched for that alone.The actual documentation of the case I thought was extremely bad, often one-sided or casting blame. While other parts felt like they were attempting to garner sympathy where it not deserved and downplayed responsibility.There seems to be an obvious bias against Baldwin, with opinions often being kinder toward Reed. Often it seems 'the bigger picture' isn't really accounted for in a lot of the arguments it's trying to present in her defense.Personally I strongly believe there should have been an additional trial. This documentary touches on whether relatives to the victim felt as though justice was served and the opinions seemed to differ. I felt as though justice had not been served properly.I see three main perpetrators in this incident (excluding the nuance of David Halls responsibilities and his guilty plea).1. There was the armorer who claimed responsibility over the guns and allowed this to happen. Throughout we learn that she was overtaxed with work and rushed through her responsibilities. They attempt to use this as an excuse, even showing the armorer raised concerns. They clearly display it was a cost cutting measure, having her work a lower paying job instead of paying her more for her work as an armorer etc. Regardless, she signed on as an armorer, the buck stops at her. She had ultimate responsibility. She got the job because her dad is well known, she has had a whole life around guns. I would argue this created a complacent attitude that wasn't really discussed in the doc. It shows an interview of her literally lying to the police about not shooting the guns when it was revealed in the news there was 'plinking' going on (shooting cans). Then they never mention she lied. It also creates the scenario or likely way in which these bullets got onto the set. She either brought them to 'plink' or should have known because she would have witnessed the other person 'plinking' and would have been able to put 2+2 together and realize there was a real bullet on the set, in the gun she was responsible for.. I think she was grossly grossly negligent, complacent and deserved the full sentence under the law.2. Her behavior was so negligent, that it should then fall upward onto whoever hired her and they should face legal responsibility because she was really that bad. Realistically, the decision to hire her was a life and death decision given the magnitude of her safety responsibility. That person who made the choice (based on nepotism alone), along with rushing her and other cost cutting measures that increased the danger should be criminally responsible for the entire event. They are probably the most responsible out of everyone, should have faced the harshest punishment. For them it's a case of should have known better + greed. I don't know whether that be Baldwin the producer, or some other exec involved. They show a women named Gabrielle or something like that was the one that was pressuring her to work faster.3. I found Baldwin to be the most vilified out of all in this, with very little sympathetic commentary his way. I think they didn't really cover his case well at all because ultimately his guilt relied more on two factors to me personally.A) did he pull the trigger. Seemingly an obvious answer, they mention in the doc there was evidence but never state what it was. They also muddied the water when they claimed the gun couldn't be fired by dropping the hammer (some can some can't, depends on the specific manufacturer and when it was made). They said it couldn't but then apparently Baldwins team claimed the gun was so damaged when they received it couldn't fire at all.B) I think one single person (I think Hall) claims you never point a gun at someone even in a movie. I am no expert but I find this extraordinarily hard to believe having watched many movies. First of all why? Why can't a completely empty, double triple checked gun be pointed at someone safely? A bullet isn't just going to materialize out of thin air.. Of course if there is a need for blanks (the things that go bang with no bullet), the rule makes sense.. Blanks can malfunction and send deadly shrapnel out of the barrel. But why if it is empty, or if it has DUMMY rounds. Rounds that look real, but are 100% fake and do nothing. Again it doesn't make sense from that perspective. Secondly Baldwin seemed to be the most experienced person on set.. I would imagine he has had some sort of etiquette training in the past knowing whether its a no-no or not. Why not interview another famous actor(s) with experience in movies with guns and ask them their opinion?I think the 'norm' within the industry should be taken into account. Maybe he did really pull the trigger, and he should've known not to point it at her. If that is the case I would say he is guilty, to whatever extent that is. To me personally still not as bad as either of the other two (unless he is person number 2).",True

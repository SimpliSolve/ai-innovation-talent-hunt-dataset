1,8,A very insightfull series into the life of one of Norways greatest painters,ArasVorte,n/a,15/08/2025,"The series explores the turbulent life of the norwegian painter Odd Nerdrum and his stand against modernism, and for some reason against the norwegian state, but also the inner workings of his artistry. His family is at the forefront as well, sometimes more than Odd himself, especially his son Ode, who throughout the series is the mastermind behind the establishment and realization of his fathers art-museum.Odd Nerdrum remains relatively infamous in Norway, without being properly recognised for his accomplishments, but this series is an absolute testament to his talent and a way to cleanse the stain on his legacy who has followed him from his very first debut as an artist.",False

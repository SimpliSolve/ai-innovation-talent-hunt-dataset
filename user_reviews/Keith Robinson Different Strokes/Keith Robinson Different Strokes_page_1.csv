1,6,Very Funny,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very funny take on really adverse situations, which are having two strokes during the Global Pandemic. His take on his pay and suffering is reminiscent of Richard Pryor's special after suffering from his freebasing injury. While I think his perspective and comedy were very funny I did wonder if he could sustain future specials with this material, or material unrelated to his strokes. Worth Watching. I see that he has previously starred in Amy Shumer's Trainwreck, and that she produced this special, which makes sense. He was also in The King of Staten Island, so he might have good pre-stroke material I was just unaware of.",False
2,8,A Killer Hour,genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was happy to hear that Robinson, one of the regulars that made Tough Crowd so great back when Comedy Central mattered (does it even exist anymore?) would have a special on Netflix. He didn't do a full hour on the stroke, but he clearly could have done a solid hour of material about it. It's great to see that his writing is still as good as ever and that he's enjoying himself in this show. Also some funny stuff on how he had to deal with covid during his problems as well as a great moment around 35 minutes in. But don't listen to my yammering - just watch the special. I hope there are more in the future.",False
3,10,Masterpiece,yisakjesus,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the funniest, if not, the funniest stand up special on netflix out there. I found out about this guy for the first time on the Kevin Hart special "" Laugh at my pain"". He was labeled one of Kevin's mentors. But i never saw his stand ups before. I check him out for the first time on the Mark Twain prize for Kevin Hart. He was hilarious. And as soon as i saw his own stand up special is out, i didn't hesitate to check it out. I just couldn't believe i am just finding out about this guy now. I actually watched it 3 times already. I hope he puts out more soon. This stand up special is definitely one of my favourites out there.",False
4,10,One of the best hours of comedy,acaruso78,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh wow this special is so good in so many ways. Not just for seeing Keith Robinson letting nothing stop him from the after affects of his medical condition....but because he is just so damn funny at the self depreciating humour. You will laugh out loud genuinely at this special, his delivery and timing doesn't miss a beat and he takes back all the control his medical condition has taken from him. My hat off to you Sir for doing some great work and just being one of the best there is. I watch a lot of stand up specials and this is right up there in the top 5%. Watch and enjoy this beautiful man and laugh along with him.",False
5,8,Hilarious,ritaweavercats,n/a,16/08/2025,"No screaming or extreme cussing, just funny jokes and stories throughout the whole 53 minutes of this show. What a relief! Just came out of hospital myself, perfect stand up to watch, put me into a great mood. I first heard about Keith Robinson while watching Kevin Hart's Mark Twain Award. Finding out Robinson was one of Kevin's mentors, I knew I had to watch his stand up when I saw it advertised on Netflix. And I have to say...it did not disappoint! What an amazing individual one has to be to turn something so tragic into pure comedy! Hats off to you Mr Robinson, will be looking forward to your next stand up release.",False

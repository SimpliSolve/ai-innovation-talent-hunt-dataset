1,6,Worth watching as an update,aanth,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's a good update to the BBC documentary from a few years back.However, one thing that struck me as strange was the title. Love at First Swipe... that thing you do on Tinder. Not Grindr. Which then made me think, well what a silky mistake. But really it's not silly, it's actually quite disrespectful. Completely misunderstanding a rather relevant difference about your subject matter and heteronormalising the title to appeal to a wider audience.It probably didn't need to be 96 minutes, only about the last 30 provided interesting and new information from what's already been covered in other reports.",False
2,10,Finally a good documentary on this case!,BlueWonder12,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have followed this case since it first hit the news and I was so happy to see something being made that showed it in a detailed light.The attention to detail in this documentary is next to none, I feel like most people know about it and have seen The BBC drama and other shows on it, but this really did go above and beyond when it came to detail and speaking to people that have not been heard. I was so shocked that Stephen Port's flatmate was on here (I didn't even know he had a flatmate at the time of the killing!) and to hear stories about what he was like to live with was so creepy / interesting.I wish most other documentaries were like this, something that isn't sensationalised and a tv show that is factual and makes you think about the case after you have watched it.Well done Amazon! - keep bringing shows like this!!",False
3,10,A must watch.,morvenruthrobinson,n/a,17/08/2025,"I watched this yesterday and haven't stopped thinking about it. This shouldn't have been allowed to happen. This documentary gives the victims the justice they deserve and the families a chance to tell their side of the story. It highlights the shocking misconduct by the met police and the homophobic views they held towards the victims. Very well made, and the interviews are extremely interesting. You'll 100% learn something when you watch this documentary, very educational. Well done to all for bringing this terrible case to light. Let's hope this never ever happens again. This is a must watch.",False
4,5,Lacking,fostersclaire,n/a,17/08/2025,"Having watched this documentary I am at a loss over its intent. It didn't provide any real information that was not already available. It really digs in at the police who made mistakes, however you can see why they made the assumptions they did. The anonymous victim story, was just shameful and is the reason why lgbtq people are stereotyped and treated unjustly.There was lots of dramatic camera moments which just all seemed pointless. Like a cat playing with a mouse, what was that all about. All in all a show that just shows all the witnesses to be very foolish, and the victims families to be courageous, having to fight to prove the truth.Don't expect any new information from this.",False
5,10,A powerful documentary,qqrxxcnt,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have seen most of the documentaries regarding this case as I find it interesting. I was shocked to learn new things from this documentary that I didn't know. The way in which Port administered the drugs to these poor victims and the police reports that were uncovered and analysed. It was also very interesting watching people I have not seen in prior interviews speak - It is certainly the best documentary on the case that is out there - very detailed. A very powerful piece that shows how much these poor victims are still missed to this day, I especially liked hearing the stories that were given by the victims family members and the surviving victim.Bravo.",False
6,10,Sensitive and shocking documentary,roseandthegroove,n/a,17/08/2025,I watched this after a recommendation from a friend. I had seen a drama about this case before so didn't expect to learn much. I couldn't have been more wrong. It was so interesting right from the start. The people interviewed tell you about so many things that got missed or ignored. I felt so sad listening to their stories and hearing their frustrations. The anonymous victim was so brave to speak out and really important to hear from. He might have died if he had done things differently. It really made me think about things. The most shocking thing for me was seeing what the police had said in their investigation documents. Absolutely disgusting and more men were allowed to be murdered because of them.,False
7,10,a must watch,Marvin2320,n/a,17/08/2025,"I saw this last night and was surprised at how much it stuck with me. A very powerful film which portrays the incompetence of the police and the determination of the family members of the victims.It was easy to follow as the documentary seemed to cover most aspects, each victims segment was explained in detail from family members and witnesses to then smartly intertwine other aspects such as experts explaining the drugs and the impact they can have on you.I felt so heartbroken when the victims mother at the end said about staying safe online and that it better to be safe than sorry.All in all a very powerful film that really follows you after you watch it.",False
8,10,A Brilliant Documentary,MellySue123,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI found this documentary on Amazon one evening and decided to give it a watch. To say I was shocked would be an understatement, I cannot believe how the police could not solve this crime, I remember thinking why have they started the documentary with the 999 call of the killer and thought at first it was giving everything away but it wasn't - looking back it made me think how easy it was for the police to solve! The documentary is so easy to follow and really shows the audience that this case is one of the biggest miscarriages of justice the UK has ever seen. It goes into brilliant detail regarding each victim and I was so shocked that the same dog walker found two bodies! I have recommended this to many friends and family members and I can honestly say as a true crime buff this film is up there with some of the best I have watched - if not, the best!",True
9,10,Absolutely Amazing,robhmoreland,n/a,17/08/2025,"So so good! Never cried for basically 2 hours straight. Both emotional and angry at the same time. The Met Police are useless and homophobic, if I got arrested I'd just be treat like a gay drugged up street worker and ignored by the police. And if I died I'd be treat like a gay drugged up street worker and just 'well least thats one down.' with no evidence. Not to give too much away, to shut a scene down after someone is dead and just say he's an overdosed gay boy and think no more about it.An absolute must watch! Very well told and recreated. Tells a story I hadn't even heard about before, and would never have expected to still be happening in this day and age, and tells it perfectly.",False

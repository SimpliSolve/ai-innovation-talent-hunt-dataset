1,7,Good interviews,iwillyaeh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Each interview was interesting, honest and down to earth. There is a huge amount of experience shared by the women. Each lady comes across as smart, confident, empowered, funny and happy. What more would you want as a woman (or as a man). I especially enjoyed the last interview by Melissa. Her life story was particularly humourous and fascinating.The simplicity of the documentary was refreshing. It didn't need anything fancy because the interviews were so strong by themselves. Maybe a better title would have suited though as this was about far more than fetishism I think.I'd imagine that it would be enjoyed by anyone with an open mind and the time to savour. Well done to all involved.",False

1,8,A beautiful journey,rbferre,n/a,16/08/2025,"The 80's were great for Brazilian rock n' roll and The Paralamas do Sucesso were one of the most successful bands of that era. This documentary includes footage since their early days in 1981. 40 years later those inseparable friends are still providing the soundtrack of young at heart South American people with their idealistic and rebel yet romantic songs.The documentary introduces the fourth member, Zé Fortes, who has been managing Herbert Vianna, Bi Ribeiro and João Barone through those forty years.Nice songs, friendship and a bit of how they faced adversity and tragedy.8/10 as I just wished it got a bit more into their personalities.",False
2,9,Perfect,RosanaBotafogo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alternately watching the two documentaries that are leaving Netflix this week without knowing that they were about the same topic,Os Quatro Paralamas (2020)andA Farra do Circo (2014), which portrays the band's beginnings in the flying circus, even more so as a circus was a Freshman show that once took place in Lapa...Lots of good music, from Brazilian Pop Rock, alternated with interviews with several important characters for the band, old interviews, a show from the beginning of their career, all wonderfully nostalgic.Documentary about the career of the band Paralamas do Sucesso, with archive images of their 37 years on the road by the film's director Roberto Berliner.",False

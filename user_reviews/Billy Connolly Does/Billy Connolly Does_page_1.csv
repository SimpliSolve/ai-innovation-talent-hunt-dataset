1,10,Glorious!!!,imdb-14479-93021,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely glorious! I cried with laughter and my heart burst with love for Billy all the way through my 6 episode binge. Exhausted, but I would watch another 6 now if they were there to watch. I've always loved Billys way of looking at the world - he makes it a wonderous, magical, and at the same time, hilarious place to be.",False
2,2,End with dignity.,Foxtrot-Alpha777,n/a,16/08/2025,"The problem is that I like Billy Connolly's work, I would consider myself a fan of his stand up when he was in his prime but unfortunately this has long since past.There seems to be a smack of desperation in these shows, the lack of original material and all the edginess that we loved him for has dulled over time into something rather lame, predictable and unfortunately unfunny.There's a time in someone's career when you have to admit that it's over, sorry Billy you need to know it's your time to retire and be remembered for your good work and not these forgettable ramblings. You don't need the money so retire gracefully with your dignity intact.I know this won't impress the die hard fans but it's the truth.",False

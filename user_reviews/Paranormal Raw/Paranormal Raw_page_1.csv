1,10,Absolutely disgusting!!!,d-88471,n/a,16/08/2025,"Now my heading has your attention I'd like to start by saying I'm appalled by they extremely low rating! I can not believe how many bad reviews have been added with no write up or reasons for it! To me personally it seems like a bit of an attempt to end this show before it's begun.My family and I sat and thoroughly enjoyed this show and are hopeful there will be more. To see a team work so we'll together and have such passion for what they do is fantastic. I sincerely hope that this show, the paranormal normal team and the production team can get the recognition they deserve.Well done to all involved. My family and I look forward to see more of you in the coming months. Good luck with all future investigations. What a team! You're a 10/10 for us.",False
2,7,Entertaining stuff,goreteornelas,n/a,16/08/2025,"I throughly enjoyed this I watched it with my son as he's the Paranormal enthusiast.I was pleasantly surprised, it sent chills down my spine at times and wasn't cheesey like most shows of this genre tend to be.You can tell they weren't actors they were genuine people with actual research and knowledge of what they do.I for one hope it continues and is a great success, Because as I said this was fresh and intriguing, And that's coming from someone who is a bit of a sceptic when it comes to the Paranormal.And I think calling it Raw was the right choice no camera tricks, no dodgy sound effects or screams.",False
3,10,Fantastic Watch,ryanswift-73087,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Recently had the chance to watch this on holiday, and was blown away with what I watched . I really dont understand the low reviews which have been logged as the programme I watched certainly didnt justify a low star rating? It was really well produced and the people in it seem genuine and really know their stuff. I love how passionate they were. It does not feel at all fake and you get the feel of genuine emmotion throughout it all. I hope this takes off and we get to see it in the UK with more episodes. To all the people in this episode, please ignore the haters and keep on doing the good work, and I just hope we all get to see more of it.",False
4,7,Wowsers,blu_dragn1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have a fondness and interest in the paranormal, It has always intrigued and fascinated me.Most of the shows I've tried to watch in the past have relied on jump scares with bad actors screaming like lunatics,
This however doesn't follow that same formula you can see they are actual real people that have a passion for what they are doing,
It's dark, informative, intriguing, and very far from cheese,
I hope this pilot episode leads to more fantastic locations and more Historical information.Being a Londoner myself I'd like to know more about this fascinating city I live in and the stories that have not been told.I highly recommend giving this a try if you like the paranormal and the history of London.",False
5,10,Excellent viewing!,ads_email,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well what can I say?!?! Paranormal Raw took me on a different sort of supernatural investigation compared to what I am used to... this felt more realistic and those on the team seemed to know their stuff. It was great hearing the British accents and I hope future episodes investigate some famous London supernatural sights. Something haunting about Victorian London/ England and some of the world famous characters from that era. Really appreciated the upfrontness with the audience and not trying to fake the fear or events. Paranormal Raw is a great name as it is exactly what the show is. I want more UK, come on!",False
6,7,Great Stuff,missjoanned,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an amazing show on paranormal, it's refreshing to see real people, Not actors with really bad screams and attitude, And it's educational too, I'd really like to visit the UK especially London, Also always been intrigued with the Paranormal.I really liked the history element and the fact this team does proper research, I really hope they do more episodes as that was a very very good pilot. I will also be visiting that place once I eventually vist London England.I would highly recommend watching this show if you have any interest in the Paranormal.Will be interesting to see the other locations they go to.",False
7,10,Fantastic work!,kieranward-85481,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been following this out is paranormal team for quite a few years now and I am very happy to see how far they have come since becoming a fan of them. They deserve to have this success and I am hoping this introduces them to a wider audience as they put in a lot of work to what they do. I have always been a major fan of the paranormal world, and maybe it's the thrill of getting scared that secretly excites me. So if you like being scared a little or a lot, go for Paranormal Raw!Please give yourself a chance to watch this if you are into everything paranormal as you won't be disappointed. Don't forget to look out for their special guest, and turn your lights off when you watch!",False
8,10,10/ 10 - RAW and REAL!,simonrichardson-98765,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wowsers! I've had an interest in paranormal tv shows for a while but I have to say this show is a cut above the rest! I really like that they don't rely on silly jump scares or fake bumps and bangs - but that they rely on genuine skills, experiences and passions about the other world! I wish I could watch more right now! The cast are relatable and I very quickly felt interested in all involved. The episode took me on a 'paranormal' journey - of which I want to go on again and again! I don't normally take the time to write reviews but I genuinely enjoyed every minute and can't wait for more! :)",False
9,9,Outstanding!!!,Threedegrees92,n/a,16/08/2025,I love paranormal based things and all things UK based so to my surprise I get this fusion of both. I loved that we get to see everything upfront in action. I love that it goes into detail with all the thing's happening to each individual and the use of scientific equipment to back their findings. Plus you also can't go wrong when a Sugababe makes guest appearance. Plus we get ouija board scene that will give you goosebumps. The only down fall is the sound is on the low side so I had to have my tv volume all the way up. I highly recommend and I hope we get more exploring other haunted locations across the UK.,False
10,10,Really enjoyed this,sabrinawashington-06067,n/a,16/08/2025,"So my friend in London told me I need to check out this new ghost investigation program that has come out over here in the states. I watched it no more than a few hours ago and yet I've already watched it again! It's got something special, really feels genuine and just a really great watch. I can't think there's anything here to not like and enjoy saying that there are some low star reviews. I am really surprised because there is genuinely nothing to dislike about this program. The cast are brilliant. The location is excellent storyline is Claire and I feel like they are all talented and are showcasing their skills.",False
11,9,Decent,ritafordford,n/a,16/08/2025,"What can I say? This is the sort of TV show That's right up my street. I knew from the title alone that I would enjoy, and I wasn't disappointed or let down! Unlike other reality, ghost hunting TV shows this one had something authentic about it, and although they were not scared a minute, it still kept me hooked the whole way through. There is something special about ghost hunting in Britain for me, I don't know if it's the accents or the history of the city, but I am always intrigued. If you are into ghost shows I would 100% recommend the show. Watch it now you won't be disappointed! I am looking forward to the next part! Bring it on.",False
12,9,Bloody brilliant!,whatnowboys,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ghost hunting? Check. A cast know what they're doing? Check. Perfect location? Check. Reality without the fake scripted reality? Check.Jump straight in and give this show a go! Do you have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain if you fancy a realistic ghost hunt in the historical city of London, England. The accents are enough to keep me watching, but I also felt really invested in the storyline. This show is unlike other ghost shows where they rely on fake/ scripted scares, which, in all honesty, cheapens those sort of shows for me. This show might not of had a jump a minute scenes, but it had something else, a realism that money cannot buy! #WatchNow.",False
13,8,Great viewing,blackasnight-02716,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't really know what I would find watching Paranormal Raw but I I certainly wasn't expecting to find a TV show that I would be so glued to! These folk need to get another show going, and this time focus on stuff linked to Jack the Ripper! London is such a history of crazy past and there is a load of stuff to be unpacked, and this is definitely the ghost hunting group to do so! I am into most things paranormal and I don't watch it to be scared, I watch it with pure interest in the hope that I can learn something new and find other peoples experiences as an interest. This was a great watch.",False
14,9,British TV at it's Best!,asjhashawna,n/a,16/08/2025,"Travelling all over the world I have to say there is no place like London England. The accent takes me back to an amazing time in my life, writing articles for newspaper columns and magazines all about the other side. Seeing this show appear, I felt instantly drawn in and had to watch. Gratefully, I was not disappointed, but in fact was taken back to a time and a set of experiences Where I had the time of my life. This is an amazing team, and having a Sugababe on board was a bonus! This is great viewing, and you should all give it a go, if you get the chance! When I am next in London, I fully intend on catching up with some of these cast members!",False

16,10,Amazing,olivia-65335,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched it after a recommendation from my friend and was a bit skeptical after seeing the reviews online but I was very pleasantly surprised by this show!This is one of the most genuine paranormal programmes that I've seen. The cast really connected with everyone well and it almost felt like I was experiencing it at home. As many other people have pointed out, it definitely doesn't gimmicky like other shows under the same genre.Im really looking forward for the future episodes and I can't wait to see what this show brings in the future! I definitely think everyone should give it a chance before judging it just by some of the reviews.",False
17,10,Gripping/ Interesting,melblatt,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the pleasure of a being sent the link to Paranormal Raw and it being recommended to me by a friend in London (where I am from). I enjoyed every second. It took me home and reminded me of the history of London which is world renowned; one episode isn't enough we need more to really get to see what this team is made of and I can tell you that there is so much in London worth investigating/ visiting. I'd like to join a show in the future and get an upfront experience. Really think that this sort of Paranormal investigation is the way forward, it adds a quality to this world of Tv which unfortunately is sometimes lacking,",False
18,8,"Spooky, spooky!",klotty-71003,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely riveting viewing from start to finish. I absolutely love a ghost hunting reality TV show and this one is just as good as anything else out there on the market.It was nice to see some fresh faces and some fresh locations being looked at and also doing ghost hunts in a different manner I felt connected to the show pretty instantly and watch the whole way through without feeling bored or confused. I would definitely recommend this TV show to those who enjoy ghosts, reality TV or just something entertaining on television! I really do look forward to the next instalments and hope that I don't have to wait too long.",False
19,10,Best thing I've seen in a while!,catherinehurley-62177,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this as sometimes shows with this content can be cheesy but it was absolutely brilliant! I LOVED it. I've seen lots of paranormal shows and they don't always hit the mark, however this show did not disappoint. It was really great to see a different spin on a ghost/paranormal show. I'm also a huge Sugababes fan and the added bonus of having Mutya in it just added to its appeal.It was so well made, you could see how much time and effort was put in and it really took me on a journey. Perfect title for the show as it felt raw and real. Can't wait to see if they make another series!!",False
20,10,Not usually a fan of this kind of thing!,m-04713,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, my other half wanted to watch Paranormal Raw as it's his kind of thing not mine. I wasn't sure but gave it a ago anyway and you know what I think I'd watch them again. Not really what I thought it would be like. He wasn't sure with it being new but was really impressed. It's definitely worth a watch. Even if you're not normally interested. It might change your thoughts on shows of this kind. We will definitely be watching any more episodes they do just to see if it's as good as the first. Well done on starting to change my mind. I never thought I'd actually like watching paranormal investigations but this team have left me intrigued and wanting to see more.",False
21,10,Paranormal Raw is ace,simonrichardson-36837,n/a,16/08/2025,Having lived in London for a few years I already followed this paranormal investigation team but after moving back to the States it wasn't as easy so happy to watch Paranormal Raw and be reunited with such a great team doing what they do best!!!!From start to end I was hooked and it has absolutely left me wanting more. If you are into real paranormal shows then you should check this show out 100%. It is different to other shows from the same genre but I'd say it is so much better than the other things out there. Give it a go. You won't regret it. Can't wait for more! Takes me back to London and the best investigation team I know!,False
22,10,Quality viewing,wesleyedwards-89929,n/a,16/08/2025,"A couple of friends have told me to watch this show over the last week or so and tonight I finally got round to doing so. At first I was a little unsure because to be honest, I don't like go shows where they put fake screams and sound effects in, however quickly, I realise this was the real deal, and none of that silly stuff was involved!Those on the screen felt very genuine, I was interested by the story and watched minute by minute, wondering what was going to happen next. I'm really looking forward to some future instalments and hope that I don't have to wait too long for that to happen! Paranormal raw was a riveting experience, one which I hope to have again soon!",False

24,10,Gripping,sidbenham61,n/a,16/08/2025,This was compelling viewing. It was absolutely brilliant. Had me hooked from start to finish. I really hope there is more to come. So brilliantly executed. London is the perfect setting for this with it's history but I hope that we will see more from around the country. So much better than some of the fake paranormal stuff that's out there. You become so connected with the team and can really feel their energy from the very beginning right through to the end. How soon will we be able to see more from this team? If you haven't watched anything like this before there is no better way to start than with Paranormal Raw!!,False
25,10,Absolutely original viewing,spicer-77179,n/a,16/08/2025,"So a few days ago, a friend recommended me this program, knowing that I love ghost stories and I have a fascination with London England. Watching the episode I was instantly attached to all of the cast. The journey they go on in that short time is excellent, and I know that I would have watched more and more had it been available. I really appreciated the fact that there was no silliness, no face creams, no pretence. I like the real relationships and the real life expertise being shared on the show. I really hope there is more to come as I for one would be tuning in. It is such an excellent thing to get to say London in this light.",False

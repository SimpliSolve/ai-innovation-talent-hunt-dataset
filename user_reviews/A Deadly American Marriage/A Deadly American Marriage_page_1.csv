1,8,"The Court ruled as if it's ""We Said, They Said""",ArianaS-77,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary had weaved a strong narrative from the start, choosing to show us all the interview videos since the beginning, including the children's. That's a good perspective to be shown, as the children's words were justified as coached, explaining the events not in their own words. I find it hard to believe that a regular 10 year-old boy would say something like 'he has physically and verbally abused my... he has physically and verbally abused my mom', stammered at that.It surprised me that we were shown all the people involved, as usually some documentaries have people that 'declined to comment', especially the alleged murderers. Everything seemed on the right track in the first half of the documentary, then it spiraled.I was honestly willing to give a chance to the Martens' defense, to see their side of the story, only to find that it went more and more unreliable.The way Molly was obsessed with the children was quite disturbing. In the first trial, it was said that Molly had unreliable narrative as she told a lot of lies; that she gave birth to Sarah herself, or she was best friends with Megs and the children's godmother on her wedding day, however, it wasn't presented at the second trial.What frustrated me the most was the outrageous accusation from the Martens that Jason had unalived his first wife through 'manual strangulation', although the autopsy has cleared that wasn't the case. There was no mark on her neck.Yet the attorney said that strangulation wasn't matter of what breaks outside the skin, but inside? Was the court and justice system mad? How can strangulation be effective if the perpetrator didn't exert force and with such force, how can it leave no trace on the skin? Make it makes sense.The Martens have little to no bruise, abrasion, or any damage that night. The first photo of Molly came out with blood on her face can easily be seen gone during her interrogation with the police, meaning that it wasn't even her blood. Thomas said that Jason was trying to get the bat back and swung it to him, yet no bruise or whatsoever?It was quite chilling that the Martens' attorney made it possible that the second trial was a back and forth 'we said, they said'. As if there was no solid evidence.Collusion was definitely there as it was stated that Thomas, due to his past service as an FBI agent, should get lesser sentencing. While in my logic, an ex-law enforcement officer certainly aware of the loop in the justice system, have vast connections, and immense authoritative power due to the strict top-bottom command system, so that if they are in any way caught in a crime, they should be given more scrutiny or even double sentencing.Disappointing. Brilliant story telling though.",True
2,7,Poor Jason,warzonem,n/a,16/08/2025,"An FBI agent who trained others to detect lies. His daughter, a model who lied for a living. And yet again, she lied, this time claiming her husband abused her. How do you verify such a claim? By trusting the liars.I was genuinely disturbed by how convincingly she played the victim. Having known people like this in real life, those who lie so thoroughly they start to believe it themselves, this hit especially hard. It's a chilling reminder of how dangerous manipulation can be.Surprisingly solid work from Netflix, especially given their recent track record with documentaries. And thank God it wasn't dragged out into three unnecessary episodes.",False
3,7,I am so tired of such horrible people,Remmuchan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOnce again, murderers are let free for NO REASON AT ALL. This documentary made me so angry. The brutality of the murder is unreal and made me sick to my stomach. That woman who did it is literally insane. And now she's free. Of course she is. Her and her crocodile tears. I wish I never watched this documentary. This world has become an unbearable place where evil people are just left to do whatever they want to unpunished. Makes me truly lose hope in humanity. I also got so annoyed at this documentary defending her so much. I'm sorry to those kids who had to suffer through this. May they get justice one day. Go to hell, Molly.",True
4,7,Messed Up Manipulative Molly,nesskimo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a difficult watch and I feel so much for Jack and Sarah. They should feel some comfort knowing they did all they could to restore their Father's reputation and they did him proud. Quite early on, the one thing that became apparent to me was that Molly was only interested in having those children. Alarm bells are ringing, and this movie adequately supported the evidence of a manipulative, messed up girl masquerading as a stable mother figure.In terms of the arguments about asthma death, I am an asthmatic, and I have woken in the middle of the night gasping, thinking I might die. To say it is scary is an understatement.This is a tragic story, even more so because manipulators do not suddenly stop manipulating. It wouldn't surprise me if someone else falls victim to Molly.",False
5,n/a,The investigation is INCOMPLETE,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis investigation is clearly incomplete.So many obvious missing puzzles.Why wasn't there more light shed on Molly's mother? Did she know about all these but chose to turn a deaf ear? Or maybe it wasn't the first time of Molly Physically assaulting Jason.In all the audio recordings, there was ABSOLUTELY NONE, where he laid hands on her. Because If there was, I'm pretty sure you and I know that's what she'd have presented first as concrete evidence of her defending herself.If only Jason could see his beautiful children, they are growing up so well.This is very sad. Very very sad. Two murderers walking away freely.",True
6,6,A shocking failure of the justice system,DanielRoof,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""A Deadly American Marriage"" reveals a horrifying flaw in the justice system. Despite overwhelming evidence pointing to Molly's manipulative and malicious intent, she manages to avoid real consequences.The series lays bare how easily truth can be distorted in court. No matter what preceded the act, Jason was brutally murdered by two people using a brick and a baseball bat. That kind of violence should lead to justice-not freedom.It's deeply disturbing that such individuals can walk free while the victim's voice is forever silenced. This documentary leaves you angry, shaken, and questioning the very system meant to protect us.",True
7,6,Vile people,Michele7169,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerAbsolutely cannot stand women like this! She is no victim. The series does a good job showing story from all points of view. But we will never truly know the damage this woman did to those sweet kids and their family. The interview and 911 call was important to show.. so glad they did.. smirks and lack of injuries and all. Everyone will have their own opinion. Mine is that you really CANT just believe all women. Jury got it right!! It was wonderful to be able to hear stories from Jason's family. Happy his children were able to share their story. Especially because they actually lived through this nightmare.,True
8,6,Many unanswered questions.,isabelleplasschaert,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter watching this documentary, I was left with more questions than answers. If the woman had so many recording devices around the house and in the car, why was only one short clip shown - where the man got mildly angry? There was no real proof that he was a violent domestic abuser. One of the investigators even pointed out that because she knew she was being recorded, she could easily have edited her own words, or provoked him to get a reaction that would sound worse on tape.The story also glossed over the blood at the crime scene. Was it ever properly tested? I assume it was all his, since neither the daughter nor the father appeared to be injured - but why such a brutal and excessive attack? What exactly happened that night?Another big question: where was her mother in all of this? She was supposedly in the house but then completely vanished from the story. That part felt unresolved and conveniently omitted.One of the most confusing elements was the testimony of his children. After their father's murder, they admitted they were told to lie when they were very young. Then in a later interview, they confirmed that they had lied. But when the case went back to court, it suddenly felt like the narrative shifted again - now the father was a domestic abuser again? The children had already said those claims were false, so which version are we supposed to believe?To me, the whole case didn't make sense. The documentary left me feeling like the Martins got off far too lightly.",True
9,7,"A good documentary, but left too many questions unanswered.",VeggieVader,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't even know where to start. Just look at the crime scene and the brutality of that murder. Self defense does not make you bash someone's head in that bad.I never believed anything that Molly or Tom said, especially Molly. She is a manipulative liar and an awful person. Sitting there, with her crocodile tears, saying how she is the victim! Jason and his kids are the real victims here! And Tom was as cold as the deepest ice in Antarctica.Why did they not question Molly's mother more? She was asleep when the murder took place and she said that she heard ""something"" but fell back to sleep. Considering the brutality of the murder that took place I doubt that. She probably knows more about what happened.And then we have the audio recordings from the hidden devices that Molly placed around the house. All you could ever hear on those recordings were Molly and Jason arguing and discussing, like EVERY couple do. Not a single time did we hear Jason abusing Molly. And why did we get to hear so little from these recordings? Maybe because there was nothing more to hear, because Molly is a liar.I feel so sorry for Jack and Sarah and I hope they get real justice one day. I can't believe these two murderers get to walk free when the evidence is so clear. Shame on the justice system.A good documentary, but left too many questions unanswered.",False
10,10,DRSABCD DARVO,edwin-wks,n/a,16/08/2025,"""I can't tell"" was what Tom Martens told the 911 operator when they asked him if Jason Corbett was still breathing. Later, he and his daughter, Molly, Jason's wife, can be heard attempting or feigning an attempt to perform CPR on Corbett's unresponsive body. Checking for signs of breathing precedes CPR. ""I can't tell"" implies either he didn't care to check whether Corbett was still breathing or he already knew that Corbett was dead.Very rarely in true crime documentaries do we get to see an even portrayal of both sides of the story. No one involved had ""declined to comment"" and it felt very much like witnessing a live trial where cases of the defense and prosecution are being presented as we the audience watch on like a member of the jury. In this sense, this documentary succeeds in allowing you to form your own opinion about the truth surrounding the death of Jason Corbett - was he the victim or the aggressor who was killed in self-defense?A few things stood out to me. Tom's coldness and detachment when discussing the death of his son-in-law, and his smirk that was captured at the police station. Molly's unwavering focus on herself and her image as the mother of Jack and Sarah, speaking of them as if she was their birth mother, as well as the abject absence of any remorse or horror towards her husband's death, even if he was abusive according to her. After all, she admitted to striking him in the head with a brick.Jack and Sarah were more reliable narrators, especially when they each expressed sadness and guilt over their initial statements to the authorities at the tender ages at 9 and 7 respectively, that portrayed their father as having a temper and abusive towards Molly; these statements were later retracted when they concluded that they had been groomed by Molly. The defense attorneys homed in on medical notes that indicated Jason reporting ""getting angry for no reason"", while ignoring the bigger picture that Jason had hypothyroidism and hadn't been taking his medication for seven months. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain, fatigue, depression and irritability.DARVO is Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender; Molly gave a masterclass of this here. A real victim of coercive control wouldn't dare to risk their abuser finding a recording device, let alone plant several at various locations in the home and in the car. Molly saying ""I was the mother to the Jack and Sarah that existed in another lifetime"" also informed me that she never truly cared for the children. She only saw them as extensions of herself as she basked in title of Mother and wanted them so that she could continue her charade. But Jason would not allow her to be their adoptive mother and wanted to return to Ireland with Jack and Sarah. That was the motive.",False
11,6,"Heartbreaking Story, Questionable Truths",kez5123,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA Deadly American Marriage tells the heartbreaking true story of Jason Corbett, an Irish father of two who was killed in 2015 by his wife, Molly Martens, and her father, a former FBI agent. The pair claimed self-defense, alleging Jason was abusive-but tragically, he wasn't alive to defend himself. Even more unsettling was the claim made years later that Jason may have been responsible for his first wife's death-a posthumous accusation that felt deeply unfair and inappropriate.The whole case is devastating, but the documentary leaves viewers struggling to trust anyone involved. Every character seemed to be hiding something. Molly's secret recordings and videos to present herself as a good mother felt premeditated and manipulative. It also didn't sit right that Jason's sister wrote a book about the situation, which came across as a way to profit from an incredibly painful and unresolved family tragedy.And when Jason's son reached out to Molly years later, she reportedly exposed him publicly rather than responding with any care-only adding to the feeling that no one in this story acted with full integrity.The judge ultimately gave a light sentence, stating the situation was too difficult to unravel-but that outcome didn't feel like justice. It's a deeply sad story, but the overwhelming lack of trust and accountability from every side left a bitter aftertaste.",True
12,8,Martens Family - Pure Evil,MuffRichardson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""A Deadly American Marriage"" is less a true crime documentary and more a window into one of the most grotesque miscarriages of justice in recent memory. Watching this film is like being forced to relive a nightmare - not only the brutal killing of Jason Corbett, but the appalling aftermath, where the killers were allowed to spin a narrative so thin and manipulative, it's hard to believe a courtroom ever entertained it.Thomas and Molly Martens - father and daughter - claim self-defense, but the facts paint a different picture. Jason was asleep in his bed, unarmed. He was bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat and a paving brick, in what can only be described as a calculated, frenzied attack. The documentary presents damning evidence, yet the system still failed to deliver real justice.The Martens family come across not as grieving victims, but as cold, calculating manipulators - crafting a story of fear and abuse that was never substantiated, all while smearing the memory of a man who can no longer speak for himself. And worst of all, they succeeded in cutting his children off from their entire Irish family - a chilling reminder of how the powerful can twist the truth and get away with murder.The fact that they served less than five years is beyond belief. This documentary may offer a glimpse of what happened, but no film could ever capture the deep injustice, the heartbreak, and the pure evil of the Martens family. A disgrace to the justice system - and a haunting story that deserves so much more outrage.",True
13,7,Sometimes the guilty ones get away,abirzenith,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was an intense watch. From the very beginning you question a lot of things but as the story unfolds you realize that there were so many obvious things overlooked or ignored by the state.It is an unfortunate tale that shows the power of manipulation, connection and media. The children did not get the justice they deserved, but at least through this documentary all of us can see how vile Martens family was and still are. This story should serve as a lesson to all of us in being more careful, making more calm decisions and making sure our children remember the truth and have a safety net to fall onto if the time ever comes.",True
14,5,Injustice,turlingtonkendall,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI watched the documentary and found it indubitably abhorrent that a man rendered completely defenceless by a drug (that Molly marten had prescribed to her a week previously) was beaten to a pulp by two maniacs with brick and a baseball bat. A premeditated heinous attack that left him annihilated with brain matter and blood splatter throughout the bedroom.This woman was obsessed with adopting his children and seeking full control over them. He clearly knew that she was unstable and unfit as he continuously declined to allow her adopt his children. She tried to set him up with recordings and assassinate his character. She gaslit and indoctrinated his children to protect her from prosecution.The American justice failed Jason Corbett and his children on a grand scale. His can this woman and her father be freed from a 20-30 year prison sentences for such a horrific and barbaric murder that all evidence proves that both were guilty of murder.,True
15,7,They weren't YOUR children!,jonidawson77,n/a,16/08/2025,"I noted that Molly was consistently calling Jack and Sarah, ""my kids"", causing me to scream at the TV screen, ""they weren't YOUR kids!"". Molly's intention is obvious in this statement. She was going to do whatever was necessary to get Sarah and Jack, even manipulating her father to be the co-executioner.I'm still not sure of the involvement of Molly's mother. She's mentioned briefly and I kept waiting for something else to be revealed but nothing mentioned of any consequence.It breaks your heart to watch these kids being emotionally tortured over so many years and I only hope they can find some peace in their true home in Ireland.",False
16,n/a,"The Credits Roll, But the Injustice Stays",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's not pretend. A Deadly American Marriage isn't just a true crime story - it's a front-row seat to one of many shameless failures of the American justice system.Jason Corbett was a father, a husband, and a man trying to rebuild his life after tragedy. What he didn't know is that he married into his own death sentence. His wife, Molly, along with her father - a retired FBI agent, who should've known better... and probably did - didn't just kill him. They ambushed him. Beat him to death in cold blood in his own bedroom. A man unarmed, defenseless, and unaware.Their excuse? ""Self-defense"".The reality? Cold-blooded murder.And yet, even with a conviction for second-degree murder, the system bent over backwards for them - A retrial. A new spin. And suddenly, both walked free after a plea deal. Time served. That's it.Jason got a grave. They got to walk.But here's where it gets truly repulsive: they had the audacity to participate in this film. To sit down for interviews, deliver their lines like actors on a press tour, and peddle the same debunked narrative with crocodile tears. Watching them speak - calm, smug, calculated - felt like being gaslit in real time.Sickening.The entitlement it takes to kill a man and then parade around as the victim? That's not just manipulative - that's sociopathic.And the true horror isn't even the murder itself. It's what happened after. The courts handed the killers a second chance - the same one Jason was never given. Meanwhile, his children were left orphaned, traumatized, and forced to watch the people who killed their father play ""misunderstood martyrs"".This isn't a perfect film, but it's a necessary one. It tells a story that must be told. Not just about murder, but about power, manipulation, and the haunting truth that in America, justice is often for sale.Jason Corbett deserved better.His children deserved better.We all deserve a justice system that doesn't confuse ""influence"" with ""innocence"".A Deadly American Marriage carries a powerful message that lingers long after the credits roll.",True
17,6,Spoilers,sarahkleames,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJack and Sarah are amazing children, well behaved, intelligent and articulate. They film well, however they are children, with brains that aren't fully formed yet, and I feel like the producers fed off this and used them to their advantage. Jason's family is so focused on getting justice, and his murder is completely gruesome and premeditated, however the family of Jason never comments on how abusive Jason was with the evidence of how he treated his second wife in those recorded tapes. They chose to focus on his being a victim and ignored the facts they didn't like.There is no doubt in my mind that Molly and Martin planned this murder together. I don't think they thought it would get as bad as it did, they hadn't fully thought it out, Martin was panicking over protecting his daughter, and Molly was too busy obsessing over what she thought was protecting the children but it came off as ownership and stalker like. They were probably too busy thinking with the dinosaur brain and not rationally thinking things through.",True
18,7,A murdered father on trial,timothybidmead,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a good, balanced documentary. Molly and her father are the only ones speaking to their own character (nobody else was available to go on film to support their narrative?), the victim's entire family are on record supporting him - including the parents of his first wife.Another case of a man apparently deserving to die a brutal death at the hands of 2 other people. The two people apparently acting in self defence without a scratch on them? (Let's ignore the tiny mark the lawyers referenced as evidence of strangulation without a single other mark on her neck nor bruising).The secret recordings of his ""abuse"" were nothing more than a marital argument, and that's when she knew they were being recorded and that's the evidence of abuse she was able to drum up to support bludgeoning him death? Him moaning that she ate without him?A man bludgeoned to death and society's apparent responsibility is to drag his name through the mud, drag his kids through hell, drag his family through hell and release this people from prison.Jason died at the hands of a man and a woman, she wasn't a helpless victim fighting for her life she was a scorned woman trying to take his kids away from him; she and her father outnumbered Jason and brutally beat him to death before embarking on quest of defamation and self-victimisation.At least the kids she wanted cast her aside where she belongs.",True
19,7,Important examples of injustice,DaydreamingBeyond,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI want to first say that I'm glad the film crew showed the two versions. I think it's very obvious based on the FULL evidence, common sense, etc. What happened to poor Jason. Molly is a sad woman, that has serious mental health issues. My heart goes out to Jason's kids, family, and friends. It's sad to see how blatantly easy it is for people to lie and manipulate situations enough to get away with the worst things. Especially people with connections to government or law enforcement of any kind. Molly's dad is obviously a skilled liar, but not good enough to beat the very obvious evidence and very clear motive she had.The justice system itself is deeply flawed, and is long over due for change. I personally watched my own abuser get away with severe crimes against me that left me with permanent injuries and mental health issues. Being disabled on limited income I couldn't afford a lawyer. He only got 2 months in jail for all that he did, because he plead no contest and swore to go to treatment. I found out later he was a repeat offender on record, too, and had hurt other women. He never went to the treatment, then violated the restraining order I have on him, and is out there with a warrant and still preying on other women, as well as still being a danger to me.This documentary just reminds me of all the messed up loop holes that can be used in our justice systems. I mean, just look at how much terrible crap our politicians are getting away with in the US. It's so sad to me that these people have been shaped this way. I only hope that more focus will be given to raising our youth better and providing better identification methods and treatments for mental health issues. Maybe one day humanity can evolve into something better than before.",True
20,7,Needs subtitles,starlight_kimberleya,n/a,16/08/2025,"Solid documentary but it needs subtitles. Im not a person who ever has subtitles on but the interviews in the police station were pretty much impossible to understand with them on due to the echo in the room. I don't know why this wasn't picked up when editing and automatically put on just the interview room scenes. Netflix are usually pretty good at doing this when things are difficult to hear.Other than that is was good, interesting story and nice to get a new documentary on Netflix. More please! Idaho 5, toy box killer, lively vs Baldoni, interviews in prison with newer well known killers like Chris watts etc..",False
21,9,American embarassment,diana_s_5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe viciousness of the murder was disgusting with very little to no wounds on the Martens. And we didn't see the autopsy photos thank god. Hitting him when he is already down or falling. This is compelling evidence that tells the tale when people lie so much. And I would argue the statements, taping, lies and demeanor also point pretty clearly to back up the crime scene.Gosh - the majority of Americans are kind and friendly like the community there in Meadowlands. But this absence of morality, lying and ability to bend the system with money and or position has become frequent and successful. We need to fight it and get back to what we use to be and the majority of folks here in the USA really are but have been under a crumbling of our society.Good documentaries shed a light on this. Well done!",True
22,8,First review!,may12th,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI honestly can't wrap my head around how messed up the American justice system is! How can 2 people beat a man to death, crush his skull, and still be out there living free like nothing happened? It's insane!They didn't just kill Jason, they took him away from his kids, and then had the nerve to drag his name through the mud even after he was gone!And Molly? She planted listening devices all over the house, which means that her intentions were shady from the start. She turned the kids against their dad, kept lying left and right, and then acted all emotional! And the crazy part is that the system actually believed her. Unreal!!The part that hit me the hardest was Jack and Sarah. Those kids didn't deserve any of this. They lost their mom first, then their dad in the worst way, and later, they were betrayed by the woman they trusted and considered their mom!A great, heartbreaking movie that proves justice doesn't always win.",True
23,6,It was alright,phantasmlady,n/a,16/08/2025,"Found A Deadly American Marriage very interesting, especially hearing the story from both sides. It's hard to imagine how difficult it must be for the families involved. What stood out to me most was how strongly the documentary leaned toward the victim's side of the story-or maybe that's exactly what it wanted us to feel. I'm not sure if that was intentional, but it made me question the balance of the narrative.The documentary was overall well-made, with good pacing and interviews that kept me engaged. However, they showed a lot of images from the crime scene, which felt like too much at times. While the storytelling was solid, something about hearing from both sides didn't feel fully neutral. It seemed like the documentary leaned more toward one side, not gonna lie.In the end, I'd say it's worth watching if you enjoy true crime documentaries. It's an interesting take and offers a new way of presenting crime stories, but keep in mind it might not be as balanced as it seems.",False
24,4,Absolutely Abhorrent and Vile,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"That Molly, Tom and their horrible excuse for an attorney were allowed to point blank LIE regarding Mags is so appalling and quite honestly, grotesque.The prosecution for this debacle couldn't have been more incompetent- they didn't even bother to call Mags' family in Ireland to testify! After presenting such an horrific case the first time, he caved completely and gave these two monsters an ridiculous plea deal for next to no time after what can only be described as the most grisly, gruesome annihilation of an human being most have witnessed.And then you have these two adorable children, through no fault of their own, are now smack in the middle of a child's worst nightmare- no parents remaining, having experienced and witnessed this hideous tragedy, and then having to struggle through being forced to endure living with people to whom they had no blood relation and all this after their father had so thoughtfully designated appropriate caregivers for them in the chance something awful befell him. Little could he have imagined the worst imaginable would pale in comparison to the actuality.There's far too much air given to these monsters, and not nearly as much time spent delving into what horrible creatures this entire family is, and how manipulated the victim was and how poorly Molly treated him and his children.",False
25,6,A point of focus,DougRates,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere's a story in the Bible of 2 women fighting over the same boy they're both claiming is their son. The king wisely says cut the boy in half and give half to each. The fake mom was satisfied but the real mother was horrified and pleaded for her son to go to the other mother if that will spare his life.If Molly was really the caring mother she claimed she would'nt have put those poor kids through a second trial even if it frees her and her dads name. Just seems very clear to me that she did it, Tom although I doubt planned it, helped cover it up at the very least and has forced himself to believe the lie he had to to save her life.",True

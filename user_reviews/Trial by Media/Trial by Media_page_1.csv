1,6,"Like many have noted, the Media isn't really the focus",willwatch,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerInteresting cases but too often, the focus seems on the lawyers. A handful of TV and print reporters pop up along with video clips of each case. I was expecting a fuller look at the cases through the lens of the journalists covering them, and some critiquing of what they got right/ what they got wrong/ how they would cover it differently looking back.",True
2,7,Could have been great,Kethina,n/a,16/08/2025,"This could have been a great docuseries because of the concept of it, but I feel like they fell short on delivering what was promised all in all. They didn't dive in to the media's involvement in a majority of the episodes, but rather showed how some characters used publicity stunts in their own cases. It was not really a critique on the media in those cases.However, there was two episodes where I felt like they gave us what the show promised - a look on how the media can put people on a public trial with severe consequences. Those two episodes were ep. 2 ""Subway Vigilante"" and ep. 5 ""Big Dan's"". These two episodes show how the media fed the public a specific narrative on how to look at the cases' victims and perpetrators, which then led to serious consequences for everyone involved.Episode 4, ""King Richard"", is a good recommendation for the absurdity of the trial itself. But it is less about the media's involvement and more about the legal strategies of a very charismatic defense attorney. I thoroughly enjoyed it though.The rest of the episodes you could watch just for educational purposes to know about the cases (like with ep. 3 ""41 Shots"" for example) but you could really learn as much by watching 10 minute youtube clips that explain the cases much better. Even if the production was good at laying forward evidence from two or three sides of a story, it criticized the characters involved more than it did the media's involvement. If they do a season 2 (which I think they should), they should study 'Dirty Money' on how to present a story with a clear focus.",False
3,7,Pretty Good,fieldmi,n/a,16/08/2025,Enlightened me on a few stories I didn't previously know about. Important to consider how justice is served in contemporary civilized society but the series doesn't get in depth enough on those very broader topics.,False
4,n/a,Media on Trial,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Trial by Media is another solid Netflix Docu-Series I set to my notification list long ago. It does not disappoint, nor exceed the thoughts that precede. I like the fact that they cover the b-sides of what has been televised. It doesn't cover the OJ Simpson Trial, or Michael Jackson's Trial, or anything like that. The cases covered are far removed enough, to only have been heard in passing, though not fully realized.Interesting enough, the cases covered may be stenciled on, however not in the broadest of strokes. That is something I am grateful for. Is something like a podcast with visuals, the minimalist approach seems to work for me.Covering societal impact through media's outward reflection. It ponders what that says about us, covering a wide range of topics such as race, consent, corruption, psychopathy, misuse of power, and capitalism's flawed infrastructure. The series never takes sides, only stating the facts one episode at a time.",False
5,6,Episode 1,macmurphy-10086,n/a,16/08/2025,"John knew it could be a bloke and not a woman on the show, he still chose to go on it
As for that vile defense lawyer, try letting people speak and stop shouting over them.",False
6,7,Pretty good,DudeFromTheNetherlands,n/a,16/08/2025,But those camera angels are just awfully distracting.,False
7,7,Relevant,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,Even though most of these stories took place in the 80s/90s the trial by media aspect seems even more relevant in todays society with social media. The stories were well put together from a documentary aspect and brought up controversial topics.,False
8,9,A little uneven but solid series,californiahummus,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't thinking this would be as compelling as it was. Some of the stories are fascinating not so much a media critique as just a perspective on society's reaction to crime.
There are some episodes that are better than others 41 Shots and Dan's Bar are both heartbreaking. Keep watching as some episodes are good but not great.",False
9,8,All of these stories were played out in the media,lmt_is_me,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI think many people read about these in the media and have made an some sort of assessment based on what they heard. The title is somewhat tongue in cheek.There are many stories out there just waiting to be told so I hope that there is a second series.Both sides of the stories were told. I found that there was a big focus on the lawyers though.41 shots was heart breaking. Talk Show Murder was also difficult to watch. The latter is a prime example of ambushing people on nation-wide television all for the sake of ratings.,True
10,7,Trial by Media,g-21936,n/a,16/08/2025,"In fact, it's pretty good, especially in the first episode, when the politician performs his best on TV and gets slapped in the face by a jury, it's a bit pleasant. But what we never expected is that after a few years in prison, a president who shares his stink will be broken. This is probably fate.",False
11,8,Very interesting,amerd-858-699637,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finished it in two sittings, very well done in my opinion",False
12,6,"Not awful, not great",captainsilverink,n/a,16/08/2025,"I understand the historical side of these events but some of the views still held by people who are featured are ridiculous.A very 90s Caucasian perspective in these narratives. Rampant homophobia, sexism, and racism. Something about some of these white yuppie lawyers (Feiger specifically) makes me remember why the world is in the state it's in today.Good documentary, but could definitely do with more information on the events rather than perspectives of those involved (tangentially)",False
13,5,"Decent, but nothing groundbreaking",sf1927,n/a,16/08/2025,"Expected to see some more commentary on the media's role in criminal trials. These are more like one hour summaries of trials that lean heavily on presenting one side over the other.I don't really see a thesis here. Feels like a drawn out A&E special from long ago. I kind of see how out of control these trials can become, but that is not the emphasis. It gets into legal strategies, but only slightly.Side note: just from my own naive perspective, I remember Al Sharpton being a punchline in popular culture through the 80s and 90s. Here, he is treated as a modern day Dr. King.",False
14,n/a,"Blinded by the usual biases, and so provides little innovative thought or insight.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its the usual narratives and talking heads, third parties allowed to spin the narratives as ""experts"" to give credibility to what the film maker won't directly say themselves. Just the example of the Big Dans episode, over and over they state rape is about power, but this is projection because for women sex is indeed about power, and so feminist analysis creates a distorted view of the world. Low class immigrant communities, likely lower than average iq's creates behavior that is inexplicable to the college educated elites who run media and make such documentaries, and so they misinterpret based on their own projections, making the same mistake as the feminists who view men as just miseducated women. So you have the obvious ignored or excused, a single mother at 21, no mind is paid to the bad decision making that implies. Just as you see today with the same types who now pretend it is normal for ""joggers"" to charge at men with shotguns. The deliberate failure to understand human nature undermines the value of these documentaries. It just becomes a platform for their chosen figures and pundits to repeat well worn narratives with no further exploration.",False
15,7,Misleading title.,vetoatreides,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Netflix 6 parts documentary cover some famous crimes and the following trials. It's interesting, but except maybe ""Subway Vigilante"", most cases were not trial by media.The weirdest thing is that we do have very famous cases of trial by medias. Richard Jewell (Centennial Olympic Park bombing), George Zimmerman (shooting of Trayvon Martin) and Darren Wilson (shooting of Micheal Brown) are 3 that comes to mind instantly where medias told a false story to the public for weeks.",False
16,7,Racism by MEDIA,maanikroda,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found that all the episodes were biased and in favor of the perpetrator of the crime rather than the victim(s). I was particularly upset with an inability to address systemic issues that are obvious components in the crimes perpetrated. For instance, the first episode addressed the topic of a homosexual man who was murdered. Instead of focusing on the experiences of him in a culturally white; heterosexual society, the documentary/media clips vilinized him and praised his assailant for killing him. The documentary had plenty of opportunities to bring forth educated professionals from current day to offer insight and education to the audience but instead chose to glorify the killer. This is also prevalent in the second episode of 4 black men being shot on a NYC subway by a white male claiming self defense. There is never an interview with an educated professional talking about systemic racism and the experience of being a black man. I'm so over documentaries flouncing over difficult (BUT EDUCATIONAL) conversations that include social injustice and unequal power dynamics of minorities.",False
17,7,Trial by Media,ylshu-66191,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a tool to control public opinion, the media will be used if it is used by others. There are also a lot of mob consuming media responsible for producing the public opinion expected by users. The subtext of the trial is power. The power does not represent eternal justice, let alone guarantee the justice of the result. Media trial means that the power side uses public opinion to achieve its own goal, and the mob is the object of utilization, and they also enjoy the entertainment brought by the process.",False
18,8,Media is a powerful medium,amithkumarshankar,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show Trial by Media was an eye opener. It was amazing to see how a medium such as media had such a diverse impact on the lives of so many people in the United States and over the world. How a medium could have such an impact on the judicial system, the victims, the families, communities, and so on. It was heart breaking at times to see the system fail you, sometimes you never understood the system at all.
Trial by Media shows how the system functions, the effect the Jury has, the efforts put in by the lawyers on both sides of the coin. Many of the cases that have been covered in this TV show were unfamiliar to me, and it was educative to me. The show has documented each event very well, giving as insight to how the media functioned in each of the cases. It was astonishing to understand the power of media, the concept of Court TV and its impact on so many lives. How people would be interested in watching the events of one's life rather than their own.
The show has managed to get all the important characters together and talk about the events that happened years ago. Trail by Media will make you question everything about the system and the media itself. Voyeurism will be the best word to explain this show.",False
19,7,Trial by Media,lshu-34187,n/a,16/08/2025,"Each episode is shocking, and the past will still reappear today. Before we judge others, whether we are ordinary people or the media, we should first make clear the facts and positions, judge ourselves first and then others.",False
20,8,Interesting Subject,aamerahmadelabssi,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has grabbed my attention because if the unique concept it introduces. Looking at the influence of media coverage on criminal justice system in the US. One of the most interesting parts of this documentary is when they interviewed defence attorneys and prosecutors in order to get highlight how they were thinking while trying to represent the victims or the defendants. I particularly enjoyed episode 4 as the two defence attorneys were brilliant and they had outstanding narrative to influence the jury by using every possible means from exploitation of the witnesses' darkest and deepest secrets And using it against them to try to tailor stories and make up some facts to play mind games and influence the jury even more. What I missed in this series is two things, digging deep in the facts related to the crimes themselves and not explaining the crimes committed in more details and the other point, not analysing and showing how the media played a role in changing the dynamics of the trials. In the series, the focus was shifted towards how the media covered the trials and has been in the middle of the courtrooms not on how it made a difference in the final outcomes or the verdicts.I thing it's a great work but if the producers are planning to make a new season, they need to elaborate more on the crimes committed and the real influence of the media on the final outcomes of the trials.",False
21,8,"Defendant, lawyer, prosecutor, court, jury, and verdict.",REXNE,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found it very successful, the content is full and progressing very detailed. There is an action side that excites like watching movies. Court decisions can be very frustrating.",False
22,5,More like Trials involving Bad Prosecutors,i_odin,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show misses the point, or at least doesn't deliver what is expected from the title. This show is nothing special, it's just another documentary depicting court room drama. The narratives are more often told by the respective lawyers, which basically make it an extension of the court room arguments. Some of them just show off and advertise their skills of bringing a win for their respective clients.First few episodes are worth watching, then afterwards you catch the pattern and it becomes predominantly boring.",False
23,9,Great Series!!,dayana421,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed it, fascinating to watch.Covers interesting legal cases from the legal point.",False
24,10,Is good documentary eye opener,brianotete,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIn opinion it just shows how law is not equal because like the case of the 41 shots and raped girl there no justice fulfilled i felt so sad and broken after watching.😞,True
25,9,Very interesting,pedrohabib-14049,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought the documentary did a great job of portraying the cases, their repercussion in the media and the public's reaction to it. And it leaves us with a big question, if all this attention given by the media for certain cases is positive . In addition, the documentary also portrays the cases very well and also expose the problems in the judicial system. I just won't give it the maximum rating because I thought some episodes were too tiring to watch",False

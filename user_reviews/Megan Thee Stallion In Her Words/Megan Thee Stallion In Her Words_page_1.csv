1,7,"Solid documentary, slightly padded out",camrx123,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's a lot of great things about this documentary. The animation is good, it is well paced, and Megan comes through as an extremely well spoken woman. Certain parts of the documentary definitely were added to pad out timing, especially in the first 1/4 of the film. No questions for me were left unanswered and I would definitely recommend this documentary to fellow Megan fans. This woman has been through so much in a few years and her resilience and ability to make a documentary like this just proves how strong she is. I hope this documentary gives her closure as much as it did for the fans so she can move onto the next chapter of her life.",False

3,10,IN MEGAN WE TRUST,ynthialaur,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was so excited to watch it! Megan is a wonderful artist and she will always have my support. I cried a lot because what she lived was unfair, but she always wins. She doesn't realize how much she changes people's lives, especially the women like me who love her. It was nice but sad too to see her past and the beautiful relationship she had with her mother. She's a really strong woman and I hope that she will be able to continue to do what she wants. As an artist she's just incredible. She works hard, always feeding the hotties and we love her so much. She's my number one and a model for me. One of the best things that has happened to me was to discover this talented woman.",False
4,10,"Inspiring, Captivating, Real, Powerful",laurencainwilliams,n/a,15/08/2025,"Megan Thee Stallion proves yet again to be Megan thee Icon as she tells her story in such a powerful and heartfelt way. It's captivating, entertaining and powerful to see her rise and overcome so much unnecessary hate, even today. I'm so proud of this young woman for sharing her story, for continuing to be a powerhouse for women's rights and empowerment. There will forever be those who go out of their way to try to tear her down which seems to only make her fans appreciate her resilience and energy that much more. WE THANK YOU AND WE LOVE YOU FOR THE BEAUTIFUL, INTELLIGENT, POISED, TALENTED, HUMANITARIAN & ACCOMPLISHED HOT GIRL COACH THAT YOU ARE. Megan has too many haters but it's a reflection of how society keeps black women down and criticized. 10/10, another top tier production and win for this iconic woman. 💜",False
5,10,An Emotional Experience,stevensond-26599,n/a,15/08/2025,"In this documentary, you see Megan's raw emotions on full display. From the beginning of her career until now, you learn who Megan is, what she has dealt with, what it's like to be a celebrity and how being a celebrity can complicate traumatic experiences. The film is nearly 2 hours long but does not feel like it. Megan has always been a huge anime fan, and she uses it to tell her story in this film. I love how many parts of the documentary show just Megan and a background. I also love how she incorporates her own music into the film at the perfect points which also reflects her life at those times. Megan is phenomenal and I cannot wait to see her on the big screen again!",False
6,1,nothing new,yjxrvgx,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was like a long redundant commercial and doesn't qualify to be considered a ""documentary"". It essentially is the same information that has been circulating on the internet and during the trial. The topic is redundant, pointless and at this point the subject is exhausted. We were given nothing new that hasn't been covered by blogs, bloggers, rap lyrics and YouTube. This was an opportunity to show, and tell the world more but it truly is another opportunity to attempt to make her relatable and she just is not. What she did manage to do here is to confirm that she can and does omit truths and tells lies in order to tell a story that will push her own false preferred narrative and to manipulate the public into believe what would best serve her at any given moment. This documentary will be good documented proof that none of her accounts the evening of the ""incident"" are credible.",True
7,10,Amazing film,tonaer-38135,n/a,15/08/2025,"I truly enjoyed this Documentary, being able to see have far Megan has come despite so many things meant to break her. She has persevered through it all and moves with so much grace and kindness, naysayers will always naysay but Megan continues to rise above. A true home grown talent that pushed herself to superstardom she remains as humble as ever is so resilient and is determined to solidify her legacy HER way no matter how hard it may seem. Megan may get knocked down but she will always get back up and continue to fight. It was a pleasure to view the recent years from her perspective and I am excited for her journey.",False
8,10,SOO GOOD,b-05244,n/a,15/08/2025,"This document is a powerful and deeply personal documentary that shatters the facade of celebrity, revealing the complexities and vulnerabilities of a true icon. With unflinching candor, Megan confronts the highs and lows of her journey, from the loss of her mother to the tumultuous ups and downs of fame.

9,10,10 Stars,thatbosschick,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nneka Onourah did a really great job capturing Megan Pete and Megan the Stalllion!

10,10,A strong successful woman,dahernandez-71804,n/a,15/08/2025,"Megan Thee Stallion breaks her comfort and shows audiences the true side to her life. The documentary shares her experience of an upcoming rapper, the struggle of losing her mother and father, and her nationally viewed court case. Even after experiencing so many difficulties, the media only made things worst for her as they painted her the villain. The documentary exposes the misogynistic men and women that took to social media and spread false narratives of her life, including celebrities, internet influences, and regular users. 'In Her Words' allows Megan to take control of her narrative and put all rumors to rest. Megan Thee Stallion is a true hard working artist that has only just started. Can't wait for more projects to come.",False
11,10,"Raw, Riveting, unfiltered, triumphant breakthrough",beam-96853,n/a,15/08/2025,I've been a fan of Meg for quite some time and this documentary has now made me a fan for life. It was everything you want in an autobiographical recount of someone's life in the eye of fame. It followed Megs childhood where she got her roots and found her love for rap music. It captures the trials and tribulations that the media speculation and platformed simple minded individuals plastered about her. It eloquently displays how it all effected her and would affect anyone else going through and transitioning between as many difficulties that she has. I commend her for sharing her story I hope many others will appreciate her words as well.,False
12,10,Beautifully Done!,hprf-52724,n/a,15/08/2025,"Megan Thee Stallion's new documentary In Her Words is a deeply personal, revealing portrait that takes fans far beyond the confident persona seen on stage and social media.

Her candid moments provide both empowerment and relatability, making the documentary a powerful, emotional experience for fans and newcomers alike.",False
13,10,Amazing,khollonqkh,n/a,15/08/2025,You truly get to get into the mind of Megan thee stallion and see what she went through. How she became who she is now. She acknowledges so much and truly proves how strong she is. This by far will have you view her differently. No one has ever been this open before. This documentary has a lot of surprising features that you were not expecting to see. The animations and the connection to Megan's parents keep you entertained. This documentary allows you to get a view of Megan Pete.The direction of the documentary is amazing. I don't want to say too much. I'm trying to avoid stating spoilers but I highly recommend watching it.,False
14,10,"Very emotional, very open, very raw",patricedavis-13760,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're sensitive at heart then be prepared to really cry
The surface level of things we watched and heard about Megan over the past couple of years has nothing on this
It dives deep deep into her life from the happiest moments of her life to the darkest moments of her and how she navigate through both
In which it shows soon as she lost her mother things just unraveled from there to where she completely lost herself
It is a very emotional and mental journey
It definitely shows how celebrities are deemed robots and not real people because the pain and loneliness she dealt with was very real
It's also a teaching experience on how you can never speak on someone else life because you really don't have a clue of what they are going through daily
Megan is a genuine spirit and a beautiful person inside out
This documentary was well needed so she can show what it's really like to be a young woman dealing with life after experiencing many traumatic experiences
How not really having a real support system takes it toll
It's very captivating and worth the 2 hours it takes to watch.",False
15,10,MEGAN YOU ARE LOVED,cynthiaonafuye,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an amazing, vulnerable, transparent and well put together documentary. Thank you Megan for giving us a glimpse of your life and what you go through on a daily basis. I really enjoyed this documentary. Well done to the team for bringing this to life, the animations? 10/10!! Megan I want you to know that I believe in you, your story resonates with your core audience WOMEN. Your strength, resilience, grace and ability to persevere is unprecedented. Your mom and dad are definitely watching over you and are proud of all you have accomplished. Nneka the woman that you are! Great job. Thank you!",False
16,10,Inspirational Story,krisie-22788,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary follows an exemplary story of perseverance and determination.Watching someone like Megan be this vulnerable and open about the things that almost destroyed her.. she is truly inspirational.The reason I fell in love with her is because of the confidence she instills in her fans, her hotties.It breaks my heart that her community failed and demonized her. Also that the people she thought were her friends, really didn't care about her.Yet through all the adversities she has faced and is STILL facing, she's still building her legacy and uplifting women.I am so proud of her.",False
17,10,Just Beautiful!,jeanayciaj,n/a,15/08/2025,This was an amazing documentary. The resilience and perseverance that Megan demonstrates I wish I had. You got to really get a peak into her life and everything that she was going through at the time. You got to see the vulnerable side that we don't get to see a lot of. I really enjoyed how they added the anime aspect into the film since Megan is a big fan. I hope Megan knows that she is loved by many. People really tried to bring her down and she came out on top despite everything! Thank you for sharing your story with the world it was definitely needed. You will always have my continued support!,False
18,10,Love her!,kpxbvzf,n/a,15/08/2025,I am so happy she was able to tell her story in her own words. She's an inspiration to many and I hope she knows that. Watching this felt like I took a peek inside her life during these trying times. I could not stop crying. She's been though so much yet still smiles and performs. She deserves the world. I know her mom is looking down proud of her. This documentary reminded me that life isn't easy but you gonna shed your past and continue to grow as a person. It's not easy getting thrown into the celebrity world without your support group. But through time you see how her real support group came through. F Tory!!,False
19,10,A very honest look into Megan's rise to superstardom,ashantejr,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film really does a great job at framing Megan the Stallion and Megan Pete as two separate entities. It's a very honest look into who she really is, and I'm glad she's decided to share this side with us because she really didn't have to. The film does get into a lot of information that's already available, but it's refreshing to see Megan's reactions to some of these milestone events happening in her life, and as a long time fan, I gained a newfound respect for her craft, her dedication to being a global entertainer and her strength to continue on throughout everything she's been through. Hard to watch at sometimes due to the subject matter, but I couldn't help but walk away wanting to give her a great big hug at the end.",False
20,10,Beautifully put together (grab the tissues),melisloggedon,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an amazing documentary, I cried, I laughed, I got angry and in the end, never felt so happy for someone that I don't even know. She's so resilient, I don't know how she handled everything thrown her way and all at once. Everyone involved did an amazing job, the way it was put together through Megans love of anime is the cherry on top. The music and the way the scenes were put together was perfect. The ones with her mother broke my heart, made me pick up the phone and call my own mom.. Never felt so raw after watching a documentary. MEGAN PETE you have so many people in this world cheering you on, a star that keeps on rising.",False
21,10,Finally,clariesilva,n/a,15/08/2025,"A beautifully told story, and well informative. Not only you see where she came from and who helped molded her, but the inside view of a rising star. We are truly getting her side, anyone who dealt with depression and/or anxiety can see the relations. She does an amazing job, and the animation is a real highlight. The animators did a great job, and really captured the pain that can be translated to real life. We get young Megan, we get the growing Megan, and the Megan we see today. She is well transparent in her pain during her grieving, and doesn't hide her struggles in finding herself. Doesn't sway viewers in showing her ""worst"" year, just being transparent.",False
22,10,"Raw, vulnerable, authentic",shannonsimpson-00084,n/a,15/08/2025,"I laughed, cried, and smiled all while watching one of the best documentaries I've ever watched. Megan's story is a testament of what hard work and determination gets you. Despite unexpectedly losing her mother, being the victim of gun violence at the hands of someone she knew and cared for, along with the internet hate/dogpilling, in the end Megan did not let any of the naysayers define her story and persevered. I was truly shocked by how vulnerable some scenes were but loved it all the same.For an almost 2 hour long film, it went by relatively quickly I was thoroughly engaged from beginning to end. The director did a great job at capturing Megan's story from start to finish and I really enjoyed the use of animation as well during some parts.",False

I feel honored that she invited us into her space to be so vulnerable to us while the world is watching. My favorite parts were definitely the animations to show for things she wasn't able to film but those bits still evoked the feelings that were in the documentary. Megan you're one of a kind and I'm so proud of you. The documentary was filmed so well and Nneka (the director) did a beautiful job! The little details such as music, transition and just overall storytelling is what makes this documentary so important.",False

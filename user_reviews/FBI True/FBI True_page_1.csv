1,7,Old stuff,surfingnaked1,n/a,15/08/2025,These are old stories. The copyright on the films are 2012. I thought I had seen some of these shows before but was not sure. This is a rebranding of some shows that are over 10 years old. Most of these I had forgotten about but these guys dig them back up put in some new people but it's very old stores. They take two episodes to go over Waco. I haven't heard about Waco in forever but maybe some of the younger folks may not have seen these stories before. I think this is just paramount to create content for its streaming service paramount plus. But it's still interesting. I guess the fbi cannot discuss anything recent.,False
2,7,"Decent show, but production seems low-budget",pumicet,n/a,15/08/2025,"I realize my opinion is based on a weirdly technical thing, but it seems amateur or overlooked, to me. The interviews with FBI agents look washed out, like they were shot using low-contrast-a common method to leave room for later color grading-but they didn't color grade that footage.The actual content of the show is good and entertaining. It's pretty cool to get the stories from the agents who were on scene. I do wish the show had episodes that would critique other drama shows and how they depict the FBI. Maybe that would be something for some other show entirely.I'm really not sure if this show is even connected to the other FBI series by Dick Wolf.",False
3,6,Yes & No,thejesuscat,n/a,15/08/2025,"As much as I try to watch this series, I become frustrated with how the stories are shared. The first setback for me involves the hubris attitude that surfaces when the agents share the information. Most of the dominate speakers seem to seek recognition for fulfilling the very job they are hired and trained to do, so that prideful arrogance really isn't necessary.Another obvious fact is the homogeneous culture that the bureau employs or prefers to interview. Those who share seem to reflect one who boast of their experiences as if theirs is paramount in professionalism. Again, an FBI agent is hired and trained to deal with terror threats and terror suspects; boasting about it seems a bit embarrassing. Some episodes do convey a retelling of a popular case. But for some reason, many of the episodes I have watched caused me to grow weary of the arrogance that comes across very strongly.And lastly, if there are two or three agents involved in the retelling of the case, PLEASE LET THEM ALL SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCE!!! Gosh!!! I just stopped ""Part 1"" of season three's episode one. In that episode, ONE GUY WILL NOT STOP TALKING!!! Why have three guest if only one dominates the entire retelling of the event??? We are ONLY hearing HIS EXPERIENCE. That is ONE SIDED!So, PLEASE, make adjustments to this interesting series. A few adjustments might make it more enjoyable. But remember, not all people like hearing barroom stories, some of us don't drink alcohol when watching this show. That means we are not under any alcoholic influence to tolerate the long winded speaker. So, the setting of this show could also benefit from a new setting.",False
4,5,Shallow retelling that could've been very compelling,megankrauslangdon,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show shares a very shallow retelling of famous FBI cases. It would have been much more interesting and compelling to dive deeper into these cases from the perspective of the investigating FBI agents. A huge opportunity was missed here. We really don't find out anything about the agents other than a ten second bio line in an early 2000's Dateline-like interview structure which feels very manufactured and superficial. I already knew the majority of the details covered in these cases already. Any other viewer could find out more about these cases by reading a few Wikipedia pages. Again, this could've been such an impactful series. I'm pretty disappointed.",False
5,1,Missed a lot of key details to make the FBI look good. Only propaganda!,sith_yarael,n/a,15/08/2025,After watching this all the stories missed key details that put the FBI in a bad light just so that they looked like they did the right thing. For the Ruby Ridge one they made it sound like all the FBI agents were all heroes. They totally skipped the part that they charges where are a setup by the same FBI agents just so that they could arrest the group. They failed to point out that Vickie Weaver was holding her 10 month old daughter and was not a threat when one of the FBI snipers shot her in the head. They said he son pointed a gun at him which when it went to court proved to be false.For the Atlanta Olympic bombing they totally glossed over the fact that they the FBI ruined Richard Jewell's life because he was the security guard that found one of the bombs and reported it and was more than happy to give them any info he could about what happened that day. Instead of treating him like a witness they treated him as he was the one that actually did the bombing and ruin his life. This was never once brought up in this propaganda for the FBI that this show is.And those are just two of the stories that I hit all. All the other ones are fully of the same propaganda and not the full stories of what actually happened. Simple historical research will prove all this.,False
6,4,"Interesting Show, Why Have It in a Bar?",mothai-89436,n/a,15/08/2025,"I find the show interesting because the perspectives of the agents are intriguing and well told. They seem to choose good cases. That are relevant and interesting. My question is why is it set in a bar? It seems like a poor choice of background and seems distracting that they are drinking beer. Unfortunately it makes Kristy Kotits look like an alcoholic. Maybe it's poor lighting, but she looks kind of rough in the show and a little buzzed. It takes away from the credibility of such an intense and trusted position that they have held. I get that a lot of agents drink after work and maybe it's set so that it feels like they are unwinding together after work, but to me it takes away from the incredible work that these folks have done.",False
7,1,We investigated ourselves and found nothing wrong,Xavier_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMost of these stories show only one side of the story, the governments, with zero accountability. That should be enough of a hint to see that this is all just a fluff piece to counter all the recent poor press regarding this agency.Ruby Ridge shows us the typical police response to any perceived threat and the outrageous actions an agency will take.I'm wondering why they aren't showing the Waco standoff. Perhaps it's tough to defend the actions of officers using armored vehicles to deliver tear gas into a compound and then igniting it.Most of these stories show only one side of the story, the governments, with zero accountability.

8,3,One sided government pep rally show,Glarbsttentenford,n/a,15/08/2025,"Shallow inaccurate reporting of policing with shock and awe in some instances where anyone that disagrees with the government are immediately threats that need to be destroyed for the good of the machine.The show has great potential but just shows how awesome and perfect the FBI operate for the safety of the sheep public.I should ask - When do you sound like a government target for not towing the line? The show was well structured and stories told in great detail.....pity its inaccurate one sided propaganda.U S A ! U S A ! Lol I still watched all episodes but was laughing a lot during it, shook my head too.",False
9,1,Wow. Total propoganda.,gwwymjxt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just watched S5 E1. No one from the Bundy family was even allowed to present their view of the situation. One sided isn't even a descriptor... Here's the FBI telling you why the FBI was right. Unelected bureaucrats/deep state trying to flex against American citizens and ready to open fire. Feds cannot be bothered to do the few things they are entrusted to do (balance the budget, control spending, protect the border, maintain a capable military, etc.)They attacked the Bundys for feeding cattle on ""public"" land. Yet turn a blind eye to American angel families whose children have been killed by illegals who should never have been here if CBP had done their job.Fortunately, these folks are all getting fired in January 2025.",False
10,2,FBI Corruption,tothbalazsandro,n/a,15/08/2025,"""FBI True Documentary"" casts the FBI as the paragon of justice, but this portrayal might be an attempt to shift focus from the agency's contentious actions. Here's a brief review alongside some examples of alleged FBI misconduct:The Steele Dossier: The FBI used this dossier, filled with unverified claims about Trump, to justify surveillance on Carter Page. The DOJ's Inspector General later criticized the process, pointing to potential bias.Clinton Email Investigation: The FBI's decision not to charge Hillary Clinton over her email server use has been seen by some as preferential treatment, questioning the agency's impartiality.Epstein Case Handling: The FBI's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein has faced scrutiny for possibly not pursuing connections to influential figures as aggressively as might be expected.Use of Informants: The FBI's tactics in cases like the Michigan Governor kidnapping plot have led to accusations of entrapment, where the FBI might be seen as manufacturing crimes.Historical Context: COINTELPRO's legacy reminds us of the FBI's past in overstepping legal and ethical boundaries.""FBI True Documentary"" offers a sanitized view, potentially serving as a counter-narrative to these controversies, which raises questions about the documentary's role in shaping public perception of the FBI.",False
11,5,Half truths,zrdh-95166,n/a,15/08/2025,"A whole lot of justifying to exonerate oversteps of the law. The branch davidvian story still sets wrong with alot of America , a shady search warrant, leads to stand off and eventual mass killing because Government would not change there narrative. This was one of the first nationwide, televised by the media day by day that captured the publics sympathy. IT made a lot of us look at what is sacred, are our homes s!fe from Government control. Are we nothing, do we have no real rights? Can the government produce a warrent on suspicion without real proof, burst into your house on hearsay? No in retrospect Janet Reno and company fouled up with no admission of wrong and it is further justified by these characters with there self pity.",False
12,4,It shows good reasons to abolish the FBI,Erik_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just the usual propaganda tales from the FBI. Nothing new or interesting if you already know about this stuff.Not bad to watch if you are interested in the sick justifications that the FBI uses to do what they do.Even these stories, sanitized by the FBI, still show why The FBI should be abolished entirely. It's the most corrupt, sinister, and tyrannical government agency ever created.Maybe if they just stuck with missing persons, then people might think they are ok, but no one likes the FBI except for corrupt Presidents like Biden and Obama. When the FBI shows up at your door, you know they aren't there to help you; even cops don't like the FBI.",False
13,1,Top of the Fbi,borisp-36769,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think that the series misses the vibe of pre 2000 cop shows , it looks like the scenario is made by ai , further more misses the excitement of the people doing their FBI job. If you want to make an FBI show just watch Top Cops and see how this kind of show is done. I really love shows that shows excitement and action , there are some good fbi shows , but that's not one of them. Really look some of the pre 2000 cop shows and for fbi and make it interesting. You are an amazing people and don't fail the American dream. Thank you all for listening and I hope soon see a good show about the America Top FBI.",False
14,2,Missed opportunity,blackbird1048,n/a,15/08/2025,"Telling the story from the FBI's perspective is a solid premise for a show. However at 30 mins its ridiculously short for what is an involved process. Even if it really were a discussion between colleagues it takes far longer to cover the case to someone not tied into it. In each episode its all glossed over and barely any detail. All the info discussed you can get on wiki so it doesn't even serve its purpose as a promotional show for the FBI.Much of the production you can see mimics the old classic crime documentaries. Yet some how this manages to feel even more simplified than they were back in the day.There was so much that could have been done with this show, yet they wasted it all.",False
15,3,"Interviews, Not a Documentary",reillym35,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerViewers should be aware the episodes are based off FBI agent interviews. These former agents tell their version of the story. The episodes do not review or critique the information provided.It's very upsetting to think people watching this show (probably on Paramount+) believe it's a documentary. This is not integral journalism, it's an opportunity for the FBI to rewrite and even wash history. To make things worse, there's no explanation why some cases expand to two episodes.Season 5 episode 5 on flight Pam Am 103 covers a very important case of international violence. Nearly 200 Americans lost their lives as well as many other nationalities. In this same episode, while reviewing suspects, they bring up Iran Air flight 655 because the FBI believed Iran could have been responsible for 103's bombing. In nearly the same breath, the agents casually let slip the US killed 290 people on the Iranian flight in 1988. No survivors. Yet the FBI and the Americans are the good guys trying to figure out who targeted them... no further information on the Iranian flight was given. I had to do the research myself. Shameful show.",True

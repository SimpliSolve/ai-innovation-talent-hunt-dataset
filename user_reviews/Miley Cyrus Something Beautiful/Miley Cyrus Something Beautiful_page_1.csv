1,10,AMAZING AMAZING,MichalV-0,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was absolutely brilliant and amazing and all about that. I loved every minute of it. Beginning of Something Beautiful (song). Wasn't that interesting, but the rest, especially End Of The World, Walk Of Walk, Every Girl You've Ever Loved and Reborn it was absolute highlight. Naomi Campbell in those shots??? ICON, LEGEND besides Miley I am at lost of words. Honestly, I went to cinema with very low expectations, but Hannah absolutely did above excellent job with that movie. It was amazing. I recommend everybody to go see it. I hope it will be somewhere available for streaming, because I want to see it again.",False
2,10,"Not a singer, nor an actress; An Artist. This is ART.",christopherm-41646,n/a,16/08/2025,"Something Beautiful is an immaculate presentation from start to finish. Vivid and vibrant emotions are felt when you see the visuals she paired with each song and how she strung each song neatly together. You really feel the highs and lows of Miley's life in this, and how she poured her heart and soul in. I felt like I was seeing inside her head, from influences of the 70s, 80s, and 90s, to glimpses of the former Miley of Hannah Montana, and culminating with a finale that I felt was heavily inspired by her Godmother, Dolly Parton, with whom she asked for guidance on advice for this project from the very beginning. If this is what Miley wants to do instead of touring for the rest of her career, I will be buying tickets for the foreseeable future, because I left the theater in awe and singing at the top of my lungs in the middle of the mall.",False
3,10,Absolutely obsessed!!,StefG25,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, love that it was shot on film. I think it really adds that grit Miley put in the new album. I'm
glad artists are keeping film alive! They did a great job mixing black and white film with color. The movie almost has this old Hollywood look and feel.Outfits... gorgeous! The close ups.... face card never declines. Lighting & all of the different scenes.... stunning! Pose pose pose!I'm so glad Brittany and Naomi were featured (as they should & slayyyyyyyed)**One thing I will say a Trigger Warning for flashing lights should've been added in the beginning for those who are sensitive (there's a lot of strobes).",False
4,10,Magnificent,jhimbdln,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Something Beautiful"" by Miley Cyrus is a raw, emotional journey through love, loss, and self-discovery. Her storytelling is honest and vulnerable, capturing the beauty in pain and the strength in healing. The visuals are stunning, perfectly complementing the heartfelt music. Miley's voice, both literal and artistic, shines with maturity and soul. It's more than a film; it's an intimate experience that leaves you reflecting on your own story. Bold, beautiful, and unforgettable. It reminds us how art can touch hearts and turn broken moments into something meaningful and lasting. A truly moving masterpiece.",False
5,3,Modern day MTV,SkyWalkerIV,n/a,16/08/2025,"If MTV were to make a return, they could add these 13 songs to their library.Lip syncing and overproduction was the MTV style (verified by YouTube), so you will understand that ""something beautiful"" fits the bill.Times have recently changed so there is no longer pressure to conform in order to be successful. She, and others now find it safe to live a normal lifestyle.I hope it works out for her.",False
6,9,A ritual called MILEY,pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Miley Cyrus: Something Beautiful"" isn't just a visual album-it's a full-on sensory manifesto. Alongside the record of the same name, this film, directed by Cyrus herself in collaboration with Jacob Bixenman and Brendan Walter, offers more than just an audiovisual translation of its tracks. It's a deep dive into the creative psyche of an artist who, almost two decades after bursting onto the scene, has never seemed so comfortable in her own skin. With her ever-changing aesthetic, raw energy, and magnetic presence, Cyrus pulls the viewer through a maze of images, sounds, and emotions that swing between the sublime and the strangely intimate-cementing her place not just as a singer, but as a performer with a truly unique artistic vision.The two-act structure lets the project shift through different moods and atmospheres, balancing dreamy, introspective moments with bursts of pop grandeur and visual fireworks. From the get-go, it's clear this isn't about linear storytelling-it's about feeling. The hazy opening, full of ambient noise and almost ghostly whispers, sets the tone for something that plays more like a dream than a narrative. With producers Sean Everett, Ian Gold, and Piece Eatah by her side, Cyrus builds sonic landscapes where acoustic instruments, synths, and natural sounds blend into one emotional ecosystem. And at the center of it all is her voice: raspy, raw, vulnerable-equally capable of summoning desperation and liberation.Visually, the film is all about texture. With diffused filters, layered images, projections, and psychedelic backdrops, the look calls back to experimental '90s music videos while staying rooted in current visual trends. Each track comes to life through luxurious costumes and carefully chosen symbolism-like the green fringed dress in ""End of the World"" or the retro-glam energy of the dancers in ""Easy Lover."" None of it feels random; it all connects to the visual language Miley's been building for years, now with a new level of stage maturity but without losing that spark of mischief. Naomi Campbell's appearance, with her hypnotic presence and near-mystical delivery, gives the whole thing a futuristic fairytale vibe-and let's be real: if Naomi's out here orbiting Miley's world, then that world clearly has its own gravity.If ""Something Beautiful"" doesn't follow a traditional story arc, that's not a flaw-it's part of the point. It plays like an open letter-or maybe a holographic diary-where memories, desires, and past wounds overlap like pieces of a broken mirror. Scenes like ""Pretend You're God,"" with its strobe light storm, or the liberating ""Golden Burning Sun,"" with Cyrus riding a motorcycle through gusts of wind, capture that spirit of visual and sonic catharsis. And even though the film leans into spectacle, it also knows when to pull back. There are silences, still moments, glances that say more than any lyric. In a time when visual excess is everywhere, that kind of restraint feels powerful.Beno√Æt Debie's cinematography meets its perfect match in Miley, who moves through his sensual, provocative lens with ease. The camera doesn't worship her from afar-it keeps her close, almost tangible. That closeness, that raw emotional exposure, is what makes the film feel like a genuine extension of her music. Tracks like ""Every Girl You've Ever Loved"" and ""Walk of Fame"" blend glamour and pain with real finesse, and the overarching idea of healing a sick culture through art-something Miley talked about in interviews-comes off not as pretentious, but as a sincere attempt to connect something deeply personal with something universal.""Miley Cyrus: Something Beautiful"" isn't easy to pin down. It's not just a long-form music video, and it's definitely not a disguised biopic. It's a ritual. A trip. A love letter to art pop with a rock 'n' roll soul-channeling Bowie and Bj√∂rk while boldly stamping the name ""Miley"" in its own loud, unapologetic ink. Honestly, it wouldn't be surprising if this project ends up being looked back on as a landmark in visual music-one that didn't need to explain itself, because it knew how to feel. And for long-time fans like me, it's a gift: intimate, daring, and yes, something truly beautiful.",False
7,10,She's Not My Doppelganger,senses-851-857324,n/a,16/08/2025,"She's my alternate in another timeline . . . But we're not supposed to exist at the same time, yet here we are, both living in 2025. She's the one, who ran away from him, and now spends years wondering if she gave up her happily ever after and lost the greatest love she's ever known. I'm her alternate. I stayed. I loved him against all odds. I found out. There is No Prince Charming. There is no happily ever after. Prince charming only loves himself. After all the wasted years, I will salvage my Chapter 3 for myself. I wish I could tell my multiverse alternate, Miley, that running from him was the right choice, but then she wouldn't create this masterpiece of a daydream questioning her destiny & heaven itself. Thank you, beautiful Miley for a spine tingling 53 minutes, for the beauty, for the knowledge that you & I have been to heaven and back again. You don't need him. You are perfect. You are loved. üôè",False
8,10,Loved it..,NikkiA-89,n/a,16/08/2025,"Didn't disappoint, I'm loving this visual album format, now just to see Miley live would be a cherry on top!Downside for those signed up to Disney basic and do not have a sound bar or good speakers. The sound is bland. Dolby Atmos + brings the sound alive.It's a Ultimate pop album & visuals didn't disappoint allowing us to channel our inner Tina Turner, Donna Summer, Madonna and of course Miley in Miley fashion.",False

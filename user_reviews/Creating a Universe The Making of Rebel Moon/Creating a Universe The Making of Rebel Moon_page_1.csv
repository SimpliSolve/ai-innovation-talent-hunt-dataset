1,6,"Rather then shade the films, this is a revue of the Makings Of featurette.",pidstr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall, this featurette probably has as much content and detail as is possible for the social media generation to absorb.But for the film making community, this special is a bit light on, with it feeling like they strung together all the opening sequences for individual features, rather then show those features in whole.Take for example, the barest mention of the lenses, and the short glimpses of them being modified to suit the image Zack Snyder wanted to get on the screen. No interview with lens technicians or engineers, just a mention of the brands and 'gluing them together'
No mention of which cameras those lenses were used on.It looks like sit-down interviews were done, but were then torn down to a bare minimum.One comment in the interviews, Sofia Boutella mentioning she'd never been lead on a film before,... Well, she's pretty much the female version of Tom Cruise, Will Smith or Matt Damon now, bankable for ticket sales will us all knowing anything she's in will be worth seeing.A special features go, this enjoyable, just no In Depth.",False
2,4,So Much Meticulous Efforts Adding Up to So Little,LeoDeLeo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Feel bad for all the many people involved (except for the top honchos including Snyder and his adoring coterie) expending so much dedication and effort on all the huge and minute technical details only to be screwed over by ridiculously bad plotting and silly amateurish dialogues - a way sub-par screenplay in other words.There was also a segment on the significant effort of actually growing wheat and then scheduling to shoot when it was ready for harvesting - BUT did it even mean anything at all to the final movie?? NO! NONE! Zilch!!Did NOBODY have the good sense (am sure some did and were duly fired) to tell Snyder at least three key things (apart from many others):1). He's a terribly BAD and terribly TACKY writer!! Don't do it! You have the money. PAY FOR PROPER WRITERS!!2) LESS can indeed be MORE - eg. Having so many characters, no matter how unique they are, nor how well the special effects folks make each of them look, can actually bland-out a movie instead of making it more compelling. They take up too much time and crowd-out too many scenes and the whole movie becomes a parade of forgettable costume jewellery - none is actually compelling because there is no room for proper character development, and evtually none sticks.3) A giant space craft building civilisation stealing grains from cart riding, scythe sweeping village farmers is a very very STUPID laughable plot - and a key plot point at that!!If they can build giant space ships they will have efficient technology to produce food.Even IF they have to steal grains for no good reason whatsoever, they would have the wisdom and means to enslave the strangely dumb and inexplicably backward farmers and provide them the technology to farm efficiently to produce more and faster and not use slow low yield 10th century earth methods.This whole enterprise is yet another example of how money power and hubris can overcome common good sense to force-manufacture with huge effort something totally stupid and 'unusable'.Snyder's coterie of yes-men and yes-women are as much to blame.At least I hope all the dedicated (but choosingly and probably choicelessly 'blind') underlings and vendors were well paid for their valiant but near-pointless efforts as far as the final movie outcome is concerned. The huge abundance of negative reviews says it all.This embarrassment is totally on Snyder and no other higher hierarchies as there were in his other movies.That said, I do enjoy quite a number of Snyder's other movies - good enough to ignore the plot and scripting shortcomings. But Rebel Moon - just a big fat obvious mistake that should never have been allowed to happen.",False
3,3,I thought the behind the scene's would help,wbsimsjr-32405,n/a,16/08/2025,"I though watching this would maybe, give me a different outlook on the movie; I only made it about 20 minutes into the movie, when I just nodded off from dis-interest and just blah, blah, bland.. Nope, this in no way gave me a different outlook on the movie, it really just solidified my view that these studio's do just back some junk, simply for product to put in the library, get some tax credit for bad investment, and just keep people working. Usually effort in the behind the scenes production is impressive and really adds a fine edge to a production, in this case it does drive home the point.. You can put all the makeup you can on a Pig... It's still going to be a oinker. Though I would find looking at a dolled up Pig, much more enjoyable than watching this or the production it is attached too.",False

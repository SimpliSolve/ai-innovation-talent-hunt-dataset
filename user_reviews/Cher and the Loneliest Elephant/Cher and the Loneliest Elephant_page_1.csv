2,8,Beautiful...,RosanaBotafogo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Cher, I've always admired her, but after the phrase ""I'm the rich man!"" it simply represents me, and it should represent all of us, women, being our own rich men, but anyway, the documentary is beautiful, mainly for reporting a happy ending, small allied acts, a set of actions, saved the lives of those poor little animal and created wonderful precedents giving the right to life in a Thai court for the first time, small allied acts, a set of actions, saved the lives of those poor little animals and created wonderful precedents giving the right to life in a Thai court for the first time...

4,10,WATCH ON PARAMOUNT+,DrDiChadwell,n/a,15/08/2025,"Get the tissues, you'll tear up Kaavan's story is so uplifting and heartwarming there won't be a dry eye in the house! Humanity is at it's BEST when we come together to rescue animals from antiquated thinking/traditions.",False
5,10,A story full of love and respect,liciagustava,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was like: Why do we need a movir about a celebrity saving an elephant for?The fact is that this documentary is much, much more than that. Cher is considered one of the best actresses and singers of the history, but what few people know is that this great woman does a million good deeds and a lot of people forget about that.This story, however, is much more than a good deed. It is about saving Kaavan, a wonderful Elephant imprisoned and alone for more than 30 years. And we need to watch this feature film to learn that he's one of many, and with love and dedication, as Cher presents throughout this adventure, we can manage to save many other animals trapped.In cinematic terms, I believe that this documentary will take many Emmys for the wonderful production, from cinematography to soundtrack, from content to editing, from the making of the film to its poster. Is just pure amazing docu-cinema.Just watch this movie that you will not regret.",False
6,10,Earth Day with Kaavan,kikipowes,n/a,15/08/2025,"For those who know me, you know that I am a big fan of documentaries, from ""March of the Penguins"" to ""The Cove"".And when I heard that they were making a documentary about Kaavan's rescue, I was very excited.And the result did not disappoint. What Cher did as a humanitarian was to praise the skies. Removing that elephant with so much trauma to put it in a place where he can find peace and company, is just thrilling.",False
7,10,Down to the heart and soul of humanity,Artisticmovielover,n/a,15/08/2025,"Heartwarming and raw to say the least. Please go watch this on Paramount plus. I've always been a huge Cher fan and I adore elephants as well but having the two of these combined in this true story of compassion was emotional to the senses. Cher really did out do herself with this one, probably her greatest gift to Mother Earth. When we think of Celebrities and the rich and famous, the first thing that usually doesn't come to our minds is the idea of humanity or even kindness. We all have heard those horror stories of what Hollywood is really like. In this case Cher has proven herself to not be one of those celebrities. We need more people with a voice to speak up for the innocent. All animals are innocent beings longing for survival. When human neglect takes that away from them the animal is destroyed. I can only imagine what Cher felt while tweeting that first tweet when she came upon this story of Kaavan the world's loneliest elephant. She knew with her platform she had the voice and the opportunity to make something happen. To see her take time out of her busy schedule for an animal, shows how much of a heart she has.",False
8,10,Thank you Cher for saving Kavaan!,aurorabenditasantos,n/a,15/08/2025,Just beautiful. Watch and tell whoever you can to do the same.,False
9,5,"Wonderful action, horrible documentary about it.",recklessron,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst let me say I congratulate Cher and all the others who saved this elephant for their actions. That is laudable. Now lets look at the documentary.It is flat and empty. Cher's part is almost a walk-on. Despite her being instrumental in clearing away all the red tape: from dealing with the zoo to the airlines to the transportation team to the government where the elephant was to the government where the elephant was given sanctuary to the sanctuary itself I have no doubt it was Cher's celebrity that opened all those closed doors BUT the documentary barely even mentions those things.We see a lot of the elephant in its original zoo. Most of the film is about getting the elephant ready to transport. Then we see a little of the transportation and less of after the elephant was relocated into a temporary holding pen. They tell us how great the temporary holding pen is compared to the miserable conditions it lived its life in. We are told of how that elephant will be released into a virtual paradise. We see a little of that paradise and how great its life will be. And then the documentary ends with the elephant in that temporary facility. SmhWhy didn't they spend time focusing on the urgent problems, chronologically, and Cher's role in the diplomacy required to solve them? That would have added a dramatic element and actually given Cher enough credit, and screen time, to be mentioned in the title.Why didn't they show us the elephant happily living in the sanctuary interacting with other elephants and enjoying its freedom?It looks more like someone decided, at the very last minute, to cobble together a documentary and didn't have any time to plan it properly from the beginning or to follow it through to a satisfying ending.This could have been an very uplifting film - enjoyable for all to see. Instead it is a mess that ends flat leaving the viewers wishing they could see the elephant enjoying its freedom.For those, and other reasons, this documentary simply misses the mark.",True
10,10,Just watched,kaungthetpaingooofficial,n/a,15/08/2025,Is so good and so warm. Proud of being a cher fan.,False

1,10,"Captivating, Magical, Heartwarming, Inspiring...",HappyQTea,n/a,15/08/2025,"So thankful this historical concert was captured so well and proved to be such an unbelievable cinematic experience. Revieting, captivating, and even at times magical. Superb LIVE performance with incredible production value: live band, orchestra, stage design, lighting design. The bond between the artist and audience so heart warming. Independent singer songwriter with the charisma of movie stars, genuine talent, and generous spirit is already a rare find anywhere in the world. Yet against all the odds, Korean artist IU has carved her place into history with this remarkable outing at the Olympic stadium of 44000 when everything just came together beautifully. Completely empowering, uplifting, healing and inspiring. Understandably anyone lucky enough to witness such an event can see a legend in the making. An incredible artist the world need to get to know and experience more of.",False

Sing and dance, it is a concert that is enjoyable, with very good musicians, dancers and orchestra.",False

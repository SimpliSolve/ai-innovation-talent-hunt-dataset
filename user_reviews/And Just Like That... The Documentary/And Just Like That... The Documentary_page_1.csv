1,8,Great BTS,h2223,n/a,17/08/2025,"Nothing too groundbreaking here, but still very enjoyable. A rare treat to see the bts of one of my all-time favorite shows. I really hope they continue with another season of AJLT. I know there's been plenty of hate, but hopefully every time someone leaves a review like this they'll know that there is an audience who *really* wants to keep these characters in their lives. (And get to know the new characters more, too!)As an aside -- all the hate for SJP is so weird. She really strikes me not only as down to earth, but as a real artist (in this doc it's clearer than ever she isn't just a passive wearer of ""Carrie's"" iconic ensembles but a true creative partner!) and a very interesting person all around.Anyway... this doc is a nice way to pass an hour or so in an evening. If you're a fan of SATC and AJLT, you'll probably like it!",False
2,7,"nice music, nice cutting, nice people",jounikuuva,n/a,17/08/2025,"The documentary was so much better than the actual series. I mean, what happened? It feels like someone actually wanted to make this film, unlike the series.",False
3,1,And just like that after watching the doc I hate this show even more than the reboot,mindyliles,n/a,17/08/2025,"Watching SJP totally out of touch with reality or people speaks volumes. I hated that I was so critical of the reboot, but after actually watching her and the other characters and their real life ""characters,"" I'm just grossed out. SJP is a joke...and so is this documentary. I didn't know if I was watching an episode of the kardashians or sex and the city. Sad. Hopefully they are smart and don't do another season. Just sad.",False
4,1,And Just Like Crap,aarpcats,n/a,17/08/2025,"As of February 2022, there are five regularly updated YouTube accounts dedicated to hate watching this AWFUL television series. Two of them are helmed by women in their 50s, and none of them are criticizing this disaster because the creators are ageist, sexist or racists. They don't like the show because the writing is horrible, the fashion looks like it's from K-Mart and they don't like being told ""they don't get it"" because they aren't as smart as the writers,This show isn't an avant garde piece in the Met. Micheal Patrick King isn't Kafka. SJP isn't Glenn Close. It's crap. The documentary is crap,too.The actors, producers and writers act as if they are creating culture, but they are really just the works of Pierre Brassau, the four year old chimpanzee who took the modern art world by storm until the critics found out he was an ape. The only problem is that they don't realize that they ARE the joke, not that they are creating it.A comedy is to entertain, not to sell the scatterbrained politics of Cynthia Nixon and to prop up the ego of self-proclaimed auteur, SJP. Kim, you get a pass, but stop getting plastic surgery,",False

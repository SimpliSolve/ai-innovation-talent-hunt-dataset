1,7,A fine item for fans,Nozz,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a fan of Ronit Elkabetz and of her brother Shlomi, this is an enlightening look at Ronit and her family (and indirectly at Shlomi). Ronit was iconic in Israeli cinema, largely because of a trilogy of films based on her family-- and partly because of her commanding and provocative presence. If you don't know anything about Ronit, you may find much of the film uninteresting and/or hard to follow. Moreover, it's quite long and the publicity terms it merely Part One.",False

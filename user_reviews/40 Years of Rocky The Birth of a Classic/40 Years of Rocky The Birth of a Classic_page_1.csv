1,8,Fascinating (Albeit Brief/Random) Home Video Footage,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"One way to look at ""40 Years of Rocky"" is to view it as a bit of a rip-off. I wouldn't totally blame someone for this opinion. It runs just 30 minutes and has no coherent message, simply consisting of Sylvester Stallone commenting on old home movies from ""Rocky"" director John G. Avildsen and other on-set producers.That being said, fans of ""Rocky"" may still enjoy this (brief) escapade for two primary reasons:1. The home movies are indeed fascinating almost because of their banality and randomness. Nothing is staged and it truly shows (as best as videotape can) what the major players of ""Rocky"" were like on set. In particular, seeing Carl Weathers practice the fight choreography with Stallone or Burgess Meredith running lines in the makeup chair will bring a smile to your face while watching.2. ""Rocky"" has become such a cultural phenomenon that it is now fair game for every little scrap of behind-the-scenes minutiae to have meaning. Fans have seen the movie so many times that any tiny bit more they can squeeze out of the franchise (even from behind the camera) seems significant.Overall, I'd only recommend ""40 Years"" to the hard-core ""Rocky"" fans, as others may question the necessity of such a random collection of home videos. But for those who admire the Philly pugilist on a deeper, more inspirational level, getting a ""peek behind the curtain"" is fun no matter how short a time is spent there.",False
2,7,Unseen Footage of The Making Of A Classic,nrgigaba,n/a,16/08/2025,The first time I watched this movie was probably 25 years after it was initially released and have seen it a dozen times since. Rocky is one hell of a classic and seeing never seen footage of it is amazing. You would have thought it would if been released with the many productions of Rocky DVDs.Making it short was probably a good decision. This could have potentially been a longer documentary because this movie has impacted many people's lives positively but having such a short film with narration from Stallon may have been the best choice.,False
3,7,"Nice insights, but painfully short",flicklover,n/a,16/08/2025,I have seen multiple making of documtaries on Rocky and this one is unique in that it is mostly made up of home movies on the set of the film. It is narrated by Sylvester Stallone giving insights about what he us seeing. It is interesting for any Rocky fan but is really short.Not worth buying.,False
4,9,Always Rocky,carlos-diviesti,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have a friend at Buenos Aires named Rocky Balboa, too. He's a friend from the movies. We spent together almost forty-five years, and I think he'll be my friend beyond death becomes to us. I truly believe in it. This little gem is not about «Rocky», it's about how John G. Avildsen saw his little picture during the making, and Sylvester Stallone enjoys his dream of making it. That's not original but that's not boring, because it's an intimate close capture of period, work, and life. See it!",False
5,1,I'd rather be knocked out by Ivan Drago than endure this again.,logicproreviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Horribly boring. Stallone narratives a making of over Super 8 footage. He repeats himself time and time again. If you want a more in depth narrative, listen to his DVD audio commentary for Rocky.This is waste of everyone's time.1/10",False
6,2,Nothing new to learn,daviddegiorgio,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a shame, couldn't wait to watch it, hoping to find something to add to the great story but...",False

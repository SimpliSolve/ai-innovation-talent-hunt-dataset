1,9,What a gloriousvsurprise,czajac-39573,n/a,15/08/2025,I don't write reviews but I felt compelled to review this movie.I went along for my husband because he likes Aussie music. But I am not a big fan.I was drawn into the story and the background to how John Farnham became the legend he is. The earlier years were such a hard slog with very little recognition. It was only as he neared his 40s that his belief in himself as well as his manager and friend's belief that things changed.So really this story is about his struggle to be seen as a great singer and musician. It is also about the enduring friendship between him and Glenn Wheatley.By the end I was tearing up thinking of his struggle and realising how good his music is. Which is more poignant now because of the loss of Glenn and Olivia Newton John last year. Then came throat cancer and the realisation that he will never sing again.A very emotional tribute that is well worth watching. It also made me realise that we should be supporting our local bands at the pub or any venue.,False
2,9,Superb tribute- Nostalgic true story of endurance and belief in talent,tm-sheehan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMy Review - Finding The Voice
My Rating 9/10 .In Cinemas now
There are very few Australian entertainers that command the affection and respect that John Farnham and the late Dame Olivia Newton - John have experienced and deserved over both their long careers .It's interesting to note the similarities that both these iconic Australian entertainers and great friends shared together. Both were child immigrants to this country from England , both were born within 12 months of each other and both loved performing together . I remember their wonderful Main Event Concert in Sydney in 1999 in which they performed with another great voice Anthony Warlow . They also toured together in April 2015 in The Two Strong Hearts Tour performing their hits over 5 decades .It's understandable that Olivia Newton - John's friendship with John Farnham and their mutual admiration for each other is often mentioned in this documentary as well as his loyal and endearing friendship with his manager Glen Wheatley plus the parting of the ways with his initial manager Darryl Sambell who is described in the film as not a very nice human being
Glen Wheatley who sadly died in 2022 from Covid 19 complications long association with Farnham features in Act 3 of this amazing comeback story and is narrated with great archival footage by his widow Gaynor Martin.I think this finely researched and entertaining tribute documentary is best described in three acts because it begins with
Act 1 Johnny Farnham's rise to fame after his initial hit Sadie the Cleaning Lady one of the biggest selling single hits ever released in Australia in 1967 when Farnham was only 18 .Act 2 - was most surprising to me as I remember seeing Johnny Farnham perform in Leagues Clubs and dance venues and enjoyed both his stage performances in the musicals Pippin (1974) and Charlie Girl (1972 in Sydney .I didn't realise this was his downward spiral period which lead to record companies and radio stations refusing to play his records.In the movie industry they refer to a star on the way down as box office poison I suppose in the music industry they refer to it as turntable terminal or just a has been?This Act includes the 3 years from 1982 to 1985 that John Farnham replaced Glen Shorrock as leader singer in The Little River Band which wasn't a happy period for the singer or the band .Act 3 - John Farnham rises triumphantly like a Phoenix under the expert management of his friend Glen Wheatley . This is where he finds his true voice in 1986 with his solo single ""Your the Voice"" that held the number one position for 25 weeks and lead to the 3rd highest selling album in Australian history titled Whispering Jack that also bought long overdue International success for John Farnham.Poppy Stockell who co wrote Finding The Voice with Paul Clarke also directed this 3 Act tribute to John Farnham . I hope Poppy receives the recognition she greatly deserves for this affectionate and cleverly edited 90 minute tribute.This film documentary is not just a scrapbook or timeline of about the entertainer who has become one of Australia's best-known and most popular performers.John Farnham is the only Australian artist to have a number-one record album or single in five consecutive decades echoing that of Cliff Richard the UK.I recommend seeing this film while it's in the Cinema before it streams it has greater emotional impact than most similar documentaries about famous entertainers the archival footage and commentary is edited beautifully.",True
3,9,The Legend. Excellent doco with just a few omissions,anthonyjlangford,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an excellent doco about a very powerful singer with quite the journey. Rather than repeat what others have said I'll focus on a couple of differences.It was poignant that the story was told by those who were part of it, especially those who did not survive to witness the release of this documentary. There were however, quite a few grabs that were low level in volume. One late in the piece by Jimmy Barnes comes to mind. I don't know if the version I saw on free to air television was any different than the one in cinemas and dvd but it seems highly unlikely. The audio levels were not consistent throughout which is unheard of really in a production, especially one this important. It should not have happened.I would have liked to known something about his siblings. We saw a brief shot of a sister in the sixties footage with his family but no mention afterwards. Surely worthy of one. And what of his parents? Did they survive long enough to witness his huge eighties success? The focus is mostly on the music but a mention or two of family is important in John's story and a human interest one for the audience. When did they pass? What impact did it have on his career and life?I was a teenager in the eighties so was a big fan of Whispering Jack and the following two albums. To my memory, W. J. was the first Australian produced CD by an Australian artist. A mention would have been good. It's quite significant. A piece of music history.It was surprising to me that so many of the songs on W. J. and Age of Reason were written by others. One from each album was written by Ross Wilson. His own version of A Touch of Paradise can be found on an earlier Mondo Rock album, Nuovo Mondo. It's very good too. I thought a mention or even interview of Ross would have been worthy. A legend in his own right. There was obviously some sort of relationship there for John to have two of Ross' songs over two albums.It's interesting because so many of the songs for the follow-up album, Chain Reaction in 1990 were written by John and associates. Some of his best including In Days to Come, See the Banners Fall and most importantly, I Can Do Anything. This last track features some very poignant lyrics that speak to the man. 'So, what do you see. Just an ordinary man. What sets us apart, is this fire in my heart. That says I can do anything.'Much was made of Burn for You, another great track, but I think a mention of this song was also very important. It says everything really about John Farnham as a person and his entire career. Again, an oversight.For the casual listener, these things would not have been noticeable. For me, I loved the whole documentary. I just wanted a bit more in certain places. Such as his regular appearances on Hey Hey it's Saturday, which I also remember. It spoke to the humour of the man and his relaxed, casual nature. Again, that 'ordinary' quality juxtaposed with his huge talent. A brief mention again, would have added more depth.It was great to see the inclusions of Amazing Grace, his song with Jimmy Barnes, his work with Daryl Braithwaite (whose own solo album is brilliant), his later live performance of that song, Sadie and many other clips unseen to most, like his mid-seventies gigs.Most importantly, it worked on an emotional level. To think of those three individuals, Olivia, Glenn and John, whose careers lasted over 50 years to be all struck down in less than 12 months, is deeply sad. John survived of course, and we can only hope that he recovers enough to have a quality of life again and that he's around for much longer to come, whether he sings again or not.What a talent. Huge respect. Thank you for some wonderful memories in the eighties in particular and excellent, timeless music. Australia's greatest talent.",False
4,10,The Voice of a Nation,SawyerSaiyan,n/a,15/08/2025,"This may very well be the best music documentary of 2023. Farnsy has been a household name in Australia for decades, and rightly so. I never knew much about him, but everyone knows his iconic voice by sound. Exploring his upbringing, childhood, and the struggles he faced to get where he is today is a very emotional roller-coaster from start to finish. The friends he made along the way, the people who stuck by him, and those who didn't, it's all here in this amazingly produced film detailing the personal life of John Farnham - Australia's voice. If you're a fan of his work, either casually or dedicated, I implore you to see this documentary.",False
5,10,Great Music Doco,stan-232,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerConfirmed a lot of what I already knew, from the outside looking in. Insightful in a lot of other things I did not know. Being done over by managers, addiction problems, depression, conflicts with fellow musicians. I could not call myself a fan, but it gave me a lot of respect for John Farnham. I would certainly watch this again. Great soundtrack. There is a lot of archival footage that the documentary had to rely on and given that, the continuity was excellent. The documentary, was tinged with sadness, frustration, elation, love, and excitement. To see how John's career was resurrected was great. Let's hope John has as successful Road to recovery with his health.",True
6,10,A great tribute to a great voice,baxterarcher,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll start by saying this, every Australian should see this movie for no other reason than to understand the struggles that he had through most of his career and hopefully get an appreciation for one of our truly great artists.Growing up in the 80's I remember how the Whispering Jack album dominated the radio for a while and was aware of Sade (the cleaning lady) but always thought of him as a bit soft and definitely a ""Mums"" kind of singer. Since watching this movie I've gained a new respect for the man and his achievements along with his enduring friendship with Glenn Wheatley.With his recently deceased friends Olivia Newton-John and Wheatley doing the majority of the narration, the movie gains extra significance.",True
7,n/a,Relive the life,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Most Australians of my age, (yes I am old) know this story well. I remember wishing John did not smoke because I was worried about what it might do to his voice.I was never really sure of the cause of his lack of ability to remember lyrics. I was hoping this might provide some insight - but it skipped over that issue.Still, it is a wonderful trip down memory lane for some of us. Many famous faces join in to express their admiration for Jonny's talents and recount their encounters with a very down-to-Earth man.I see it is now to be released on free-to-air TV (in Australia at least) so try and watch it if you can - or even record it if you still have that capability.",False
8,8,Well made,Kingslaay,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been a fan of John Farnham for many years. This was a wonderful and well made documentary that gave an intimate and in-depth look at John and his journey. We see how John started with simple beginnings and how he found his voice and achieved the fame and glory he deserved. I learnt more about the iconic song, You're the Voice' and other great songs he performed. It was so interesting to see how he became a young sensation with 'Sadie The Cleaning Lady' but this sadly held him back for almost two decades. People have long memories in the music business. It was beautiful seeing the strong enduring friendships he made that helped him succeed. It was also wonderful seeing the historical context and other greats who featured during his journey. A well made documentary, would definitely recommend.",False
9,10,A fitting (and long overdue) tribute to The Voice.,allmoviesfan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFantastic. The backstory of one of Australia's greatest icons - musical or otherwise - finally comes to the screen. What a life and what a career John Farnham has had. 'Finding the Voice' focuses largely on his life as a teen idol (of 'Sadie the Cleaning Lady' fame or infamy) through the Whispering Jack phenomenon of the late 1980's and into the Age of Reason album era.Told through a series of video clips, current and hstorical interviews with Farnham and others like manager Glenn Wheatley, friend Olivia Newton-John, producer Ross Fraser and Farnham bandmembers David Hirschfelder, Brett Garsed and Angus Burchall (amongst many others), there are plenty of nuggets that fill in the backstory that most Australians know at least pieces of: Glenn Wheatley remortgaging the house to fund Whispering Jack, Farnham's Little River Band days, his relationships with both Wheatley and ONJ and the worldwide impact his music has had.And, of course, with Farnham's music in the background - and sometimes, in live clips, the foreground - you can't go wrong.A spectacular documentary, dedicated to the late Glen Wheatley. Here's hoping The Voice sings again.",True
10,6,Documenting an Aussie rock legend,glenaobrien,n/a,15/08/2025,John Farnham is a living legend of Aussie rock and this is a solid documentary that traces his early career with a focus on his creative comeback from the Whispering Jack era. It suffers a little from not including any conversations with the man himself. Gaynor Wheatley figured prominently and the friendship between John and Glenn Wheatley is well documented. The ill-fated period fronting for The Little River Band is covered well including the creative differences between Farnham and Graham Goble. If you're a John Farnham fan you've probably already seen it but it will engage anyone interested in the history of Australian music. For those who want more in depth analysis of the Whispering Jack album try the He's the Voice podcast hosted by uber fans Adam and Nigel.,False
11,1,"""Australian icon"" - Retro John.",retrobeme,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a great biography to prove how rigged the music industry is and how nearly impossible it is for a local musician in Australia to genuinely break. John Farnham does not deserve the title ""Australian icon"" considering he is from England and was not born in Australia. The focus he got could have gone towards someone/ or someones in Australia who actually originated there. He could have had his focus given to him back in England so my biggest issue here with the overall ""Australian icon"" is how unauthentic his whole story is and didn't really have anything too unique to offer, Whispering Jack is just very okay compared to The Beatles Rubber Soul album which is so much more meaningful and of the same place where Johnny actually originated from. Also everything has poorly been put together, the film poster, the slapped on fonts from something like Dafont and the whole documentary just containing heaps of footage mostly elaborating on how great he is, elaborating on little silly details like his hair, nice looks etc.. not really providing anything too authentic to factually label him as Australia's singer icon. - Retro John (Original Review)",True

1,8,Good but episodes too short,cgtam,n/a,15/08/2025,"Filmography is fascinating &short footage is good. They're no real story lines, just glimpses in the lead animal life . Wish footage of animals were longer to complete a true storyline instead of 1 or few nights.
Tom Hiddleston is a great narrator being a Shakespearean actor, & adds depth instead of distraction/ boredom to the series. Tom should be the ""BBC's voice"" when Sir David retires, not Paul Rudd.",False
2,8,Season 2 improves from S1.,cgtam,n/a,15/08/2025,"S2 eps of elephant family and puma family are more in-depth than S 1. The other eps are also mostly focused on a lead animal where viewer can appreciate the huge struggle all wildlife must endure simply to survive on this human planet. The cinematography is exceptional, narration by Tom Hiddleston is also very good, though he is forced to pause at times from director. Tom is a Shakespeare an actor with fantastic speaking abilities. Adults can enjoy this series 2, not just kids. No graphic hunt kill shots. Gorgeous at times, even the tiny lives.",False
3,7,"Stunning cinematography, subpar script",ukgreek,n/a,15/08/2025,"Only seen the first episode so far, and the cinematography is gorgeous. But I agree with the reviewer who said it lacked diversity and retained a colonial approach to this kind of documentary, and though I didn't really mind Tom Hiddleston, the pacing was ponderous, and the script itself... oy. Suffocatingly anthropomorphic. eg, the lioness didn't ""abandon"" her cubs. Why not simply say she is forced to leave them to hunt? It's repeatedly said that the Maasai Mara is ""a last refuge"", sliding in the indefinite article. Just say it plainly: it's one of the last refuges, don't try to imply it's the only one for effect. This kind of melodramatic narration, which never lets up, should have been replaced by smarter, more informative text. I'm curious to to see Night on Earth now, as that uses similar technology.",False
4,10,Amazing new look on animals night life!,Appleflax,n/a,15/08/2025,Unmet scenes captured by latest camera technologies proposing a very nice new picture. What a great immersion into the dark side of animals life thanks to cameraman and production.,False
5,10,Truly beautiful and well done.,vedvaghela,n/a,15/08/2025,"A glimpse into animal world at night is breathtaking, refreshing and really interesting.Tom Hiddleston as the narrator is really great to hear. He describes everything really well.All in all, would recommend.",False
6,10,Eye-popping!,henrycoles9,n/a,15/08/2025,You won't believe your eyes and you'll actually keep forgetting this is nighttime you're looking at! They actually discovered absolutely new stuff in science about these enigmatic nocturnal animals while making this series. And Tom Hiddleston's majestic voice adds loads to the awe and wonder of the show.,False
7,10,It's amazing way of documentary,abytvm,n/a,15/08/2025,"How beautiful they shoot this video, truly hats off this amazing documentary.",False
8,9,Magnificent,shaunmcevoy-98833,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tom hiddlestone should definitely do another show similar to this his voice is soothing and nice to listen to. The visuals on this are nothing short of spectacular absolutely astonishing, I really hope Apple+ makes more content like this with Tom.",False
9,10,BRILLIANT!! OUTSTANDING!!!,xxxfarha,n/a,15/08/2025,"I absolutely loved it! The camera work was absolutely stunning, the soundtrack is amazing, the script was really good. Also, Tom Hiddleston does an amazing job as the narrator. The entire team deserves hats-off. Really looking forward to the next 6 episodes coming out next year.
Recommended!",False
10,6,Glorified Tech Demo,owen-watts,n/a,15/08/2025,"Coming to this directly after the latest sprawling ""Planet"" nature series on the BBC slanted my experience with it significantly - the footage is remarkable, the technology incredible but the overall vibe is quite shallow. The episodes are quite short, the nature narratives are very standard and the whole thing is essentially just a vehicle for the phenomenal technology on display. Hiddleston's unctuous commentary feels almost sarcastic and doesn't quite work either.At its best (in the first season pursuing otherworldly tarsiers through the trees or the spectacular footage of falcons diving amidst glittering skyscrapers) it's a convincing and enticing vehicle for the technology - but I prefer my nature docs spotlighting the animals rather than the equipment. Or it should have gone all-out like ""Animals With Cameras"" and folded the trials and tribulations of trying out the equipment into the main focus of the show, rather than relegating it into the now-ubiquitous ""behind the scenes segment"" (which seems even more superfluous in a half-hour show).So, pleasant enough for what amounts to an equipment demonstration - but I look forward to seeing this tech rolled out seamlessly in far more weighty nature docs to come.",False
11,10,Stunning,seandyson,n/a,15/08/2025,Absolutely fantastic insight in to animal life at night with cameras able to turn night into dayThings caught on camera for the first time was utterly superbOne reviewer saying not enough diversity needs to grow up it's about animals at night and nothing else,False
12,6,Good Documentary!,pegasus-67050,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a cool & unique documentary but as much as I love Tom, he sounds like he has never narrated anything prior to this and it seems as though he is talking to children.",False
13,3,Greet cine... ...matografie ! Bad... ...story... ... (wait for it) ... ...telling !,bcreemers77,n/a,15/08/2025,This guy telling the story gets me on my nerves (nothing personal). The way they (try to) builds up suspension is just dreadful... Sorry... not my cup of tea.,False
14,8,Wow! This knocks other documentaries filmed at night completely out of the water!,rannynm,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Earth at Night in Color stands apart from many documentary series. The latest camera technologies that are used in this series deliver a documentary with a fresh look at nature.This show documents the lives of various species across the world in different habitats, during nighttime. However, even in the low light, the cinematography we see is in full color!The photography and camera team for this series must be commended for their astonishing and brave work filming these dangerous and majestic creatures in the dead of night. All of the habitats are so well colored and clear, to the point that I could not differentiate night to day. Narrated by Tom Hiddleston (Thor, Avengers: Endgame) who adds a youthful and professional voice. My favorite part is at the end of each episode when we get a behind-the-scenes look into how a particular episode was shot in the dark. It leaves the audience no questions about how this was filmed; a question many have after watching documentaries about nature.The film's message challenges the idea 'there is more than meets the eye."" While the dark may seem scary and unpredictable, the sun always shines back in the morning.I give The Earth at Night in Color 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, plus adults. You can watch it on AppleTV+ now. By Ashleigh C., KIDS FIRST!",False
15,9,Apple TV nature doc,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"Apple TV is throwing its hat into the nature documentary genre. To its credit, it has created something new in this relatively crowded space. There are only a few different situations that isn't saturated with nature documentary crews; the deepest of oceans and the darkest of nights. Sure, there is footage of animals at night. It's usually those night vision or thermal imaging footage. Somehow, they look alien and disconnecting. By seeing it in daylight conditions, this show is revealing new situations with new footage.Even something old is presented in new ways. In the artificial city lights, this show has peregrine falcons dive bombing little birds against the backdrop of the glowing cityscape. It looks amazing and new. Then there are new animal situations. The predators are a lot closer in the darkness. There are new animals but even old animals have new behavior. I've never seen a herd of wildebeests following cheetahs around. This is narrated by Tom Hiddleston. He fits the nature documentary space in a new way. He is British like the old doc series, but he is still a new yet familiar voice.",False
16,10,Let's spend the night together,markus-morawetz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Incredibly great imagery, hunting scenes that stop right where they should and for me a great narrative voice.The effect that these fast lenses conjure up is just dreamlike. You're not used to seeing such a dreamlike blur in 6.5K times - I'd love to see more of it, and not just in night shots.",False
17,10,Amazinglu attractive!!!!!,snapeseverus-65135,n/a,15/08/2025,Tom Hiddleston's voice make it so elegant and classy. I have watched it twice this week. Thank U for your new method of observing wild word. And with Hiddleston's royal voice.....its so much better.,False
18,10,Yes Yes and No,gregoryblanch88,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first Yes is the ability to see animal behaviour in the night in a way never possible before. Sure thermal imaging and low light tech have given us a glimpse but those methods tend to strip the essence of nature.The second Yes is Tom Hiddleston's enchanting voice, one of the few that is comparable to Sir David and Benedict Cumberbatch.The No is why stop at 30 minutes (including the making of). Each episode could easily run double that, and we sometimes even see shots in the ""making of"" that were not in the main episode. The editing must be agony.Kudos to the folks literally stumbling about in the dark, you have produced something wonderful and unique.",False
19,10,I want more,jmsg_PR,n/a,15/08/2025,"The show is amazing. Love Hiddleston's narration, seeing how the animals behave during the night in their respective environment and how we can see it with the technology that they're using is most impressive. I want to see more seasons of this show.",False
20,6,"Short and quick glimpses of animals, production is a 8, story is a 4",Xavier_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"By the looks of the cameras and the images they are able to bring out I bet they are super expensive. Add in software, some music and the production value is top notch and time consuming, as why I expect each show is limited to 30 minutes.The first lion story however isn't anything that hasn't been done loads of times before, since the 70's. The camera work is great, and Tom's voice is soothing but the story the same, lions hunting and looking after their young.In additional episodes different animals are covered and Tom tries hard to get us excited about what we are being shown but it seems the topics aren't interesting to me. Perhaps it's just because I've seen too many nature shows with David Attenborough at the helm.",False
21,10,The natural world is deeply beautiful,AZHE217,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is the first time for all living beings to feel that these creatures in nature are so emotional and tender, and there are some deep scenes. The mother lion searched for four days in a row and found her lost child. The elephant family searched for water. Unite as one, Leopard Aquinas has grown from a cub to a mother with her own child, and deeply admires every staff behind the scenes. In order to capture these little-known pictures, they need to set foot in the world that humans have never set foot on. I am also envious of them being able to do what they like and achieve success in the end. I have witnessed these exciting and shocking scenes with my own eyes!",False
22,6,Great Revolutionary Footage But Boring Narration,pegasus-67050,n/a,15/08/2025,"The technology, footage and crew are great but the narrator sounds like he's reading a script and seems very unenthused about what he's actually talking about. Give me David Attenborough any day.",False
23,5,"Episode 1 Same story, same posh British colonial accent.",alessandro-ponzo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I hope the next episodes will bring something new.
Episode 1 was a huge let down.
Same lion story we have been hearing and watching since the mid 80s, all drama built in in camera with nothing really happening, same voice of a posh Cambridge elite London raised actor, not bringing any diversity or even try to move away from colonialistic approach of documentary Filmmaking.
I hoped that Apple and Offspring would have brought us something better, fresh and more exciting.Footage are cool, but Night on Earth already broke the barriers of night vision and gave us the first wow.. So this as a second version should have brought more indepth stories, a different perspective and the maturity that night on earth may have missed, but unfortunately it did not.I'll keep my hope high for the next episodes, but bad plan to start with the most unexciting subject.",False
24,9,Its really night in colour,hesoyamfsa,n/a,15/08/2025,"This one is great.as never before it filmed wildlife in colour and in high quality.short running time make desire to watch.the six episodes are based on six animals so we can see ones nightlife better.but some scenes are blurred and miised most valuable scenes like lion kill wildebeest. I hope its better with a episode with marine animals like sharks, whales etc....",False
25,9,New Doc Indeed,medalice,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutly beatifull and eye opening.
Only needs David Attenborough make this 10/10.",False

1,10,two thumbs up!!!!,new859,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't expect much from the series. But it surprised me with extremely high quality materials, except the one episode on Elon Musk. I though this series will be an ordinary praising of these billionaires. But it is NOT. It digs much deeper than ordinary documentary films. Usually people have already heard a lot about these 4 tech billionaires. I am too. I have read books about them and books written by them. But this series tells me a lot more than I already knew, especially on the dark side of their story. And, I believe these are authentic portraits of them. I just want to express my gratitude to the film makers.",False
2,1,The world doesn't need billionaires,elonmusk-is_a_moron,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPeople can't comprehend that we could have unlimited free house, electricity, food, healthcare, education, transportation, family time, etc., if we just sacrificed the concept of billionaries.Everyone would be safe, happy and secure.We can make this a reality, but instead, we are still fighting each other over trivialities and nonsense used by rich elite to divide us.The world billionaries like Elon Musk and their ilk are creating is a hellish dystopia, filled with inequality, pollution, food and water insecurity, constant violation of human rights with zero possibilities of change.Billionaries know they are putting the whole world on the verge of catastrophe (Why do you think they are buying all these underground bunkers?)Is just madness to keep worshipping these soulless monsters while still using minorities and poor people as scapegoat. Is people blind, dumb or just suicidal?",True

1,8,Tearing up,philip-82486,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWow. Growing up watching JJ this feels so strange to watch, like a different person. Like JJ mentioned multiple time throughout the documentary, the relationship between him and his fans is so close. And to go from that close of a relationship, to then show such real emotions with his family and to show how vulnerable a person can be is honestly so respectable.Over all good documentary, but the last 15-20 minutes with his dad talking about love, abuse and lack of communication had me in tears. The damaged from bad parenting will always reoccur in later generations without communication and putting in the work to get better and becoming more loving.",True
2,8,It is always lonely at the top. Exceptional Take On a Life full of Success.,yewalehardik,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOne word : Relatable.Relatable for how human KSI himself is seen in this documentary. He is like us without the cameras , dealing with its own of issues, and difficulties and suffering from what they call success.Documentary itself is well shot, the back and forth of timeline is cool as it helps in showing the lows and highs of KSI.This was more like a emotional connect all access video documentary than a vlog of a famous person.Some cons:
1. Too many drone shots of the locations , i mean we get it, but the repetitive drone shots made the doc longer than it should be. I could easily take out 10 minutes off as a whole.2. Minimal mention of his friends. I get it , it was a KSI doc but we also know how important sidemen is for KSI.Pros:1. You'll love it for how its shot
2. The emotional connect is shown quite well.3. Relatable to the countless people who face issues with their family and siblings.8/10.",True
3,7,"Ksi: In real life, or part of that",sanderkorff-00329,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think this documentary shows a lot of things going on in JJ's life we don't get to see through youtube, which is nice. I do think however that leaving out the Sidemen out of this documentary and the role they have in JJ's life, makes this documentary fall short. There was not even a mention of their names and it makes it seem like they are not a big part of JJ's life. Of course idk if that is or isn't the case, but I always was under the impression that the Sidemen were a big part of KSI. One shot even says, JJ is buying a new house after living together with one of the Sidemen. I myself know it was Simon who he lived with, but he's never mentioned, despite being one of JJ's longest and best friends. It just seems a bit weird to exclude your (best) friend(s) when making a documentary of ones life.All in all I think the documentary is fine, but it could have been better and it could have shown more of the youtube side of his life, with which it all started and where most people know him from.",True
4,10,Perfect. Down to the last minute detail,alsheroa,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDamn. What an amazing documentary.I don't normally watch documentaries mainly because of my attention span that is slowly deteriorating but I really enjoyed watching this documentary from start to finish. I relate to JJ mainly because I grew up watching him for the past 10 years and alot of his personal problems kind of relate to me so that made it much eaiser for me to watch. I loved the resolution he came to with his dad and brother. It has given me a new purpose to add to my very small list. I hope JJ reads this and want to see what he does next.Thank you JJ for the memories, laughs, and all around just being a genuine human being.And from the bottom of my heart thank you for making my childhood just that much better.",True
5,7,It was ok,Sunflower_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot the best documentary that I've watched but it was still an interesting watch. I like watching JJ's videos and the Sidemen so I already liked him but I don't think this documentary showed much of his real personality.The only part really that I though was 'real' was how he was talking about his parents but I definitely think he did hold back. It was horrible to watch how much he wanted his parents validation but they never gave it. I personally don't think they ever will- they came across quite shallow and seem just to use him for being well known (ironic as they said Simon uses him in one of the sidemen videos).But overall wasn't bad, if you're a fan of the sidemen or KSI then it's a simple watch.",True
6,10,WOW!,alfiehobbs-90493,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWOW! Made me tear up...
Just so deep into his personal life...
It makes me feel so under working, this is because, seeing how hard ksi works.The way it talks about the relationship with his dad is so sad and so inspiring.This documentary is inspiring to be best I can be and boost my ego...I love how he has got back with his girlfriend at the end of it it all...
I love how he has two sides to his life his personal side and his YouTube side. I like how he keeps his personal side to himself. I feel that keeps him going and what gives him motivation to keep being him...Also the way it brings DJI into it and how they are brothers and have there relationship and how they had there ups and downs and needed to get back together and did in the end, it's so wholesome.I think if you don't know KSI it will be a bit hard to understand at points. Like why do he start YouTube and boxing and how he became to be a singer and why he became to be a singer?Definitely a 10 out 10 for inspiration. I feel immortal now, and like I have endless power...",True
7,6,"An intriguing look into JJ's life, but unfortunately falls short.",becky-92346,n/a,16/08/2025,"KSI: In Real Life (2023) is a documentary following the YouTuber, boxer, and musician, KSI. It details his rise to fame and the issues that come alongside it. As a documentary, the film doesn't keep a consistent pacing and feels quite unorganised at times. However, I found JJ to be interesting and I enjoyed learning about his life.The documentary includes some effective editing that keeps the film upbeat and engaging. I really like the onscreen graphics used throughout, however I would've like to see them used more often. There's also a good use of archive footage to provide context.The original score is okay, it's nothing outstanding but it doesn't need to be. The parts of the documentary I really enjoyed are the live performances, it's fun to see JJ's passion for music and how he interacts with fans.I really like the use of laidback interviews, JJ is interesting to watch and has a lot of intriguing things to say. Additionally, it is very nice to see JJ be vulnerable to the audience and talk about a lot of personal topics, I feel the emotional parts are important.Lastly, this film is nothing unique in terms of documentary filmmaking but manages to entertain and inform. Some parts are a bit too brief however, which makes it a good film to put on in the background.",False
8,9,Growth and Vulnerability,NikolaiiStewart,n/a,16/08/2025,"As with just about 90% of the UK who watched YouTube in their younger years, KSI was a prominent part of my daily life. We grew alongside him, and became men and women of the world as he did. It's so refreshing to see someone who I thought must think the world is in the palm of his hand going through life, going through struggles and going through pain, really hit home.There was a lot the documentary touched on, his relentless ambition, his ways of navigating love, his motivation to keep going. I think it achieved all those aspects, with more depth placed and what I imagine he wanted for the documentary of those three. At the end of the day, despite not seeing the sidemen as much in that, maybe that is more a testament to how that relationship is rather than some ego-driven decision.Sure many people want to reach out and hug the guy. I sure did. With fame comes changes that you can't ever hope to reverse, but adapting in the way he showed in the documentary is what I'd hope for him. The persona and the reality, this gave a good insight into what it is to be in the limelight. Wish him the best.",False
9,3,Overproduced mess,lillgroggis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who is this documentary for? I am sure that the majority of the people who watch this are fans who love KSI and everyone around him, I myself have watched him since before the Sidemen. But the documentary really doesn't explain nor teach many unknown parts of JJs life. We learn that his motivation is money and spite, how charming. This philosophy on life is flawed. But if you would watch this and don't have any idea who KSI is you would klick off directly.I'm sure if someone loves the guy this documentary could be fine. However as a documentary it lacks a narrative, focus and structure. It jumps all around just to fill out the runtime but still doesn't manage to show us anything worthwhile. How many times are we going to see documentary about how though it is to be famous and rich?He called himself an alpha which made me cringe to my core.",False
10,10,KSI is the goat,ljnisbett,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLoved this documentary and how it opens up a different perspective of JJ's life, would highly recommend this to anyone as a watch.Shows the highs and lows of an idol to many of his fans including myself.Having grown up watching his content and seeing how well he's done with his life it was saddening and surprising to learn how unfortunate his relationship with his family had suffered due to being ""KSI"", it's nice to see how he managed to turn his life to focus more on what matters to him most in life, the people around him. Really glad he got back with his mrs again also cause he clearly cared deeply for her and only pushed her away cause he thought he wasn't enough.KSI is the goat.",True
11,1,Awful Watching Experience.,HotHamlet,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the very few times i did not finish something before reviewing it. It took me only forty-three minutes to stop watching.I genuinely thought this KSI documentary was abysmal. Nothing about his emotions and/or reactions seemed genuine (even if they where). It makes it seem very fake and makes him seem unlikable in my eyes. I also thought that it was overproduced in almost every way. An example of this would be the constant switching to his family members to talk about stuff in moments when it seems pointless and unimportant to what we are seeing.The way KSI is presented both by himself and because of the production is not great. He is probably a very nice guy. But this documentary (at least the first half) showed him as arrogant in my mind. Now maybe that i what he was going for but i do not believe so when watching it. I should also mention i have heard of and watched KSI in the past thus i know a little about the man prior to watching this documentary.Also i just found it very boring on top of all of these statements from myself. Nothing interesting happened for the whole time i watched.I know these seem like minor criticisms but it's all i can say about his production. I genuinely only have negative emotions towards this and can't conjure up anything positive.I must apologise for te short review but i still wanted to make it knowing it would be short for some reason or another.Do not recommend watching this at all, 1/10.",False
12,10,Best documentary i have ever watched,idangoodname,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust amazing.From the start to the finish, we now all what is up when the camera's are off.I was so emotional.. so happy for JJ that he sorted out his problems with his father, brother and especially his girlfriend.I learned a lot for this, how to be in close touch with your friends, families and always do best in your life in every aspect.We now truly now who is JJ, and i hope he will give us more of JJ and not KSI because he is not needed to hide behind KSI, we all love and appreciate JJ so much.To be honest I'm pretty gassed by watching it, it made my day.Watch it, you will be so inspired
LOVE YOU JJ.",True
13,9,Family,arrenjenkins,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI always enjoy watching the Sidemen and especially KSI is my favourite. However he really showed his true colours in this and let loose his emotional side, showing it's okay to be emo as a man. The hate he faced is horrible and it shows his character, on how he survived it. I found it fascinating, how he created this character who is arrogant and crazy, yet how IRL he is humble and empathetic. His relationship with his family is traumatic and it shows how he was the one trying to rebuild. I did find the girlfriend bits slightly boring, but it still built to who he was. I used to like Dej I don't now. He was unnecessary to Randolph and a dick to his brother.",True
14,10,The best document I have ever seen,mihaitarascanu,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe document brought so many emotions in me as the start where we all know the classic KSI to finding out about his famaly problems and the breakup he had with hes girlfriend it brings you in a journey of what he is dealing with behind all the things he does on his free time it also makes us feel involved and get to know how much he cares about hes fans his family and all the people around him that help. When he showed the broken KSI it was surprising and sad because of how he always seems happy and laughing but I saw a broken side of him. He has worked very hard to where he is at and I am proud and wish him good luck on the future. This show was very good made and probably took lots of work but it turned out great recommended to anyone.,True

16,9,"Now, I know what you're thinking",lhbaker-28783,n/a,16/08/2025,"I rated KSI: In Real Life a 9/10 because I'm a hardcore fan of KSI, and not because of the quality of the actual documentary. Honestly, I don't blame you for assuming this; half of the people who rated this probably rated it a 10 or 1 because they love or hate KSI. I can assure you that I gave KSI: In Real Life a 10 because this documentary deserves it. Why? Mainly because of the parts in it about KSI's family. Don't get me wrong, the rest of the documentary was hilarious, and fascinatingly made me realize the type of person KSI is; not the good stuff I already knew, but the flaws. However, they can't compare to the parts about his family that hit home. Every time family was mentioned I could feel the water in my eyes trying to break free. I told myself as I watched: ""I ain't crying in no documentary."" I could not let a documentary be the 5th movie I've cried in out of 300+. But once JJ broke down, I did too. And I'm not talking about a tiny droplet that pushed its way just outside my eye, I'm talking about full on tears that went to my chin. Out of those 5 movies I've cried in, I had never cried as much as I did this time. The only reason this isn't a 10/10 is because most of the movie doesn't have an intense emotion, but the parts that do are sensational. In conclusion, if you are an old or new fan of KSI, watch this through to the end, for if you've never cried in a film, this could be your first.",False
17,1,MOST PATHETIC DOCUMENTARY EVERRRR!!,adxpitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is just about the worst documentary ever made. Hell, Ed Woods might have directed it himself. It's basically a cheap attempt to do Dwayne THE ROCK Johnson's ""Young Rock"" but with a guy with zero talent who got lucky the current generation has no taste in celebrity nor idols.I just can't figure out why an unfunny clown like KSI got such a fan following when sitting through the video is the worst punishment I've led myself into.Leave off the torturous YouTube video library, we see the phoniest so called ""boxer"" who, like his butt buddy Pauls, get the opponents dive for 6 figures and equally has the worst music skills that I personally would never let nor allow an enemy's corpse listen.I wish the current society do a 160 degree turn and get back to the old days when the likes of these Clownshoes never had a chance in the world's affairs or else take a huge jump into the future and get away from this culture for good.",False

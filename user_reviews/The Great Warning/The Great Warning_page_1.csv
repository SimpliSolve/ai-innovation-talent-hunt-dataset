1,1,Conspiracy Thinking Posing as Catholic,J_B_Bees,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not Catholic in its message at all, it's fundamentalist. It's not a message of faith, it's one of Christian nationalism.It's not really a religious message in this at all. It's loony paranoia not that different from ""documentaries"" from the likes of Q Anon, Alex Jones, or any other fact free ranting and raving.Catholic priest and bishops have spoken out about Christine Watkin's books and film. Catholic belief has always said the Book of Revelations is about the past, not the future.Watkins claims she's supported by Church Fathers, popes, and the miracles at Fatima.However 1) the Church Fathers did not inherit a single interpretation of the book of Revelation. 2) Popes have not provided teachings supporting the Countdown timeline. 3) The church says Fatima dealt with events in the twentieth century, not events in our future.Catholics, don't be fooled.",False
2,10,A MUST-SEE,mjmac-67319,n/a,16/08/2025,"I highly recommend this film, which is based on the book ""The Illumination"" by Christine Watkins. The documentary is a combination of prophecies revealed to saints dating back over hundreds of years, plus a series of reports from real people who have already experienced a mini-version of ""The Great Warning"" that is coming within our lifetime. This warning will be a miraculous ""Illumination of Conscience"", that every person on earth will see at the same moment, no matter where they are on earth.Once the Great Warning happens, people will have very little time to amend their lives. Anyone who isn't aware that is event is coming is vulnerable to ""fake news"" that will spread, claiming that the event was caused by a cosmic or alien force.The message of this movie is the most important message ever shown in film. Don't pass up the chance to watch this extensively researched true-life documentary. Every person on the face of the earth needs to be aware of the information contained in this film in order to prepare themselves and their families for an event that will soon shake the word.",False
3,10,All Should See This Film,imdbfan-5794994741,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Great Warning is a message of hope for for a world that has lost its way. There are numerous prophecies of the Warning, or the illumination of Conscience, dating back as far at the 1500's. St. Faustina was one Saint who was given a revelation about The Warning. In the prophecies the Warning goes by many different names: The Flame of Love, The Great Day of Light, The Second Pentecost, the Mini-Judgement. It Real people alive today have already experienced it, as have several Saints. The Great Warning will be the greatest mercy of God since Jesus came to earth to bring us salvation. Seeing the movie will help people prepare for the real event and many conversions will result from it. A movie you won't forget.",False
4,10,Mind blowing! 20/10,imdbfan-3986907351,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no words to describe how powerful this movie is. It is eye-opening, accurate, well thought and aligned with thousands of messages from our Holy Mother and her visionaries. More than just a movie, I think it's more of an urgent message from God. Please watch this movie with an open heart, and dont hesitate to learn more about its background. Two thumbs up!The visuals are breathtaking, the soundtrack is mesmerizing, and the emotions-oh, the emotions-will stay with you long after the credits roll. This is the kind of movie that makes you think, makes you feel, and makes you want to watch it all over again.",False
5,10,High production value,ablack90,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Marian Catholic I know about the prophesied Illumination of Conscience (the warning) as an act of Mercy by God for humanity. But I wasn't sure if the production value of this film would be any good. Wow was I ever in for a pleasant surprise.Everything from cinematography to music, visuals, acting and compelling story telling was there. The actors are real people who share their experience with a God of Love and Mercy. They come across as genuine and permanently changed people who have been given a re-set in life, only this time, walking hand in hand with Jesus the King of all nations. I was glad the film narrator, author of the book upon which this film is based, explained that illumination of conscience is not the same as a near death experience. For the Warning is God revealing the state of our personal life and the impact on those around us.I brought my adult sons and was delighted to see two men in the film, a thrill seeker and a fighting alcoholic who give their testimony. I also loved the Spanish woman and teen girl who also experienced a foretaste of the warning.I left the theater, my heart filled with gratitude and joy. Would that we prepare ourselves by going to confession, praying the rosary and providing service to those in need. It will not be as shocking to us. As it is, many will be so freaked out at this triumph of Mary's Immaculate Heart, they will want the mountains to fall on them Rev 6:16Mary brought her Son in the first time and She will bring Him in the 2nd time in this 2nd Pentecost that will renew the face of the earth. Watch this film and be filled with gratitude that our God loves us much more than we love each other.",False
6,10,Must See,imdbfan-9917806033,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very important movie that brings to life in particular the prophecies of St Faustina about a great event that will illuminate the consciences of the world. Prepare now. We are in a time worse than the flood. Before the day of justice there will come a time of mercy, which we are still in, but it will end.Across the world we can feel that something is coming. A must see movie that helps us prepare. Modern people are used to receiving information via film. This is the perfect medium to convey these important concepts especially to the ' o reading' people in your life. Bring your loved ones and believe the majority of positive reviews that have been listed.",False
7,10,Marvelous movie,arturolira-64419,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Great Warning"" immerses the audience in a suspenseful journey that explores humanity's reaction to looming disaster. The storyline captures the lives of various characters, each dealing with foreboding threats in their own way. The film's intense pacing, combined with a chilling score, effectively keeps viewers on edge, provoking them to consider their own choices in the face of crisis. The acting is skillful, with each performer adding depth to their roles, allowing the viewer to connect with both their fears and strengths. Additionally, the cinematography makes great use of shadows and close-ups, intensifying the feeling of dread and hopelessness. While some plot points may feel familiar to fans of disaster cinema, The Great Warning carves its own path by focusing on the psychological impact of imminent peril rather than relying solely on visual spectacle. This blend of human emotion with suspenseful storytelling makes The Great Warning a memorable experience that resonates long after the credits roll.",False

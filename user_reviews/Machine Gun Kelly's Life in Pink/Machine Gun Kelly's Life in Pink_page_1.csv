1,5,This is a video of a google search,sovhitman,n/a,16/08/2025,"So first off, im not a mgk fan. But i went into it open minded bc i just want the guy to do something well. So far no luck. The rap part is interesting but its really just the home videos i like the most bc you get to see him pre fame which really begs a lot of questions like what happened and does money change people? The answer come quickly as you see him in the now and live performances and you say oh drugs and money and yes, yes it does change people.The rest of the info given to you through a very one sided opinion is nothing we didnt already know from media and gossip news. Just spoon fed to you as kelly wants you to see it. I didnt like that at all.All in all if your a fan of his its a good docu movie, but if your not its a waste. Production was well done so ill give it a solid 5. For real they put money into it you can tell. Outside that, just google search and you'll get all the same info from wiki.",False
2,6,Interesting,grellsutcliffsimp,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am a fan of MGK. I think this documentary wasn't done as well as most documentaries I have seen.It was interesting to learn his life isn't all unicorns and rainbows as I imagined from tabloids and news. Bless his heart to be truthful about his life and I don't see him any differenly except for the fact that all I have seen is him being the best Dad ever. Seems from this ""movie"" that isn't exactly true, but who is the perfect Dad? Every family has their issues and Kuddos to him for being very honest. One thing is for sure, he very much loves his daughter and I hope they continue to have a great relationship per the end of the movie. He is open about what is most important.6 stars because I did find myself fast forwarding through a lot of the ""movie"" as I was bored with a lot of the concert aspect and just wanted to see the interviews mostly..
MGK- if you read this. Keep doing you!! So many people love you and I personally love to see how much you love your fans and treat them with respect.",True
3,10,He doesn't get enough credit,mmprettygirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"MGKs music then and now is amazing and this documentary only gives you a glimpse of his life but enough to see he doesn't deserve all the hatred that's thrown his way. He loves his fans, since day one it's been about his fans and still is today. Love him and hope he never stops making music.",False
4,n/a,Well Made. Who's His Stylist?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know MGK personally but after watching this, I feel like I know him and can relate. I hope he truly is a genuinely nice guy as being portrayed in this film. A hard worker perfectionist who's also very talented. Earned my respect. Wish him continued success. And I dig his style.",False
5,1,No reason,klyons-52504,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was for what reason... none... no point to this waste of time spent trying to figure it out. I am still trying to figure out what I just watched.,False
6,10,Love pink!,restingnurseface,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just saw MGK in Toronto and had so much fun. Everyone was talking about this doc so I thought I'd check it out. I think the people who are bashing this are the same people that have a problem with him changing up his sound. If you're not a fan that's okay, but then just peace out. I enjoyed it, the music was awesome, the behind the scenes was cool. I appreciated his honesty. And I'm so jealous of his pink hair.",False
7,1,Lame documentary on a depressing less than artist,Eljefedejeffy,n/a,16/08/2025,Nothing exciting except to hear how depressing he is and how bad his music is. Also way too long! Might have been digestible if it was 1/3 of the length. Crazy this was made but also that his music is popular. There's nothin rock about this guy.,False
8,10,Respect the honesty.,niccimaynard,n/a,16/08/2025,Very well made documentary. I respect his honesty and his drive to be better. There are great lessons to be leaned in this story and hopefully even the haters can get something out of this.,False
9,1,yuck,moonknightdnb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is trash and needs to go into the bin with all his music, there are so many bots labeling this 10 stars and the best ever. Do they have ears?This just bad, really bad and should be buried with all docos that should not have been maderip.",False
10,9,This movie had Documentary elements we all were missing,arjunkhatanaak,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie felt like it connected to the artist rather than the label controlling everything. Machine gun Kelly and his relations with megan fox and his daughter, his father, his daughter and friends. It was an honest ride and everyone should watch before hating on the artist for the decisions he made in the past.",False
11,1,Garbage,rschiller-80892,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI wanted to watch this doc and change my mind about mgk. But it made it more convincing that he is just an attention seeker, always taking a money grab and acting like hes real but he is just cruising moment to moment and grabbing everyones attention as he goes. Going at eminem.. mistake.. but also opportunity.. switching genres right after and chnaging whole look, sound, pink colors, hair.. poser and his music still sucks.. pretending on his doc that hes suicidal and out of it.. make believe.. to grab attention.. megan fox.. attention.. this guy is the definition of taking advantage of yall...",True
12,10,He is the new rockstar,ycgpwydjj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before hating on mgk watch this documentary it explains his life to the extreme with his highs and lows and when I talk about lows I mean lows like really low he tackles his drug addiction, his family , his music , his mistakes, his really tough life . Life in pink is a great way to say f you to the haters and a good way to say I have Made it . It's extremely emotional and brilliantly crafted he is a great man , father , husband , and musician. And I think it's funny how people are
Making fun of our names bc they seem like bot names haha y'all are stupid 😂",False
13,1,Horrible,mlynncarbajal,n/a,16/08/2025,Not a fan this is horrible and a waist of time it's crazy how bots are giving this 10/10!clearly it's not and it's sad those have to be bought and lie MGK is rude! His personality is trash so is is music.,False
14,10,Well Done MGK,jwmiller-43135,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was long awaited and much needed. It not only showcases the highs of Machine Gun Kelly's career but the plenty lows going on behind the scenes in the life of a rock star. 10/10.,False
15,1,Machine gun? more like potato silencer (spoiler warning),revertobrochacho,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerA good day starts with a positive attitude and a great cup of coffee.I believe there should be a better way to start each day... Instead of waking up every morning.Dumpster fire.,True
16,10,Amazing.,fydthss,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can say what you'd like about Colson but one thing for sure is not only is he a brilliant artist, but that he's also a hard worker, and an amazing father, friend, and husband. He's been riding with his brothers from the beginning and clearly no amount of fame or money has changed that. He hasn't forgotten where he came from. Although I'll never know him personally, you can feel his genuine intent in everything he does. He has overcome and continues to overcome, some hardships that most people will never have to encounter in their lifetime. After all the hurt and loss he's had to endure, he has come out on top, and living larger than life. He deserves every bit of happiness this world has to offer him. We are so proud of you Colson, and I couldn't be any prouder to be a fan of yours. Your music has changed my life.",False
17,1,No real story,briseisj,n/a,16/08/2025,"A drug addict with abandonment issues... bla bla bla. Honestly, he has to dig deep to find the non self-inflicted trauma in his life.There really is no story here.He writes music, and has friends that he works with who are talented at their crafts..I admire anyone who is passionate about their craft and is tenacious despite the knock-backs. So he gets a star for that.",False
18,10,Love filled Amazing documentary,carsonlester-75164,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always loved mgk but this documentary gave me a new found respect for him and his art and made me respect him even more for seeing his journey, I love this documentary it's amazing!! Can't wait to watch it again.",False
19,n/a,Annoying Poser but Respect the Grind,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot stand this guy and the way he presents himself, so full of himself, not to mention hes worse with jewelry than Depp and for someone so ""real"" to be so obsessed with his image seems a bit contraintuitive. And his music is such a rip off from Pixies, Nirvana, generic punk....sometimes down to specific tune.BUT
the guy seems is a great dad, promotes sober lifestyle, takes time for fans and in general has more good rolemodel qualities than not.I guess if the world of today is already so shallow and inauthentic, at least amongst all the weeds let kids watch those that dont promote negative choices and laziness.",False
20,1,A Hair Plug Filled Culture Vulture... Why Do We Need A Documentary?,smithdean-22092,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'd rather sit and watch a 2 hour documentary about Mili-Vanilli or N. K. O. T. B. They are more relevant than this malnourished drug inhaling culture vulture. He contributes ZERO, NOTHING to the music industry.This talentless balding privileged kid from middle class Cleveland Ohio trying to affiliate himself with Cleveland born Bone Thugs-N-Harmony... stealing the ""E. 1999"" Moniker from Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, Wish, & Flesh. And shame on Layzie Bone for doing a mixtape song and video with this blatant culture vulture who come out claiming their hard hip-hop and the minute they get a taste of fame and money... they completely switch to rock music and getting that 9 to 15 year old girls and boys fan base. He tried to and get fame from dissing Eminem & his daughter and succeeded unfortunately. Then he has the gull to throw his daughter into the spotlight on this documentary. His terrible FAKE sad family stories made me puke. I'm only 15 minutes into this terrible idea of a documentary but I'm turning it off ASAP.DEAR COLSIN BAKER... a very privileged white boy from upper middle class beginning... you had and have so many opportunities to thrive and succeed. You were, allegedly, a ""drug addict"" because you had that privilege... not because you grew up in that drug filled environment like 99% of us poor individuals do.DEAR AMERICA... please please quit supporting culture vultures like MGK, POST MALONE, & ECT... they contribute NOTHING to the history of rap, hip-hop, or music in general.Thank you.",False
21,10,life in pink,coltslife-69152,n/a,16/08/2025,A great look at what a great person machine gun kelly is. All around great human being and just like us is just being a human being and trying to navigate thru life.,False
22,1,Horrible,shenzeeb,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe life store of a complete waste of human flesh. Watching mold grow is a better use of time and more entertaining. Not only is he a horrible and talentless rapper, he is also a moron and a horrible human being. This garbage will turn your brain into diarrhea.",True
23,10,GREAT!,shifkdrdz,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's funny how the documentary shows how he has cope up with stuffs, and how haters doesn't effect him that much anymore, and people are still commenting hate here.. Like come on get a job.This documentary is a blast!! I literally cried watching it.",False
24,2,A Normal Guy Who Actually Watched It.,alexjames-58637,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't really understand how there can be 1/10 reviews, firstly why would you even waste your life watching the entire show to then slate it...However, I watched all of it and I've been a growing fan of MGK for a few years - similar age - 30, whose had a troubled life himself and figuring things out.The documentary, whilst alcohol & drugs are mentioned, shows his dedication to the grind and him understanding the negative effects of toxicity in work and lifestyle choices.If you're not close minded and can accept that people can cross blend genres and try something new. Respect! Watch it, understand where Colson came from, he has worked for his career since a young age, he switched genres due to passions and is there anything wrong with that? Not at all.People learn, they grow, they love.Be part of something progressive and don't be caught up in the past, it just leaves you bitter.",False
25,10,Amazing Documentary,twkrys,n/a,16/08/2025,"Going from the bottom to the top
Showing his life from different perspectives that everyone out there have to understand and realises that he is a human being too with his mistakes but also one of the most talented musician at his generation
Shout out to everyone for this film 🙌🏼🙌🏼",False

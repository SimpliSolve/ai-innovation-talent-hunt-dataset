1,6,New frontiers of earth exploitation,marcobrcc,n/a,16/08/2025,"This might not be the documentary of the year, but it is a much-needed investigation into deep-sea mining. It doesn't really clear things up or give us solutions, but it does get you thinking about the whole deal. Its main drawback is apparent in the limited contributions, with only a solitary marine scientist participating in the discourse. On the upside, the documentary offers captivating underwater visuals of marine life/geology and a commendable soundtrack.The biggest issue is the relatively superficial exploration of the uncertainties surrounding mineral extraction from the seabed and its potential ecological impacts. A more comprehensive examination, featuring diverse professional perspectives, could have amplified the documentary's depth. The recent decision by the Norwegian government to authorize seabed mining accentuates the relevance and timeliness of these discussions, particularly in the context of global challenges like the climate crisis.It is commendable just because of the fact that it encourages viewers to scrutinize the actual ecological implications of ostensibly sustainable energy production chains. A reminder that even the supposedly safe harbors might not be so safe. So, are these alternatives actually green, or are we just kidding ourselves? There's no green revolution without batteris and batteries need heavy metals to be manufactures. Overall, it is a cool watch, but it could have taken advantage of more professional insights.",False
2,9,A powerful and timely documentary,tomseaf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unlike most docos of this sort, which tend to appear after something serious has happened and thereby they analyse the damage or the implications of what went on at the time, the central subject of Deep Rising (deep sea mining) is hugely topical right now-whether it commences or not is being decided as we speak. Knowing this while viewing Deep Rising makes it all the more compelling. The story follows two parallel yet opposing protagonists, one a world leading marine geologist, the other a CEO of a mining company. Led by Jason Momoa's rather fitting ""voice of the deep"" and a beautiful score by Olaffur Arnolds, the film is both cinematic (stunning deep sea animals) and politically fascinating. A rare doco in the moment doco.",False
3,10,Stunning and sobering,marcirandall,n/a,16/08/2025,"We all know the seas are in peril from the affects of climate change and overfishing, but when we think of the seas, we never really imagine the the deep seas where we think there's nothing. Well, as it turns out, there's actually a lot going on down there and a lot of interest in disturbing it for political and financial gain.Deep Rising probes the motives and and the consequences of what opening up a new massive mining operation might mean for us and the world and it's certainly concerning.But the film is also balanced very carefully with the beauty of the life down there and we're led through the journey by the voice of Jason Momoa, who at first seemed like an odd or maybe populist choice, but strangely feels just right - deep and emotive.All in all it feels like an important journey into the deep seas that we all need to take!",False
4,n/a,i agree,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It IS a timely documentary...but, in my opinion, it doesn't address a very important point...
that if there were less need for the resources then there wouldn't be a need for this documentary....
in plainer terms, why isn't there a LARGE move, governed by each nation's government, towards a public transportation system that will meet all needs...including individual services for those in need... like the handicapped...or, let's say, a vehicle parked in every neighborhood for emergency(life threatening) situations...and i'm just coming up with possible needs off the top of my head...sure, it would take a LARGE organizational shift...but ULtimately it would reduce the need for the resources now being mined(including drilling) that are SO damaging the ecosphere...
think about it...almost all vehicles spend 90% of their time PARKED...
if each government made it part of their business to make SURE that there was a system to move around it's populace...inexpensively, including it could be a tax...and it prob wouldn't be much...what a difference it would make...
so...once again our species is approaching an important problem from the wrong angle...
and i don't CARE about what people might think is an 'unrealistic solution'. WHY? Because of our addiction to the idea that we're enTItled to move around when and where we want to? Not now that we understand the consequences of this freedom...
we either get these addictions under control or we won't survive...AND we'll be taking most of other life forms with us in our headlong rush into relative extinction...",False
5,10,From wonder to worry.,DranishS,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into ""Deep Rising"" not 100% sure what I'd be seeing (I'd been led to believe it was more of a scientific and natural world tale of the deep sea) but I came out 100% persuaded of the the peril to this mysterious and wonderful place that covers so much of our planet. It genuinely surprised me. Sure the footage is absolutely stunning-strange glowing creatures, vast black expanses, shimmering particles that look like stars, but the underlying peril we learn about on a journey we're led on by the two protagonists - a miner with invested aims on plunder and a scientist with a deep desire to preserve and protect take us on a balanced journey to a position that is left in the balance but leaning to one of undoubted concern.To begin with, it felt like watching the bottom of the ocean breathe. But then the film slowly brings in this whole other side-the companies planning to mine the seafloor for metals. And yet, we've barely explored these parts of our planet, and we're already trying to extract things from them. It made me feel a strange mix of wonder and dread. I couldn't stop thinking about how disconnected we are from these hidden worlds and how quickly we move to dominate them. The documentary doesn't lecture-it just quietly builds this atmosphere of beauty and unease. I left feeling both amazed and unsettled, like I'd seen something sacred that we might destroy before we understand it. It's great that someone is finally shining a light on this conveniently dark and utterly crucial place.",False
6,9,A stark warning wrapped in deep beauty,SaniK-10,n/a,16/08/2025,"Underlying this seemingly balanced deep sea science and geopolitical documentary is a simple but very important message, are we about to make another catastrophic mistake in the pursuance of resources. I pray we don't.The movie takes us on a dark journey, both figurative and literal. While the literal darkness is spliced with light, in the form of absolutely stunning deep sea footage, the figurative form less such opportunities for balance due to our evolving understanding that we are on another fast track towards a dire outcome which can only be bad for us and the only question is, how soon will we reap the seeds of this new calamity should we embark on a path of plunder. The film left me deeply (no need to pardon the pun) concerned and left me wanting to take action. I'm guessing this is it's implicit aim. In which case well done indeed.",False
7,5,Takes a long time to get to the point which never seems to arrive.,Statler-Waldorf,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was hoping for an informative and thought provoking analysis of the merits and risks of a newly discovered source of minerals for future auto industry technology. Instead I couldn't help thinking it might just be an anti-EV propaganda hit job from the fossil fuel industry.The ""fly-on-the-wall"" view of various meetings and functions does leave the viewer somewhat to their own thoughts, which helps to make it seem vaguely impartial. The dull bits are interspersed with some stunning underwater video of various unusual deep sea creatures that would very likely be affected by the sediment plumes created by the proposed mineral extraction along with examples of anti-mining protestors. But this subject has been summed up much more succinctly and clearly by others including the Just Have a Think channel on YT.",False

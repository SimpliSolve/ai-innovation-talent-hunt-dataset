1,1,A war on abortion is its title..,atischoo,n/a,16/08/2025,"That should really be ..a war on the population ..but not for the reasons you might think..As usual what documentaries like this fail to do is explore..the future!And what's coming in America's future is the same as EVERY country that adopted an abortion on demand policy...the ""Demographic Time Bomb"" ie. A rapidly aging population which can no longer sustain a country's economy, healthcare & welfare systems...think about that for a moment!By the end of this decade Ms Khan will need to make another documentary about our solution to defusing the oncoming massive crisis caused by having sustained record high abortion rates and record low birth rates..as that solution is going to change the world..!",False

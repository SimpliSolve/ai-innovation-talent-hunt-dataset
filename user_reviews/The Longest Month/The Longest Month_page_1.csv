1,10,Best Military documentary I have seen!,kevinyoakum,n/a,15/08/2025,"The honest interviews of the pilots and ground crews involved make this documentary much more intimate than most, watching it you feel like you are talking with friends.",False
2,10,Tip of the Spear,james-a-wilson1,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Longest Month tells the story of the men and women fighting at the top of the spear - an Apache helicopter battalion - during the height of ""the surge"" in Iraq. These are important stories to be told and The Longest Month does it masterfully.",False
3,10,Proud to Support,squaife,n/a,15/08/2025,The Apache airframe is unique and to fly it so are the pilots. To disregard your life to ensure your brothers and sisters on the ground come home is the best honor. Thank you for remembering those who gave all so we can honor their legacy. Attack!,False
4,10,Real. Unbiased. Stories told by soldiers who were there.,jake_gaston,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stories like these often die with the soldiers who lived them - because they are too difficult to tell. This documentary found a way. Real stories. Real attack pilots. Real soldiers. No scripts. Their words. If you want to know what it was like to be in the cockpit of an Apache gunship in the skies over Baghdad during the surge, this is as close as you'll get.",False
5,9,They got it right!,bdavila-60585,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having been there to witness these stories first hand, I was thoroughly impressed as to how they got the stories right. It is not easy to reenact or go that deep into the details and this documentary does this and does it well! These stories need to be told and more importantly they need to be heard! Well done!",False
6,10,Excellent accounting of events,jacksonchris-38585,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been waiting on this film for quite a while and was excited for the release. I was not disappointed. Having served during the same deployment (in a sister unit) and being involved in many of the events depicted, the accounts portrayed were as real as it gets. Well done!",False
7,10,Great documentary,mrsmartinez-74410,n/a,15/08/2025,The interviews were great.. the footage was so real and raw. This documentary made you experience a true glimpse of what this unit faced and went through overseas.

8,10,A must watch,onlythingleft,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a great documentary! Another part of Air Cav history with real stories, photos, and footage giving a small glimpse of what went on at the height of the surge in Iraq. You can feel the emotions from the soldiers who lived it as they share their part. These are stories and events that need to be shared.",False
9,10,"Incredible, Truthful film about the intense aerial combat in Iraq",gundrvr-20082,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the true story of America's Apache pilots in the Iraq war. A true unbiased account of the intense combat the Apache pilots endured during the heaviest of fighting in OIF. For those that want to know the rest of the story, that the main stream media could not show or talk about, this is what you've been waiting for. These Apache pilots showed the enemy the full capabilities that the aircraft has, it showed that the Apache could bring on some incredible firepower and was able to absorb multiple hits from various weapons and continue the fight. Highly recommend this film be viewed by all Americans, especially before Memorial day, to understand what these Apache pilots did to save our brothers and sisters on the ground.",False
10,n/a,Offal as tools by jingoistic jarheads,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've nothing against anyone in any military force. Still, I found the idea of anyone making the fight for a(ny nation's sovereignty into some quasi-mythical claptrap ridiculous, overbearing, and dangerous.Fighting isn't anything to be proud of. The American revolutionaries who fought for the birth of the States didn't think anything like today's lunacy. They fought because they had to become free.It might sound slightly clich√©, but I'll take a quote from Captain of the Enterprise, James T. Kirk, who was trying to help destroy a supposed several-millennia-old creator of their society by leaving his intelligence but not his soul or compassion in the eponymously named 'Landreau' computer.But when it was time for that final thrust to face Landreau, finally, whatever it might be, the two people of the planet suddenly became hesitant. Reticent.Captain Kirk said one must fight for freedom, which isn't freely given.That's more in the spirit of fighting for one's freedom I'm referring to.The French who overthrew their monarchy, and, even when the Soviet Union collapsed, that's exactly what those Russians who wanted to maintain freedom did when they fought the remaining old communist oligarchy who decided to stage an overthrow.I know many people around the world who were alive when Boris Yeltsin, a former Communist apparatchik, appeared from virtually nowhere and said, 'enough'!That's what fighting's about.It's not about mostly testosterone-pumped, not much upstairs types who think that 'fighting' means becoming a marine or some such nonsense.If someone wishes to join their nation's military just for that (such as this film's speakers), it's a waste of my time, and it should be a waste of your time.",False

1,8,"Mostly Mommy, Not Much Concert",Kamandi73,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love her concerts, they are amazing. Pink is a gymnast, singer, in top shape, a genius level mind, an astonishing person. This film spends about 65% of the time on her interaction with her husband and kids.The message is that her family and her career are equally balanced. She mentions balance a few times. In the prayer prior to the Wembley Stadium concert, she and her band and dancers pray for balance between good and evil, and balance in life. The movie is very touching, and I shed a tear here and there.I was hoping for another great concert movie, but seeing Pink and her life as a Mother and a human being were very real. What a positive family environment for her band, singers, dancers, gymnasts, and crew!",False
2,9,What a human!,vera-94936,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was an absolute joy to watch! I laughed and cried and sang. Such a good documentary, well balanced and it had some incredible shots. Loved this movie.",False
3,9,Now we know too,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love Pink and her music ... there is nothing more I need to add. Not sure how this will play if you actually hate her music ... maybe you'll be skipping the songs/performances to watch a really good behind the scenes documentary and a build up to one of the most amazing concerts in the last couple of years.Pink is a phenomenal artist and musician. She also is quite the interesting human being. With an incredible family ... and a life that you may envy her for ... not always easy, but in the end rewarding. Another example of concert movie done well.",False
4,n/a,Alecia Moore as P!NK slays it one more time.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I watched this at home on Amazon streaming on its first night of availability. I suppose my quick summary is ""never a dull minute."" We knew Alecia during the 1990s in Philly, she even babysat for our young twin boys when she was 14 or 15 and trying to make it with her early bands. Even though she had a rebellious attitude she was great with those boys and we can see it now with her two young children. We love Alecia.The program wisely mixes clips from Pink's rehearsals and performances, and includes a heavy dose of her interactions with her husband and her two small children as they all go from place to place around the world, quite a scheduling and juggling task. It will be interesting to see how the kids recall all this when they are older, say in their 20s.Being a total Pink fan, I like her singing and her personality and this documentary is just great. To me she can do no wrong. I will view it again.",False
5,10,Worth the wait!,rachaelevans-01884,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been a huge P!nk fan for years and have been waiting weeks for this to be released and it did not disappoint. This film shows how down to earth and just flipping awesome she actually is, juggling an amazing World Tour and motherhood, hats off to her, love, love, loved it!!!",False
6,10,ALL THE FEELS,lilykin,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great behind the scenes look at the beautiful trauma tour. P!nk is fiercely loyal, wickedly talented, fantastically strong, and a performer who I will adore, admire and follow till the world explodes. A tender soul with a cracked shell, an ambitious and creative visionary and a devoted momma and wife. She's just all the damn things. I admire few, but I surely admire her. And good lord she can sing. What an icon! Turn up the volume, sing loud and dance like you don't care!",False
7,10,Absolutely Amazing,angeletawashington,n/a,16/08/2025,You can feel her soul every time she performs. An absolutely amazing artist and mother. Continue being an inspiration P! NK!,False
8,10,LOVE LOVE LOVE,kmroman-10763,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerOk I didn't have many expectations before this. Now Goosebumps! So many emotions during the entire documentary. Her family is absolutely beautiful and amazing! She's so crazy talented but also a great mother and friend! I have so much more respect for her now.I'd watch this again! Highly recommend!!!,True
9,7,"P!nk the live performer, P!nk the creative artist, P!nk the loving mother",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""All I Know So Far"" (2021 release; 99 min.) is a concert film about P!nk's June 29, 2019 show at a sold out Wembley Stadium in London. While of course there is plenty of footage of the actual show itself, there is also plenty of behind-the-scenes looks at the preparations for such a massive stadium show but it also takes a personal turn when we see P!nk's frequent interactions with her young daughters. The mother's love is undeniable and obvious.Couple of comments: this concert film is directed by none other than Michael Gracey, who directed the critical and commercial smash ""The Greatest Showman"". (He also was involved with the Elton John biopic ""Rocketman"".) Gracey does a good job of mixing up the concert footage with the backstage stuff and more personal moments. Understandably, the set that P!nk brought is heavy on both the ""Beautiful Trauma"" and ""Hurts 2B Human"" albums, although there are still plenty of old nuggets and a number of choice cover songs to be enjoyed.As an aside, today also saw the release of the live P!nk album ""All I Know So Far: Setlist"" (16 tracks; 69 min.), which focuses solely on the music. But it does not bring the entire Wembley setlist (neither does the concert film). Bottom line: there surely will be something in the documentary and in the live album that will please many P!nk fans.",False
10,10,Up Close and Personal,callieanneclarke,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an utterly bewitching portrait of a true musical icon and equal rights advocate, plus dedicated mother. I don't know how she finds the hours in the days depicted in this documentary.",False
11,7,A great Pink with a family on her sid,DLochner,n/a,16/08/2025,A wonderful documentary about a woman who tries to put family above everything. The documentary gives a good insight into the daily chaos and the organization that are necessary to bring a Welz and family under one roof. A nice focus that I like a lot. But too less about her personal life and motivation.,False
12,10,Loved,suzandyson,n/a,16/08/2025,It left me wanting to watch more. What an amazing woman!!!,False
13,7,Good fun,joeyford-55342,n/a,16/08/2025,"We've seen her twice. Great show. This is the inside family stuff and behind stage. Some silly liberal stuff, weird for a military brat. Fun.",False
14,5,It's basically her telling the world I'm a good mom,jakethesnake-42007,n/a,16/08/2025,I love pink and this documentary showed that she's an amazing person on the stage and off. The problem was its 90 min of Pink just saying how much she loves her family and how she is as a mother. I get it but 90 min is too much. It's basically links way of telling the world I'm a good mother.,False
15,10,Best documentary in a long time!,laurenagnew,n/a,16/08/2025,Definitely worth a watch for anyone that enjoys P!nk's music! I only managed to attend one of her concerts but still to this day she has been the best live act I have ever seen! I would definitely love to attend another concert. This documentary was amazing and I enjoyed seeing every minute out of including the interactions with her husband and kids...she's an amazing lady and should be so proud!,False
16,10,Great Documentary,Dog-River,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of P!nk's since I was a kid. Her and her music have gotten me through a lot throughout the years. I love how down-to-earth she is and her voice is out of this world fantastic, as is shown in the documentary. I enjoyed watching her be a mom and her kids are adorable. I love the way she and Carey are raising them, always making sure they know how much they're loved and letting them run around and just be kids. It was interesting seeing the behind the scenes process of putting on a world tour and I love how close she is with her team/village. She's a true role model and I absolutely adore her. I highly recommend watching this documentary.",False
17,10,Enjoyed each and every second of it!,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was intrigued by P!nk: All I Know So Far and enjoyed each and every second of it, from its realistic aspect to the behind-the-scenes showing them working on the performances. We see that P!nk loves her family just as much as she loves performing and how she makes time for both. Each and every part of this documentary is amazing.This documentary gives the audience an inside peek into the life of P!nk as a performer and a mom, while counting down to one of the biggest moments in her life - her 2019 Wembley Stadium performance. This film gives you a taste of all the hard work that P!nk and her team put into every performance. Plus, it shows how she balances her profession with being a mother of two and being absolutely great at both.The beginning of P!nk: All I Know So Far pulled me in immediately as it gave me the feeling that I was about to see something incredible. And, I was one hundred percent right; I love everything about this documentary. I loved seeing the honest and hardworking P!nk on screen. She conveys how hard being the boss can be, especially as a woman in this industry. In P!nk's case, her team respects her and is committed to perfecting their performance as they practice dance moves and rework blocking to make things easier on P!nk. This film shows you that Pink is just as human as the rest of us. She may be a singer with many hits, but at the end of the day, she is back with her family doing what most people do. She wants to be a great mom and that's the main reason she brings her kids on tour with her. Seeing how much P!nk loves her family brings a calm and heartwarming aspect to the film. I learned a lot about P!nk that I didn't know before and that helped me understand her better. I love seeing P!nk give advice to her younger self as well as to her kids. I found myself learning some things to use in my own life. My favorite thing was, ""Lead by example, work hard."" She does both as she participates in this beautiful but overwhelming business, while absolutely killing it. You might find yourself learning new things about the pop-star P!nk and you will be inspired by what is on screen.This film really shows audiences how much hard work P!nk puts into her art. We usually only see the final product of P!nk being on stage. This shows the ups and downs she goes through as a performer and how she deals with everything thrown at her.I give P!nk: All I Know So Far 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. P!nk: All I Know So Far can be streamed on Amazon Prime now.Reviewed by Hazel A., KIDS FIRST!",False
18,10,Beautiful,ricramey2000,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely, loved this documentary! Great work putting this video together. Kept my attention.",False
19,7,This gave me such growing pains!,MyMovieTVRomance,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hated the part about her daughter wanting to go be with her friends and the separation anxiety that triggered for me- yes, I could feel it- or something. It reminded me how opposite I am to most people, I never got what was so cool about leaving home, and I never wanted to grow up- cause I knew better- even as a child.But yes, P!nk is such a vibrant and caring soul. Her kids and friends are lucky! Her spouse is lucky too- and she's lucky to have him. I truly admire how they make it work and are so right for each-other and so committed. At times, this does come across as a bit of an ego-stroking film, but even as full of herself she might seem at little moments, it's still impossible not to love her, cause of her genuine nature and her warmth.Good behind-the-scenes concert-type doc.",False
20,10,"A beautiful soul, family, documentary",geegsforu,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a fabulous documentary. She really is a wonderful, down to earth, respectful human being. Her tour is more like a family adventure. Her own personal family and her touring family. All of them together gives us an insight into what makes an artist like Pinks tours such a joy. It's not all about Pink and she herself says she doesn't feel intimidated by the talent that surrounds her. If anything, they all work hard together to deliver something quite extraordinary!Feel inspired, emotional and filled with Joy watching this super mum and dad raise a beautiful family against a hectic yet passionate filled back drop!Incredible!",False
21,10,Nothing But Love!,mcuba-251-570451,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the beginning to the end I had goosebumps. Pink is an amazing person, mom, and artist. This behind the scene look at the day to day as well as portions of her performances on tour was great. Will be watching this again 💗",False
22,3,Way too much footage of children running around,lauradaveyemail,n/a,16/08/2025,Not a great watch. I turned it off after 20 mins. It was mostly pink's kids squealing and dangling on things. Not much interesting content and definitely felt like an agenda to show the world how balanced in Mom life Pink is. Pass for me. Maybe the die hard fans will enjoy it.,False
23,10,Pink is the one to watch,Shadow2442,n/a,16/08/2025,"This one is personal. After all those years, I fell in love how she sings, what kind of human being she is and how she manages all the success and still is able to grow and manages her family. Tbh just find one word: AMAZING. Even if you don't necessarely like her music you have to admin that she is one hell of an artist. Kinda grew up with here music and helped me through all the lows and highs. Personally I adore here and love her music. This documentation shows an in depth look at her way of managing everything and how she is able to be the super-artist and super-mom and wife at the same time. Please keep on rock'n rolling for many years and fill the hearts of all your dedicated fans all over the world with joy and hope. One day, I really hope I can see you live. Thank you for everything.",False
24,10,Ah-mazing!,katstraughan,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't normally write reviews but this deserves it. So worth the wait. She made you feel like we are a part of her family. Thank you Alecia! This had me from start to finish - and the credits.,False
25,10,Superwoman!,dianelisms,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this documentary I felt I could have watched it for 3 more hours. We all know she is a great singer, but what a great human being P!nk is!! We can see her as a mother, as a performer, as a friend, and she is so genuine! Hope I can see more documentaries like this from P!nk.",False

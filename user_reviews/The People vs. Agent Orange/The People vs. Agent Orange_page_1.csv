1,8,Horror of War & Beyond Exposed - On Par With Hiroshima.,AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being far from any kind of activism you might dismiss ""The People vs. Agent Orange"" as only for ""Tree-Huggers"" and related types. Within a couple of minutes, however, you sense the worst of corporate and government malfeasance. I'm not talking about government waste of our tax dollars - I'm talking about the government using and allowing the use of a known toxic substance. And yes, there was a big chemical giant corporation receiving large sums of ""blood money"" which certainly included our taxes in order to push the use of this killer chemical.Our story begins in Vietnam in the early sixties with a program ran by The Air Force called ""Operation Ranchhand"". To defoiliate the dense vegetation used by enemy snipers as cover a chemical compuund began to be liberally sprayed non-stop in Vietnam. It was quite early on in this on-going operation serious side-effects on humans, animals, and living organisms began to show up. The armed forces couldn't get enough of the stuff and by 1971 it was known over 11 million gallons (undiluted) had covered vast areas of Vietnam.Under the guise of getting the upper hand in the war the government exercised almost no due dilegence in the use of so-called Agent Orange. Dow Chemical actually knew early on that the compound posed health risks yet to meet the demand fast tracked a particularly nasty version in order to make massive profits and meet the government's huge demand. By the late sixties it was apparent, however, that there were grave health risks. In '71 they sent Air Force scientist Dr. James Clary to conduct an investigation. He just barely beat the mass destruction of all records of the operation and compiled a very e ""smoking gun"" report of the array of side-effects that coincided the program. As such his report was immediately classified as top secret. The damning report was immediately classified and spraying was stopped around 1971. This should have been the end of the use of the dioxin laced compound, but it wasn't. The death chemical then came home to the US being used by The Department of Agriculture and the logging industry. This time it was liberally sprayed in the Western United States. This begs the question: why? Greed and profiteering is the logical only take-away.This pans out to be the most toxic chemical ever devised by humanity being on the level of plutonium for deadly side-effects It doesn't go away either. It keeps being toxic for an unbelivable million year half-life. The whole mess defies moral judgement as this film certainly scrapes the surface of.Everyone needs to see this film. This is the worst case of malefeasance of world health by any government. Broadly speaking all herbicides are poisonous and in particular those related to Agent Orange being the worst or a truly horrible lot. One cannot help but be appauled by the deliberate poisoning of our world. It must be noted there is a woman in this doc that has suffered the worst from related events and instead of folding she found exceptional courage as you will see here. She is a fighter and along with another exceptional French Vietnamese woman a real profile in courage. I advise you to watch.",False
2,8,Well made and very disturbing,spamsucks31,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew Agent Orange was used in Vietnam but was unaware it was used and is still being used in the US. The film follows two women, one in Vietnam and one in Oregon who lives were devastated by the US governement's spraying of this extremely toxic substance. There is a lot of information to digest (and FYI it runs almost 90 minutes not 55) but it keeps your attention and makes you angry.",False
3,8,"Savage, but Beautiful",yoginimaura,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a subject that is immensely disturbing, there is a visual beauty that serves to help the viewer through it. It is beautifully made. There is so much to admire about the principals, women, who have been waging the battle against the purveyors of Agent Orange, for decades, both in Vietnam and the United States. In spite of unspeakable loss, they carry on and fight the inexorable fight. It is unbelievably inspiring. Pandemic notwithstanding, this is a really important topic. I marvel at the filmmakers who were able to stick with it and get it done. Thank you.",False
4,10,"VIETNAM WAR = MUTILATIONS, MASS MURDER = MONEY! AMERICAN CITIZENS WAR = MUTILATIONS, MASS MURDER = CORRUPTION, GREED & MONEY!",silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember as a young teenager watching something on a television broadcast about, ""AGENT ORANGE"". They were telling the viewers that it was a vital aid in gaining a victory over the Vietnamese Vietcong Communists; it was to make the land infertile, unable to grow crops, and therefore would destroy the Vietcong's ability to grow food! Even back then (with no in depth knowledge of the corrupt covert operations of the C. I. A and the American government of the time...still going on to this very day) I knew it was wrong and was propaganda BS of false flag information!53 years later! It was with profound disgust, sadness and anger that I was once again watching a broadcasting of a story informing me (and both the peoples of America and Vietnam) that the ""AGENT ORANGE"" catastrophe did not end with the Vietnam War. Two heroic ladies are locked in a fight (that is every bit as vicious, corrupt and dangerous) to hold the manufacturers accountable. Millions of acres of land were destroyed, the follow up was horrendous, resulting in horrific health issues that included many forms of both heart and lung disease, type-2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Leukemia and absolute inhuman deformities in unborn children. The most outrageous and diabolical disgusting news - that we hear in this documentary - is that Agent Orange is still being used to this day (in one form or another). The the big OMG surprise is that this time it is being used against the people of America...children, men, women/pregnant women, the land, the wildlife. Its contaminating water (even worse than the Fracking of land) and once again it is killing on an unprecedented scale!The powers that be, who have the vast wealth, have pulled every dirty trick in the book to squash the legal cases against them. This includes Paying Doctors to say the illnesses/deaths are not caused by ""AGENT ORANGE"", having people threatened (including one of the female activists children), buying off the judicial systems Judges and (because of propaganda lies to the likes of the logging workers) are responsible for the deaths of 3 children who were murdered in their home, that was burnt to the ground; so badly that only the concrete base foundation base remained...and the police covered it up, even after being told by the Fire Dept that it was arson!When America's government shouts out about the inhumane chemical weapons use against populations (most recently being Syria's President) they are so hypocritical! They have inflicted more harm than anyone, with the use of the chemical weapon ""AGENT ORANGE"", over 53 years; more than any other country in either war time or peacetime!The world should watch this, the world's youth should have this included in their school history lessons. Most important though is that the American people should be aware of how little their countries power mogul's care about them; Vietnam veteran's died from ""AGENT ORANGE"" and veterans were still dying years later when the military introduced the use of Plutonium tipped shells etc!If you happen to watch this must see documentary I must warn you, some of the scenes you will view you will find EXTREMELY upsetting!",False
5,10,"Everybody needs to watch this! Vegans of Oregon, where are you?!",imdb-25288,n/a,16/08/2025,"Devastating what they did to millions of people. Spraying these Agent Orange chemicals they used in Vietnam. This is the Hiroshima of Vietnam and Oregon. Why aren't the tattooed Xellennial woke misguided activists protesting this? The effects linger. Babies born with missing limbs or deformed heads, when they aren't miscarried. This affects us all.They spray this garbage and for what? For Dow's profit, of course, but what do they claim to accomplish? This is insane. I cheered when I saw they had shot down one spraying helicopter, as all throughout this documentary, I been wondering why no one ""took care"" of that. I mean they're committing mass murders, this is self-defense. Send a message! And they did. But sadly, it's not enough. Why do they care about the workers' lives? Do THEY care about the people's lives?!One lady got her house burned down with her four young children inside. FOUR! And they still deny this causes harm. I wanted to punch the moron who, on camera, claimed this wasn't more harmful than aspirin. REALLY!? Why do they even have to kill weeds in nature? Those PNW herbs are healing medicinals. They can't do that! But they are. And it kills fawns and birds and pets and all kinds of wildlife too. Somebody help those poor people!And don't say ""move"" because nature needs to remain wild and herbs and forests there provide rare medicinals that are now forevermore contaminated and it continues. I can't believe they produced this in 2020. I can't believe nobody got rid of the perpetrators. The only way to stop this, because most corrupt chemical companies would sell their newborn for a buck. You know this is true. It's still happening to this day. 10/10 and anyone who rated it less does not have a soul nor a conscience! God bless the nice little Vietnamese old lady, I didn't catch her name. A must watch. Now.",False

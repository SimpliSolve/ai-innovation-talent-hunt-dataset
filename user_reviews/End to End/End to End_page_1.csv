1,6,End to End,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"George Ezra genuinely comes across as a decent human being here. A man who appreciates his success with quite some degree of humility. Getting on for ten years after his ""Budapest"" song made him famous, he and lifelong friends Christy Tattershall and Adam Scarborough give themselves three months to walk the length of mainland Great Britain from Land's End to John O'Groats. As the lads travel this 1,000-odd mile trip, they encounter some local musicians and generally chat about their early lives and of how success arrived and changed his life. Ezra is a charming and unassuming fellow who comes across well, but after about fifteen minutes I felt that I was intruding into a rather personal, and frankly not very interesting, home movie with three guys who had been friends for a very long time and who didn't really have anything that illuminating to say to me. Now, I am the first to say that if I set off on a walk of that proportion with my nearest and dearest, it probably wouldn't be that interesting for others either, so I don't want to be too critical - but after a while the ennui set in. Whilst they certainly appeared to be doing the walking across some of our country's most beautiful and rugged scenery, they clearly had support vehicles (they were most definitely not carrying their chunky survival tents) which made me want to cry foul a bit. That'd be a bit mean spirited though - it's a PR exercise for an amiable singer and his mates that is watchable and forgettable...",False
2,10,FANTASTIC!!! 10/10,verahull,n/a,16/08/2025,"Three best friends, Christy Tattershall, Adam Scarborough, George Ezra, decided to walk from Lands End to John o' Groats.It took them 95 days (over 3 months!!) totalling 1215 miles!!!!I Absolutely LOVED IT!The ups the downs post lockdown. The songs George sang - ahhh, wonderful, blissful. His voice is so soothing. What a talent. Meeting his second cousin and finding out music is in his DNA.Meeting other musicians.THE MIDGES. I laughed so much.The lads all enjoyed the pace of life this afforded them. The joy was tangible. I've got three brothers, and being the only girl had it's challenges. But I'd love to have these three as brothers. Just to hang out with them.Delightful young men.Near the end of the trip George looking at the beauty surrounding him said, "" You can only see this if you hike."" Made me think.This really was a once in a lifetime experience and to have recorded it for us to watch was an amazing idea. I really Hope they do another series on something else. Great guys. A credit to their families. Highly recommend.",False
3,9,"real, authentic, genuine, inspiring",Moobee,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film took you on the journey walking with these 3 on a personal trip from the end of the south to the end of north of Britain which took them 3 months of hardcore experiences, away from the comfort of homes and indoor life. It leads to a sincere conclusion as one of the men Christy Tattershall put it, the end is just the end, the confirmation that the individual moment and path of each day are the answers of the journey. 9 out 10 of a film, it made you falling in love with Ezra and understand his music with a more personal connection.The landscape of the UK is another main character especially Scotland, the generosity of the land opens up his music, one could feel the spirit of his latest album, Gold Rush baby, which is not about the western landscape in the US but the open space in between a person's mind and one's the connection with the land.",False
4,10,What a delight,sandra-94249,n/a,16/08/2025,"I needed something to watch that was light and didn't require to much concentration and I happened upon this. Oh my what delight.George Ezra and his two best friends Adam and Christie embark on a walk from Lands End to John O'Groats, 1215 miles. They meet a few musicians along the way (what is lovely is that these musicians are not famous stars, but local musicians to the area, one actually was a second cousin in a brass band).The scenery is fabulous, the midges looked horrendous. They camped along the way, with George playing his guitar and singing a few songs, lucky friends. No posh hotels, but clearly they had a support vehicle, but spending 3 months on this trip you would need one and I certainly wouldn't begrudge them that.I highly recommend it and I will certainly watch it again.",False
5,9,"Landscape, adventure and music",championarthur,n/a,16/08/2025,"The context is No10s covid lockdowns, mask wearing and other mind-bending mandates. Perhaps some of the motivation comes from a feeling if performance burn out? George and his two mates decide to break free into the wonderful British countryside. It's an epic adventure interspersed with musical interludes along the way. One of the highlights is their quick visit to Glastonbury but there's just the pyramid stage in an empty field. George tells his remarkable stage story with flashbacks. The landscape, the banter and the music blend nicely together. However, I would have liked more information about the places they passed through. Attacks by the infamous Scottish midge evoke deep sympathy!",False
6,10,Inspirational story of three life long friends taking on a genuinely difficult journey together,dizzeness,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thanks, George, and your two long time mates for even thinking about taking this on. In reality it's a seriously tough journey that very few people could even enremotely appreciate.So many aspects stand out, true heiftiendship, endurance, determination and yet the ultimate message that the most important thing in life is how much we make of the events along the way. Midges are a nightmare that need to be experienced to genuinely understand what a horrible effect they can have on your morale.But a hugely overwhelming part of this film, and for me a very personal thing that I have also endured, is the way that you highlight the incredible beauty of the land that 1we live in.",False

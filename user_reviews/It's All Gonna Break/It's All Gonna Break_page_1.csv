1,8,Late Nineties Bedroom Doc for the People,trondrew,n/a,17/08/2025,"I fell in love with these musicians so hard. It started with Metric in the fall of 2004 at the Pyramid Cabaret in Winnipeg. They opened for Hot Hot Heat, and a friend of mine who lived in Toronto said, ""just go"".It completely changed me, and maybe the 50 other people there. Finding out about BSS, and looking to find out about every person in that band.Finding ways to see them all live together, and separately. It shaped me at the perfect time in my life. So in a weird way, this was like hanging out with old friends you barely know, or that you only hung out with parties.This documentary threw that time back at me like a warm blanket, and just made me happy, and nostalgic. A must watch if you've ever found yourself in a swamp of BSS adjacent music.",False

1,1,Who organised this?,chris_rowe-881-168820,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love their music I think they're wildly talented and brighten up days but this was genuinely one of the worst things I've ever seen on tv and made me like them less, not the music, but as people.They come across, unnatural, narcissistic and unable to communicate in a non scripted manor, the conversation is forced and cheesy and just very cringe. The bits of music they do are great but the cheesy fake cut aways are some are the most embarrassing things I've watched on a Disney thing.The two black guys seemed likeable, the rest not so much, thee was nothing here at all natural, having that guy from ""superstore"" was a strange move and he looked awful on screen.There's nothing funny, interesting or worth watching, just cringe fake positivity and people trying to look natural whilst just coming across as corny stereotypical showbiz Americans, maybe it's cultural, if a uk group did something this cheesy the hate they'd get would finish them. Maybe USA don't mind,Just stick to the music until you feel like you can be naturals on camera in these kinda settings.",False

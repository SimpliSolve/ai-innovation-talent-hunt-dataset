1,8,"Emotional, Engaging, and Captivating",peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.A solid moving and motivating documentary about the journey of youth individuals part-taking in speech competitions and the journeys throughout their preparations. The filmmakers have a clear vision of what they are desiring to present with their documentary regarding its theme and presentation. Being able to witness and connect with the youth who are challenging themselves and going through to achieve their goals, having a voice and preparing for the most important moments of their lives. You are able to really connect with the participants and feel for what they desire and wanting to see what they go through from the beginning to end.As oratory speeches are interesting competitions and this doc does a good job on exploring it's topic with some great insights from the participants and some good moving moments. While presentation wise and stlisitcallly isn't grand and has a familiar structure and admittedly, being a bit biased when it comes to score composition, it's still a nice emotional journey to witness.Having said, an emotional adventure leaves a good impact.",False

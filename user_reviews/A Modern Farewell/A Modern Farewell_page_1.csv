1,9,A Modern Farewell,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a lovely farewell tribute to the much loved comedy, with full input from all of the cast.When it was good, 'Modern Family' was really good, and I'm sure has earned its place amongst the best sitcoms of all time.",False
2,10,A tribute to eleven years of good clean family entertainment filled with joy,Ed-Shullivan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mrs. Shullivan and I like many other families and couples have watched the Pritchett's, Dunphy's and the Tucker's from their respective living rooms, kitchens and of course their bedrooms entertain us these past eleven (11) years. It would be unfair to write a negative review on their personal tribute show just because they didn't include so many of the wonderful moments that we remembered, or didn't include some of our favorite cameo appearances such as Chazz Palminteri, Rob Riggle, Steve Zahn, Peyton Manning, George Brett, and/or Mira Sorvino just to name a few.Suffice to say we thank the entire Modern Family cast, supporting cast and cameo appearances, writers, producers, directors and all those hard working backlot workers who kept this comedy series fresh and so much fun, week in, week out, year after year.You will be missed greatly!",False

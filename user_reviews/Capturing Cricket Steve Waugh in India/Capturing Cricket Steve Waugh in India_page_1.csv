1,8,The beauty of cricket,wix99,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a beautiful documentary about Steve Waugh, about cricket and about India. The thing that shines through is Waugh's love for India and India's passion for cricket. Waugh criss-crosses the country capturing cricketers playing in all kinds of conditions. There are young players of great talent, Tibetan monks and blind cricketers. It is also great to see many girls and young women playing the game. After watching this documentary I was left with the impression that India will be a superpower of cricket for many years to come.",False

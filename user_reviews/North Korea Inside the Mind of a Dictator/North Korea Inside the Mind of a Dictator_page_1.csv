1,7,Not shown here in the States in the same form as the original.,planktonrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was VERY confused when I found a copy of this documentary. After all, IMDB indicates it's about 90 minutes and I noticed a lot of comments about Donald Trump in the reviews...but this is NOT what I saw. The YouTube documentary was only 45 minutes and Trump was never mentioned once...nor was John Bolton. So, after doing a bit of research, I realized I was shown the first half of the documentary....and so I looked on YouTube for the second half. They are differentiated by the first being labeled ""Dictator's Dilemma"" and the second ""Taking the World Stage"". It's confusing, I know.As far as the two halves go, the first portion is MUCH better...more interesting and better paced. The second focuses a lot on the meetings between Un and Trump...which should have been mentioned but which took up WAY too much of the show.Overall, my recommendation is that you watch the first portion....and the second is easy to skip but not terrible.By the way, it's VERY odd that the show never mentioned Un's first big sick behaviors once he gained power. Having his uncle killed and also having five people killed by shooting them with an anti-aircraft gun, mortars and more weird, sick methods...it sure sounds like something they should have mentioned.",False
2,7,Good and informative Documentary,candycrush-25752,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very good an informative documentary that gives you some insight into North Korea, and Kim Jong Un! Not much more to say really, just your basic Documentary about Kim Jong Un and North Korea.",False
3,8,More of an update,davewass,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am someone who is intrigued with DPRK, I thought it may show something different but it's more ""here's the latest in DPRK"".We have the same problem as them we only allowed to see what our governments allow us to see so is it just another chance to put DPRK down.",False
4,4,Nothing special,greghughes-51668,n/a,16/08/2025,"Listening to journalists and John Bolton talk about Kim is wildly underwhelming. The whole second half is just a bizarre puff piece about Trump and Kim complete with romance jazz. If you want a look into North Korean culture, look elsewhere.",False
5,2,Really Disappointed,hkhdswdjz,n/a,16/08/2025,Hoping for unbiased documentary. Unfortunately in this day and age that rarely happens. When I saw John Bolton pop on the screen I knew it was downhill from there. Not worth the time to watch.,False
6,1,Was this about N. Korea or Trump being stupid?,bfackrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"1) Documentaries are supposed to be fact based and unbiased - FAIL2) Attempting to bring peace and form a dialog with a nation that has the world's fourth largest army and a strong and growing nuclear presence should be praised not criticized - FAILThis could have been a decent documentary if it weren't for the obvious, awkward, and ever so popular attempt to make Trump look stupid.I was thinking about giving it 2 or 3 stars but, since they failed in TWO ways, it doesn't even deserve 1.When did journalist loose touch with the concept of providing accurate and unbiased information? We are at a point in time where nothing can be trusted!",False

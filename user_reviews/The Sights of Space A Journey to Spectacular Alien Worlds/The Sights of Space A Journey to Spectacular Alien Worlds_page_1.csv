1,10,Absolutely breathtaking,Skater1331,n/a,15/08/2025,"A wonderful mix of science, beauty, and imagination. This documentary takes us on an amazing journey to exoplanets and alien moons with magnificent visuals. We see worlds with massive rings, clouds made of metal particles, and the land decorated with rubies and sapphires. The environments are stunning and on par with Avatar's Pandora.This documentary is the gold standard of how space documentaries should be made. No talking heads. No need to cutaway back to Earth to show us an ""example,"" like when The Universe cut to a bar to show a scientist drinking beer to help us ""understand"" that a nebula had alcohol molecules. The focus was kept on the environments being explored as it should be.The most brilliant part was that it did not focus on alien life as the only thing that is worth looking for in the universe. Many of these worlds would not support life, but were still absolutely fascinating to explore.Definitely worth a watch.",False

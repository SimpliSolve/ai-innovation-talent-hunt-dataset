1,10,Fresh from the Tribeca film festival an honest review,urboiblunt,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film was, funny, interesting, inspiring touched with some dramatic scenes along with some tear jerking parts. Definitely highly recommend to view. This documentary will be one if the most important and socially significant fims of our lifetime. It takes into the mindset of a person that suddenly finds themselves trapped inside a body that no longer functioning properly. A disabled one. And we follow the story of a couple of people that get together during therapy along with some amazing Therapist they bring you into thier lives, mindset ups and downs. Sometimes you will laugh. Sometimes you may cry. All emotions are touched on in this movie. There are lessons as well. One I came away with that I hope everyone seeing this get ls is how intelligent and highly motivated but most importantly normal people with disabilities are. Definitely a must see. Most deserving of the highest accolades possible. Tell a friend to tell a friend and go see a support this movie.",False
2,10,The importance of adaptive gaming and independence,mikethequad,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't listen to the other quad that rated 5/10. This is a very well documented film on what adaptive gaming does for spinal cord injuries. Everyone in the Quad Gods is a quadriplegic by medical classification. I'm a C6 quadriplegic and it's baffling a high level quad like the user critic livemuzek-01941 doesn't understand the actual difference between quad and para. They also aren't a recognizable name in the gaming industry like RockyNoHands. You can find my credentials by just looking me up too, at MikeTheQuad. Big ups to the film and everyone involved for making this wonderful documentary which took years to make. I would recommend anyone that knows of someone that had a severe spinal cord injury. This film is just one example to show them their disability is not the end.",False

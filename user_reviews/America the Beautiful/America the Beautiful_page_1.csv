1,7,"Great cinematography, narration just okay",isaacgoulding,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cinematography is fantastic, but narration isn't my favourite. It's a little childish, of course they've likely done that on purpose, but I really don't like all the animals being constantly referred to as 'heroes', feels corny. But all in all an enjoyable nature series.",False
2,7,"Beautiful Photography, 3rd Grade Level Narration",jackdog1-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Given that it's done by National Geographic and Disney, it's no wonder it comes off as a modern take on Disney True Life Adventures. The photography is flawless and stunning, but the narration is more anthropomorphized feel good aimed at elementary school kids than actual scientific education. That's not necessarily a bad thing if it gets kids interested in nature and caring for the planet.",False
3,8,Excellent visuals,lindsey204,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent visuals, and being the Disney channel I can understand the level of narration, maybe targeting younger children... oh, sometimes the predator does get the prey.... all in all, not bad...",False
4,8,Stunning visuals - by godawful voice over!,agasi999,n/a,16/08/2025,Micheal B Jordan's voice over is so dry and mono tone and sometimes incomprehensible it ruins an otherwise stunning documentary. Why put so much effort to capture these amazing visuals and ruin it with a terrible voice over ? The person who thought his voice suited this documentary should be fired for ruining this otherwise amazing documentary.,False
5,10,Well done...well done!,parkmarketing,n/a,16/08/2025,"If this doesn't encourage people to dust off their hiking shoes and take full advantage of what this great country has to offer, then I don't know what will! Thank you for reminding us of the beauty that awaits us, just outside our front door. Although a stroll through the woods, walk along the beach or hike in the desert may not expose us to the intricate details of nature's ""Heroes"" as shown in this documentary, we can discover our own connection to nature, if we just pay attention.As I watched the series, I was enchanted by the tiny creatures, respectful of the strength of the hierarchy animals and in awe of the landscape. The technically advanced way in which you chose to help us see this great country afforded the viewer a new and exciting experience. The subject matter was fascinating. What a wonderful world we have all around us!The music created by your group of composers is the proverbial, ""icing on the cake"". Without the grace of the violin strings, plucking of the guitar/banjo or intense beat of the drums, the series would not have the power it holds. Music is the driving force behind most of what entertains us on the big screen. The musical talent, behind the scenes should take a bow. Bravo!I applaud your entire crew of talented people behind your masterpiece! Congratulations!",False
6,9,Perfect... if you don't count the narration,feherzol96,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe the most creative, beautiful and dynamic aerial shots I've ever seen, not just in a nature documentary but in every media ever. The animal roster is fine, though a bit too much of the most famous species like grizzlies. Man, they are getting really boring now. Seeing a bear catch salmon was fun in the first 50 documentaries they are in, but after that, it gets repetitive whether the cinamtography is creative or not. It's a shame that the creators of nature shows like this don't think that fish, amphibians, reptiles or insects are just as (or more) interesting as a bear or a lion or an elephant. This series lacks these groups, focusing too much on mammals and birds (mostly mammals).But it's okay, I can't judge a show by the animals it features, so the only negative point is because of the narration. It is just cringe. Especially the totally random ""heroes"". ""This squirrel is hero because it exists. This bear is a hero because it has eaten a fish."" - and this is not an exaggeration. The narration is so very far from the beautifully written Attenborough stuff. When I was a kid, I was inspired by his work in every possible way, so I just can't imagine that a goofy narration like the one in this series is needed to get the attention of children.",False
7,10,Family friendly animal series,sarojkmohapatra,n/a,16/08/2025,"1. Awesome videography
2. Jordan's voice is so clear and soothing
3. Kid friendly video ( so no oh **** change channel surprises.4. Yes, animal world is cruel, but then we don't need to show all the cruelty in all videos. Kids just can't handle it.If you are looking for a kid friendly animal series that you can show to your kids to learn about animal planet, then you found one.I hope Disney soon makes few more like this.",False
8,10,Enjoyable enough,cnfranco,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI only watched this because I heard a sampling of the OST by Joseph Trapanese, who I like quite a bit, and was blown away by the quality of the cinematography. Particularly the mountain shots which puzzled me until I found out they had strapped super-stabilized cameras to jets and flown them through the ranges. The scripting and spoken narration are rather juvenile, and you can skip the 6th episode entirely, but this is still a very solid nature series. If you liked the soundtracks for Tron Uprising or Only the Brave, you'll hear the same types of instruments being used here, and some of the same melody structuring.",True
9,9,unbelievable camerawork,happy_quadruped,n/a,16/08/2025,"I honestly have no clue how they got some of these shots, it seems like it would be almost impossible to get the timing right but somehow they did it. I watch a ton of nature shows but this includes stuff I haven't seen elsewhere before for sure. It's so unique that it really makes you think about the world in a different way.My one critique is that I think the drone shots where they move over landscapes quickly might actually be a little too quick at times to be pleasing. At least watching on my MacBook Pro it's a little nauseating. But that's only a fraction of the show so I won't weight it too highly.I enjoy the narrator. Maybe a little hokey, sure, but actually that's sort of on point for a nature documentary and I appreciate his friendliness. I like the theme of ""heros"".Somewhat relatedly, one other amazing thing about this show is that it isn't just individual shots, rather they seem to have followed individual animals for a somewhat extended duration, which makes the storytelling more compelling.",False
10,7,"Beautiful cinema, why the voice?",sieczc,n/a,16/08/2025,"The cinematography is stunning and perfectly edited. Really quite beautiful. However, it is ruined by the narration. Why in the world have Michael B. Jordan narrate it?? You might as well have had my neighbor, Frank do it. They have equally lackluster voices. Morgan Freeman too expensive??",False
11,7,"Stunning Visuals, Lame Script",LoveStallion,n/a,16/08/2025,"What's with the ""heroes"" stuff?? I don't get it. It's such dumb dialogue.As others have said, the narration is a bit corny and better for kids. But ironically, this documentary doesn't show up in kids profiles on Disney+.It's still wonderful to look at. I think we've just all been spoiled by Attenborough. Michael D. Jordan is a talented actor but just an OK narrator.Nevertheless, you'll enjoy this series, and it's fun to watch as a family. Just try not to tolle your eyes too much when Jordan describes every animal in existence as ""hero.""These animals are not heroes. They are merely living their lives based on instinct.",False
12,2,Suited For Children,paulie-70246,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two minutes on squirrels in a forest, then off to an alligator in the Louisiana swamp, then a few minutes later a prairie dog sits in the sun, survives a tornado, now its snowing. All narrated in childlike simplicity by some American celebrity.American version of Attenborough for children with short attention spans.",False
13,5,Great footage but haphazard script and editing,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Episode 1 (""Land of Heroes"") of ""America The Beautiful"" (2022 release; 6 episodes of about 45 min each) opens, we are in North Dakota, where a red squirrel is gathering food for the long winter ahead, only to be challenged by scavengers. What is the squirrel to do? We then go to the wetlands in Louisiana, where a 15 ft alligator is patrolling the neighborhood, ready to pounce at any time...Couple of comments: there are so many nature documentaries out there, so how does this one compare? Actually not that good, I'm afraid to say. Let's start with the positives: there is some amazing footage in this 6 part series, and some of it is hard to watch (see how the grizzly bear hunts down a caribou calf that literally was born only hours before). But there is way too many aerial drone footage of massive landscapes that fly by in seconds, and the opening episode crisscrosses North America without any rhyme or reason (literally going from the Grand Canyon to the northern lights in Alaska within minutes. I couldn't make any heads or tails as to the overall direction or purpose of this. What it really felt like was a ""greatest hits"" collection of animals in the wild in North America. Perhaps for some viewers, this is more than enough, but I felt that the haphazard nature of the underlying script and its correlating editing didn't do this mini-series any favors, unfortunately.""American The Beautiful"" was released, appropriately enough, this past July 4 (2 weeks ago today). If you like nature documentaries, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False

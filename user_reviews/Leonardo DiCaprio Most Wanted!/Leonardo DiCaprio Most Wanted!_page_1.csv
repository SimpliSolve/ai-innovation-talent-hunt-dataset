1,7,A genius of his time,DLochner,n/a,16/08/2025,A very successful documentary about one of the greatest actors in film history. The documentary goes into detail on the actor's career and takes a good look behind the scenes and the acting skills of Leonardo DiCaprio. The only point of criticism: the documentary unfortunately only minimally addresses the essential and important collaboration with director Quentin Tarantino. Too bad. But still absolutely worth seeing. The quick-change artist Leonardo DiCaprio. A genius of his time.,False
2,5,A collection of unsubstantiated opinions of a good actor,haroldschranz,n/a,16/08/2025,"The German commentators too often go out on a limb with their uninformed and overinflated opinions of Leo and the various roles he adopts as an actor. A lot of flowery language with adjectives found from a Thesaurus and a lot of assumptions that Leo was just a pretty boy who needed to prove he could act. I am pretty sure he knows his good work and does need an Oscar that desparately. Even without an Oscar, his body of work speaks for itself. We do not need overimaginative opinions of commentators in the documentary based on nothing but their flights of fancy. A better documentary would look at the facts of each role and just present that. Almost like each documentary commentator wanted to be a movie star! It is more like a tabloid article than a real documentary!",False
3,1,Everything to Distract From What Matters,krisnicolecbo,n/a,16/08/2025,Feels like a strongly forced narrative to make a man who likes children (young girls) look exquisite. Far too too to have something like this made for someone so young and still alive. Especially someone who is not truly exceptional or changing the world in any real way. A joke. Like a cherry on top of this joke of an industry. There is nothing that calls for this man to be fake revered in this say in a film like this. He has been chosen to represent a few by and industry that has played with the minds of millions. And now this movie is another play to convince people that he is great in some way and not one who harms women and is save with nda's and by having wealthy to silence people. What a tragic industry. What a tragic man. Perhaps a real movie will be made about him and the others one day and this joke of a movie will be referenced.,False

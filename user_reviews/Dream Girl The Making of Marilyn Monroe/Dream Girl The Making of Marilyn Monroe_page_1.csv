1,7,"Mixed feelings about this, but it was informative",montymonvieux,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI almost stopped watching this early on because I found the narration to be irritating and almost like a parody of a narration to a serious documentary. I persevered, however, and learned a lot of things about MM that hadn't been mentioned in previous written or filmed biographies. The biography also introduced the viewer to previously unknown people who were involved in MM's life in childhood and later, as she worked to develop her career. It was satisfying to hear someone say outright that she was visited by RFK on the day she died and silenced by being murdered in a straightforward manner. The death by suicide ""question"" and other mysteries can finally be laid to rest. Marilyn Monroe will always be a person of great interest due to her enigmatic personality, complicated life experience and immense physical beauty.",True

1,6,Bambi revisited,raphaelyegles,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beautiful images of Bambi's life in the forest. His birth, infancy, lhis earning to take the first steps, discoveries, growth, dangers, encounters with other animals, learning to avoid dangers, swimming, tending his wounds, facing the rigours of winter, following his instincts, surviving man's hunt, learning to be safe with his father, becoming independent and entering adulthood. The scenes are well chosen, the story holds together. Everything happens from Bambi's point of view, and in the big forest, there's a lot going on. This film is a bath of sounds, lights, trees, shadows, everything that moves, walks, crawls and flies in the forest. It's not boring, and as the seasons go by, Bambi grows up to become an adult and start a family. On the downside, the music is too emphatic at times, detracting from the charm of Bambi's life. The images are very realistic, almost documentary-like. It's always the same animals that reappear, and you get the impression that there aren't many species of animal in the forest. There are a few too many crows and ravens cawing unpleasantly. Scenes with pond frogs, snails and night owls are remarkable. It's not a perfect film, but Bambi makes for an enjoyable time. Missing scenes: where does Bambi sleep, especially on freezing winter nights? And what food he prefers at different seasons? The scene at night with thousands of fireflies surrounding Bambi is marvellous.",False
2,6,"""Bambi, l'histoire d'une vie dans les bois"" is a good film that declines in some scenes but recovers again with other scenes of great quality.",jp_91,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Bambi, l'histoire d'une vie dans les bois"" is a simple but effective film, its script based on the story written by Felix Salten is interesting, telling it in documentary form, giving a touch of realism to Bambi's story, in addition to adding realities of animal life, although of course with a slightly childish perspective. In addition, elements are touched upon that demonstrate the importance of animals and the bad role that humans often play in their lives. The editing manages to be incredible, accentuating the drama and even the suspense. The animals that appear in the film are wonderful actors, achieving endearing scenes. The cinematography manages to be of great visual quality, definitely the best thing about the film.

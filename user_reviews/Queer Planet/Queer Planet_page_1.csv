1,n/a,One of my favorite documentaries ever!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,This is such a beautiful and informative documentary! I love nature so much and to see how so many creatures are a part of the LGBT community is amazing and it proves that homophobia just exists with humans. This world of ours is so beautiful and big and wonderful and humans have destroyed with their hate and darkness. We need more light and more love and more hope and positivity and goodness in this world! Homophobia should have never ever existed! Being a part of the LGBTQIA community is natural and normal. This documentary needs to be shown to classrooms and universities everywhere! This documentary is so important!,False
2,10,A Must View For All To Watch,georgegrimes,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary has made me very, very angry. For years as a gay man I have had society treat me with both hostility and irreverence. This abnormal response by the ""normal"" is the misconception that homosexuality or similar is non productive, which has been emphasised by our religions, which founded the basis of Common Law. In this documentary, matters of scientific fact completely dispel our human illogical, irrational and paranoid perceptions regarding sexuality. This documentary proves that same sex couples adopt orphans and raise them as their own and so much more. What makes my blood boil is that for tens of years, television documentary makers have filmed in the wild and have misrepresented the animal kingdom to us all. Who's playing God! Well done to all for this documentary. More power to your elbow.",False
3,9,Important and timely,hpfqbzyxh,n/a,15/08/2025,"Queer Planet finally legitimises centuries of natural history observations of queer animals. This documentary may be confronting to those with idealistic repulsion to natural animal behaviour but will be validating to millions that are told they are ""unnatural"". This work fearlessly tackles the anti queer history of our most famous naturalists (Darwin). The cinematography is as good as any other nature documentary. The narrator and interviewees are entertaining but not made into caricatures of queer people. One of the most engaging and interesting documentaries I have seen and I look forward to more!",False
4,7,Over-queering the pitch,ozjosh03,n/a,15/08/2025,"Queer Planet is a well-intentioned, visually stunning and enjoyably informative documentary, but also more than somewhat muddle-headed. In the concluding comments to the film the various scientist-presenters make the point that being more informed about just how queer nature can be might be key to humans being more tolerant of each other. It's odd then that Queer Planet is somewhat exclusively pitched at a queer audience, and would more than likely alienate those who most need to hear what it has to say. A big part of the problem is the gayer-than-gay narration by Andrew Rannells, jam-packed with gay culture allusions and you-go-gurl snark. It quickly becomes tiresome and by the end I would have been ready to endorse a fatwa on Rannells. I doubt your average straight viewer would find it appealing, much less entertaining. And anyone who came to the film sceptical or wary would instantly turn it off on the strength of the narration alone. There's a case for levity when it comes to selling science, but the wrong kind of levity only undermines and de-legitimises the science. This is very definitely the wrong kind of levity.",False
5,10,Love this,thiemkeyabigail,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not only does representation matter, what it's so imperative that members outside the scientific community know that the natural world is very queer. We need more of this. Over 70 different species of mammals alone have homosexual relationships and that's not even the baseline of it. Brava.We are in a new era where film makers now need to show the truth of what the animal kingdom is. It's beautiful and unique, filled with queerness and has proven that biology is not an excuse to be homophobic. This is disproving the biology take on far right and homophobic views that homosexuality and transgender is not ""right"". I hope they stay mad.",False
6,9,A show we needed about science and facts,santiagoramirezsaid,n/a,15/08/2025,"Let's put preconceived notions of what is good and wrong behind. This is a great show based on scientific evidence of natural animal behaviour in the wild.Any judgment you want to attribute to this natural behaviour is personal but I won't change the irrefutable scientific fact that this behaviour has a very common space in nature. Denying it is denying scientific evidence.This great show is meant to illustrate a reality in nature, with facts and data. It's not meant to be watched with judgment or ideologies up front. True science does not work like that. Open your mind, allow yourself to learn and you just got a great show to watch! A big thanks to the producers and cast for sharing knowledge with the audience!",False

8,10,"A truly well made film, reflecting things as I also see and understand them.",dentfreeeu,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've wrote the same words/review for another movie, but they are both in my mind, equally toppers, that other movie is Euphoria.I wanted to equally share my view on both of them, using the same words.A truly well made film, reflecting things as I also see and understand them.It's not all roses and goodness on this planet, in one way or another, it's a hard world for all of us out there, especially for those that are unjustly viewed, miss understood, miss treated and rejected, let me say ""ironically enough?!"", but it's absolutely not funny at all, it's done by those that are actually in the wrong themselves, especially by being above all, ignorant, not wanting to know, rejecting our natural and genuine differences, when it has always been this way, nature makes the right choices and rules.It's not a matter of just being male or female alone, that determines consensual love and affection for anyone else, love and companionship is found when souls are compatible, love is truly blind, it does not look at size, shape, colour, species or races, the same and inseparably, goes for at least most other animal species on this whole planet.In the least, we need more people to understand that, we are all genuinely different, have different views and needs, but are all equally worthy of the same respect and treatment, we would want to receive ourselves in return.And it doesn't matter if I'm ''so said'' ""straight or not"", I support the LGBTQ plus community, as it's also included in the following:I'm ethically and morally all for veganism and support the Ahimsa belief, because they both support the following:
I'm all for environmental, human and non human animal rights, because no matter where from in the entire universe, they are equally all one concern.üå±ü§úü§õüèæ‚ú®",False

10,10,Showing Nature as It Is Recorded,FinleyKolapo,n/a,15/08/2025,"At its core, it's just another nature documentary among many, it shows the observed behaviors of a diverse array of animals.It shows nature as it is recorded. What sets this documentary apart is its focus on showcasing a side of nature that was not mainstream in traditional documentaries.The cinematography is excellent, as nature docs often do. I think it provides an eye-opening look at wildlife. I already know that animals have been recorded doing same-sex stuff, but this documentary still surprised me by showing so much more species e.g., hyenas, dolphins, macaques, clownfish , giraffes and more.",False
11,10,Excellent!,deryak-28492,n/a,15/08/2025,"Humans have created societies that look down on completely natural acts and incorrectly labeled them unnatural. We have a complicated relationship with sexuality steeped in shame and ignorance. This documentary shows how we have failed to understand ourselves when aligned with the natural world. Same sex encounters are NATURAL and the a part of life.""Queer Planet"" dazzles with its vibrant and heartfelt dive into the multifaceted world of the LGBTQ+ community. This captivating documentary illuminates the rich tapestry of queer experiences, blending poignant personal stories with powerful historical insights.

12,10,"Loved it, funny and informative!",diegoleonbarido,n/a,15/08/2025,"For all my life, I've been ignorant of the incredible diversity on our planet, and this movie further opened my eyes to how beautiful and awesome it is for everyone to fully be themselves. The movie is funny and engaging; I particularly enjoyed the segment about the rams! Awesome cinematography, combined with heartfelt and funnystorytelling, makes Queer Planet a must-watch. The film's ability to balance humor with poignant moments is truly commendable. Go watch it! There's so much to learn and appreciate about the vibrant tapestry of life in our planet! We organized a movie with some of our friends and it was particularly fun to watch it with a group of people :)",False
13,9,Nature activism,sherylchilders82,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a person that majored in biology, give me MORE like this. Every single nature documentary focuses on males killing each other, like that's all nature is. It's infuriating. The reason I fell in love with biology is because it is fascinating and always challenging our human centric world. I geek out on this weirdness and want all nature documentaries to be like this.Now do ones to challenge the ""natural"" human patriarchy and racism. I'll give you a head start. Media and education are always telling us that our closest living relative is the common chimpanzee, a decidedly patriarchal animal. But, guess what? We are equally related to bonobos shown in this film (a different chimpanzee species), who are matriarchal. And, they're also sexually dimorphic with larger males, like us. For racism, see anything Henry Louis Gates Jr does - his shows are always breaking down the cultural beliefs and stereotypes of biological race.Thanks for the nerdy nature documentary about love, not war, that every true scientist like me can appreciate for a true representation of nature and why we love it.",False
14,10,A Groundbreaking Documentary,connorgouws,n/a,15/08/2025,"Queer Planet: A Groundbreaking Documentary Celebrating the Natural Beauty of Queerness in the Animal Kingdom""Queer Planet"" is a stunning documentary that delves into the fascinating world of queer animals, showcasing the natural diversity of sexual behavior in the animal kingdom.

1,5,Average...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Bin Laden's Hard Drive"" is a Documentary in which we watch the contents of the hard drive found in the compound where Osama bin Laden was killed, offering new insights into the life of one of the most notorious figures of modern history.I have to admit that I expected more from this documentary regarding information and more than a fascinating glimpse into bin Laden's personal life, communications, and strategy. The documentary aims to unravel the secrets hidden within the files, exploring how they shape our understanding of bin Laden and his network. However, the analysis of the hard drive's contents is surface-level, and much of the information is not particularly new. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Bin Laden's Hard Drive"" is an intriguing look at a significant piece of historical evidence, but it lacks the depth and context to make it truly engaging. For those looking for a more thorough exploration, the documentary may feel a bit underwhelming so, I don't recommend it.",False
2,1,Tries to rehabilitate Laden,rmmkxz,n/a,16/08/2025,"You never really get to ANYTHING meaningful from the hard drives. They skirt around it but never dig in. Kids playing with rocks, killing helpless birds, kids having poetry contests, wives helping him write speeches. This is an absolute mess of a documentary. This had the potential to be riveting and educational. Instead, they try to rehabilitate Laden as some 'humble narcissist' who loved his indoctrinated children and friends from the 80s. About 10 minutes total, if that, on the actual contents of the hard drive.With a treasure trove of data at their disposal, you think they could do a series with this. This is a monumental miss.",False
3,2,Definition of here say....,kowas_2,n/a,16/08/2025,I found that the information was force fed down our throat. Felt like all the footage we have seen before. And many videos felt like it could have been from anywhere. Almost felt like this was made to justify making Bin Laden bigger than what he probably was.,False

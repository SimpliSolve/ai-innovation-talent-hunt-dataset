1,7,Disconnected,confidencegame,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this from episode to episode, it all feels very disconnected... So much information is presented, but pretty much without ANY narrative structure or even a timeline (?). They are just jumping from one subject to another, and throwing everything at the kitchen wall to see if it sticks.A great example of this mess would be the film Lisinski. Created during the NDH in 1944, it was the first ever feature, sound film created in Croatia. And yet this interesting bit of information is never actually mentioned, not even in the episode 8 which explores the culture of NDH. Lisinski (1944) is just casually mentioned once, seemingly with an assumption that everyone is familiar with it, while in reality few people have even heard of it.Overall, the poor editing and incomprehensible narration make up for a very boring series. Maybe that was the point? To strip this Nazi puppet state of any glamour? Fine by me. But still I would much rather watch something more polished, with a narrative structure that holds, and just with some proper editing, which was preferrably not done by someone who took a 2-hour online course.",False

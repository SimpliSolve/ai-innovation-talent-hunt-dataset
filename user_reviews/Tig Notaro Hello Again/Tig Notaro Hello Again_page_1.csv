1,8,Her name is TIG!,KowboyPedro36,n/a,16/08/2025,"Long day on the planet and was in need of a laugh. Showered, grabbed a beer and snuggled in with my pup. Fired up the Amazon Fire Cube (Gen. 1) ***not sponsored, but open to offers*** and the 1st thing I see is a brand new TIG NOTARO special??!?!!? The comedy gods were INDEED smiling upon me.Tig=Cancer survivor.Wife.Mother (or whatever) of two.Voice of an angel.Can play the piano.Very sharp, brilliantly deadpan and patiently delivered. Her new set is like a roast in a crock pot, pleasing to the senses as it cooks & filled with mouthwatering anticipation for the next morsel.And her name is Tig.",False
2,7,Half part funny the other half a snooze,estebanperek,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI like Tig notaro. She's funny, quick witty, with an impeccable timing. I enjoyed this special until the last part. The piano part.She's great at dragging stories forever and they become even funnier by the ridiculousness of the whole situation ( like the famous barstool or Taylor Dayne) but this time it isn't funny. It's plain boring and uninteresting and to be sincere it feels basic.The first part of the show is great, dynamic, with unexpected twists but once she reaches the piano it's all down hill.Just my opinion. I still follow her on her podcast (Handsome podcast) which is hilarious.",True
3,10,Fantastic,ad8899,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love Tig Notaro, you will love this. It was such a pleasure to hang out with her and watch her talk for an hour. Highly recommend.If you don't know her, give it a chance. It's a different style than the typical comedy show, very deadpan and observational, a lot of storytelling.It's not the typical format of joke, set up, joke, joke.. Don't go into it expecting that. It's not going to be old style in that way. And that's what I love about her style. It's more of a conversation.I always appreciate any piece of art that Tig puts out. I appreciate her worldview, her compassion, and her ability to laugh at even hard subjects.",False
4,10,"*Just simple and honest sharing, with an original twist on observational humour*",mynameisnotsarah,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are only a few stand-up comedy shows a year that get my attention... Tig's unique brand of humour is a breath of fresh air amongst an endless stream of crass, loud, vulgur, reach for the low-hanging fruit type of comedians. I love the slow pace and build up to her humorous storytelling, which leaves me smiling and chuckling the whole way through. Honestly, she is so talented and has clearly honed her skills in the art of stand-up comedy. I wish there were more people like her that were brave enough to authentically relate the humour in their life's journey. No need to resort to vulgarity, shock value or a constant need to offend other people. Just simple and honest sharing, with an original twist on observational humour. I absolutely loved this comedy special and highly recommend it! Thanks for the laughs and smiles, Tig! :)",False
5,10,I absolutely love her dry humour,colleenwoodhead,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am so disappointed that there is only one episode available.Tig's dry delivery and timing has me ROFLMAO (does anyone still use that besides me?)I hope she comes to perform in Toronto and that I can get tickets. I'm guessing that the best way to experience Tig is to watch her live.The way that she invites you into her life experiences and is able to laugh at herself is so endearing and relatable.Prime, please release more episodes as quickly as Tig can create them!She's amazing while remaining family friendly! A feat that very few even attempt to accomplish these days!I will be eagerly awaiting more of this series!",False
6,10,my face hurts from smiling,rachelbryant-11736,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed this hour. I didn't know her, and didn't recognize she was in the Morning Showme: Tig Notaro was really fun in her comedy special Hello again. Loved her storytelling about her sons and being a parent.

7,1,When does it become funny?,djak-43049,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved Trig's Commander Jett Reno character in Star Trek: Discovery, so my expectations were high when I watched this.I sat patiently, waiting for her to be funny and had to conclude that the laughter of the audience was due to the expectation that all things 'non-binary' must be appreciated and applauded.Trig bears no relationship to Jett Reno, that could be because others have written the material so it was easy to build a context in which Trig's deadpan approach to life could be appreciated.Standing on that stage, relaying one medical incident after another was painful to watch and I was waiting for something to be funny - nothing was.I really wanted it to be funny; I was waiting for it to become funny; I love deadpan humour - it never did.I felt the audience only found it funny because they didn't want to be cancelled in this world where diversity is so much more important than meritocracy.Trig used every diversity hook in the book, but nothing gelled; nothing was really funny.I can't wait to see Trig as Reno in the next series of Discovery but I won't be indulging in any more stand up.",False
8,n/a,Did you know the castle was in need of a lesbian fool?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI had previously seen Tig Notaro in the late night TV circuit or whatever, couldn't recall, but said I'd try it, in need of a lesbian spin on wit. Nothing of the sort happened here, except in promise, before spiralling down to name-dropping privilege: Oprah is literally the final word of the show. A story on what she once misheard in Reese Withered Spoon's office establishes Tig's privilege: would we really care for a story whose ramifications are not beyond our everyday horizon if name-dropping would not separate us common folk at the same time it traps us to the way Tig plays the lesbian card as commonsensical commonness - don't be put off by the fact of namedropping, I am one of you in my comical failings! But the obnoxious truth is, as Oprah is elevated center-field at the end, as the self-righteous sun of America she always is, Tig Notaro slips into her privileged orbit seamlessly, to a sold-out, or sell-out, depending on how celebrity bends your present, theater audience.",True
9,3,Makes you smile. Not more than that.,chrisfacebook-52707,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love stand up comedy and i did not know who she was. So i took a chance. It's a dry humour, she tells story's that was supposed to make people laugh but no. At most put a smile on your face. I believe she could be a great actress in a comedy movie or TV show.The voice, the body and the story. Nothing of it gives you an sincerely laugh.She seems a nice person. I really wanted to love more the show, but in the end i remember i smile a little bit in beginning but after that was too boring and in the last minutes i was suffering to watch till the end.Despite that she definitely should continue in the comedy but not stand up shows.",False
10,4,1/2 FUNNY,valeriedilorenzo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLove Tig Notaro, long time fan...so excited to see this new comedy special...funny, relatable, vintage Tig and then the piano comes out and the special is um, not so special anymore. Has Tig become so popular that she could actually command/demand this ridiculous segment and get paid for it. It never got better. Reminds me of the Emperor's New Clothes - was there no one who could tell her this segment was NOT funny in any way? It's also kind of an insult to all the people who paid to see her live. I understand this segment is now a regular part of her routine. You can do better Tig, much better.",True

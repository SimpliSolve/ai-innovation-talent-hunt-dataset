1,7,Nuanced look at the icon and the man,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Real Charlie Chaplin"" (2021 release; 114 min.) opens, it is December, 1916, and Chaplin-mania is in full swing. We then go back in time, and visit London, where Chaplin was born in 1889 (4 days apart from a certain fella named Adolf Hitler). The film makers have dug up a 1983 interview with the Chaplin family's neighbor from the early days, and the woman reflects on Charlie as a boy. At this point we are 10 min into the film.Couple of comments: this documentary is co-directed by Peter Middleton and James Spinney (""Notes On Blindness""). Here they reassess the man, the myth and the legacy of Charlie Chaplin. It appears that this film received the full cooperation of the Chaplin estate, as the film features tons of archive home footage. As is noted by several talking heads: Charlie Chaplin's the Tramp character is just that: a character, and not Charlie Chaplin himself. Chaplin the film maker was a genius. Chaplin the man was a deeply flawed person. Meanwhile the US doesn't come out great in this either, and that's a serious understatement. After years of a smear campaign led by the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover, to boot Chaplin and his family out of the country in 1952 at the height of McCarthyism was simply petty and vindictive (and unfounded I might add). The movie also contains a large segment as to the parallels between Chaplin and Hitler. None of it is ""new"" but to see it laid out as it is here, is startling nevertheless. One thing about the documentary that bothered me (perhaps more than it should) is the reenactment of various interviews that were audio-taped only, but shown here in full stage reenactments, as if these events were filmed (which they were not). It is completely unnecessary and frankly misleading. Aside from that stain, this documentary is a timely reminder of the genius and shortcomings at the same time that befell Charlie Chaplin.""The Real Charlie Chaplin"" recently premiered in Showtime, and is now available on SHO On Demand (where I caught it). If you have any interest in movie history or are simply a fan of Charlie Chapin, I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,7,The Real Charlie Chaplin,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"An insightful documentary which manages to largely follow the man's entire life whilst trying, largely successfully, to understand and articulate his motivations and aching doubts. He remains highly regarded and it is hard to understand now how incredibly popular and loved he was. He was though not a particularly nice man and seemed to find affection for others difficult, until possibly in his old age. The nonsensical communist paranoia that plagued the US finally got him and he had to live his later years in Switzerland which often seems here so very sad, particularly given the somewhat hypocritical Oscar he received in his last few years.I rather liked Pearl Mackie's rather affectionate narration, which made a nice change from the usual Walter Cronkite type austerity.",False
3,8,A Good documentary ... but...,tody711,n/a,16/08/2025,I did not learn anything new about him.... But it was nice to see all those old clips. Especially the home movies of him and Oona and kids in his later years. My fav movie of his is Monsieur Verdoux.... The 'tramp' was interesting but repetitive. Chaplin wanted to become 'famous' and he did. And wealthy. It's too bad his love for way too young girls led him and his career astray....,False
4,7,An Earnest Attempt To Characterize The Legendary Silent Film Star,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Real Charlie Chaplin is an earnest attempt to characterize the legendary silent film star Charlie Chaplin, showing more about the man behind the Little Tramp character, and explaining his significance. At times this documentary's somewhat bland narration and spotty coverage of Chaplin's life seem to undermine the actor and his legacy.Almost everyone knows who Charlie Chaplin is, at least by his image: The bowler hat, scraggly coat, thin cane, and trademark mustache are well-known symbols of the first landmark actor of Western cinema. The Real Charlie Chaplin does its best to do the impossible - capture the essence of Charlie Chaplin - using archival footage and tape-recorded interviews. It's a compilation of perspectives and personal impressions, told in dramatic fashion, rather than a linear storyline. Really, The Real Charlie Chaplin is all about Chaplin's rise and fall to and from fame, his political opinions, and his contributions to film history (which have been surveyed in a slightly haphazard fashion, only grazing the surface of some of Chaplin's works).The film draws on rarely-heard recordings made by Chaplin, his family, and Effie Wisdom, a childhood friend who grew up with him in London. It's surreal to hear all these voices talk about one of history's most-loved personalities. Directors Charles Middleton and James Spinney orchestrated reenactments of these recordings, with actors lip-synching and emoting precisely to the audio. It's an approach that works for some and may not for others, since it entails actors adding gestures or expressions that the original speakers weren't able to, and so feels a bit unnatural at times. Wisdom's recording is by far the clearest, and this reenactment method begins to fall apart when Chaplin's recording is introduced, as Chaplin's voice is grainy and the tape recorder makes him sound strained. Many scenes of Chaplin's films are dissected by narrator Pearl Mackie, as is his family life through a series of photographs accompanied by the aforementioned recordings. Her narration slows the pace of the film quite dramatically, and it may have been a better idea to have the recordings guide the film more, instead of the narration. In all other aspects, though, The Real Charlie Chaplin is a well-made film.The Real Charlie Chaplin is all about individualism, perspective, and devoting yourself to your craft. There are some mature themes like domestic abuse and manipulation to watch out for.I give The Real Charlie Chaplin 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. The Real Charlie Chaplin begins its theatrical run at Cinema Village (New York) and Laemmle Santa Monica (Los Angeles) on Friday, November 19, 2021.By Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",False
5,9,"Chaplin, Very funny, very sad",ArmenPandolaITSJUSTAMOVIECOM,n/a,16/08/2025,"Charles Chaplin was the greatest comic actor, writer, producer and director of his time - from the infancy of film to the collapse of the studio system in the 1950s. For a long period, he was the most famous person on earth. His creation, The Tramp, was so flexible that he could find himself in a factory, a circus, a boxing ring, a gold rush - the list is endless. And it never didn't work. Wherever the Tramp went, he found himself immersed in the business of being human. This documentary wants us to know the man behind the Tramp facade. In many ways, they were very similar. Chaplin came from dire poverty in the hovels of late Victorian London. In many respects, he never left there. His politics were never very precise except that he was always for the underdog, for the Tramp. During the shameful period of American history when the FBI spied on every prominent person (probably still do) and tried to ruin the careers of all those who were sympathetic to working people (again, they probably still do) Chaplin was forced to leave the US and prevented from returning. He never fully recovered from the shock.",False
6,6,Could have been wonderful,drjgardner,n/a,16/08/2025,"With the type of attention to detail and editing that Chaplin used throughout his career, this documentary could have been wonderful. But it's not. It's overly long, dwells too much on some things while ignoring others, and gives us an arms-length view. Shame. Better editing could make it wonderful.",False
7,10,New Footage and Audio add to the incredible Chaplin Story,Stan16mm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Over 700 books worldwide have been written about him, thousands of stories and articles,
merchandise galore; anything and everything that could be marketed has been including
hundreds of documentaries. With all this information at hand, why would it be necessary to
produce another documentary on a man who was once considered to be the most famous
person on the globe? You would think that everything that has been discussed about him
has already been documented and its cache has been fully gleaned. The filmmakers of the
new documentary on Charles Chaplin were faced with this daunting task before they ever
started. They asked themselves if there could possibly be anything to add to the Chaplin
story. With the help of an amazing researcher and the Chaplin Office, they not only
found new elements to add to the story, they did it in a bravura style that sets a new high bar
in documentary film making.""The Real Charlie Chaplin"" is not a history of the films of the great Chaplin so get that out of
your head from the start. This is the story of the man who created brilliance in film, how he came
to create and nurture his craft and what his genius cost him both in his professional and personal life.If you are a big fan of his work and have a wealth of knowledge about his films, consider yourselves
ahead of the curve. This is not a film by film in depth look at Charlie but an examination of his process and how
he carefully chose his stories. There are abundant clips from his early works but hardly a title of those
Keystone, Essanay, Mutual and First National films are uttered; only Sennett and Keystone are mentioned
by name. Edna Purviance, Eric Campbell, Henry Bergman and other members of the Chaplin stock company
are seen but never mentioned by name. Again, this film isn't about them. If you know all about these artisans,
you go to the head of the class. Remain seated, however, as there is more to ingest.From the start, the film tries to uncover who the real Charlie Chaplin is. We are introduced to a vast majority
of Chaplin imitators; from the best remembered to simply fans. From Billy West, Billie Ritchie to Charlie
Aplin and in between, we are invited on an expedition to discover who The Little Fellow is and who is
the man who created him.It is in the second half hour that we first get to see him in a fully developed sequence, albeit, slightly edited
from ""A Dog's Life"" (1918). It all leads up to his work on ""The Kid"" (1921) and the similarities to his own
upbringing at 3 Pownall Terrace in England. With each successive sequence from his films, we get to see how
the real world and Charlie's world commingle and why his work was influenced by the happenings surrounding
him. Through the use of footage of the England Charlie was raised in and by seeing the parallel in his own films,
the evidence is overwhelming. As is the advise given to countless creators, write what you know about.Directors Peter Middleton and James Spinney engaged researcher Erin Sayder to scour the world for film
and audio elements, interviews and photographs and they couldn't have hired a better person for the job.In my lifelong admiration for and archiving of everything Chaplin, I figured that I've seen virtually everything
connected to his career that was available. Was I incorrect on that score. Sayder tracked down a hitherto
thought to be forever lost complete recording of Chaplin's 1947 press conference at the Gotham Hotel in
New York City. Only a scant clip was known to survive but Sayder discovered the original wire recording in
a collection in San Francisco. It is one of the incredible revelations in this film. Using actors to recreate
the press conference and by having them lip sync to the actual recording, you get the feeling that you are
in the Gotham watching the press attack Chaplin as the Press conference became more of an inquisition.The use of other audio recordings with recreations are included including Chaplin's childhood friend Effie Wisdom
speaking to Kevin Brownlow (also recreated by an actor) and the 1966 audio recording of Chaplin himself
during his Life Magazine interview offer new insight into this most complex man.The film delves into the scandalous areas of his life with Joan Barry and Lita Grey Chaplin, letting us know
that while Barry's daughter wasn't biologically Charlie's and that he never mentions Lita by name in his
own autobiography, it was the cause of much concern in its day.It's the rare film footage that frequently pops up throughout this 114 minute film that is a feast for fans.The film takes the bold step to never become a ""talking heads"" documentary. Aside from the recreations,
each voice heard is from someone who knew Charlie personally; Geraldine, Eugene, Jane and Michael Chaplin,
Alastair Cooke, Georgia Hale, Virginia Cherrill (Lita Grey is seen in footage from a 1966 Merv Griffin Show and an
interview with Kevin Brownlow). Fragments from private home movies from a few sources show Chaplin at work
on ""City Lights"" (1931), at play and general clowning around for his own amusement. Footage of Charlie after he
was knighted by the Queen, traveling all over the world, making speeches, outtakes from his early works all makes
for exciting viewing. Among the rare audio is a snippet of Charlie delivering his final speech from ""The Great Dictator""
at FDR's third inauguration in 1941.Newly shot footage at the former Chaplin home in Vevey, Switzerland, now the museum, Chaplin's World, is used as
well as original footage shot in 1973 by Richard Patterson for his ""The Gentleman Tramp"" (1975) is bridged and offers
another glimpse at the private Chaplin. Part of the recreation of the 1966 Life interview was filmed in the living room.While the film is focused on the drama in Charlie's life (his daughter Jane laments that she longed to have one conversation
with her father and her alone), there is joy to be found. His beloved Oona is eulogized by her daughter Geraldine in a
loving manner, the reaffirmation of his standing in the film community as he is honored by the Motion Picture Academy
and sprinkled throughout the film, we see the admiration of fans worldwide.Richard Patterson's ""The Gentleman Tramp, arguably the finest documentary ever made on Chaplin and with the
approval of his wife is more for the person who wants to know about the man and his films with important
information about his personal life. However, ""The Real Charlie Chaplin"" takes a bolder step by digging deeper into
the darker areas. There are some who discount Lita Grey's account of her life as wife #2 but Chaplin relegated his
biography without mentioning her by name and only referencing her in three sentences so he pretty much rolled
out the red carpet for her in penning her version of life as a Chaplin. The Joan Barry paternity trial is also a matter of
public record. Even though her daughter Carol Ann wasn't his child, they were in a relationship and he was ordered to
provide for the child. It's tough medicine to swallow for a Chaplin fan and Middleton and Spinney don't spare the viewer
the details. All of this as well as his speeches snowball into Chaplin's eventual blocking from returning to the
United States in 1952.You won't see his funeral (it's never mentioned), the grave robbing incident or those sad final photographs of Charlie
in a wheelchair being pushed by his wife along Lake Geneva. That's not what this film is about. We all know Charlie
died and the directors wisely chose to steer clear of that. In this film, Charlie is alive and that's as it should be. When
archival footage does show him in a wheelchair, it's to augment a conversation Effie had with him in 1975 the last time
they were to see each other. It's one of the precious moments included in this film.The technique Middleton and Spinney use to tell this latest incarnation is top tier film making. Their choice of
narrator, Pearl Mackie is as inspired as it is daring. Her delivery in the story sounds as if she is discovering what we are
discovering at the same time. I was able to see this film in a theater and I'm very glad I did as the quality of much of the
archival footage is crisp and clear. With the recreation sequences, it adds a cinematic touch that might become lost
when viewed on a television. The music contained in the film is virtually all Chaplin and much of it has been re recorded
by accomplished musicians. This is not one of those ""quickie"" documentaries relegated to public domain footage and
audio.The Chaplin family and their representatives were very much involved in this project and the final result is a
film that will stand as an important addition to further understand the life of a remarkable man. Warts and all, Chaplin
is clearly shown as one of the great creative forces of the last century, a benchmark in cinema, at his peak, the most popular
individual who ever breathed oxygen but first and foremost, a man with human frailties and problems like all of us. We all have
things in our lives we would like to forget. I know Chaplin did too but being Chaplin, a public figure, an ""influencer"" and
a beloved figure of his time, it would be impossible to simply forget when your every word and movement is
documented and brought back to haunt you. Before the internet and modern communication, Chaplin had a tough
time avoiding his past as many public figures do today.The most ardent Chaplin fans may object to classic sequences being trimmed but again, if you want to see full clips of
Chaplin films, see ""The Gentleman Tramp"" or watch the complete films the sequences come from.Here, we get the taste, the gist, the flavor. If anything, this film should whet the appetites of viewers who will want to
seek out the treasures that await them. Charlie's story needs to be told and retold. When in the capable hands of
Middleton and Spinney, In the case of ""The Real Charlie Chaplin"", you'll be glad they did.",False
8,7,GOOD CONVERSATION STARTER...!,masonfisk,n/a,16/08/2025,"A current Showtime doc about the master of silent film. Told from actual archival audio reels by Chaplin & key players in his life, this film is a welcome intro which gets at the heart of where his genius stemmed from (his poor upbringing in a working class section of England), where it would take him (he became the preeminent filmmaker of his generation w/crowds in the thousands flocking to his appearances) & how life humbled him (his persecution by the FBI for his communist leanings & his predilection for wooing young girls). Using actor portrayals to animate the archival audio gives the spoken words a perfect concreteness since there isn't any talking head interviews (Chaplin's son & daughters are interviewed be we only hear them). Probably not the definitive word on Chaplin (even 1992's Chaplin w/Robert Downey Jr. Scratched the surface a bit) but considering Showtime's stellar documentary presentations, this one will stand for the moment.",False
9,9,Just saw it,marktayloruk,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerExcellent and revealing documentary with things I'd never come across before. Especially the FBI allegation that he was a homosexual!He was a genius who brought pleasure to the world . That more than.makes up for any faults he may have had offscreen.,True
10,6,Barely scratched the surface,tgdamsi,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great artistic effort to dissect the tramp but ultimately falls quite short of gleaning the ""real"" Charlie Chaplin. There is no more investigative work here than the gossip columns the writers clearly detested.It is unlikely that CC would have wanted to be vindicated at this point in time and certainly not in such an offhand and uninspiring fashion.Eventually we are left baffled by the lack of any insight into his mind, his genius or even his filmmaking.",False
11,8,Fascinating!,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Going into this, you could write what I know about Charlie Chaplin on a stamp. I know that his films are classics of the silent era and that he was a comic genius. But everyone knows that right? What else is there to know about Charlie? This is a brilliant documentary. Both the perfect introduction to Chaplin and an insightful and deep exploration for any die hard fan. We think Chaplin and see his character, the moustache, the hat, The Tramp. It's difficult to separate Chaplin from his screen alter ego and to be honest, without the hat and the moustache, I don't think I could pick him out of a line up. Narrated beautifully by Pearl Mackie we begin in 1889, the year of Chaplin's birth and the birth of technological invention, most notably film. There's some clever tricks that make this especially watchable. Old audio interviews, brought to life with actors lipsyncing, but it's the narrated segments that tell the story best. The script is informative, yet poetic. Telling of his arrival in America, his start on the stage, using his comic gift and charm to hide the inadequacy and fear he felt. Fear of being alone, being poor, all things he knew only too well from his childhood. Yes the physical performances are exquisite, but this guy was a master polymath. Writing, directing, producing, editing, scoring. Staggering. The archive material is fantastic. Photos, newsreel, outtakes and movie clips, but it's the stories they tell. The arrival of The Talkies, how Chaplin innovates and continues to delight. I'm left with a list of Chaplin classics that I now have to watch. The Kid, The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, The Great Dictator. These films aren't great because of the physical comedy we associate with Chaplin. It's the heart, the truth and honest of the character he portrays. All incredibly self referential. It's not just the genius onscreen Chaplin we learn about though. There's the off screen marital problems. Teenage wives, abuse, deplorable patriarchy. Although this side of Chaplin is covered relatively quickly. None of the weight is taken away. There's much more to Chaplin than slapstick and a funny walk. Political witch-hunts, overzealous governments, tabloid scandal, exile. As miraculous his rise, how sensational the fall. A truly fascinating career and a truly fascinating documentary. ""When you ask for the real Charlie Chaplin, a thousand voices reply. Some are louder than others. Some are hidden. Some struggle to be heard and others remain silent"".",False
12,5,Marred by monotonous commentary and unnecessary flashes,malcolmgsw,n/a,16/08/2025,I thought this was a fairly reasonable documentary. However there are two main problems. Firstly the truly dreadful narrator whose monotonous tone starts to grate after 5 minutes. Secondly the totally unneccesary flashes at certain junctures for example when sound arrived in Hollywood. I am not epilectic but i had to cover my eyes as it was uncomfortable. Directors of documentaries should realise that they are detracting from the story and annoying the audience.,False
13,9,Well Worth Watching!,martimusross,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Real Charlie ChaplinA really brilliantly constructed impression of Charlie Chaplin's life and work. This was done with a real sense of fairness to the man showing the complexities that lay behind a movie mogul who shaped and controlled early Hollywood to bring his dreams and stories to the big screen.It was self evident that his life was work, work and more work, and this documentary kept it interesting by examining facets and trends within his work. He was clearly a very great artist who exploited opportunity to his own advantage.I was a little surprised by the direct comparison with Hitler, which was overdone, however it neatly dovetailed into overall story of film production that seemed relevant.In terms of Mr Chaplin's private life, there wasn't much really, his life was all work. You can never expect great artists to live conventional lives. But 4 wives and 11 children says something about the man.I really enjoyed this biopic and for me it's a 9 outta 10, meaning I walked away having found the real Charlie Chaplin.",False

16,8,A not so indepth exploration of Chaplin,yowilwasup,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting story that fans have heard before. No revelations or new and interesting reveals. No deep dives. The film relies heavily on a single recorded interview Chaplin gave in 1960 and his own autobiography. No real investigation into who Chaplin really was which is ironic giving the title of the film. No examination of contemporary opinions of Chaplin's friends and peers. The most interesting part was the explanation of the circular relationship between the FBI and the media. The way Chaplin was taken down by an incestuous dynamic between the FBI and the Media. It's very analogous to recent events in American politics. The FBI feeds a story to the Media, the media prints it, then the FBI uses the media's story (that the FBI provided) as proof. Recently a sitting US President was taken down the same way. (Can you say dossier? One of the oldest tricks in the book, apparently). One other note it's odd that Chaplin's 4th wife Oona O'Neil is not identified as playwright Eugene O'Neil's daughter. (Which she was). Strangly the film alludes to the daughter of of one of America's greatest playwrights as maybe ""just a bimbo"". (Are the film makers grinding as ax? Taking a personal sideways shot at Charlie's living descendants?) Also missing is any real examination of Charlie's inappropriate (to say the least) attraction to underage girls. But then again Charlie thought the 'approved thoughts' of today so getting young girls pregnant and back alley abortions are somehow just not that important.",False

The documentary embraces the style of the silent era whilst telling the story of Chaplin from a contemporary point of view.A complex man. As all men are. As all humans are. A man scarred by a brutal, victorian, poverty stricken, working class upbringing who went on to become, possibly, the most famous man there's ever been in his own lifetime.Beautifully narrated & scored. I like how the silent film era style has been embraced in the telling of the story.

21,8,The Real Charlie Chaplin - Top-Notch Documentary,arthur_tafero,n/a,16/08/2025,"He was a perfectionist (See City Lights scene). He was a perfect comedian; but he was not a perfect man. He had several flaws. Like all the rest of us. I was ashamed of how the US treated him in the early 1950s during the moronic commie scare period. The idiotic questions of an obviously unrefined and uneducated press corps, or what passed for a press corps in 1947 after the completion of Monsieur Verdoux, were embarrassing to the profession.Pearl Mackie gives us a balanced oral history of Chaplin's origins, trip to the US, wild success in Hollywood and New York, gradual demise with the arrival of sound pictures, and then retreat from the hate-mongers that dominated both law enforcement and politics during the communist witch hunts of the early 50s. At different times, Chaplin is portrayed as a demigod, a hero, a terrible husband, an overt socialist, a fantastic success, then a fantastic failure in later life. What was really the real Chaplin? Even with this documentary, only his wife Oona, and his children knew the real Chaplin; and even that premise might be a bit suspect. No, although this film is a success, and beautifully constructed by Peter Middleton and James Spinney, I don't think anyone will ever quite know for sure what type of person Charlie Chaplin was in real life.

Kazan were in the forefront of the charge to exile Charlie, driven by professional jealousy and the urge to backstab their main competitor. Furthermore, rival comedians including J. Wayne, C.

It is so self-indulgent and artsy - deliberately - that the subject (Chaplin) becomes just a vehicle for 5he filmmaker's bells & whistles.

The most interesting part was when we heard from his family members but that just felt like a minor addition at the end. At least one of his daughters had the final word rather than the dreadful commentator!,False

1,6,Mildly interesting,OJT,n/a,15/08/2025,"Director HÃ¥vard Bustnes has finally made a documentary about politician Trond Giske. A politician many thought would go al the way to the top as a prime minister in Norway - and leading the Labour Party, the biggest party in Norway traditionally.When he is taken down due to partying and rumors of ""me too-happenings"", the time has finally come. The trials of his premature come back as a top politician.The film is mildly disappointing, and doesn't bring much new things to the table. It's a part of a leader conflict, and also about a politician who doesn't know where the limits go when it comes to acting towards younger women.Giske may not be a bad man, nor politician, but he has not been careful enough when it comes to partying and alcohol, and maybe doing the right choices.It's an interesting take, but I was expecting so much more.Only exciting for people who are really interested in recent Norwegian politics, me-too, and maybe how Giske tries a come back. Others will be bored.",False
2,6,Nothing new about Trond Giske here,dakjets,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary maker states that for many years he has wanted to make a documentary about Trond Giske, a very well-known Norwegian politician. When the documentary finally becomes a reality, this culminates with a Metoo scandal Giske who stops his career as a top politician.This documentary is mostly about everything that is rolled out in connection with the notifications that come against Giske. Several well-known journalists and analysts contribute information about the events against Giske. The documentary has also cut in news reports about the notifications. This is very well known to Norwegian public opinion. For several weeks, months, we hardly read or heard anything other than the ""Giske case"".Regardless of what we have to think about Giske and his actions, the documentary gives good insight into what a top politician is exposed to in the face of a media storm.The weakness here is that this is a topic that Giske minimally wants to comment on in the documentary. A thorough insight into what this does to a person here Giskes therefore does not emerge. It's a weakness and I lose interest. Most of what comes out here, I have seen and heard through news broadcasts before. What would have been exciting was if Giske had explained himself, how this felt etc. But this is missing to a large extent.Certainly an exciting documentary for people who are really interested in recent Norwegian politics. And not so many others.",True

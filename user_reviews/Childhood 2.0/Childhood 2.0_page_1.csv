1,10,A MUST watch for EVERY parent!!!,elizabethlhilkert,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was very informative and moving! I had no idea how many dangers children face on apps and their devices. We did not grow up with technologies that our kids are and we do not use our device the way they do. Parents aren't at fault for not knowing the risk and dangers- they just need to be educated and that is exactly what this documentary does! Every parents should be required to watch this before giving their kids a device so that they know exactly what their kids are getting into and guide them appropriately!,False
2,10,Go hug your kids,matt-68489,n/a,16/08/2025,After watching this documentary I knew I needed to go sit down and have a meaningful conversation with my kids. The movie is extremely well done. It is very eye opening to what is really happening online. I would recommend this to every parent.,False
3,10,The Facts in this movie will blow your mind!,piqueelise,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a dumb parent... or so I thought. I know about the potential dangers that children face on the internet... I know that predators are out there trying to get in good with children on the internet to hurt them in real life... But, there was a lot I didn't know... and it was shocking! I'll hug my babies a little tighter and protect them a little harder. I truly believe this is a must watch for every parent. Great job Childhood 2.0 team. I'm thankful for you and your research. It's helping me be a better parent.",False
4,10,Eye Opening Film!,dara-24018,n/a,16/08/2025,"WOW! To say I was blind to the dangers kids are facing online these days would be an understatement. This film really goes in depth and shows you how the internet, smart phones, and social media have completely changed the landscape for teens and tweens. Experts and real families share their stories and insight, there is so much for everyone to learn. This is a must see for everyone but especially parents.",False
5,10,The documentary you've been waiting for,carolinecscruggs,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is the first of its kind and an absolute must-watch for parents and caregivers everywhere. As a millennial, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what it means to be a kid growing up with technology. I was wrong. This documentary opened my eyes to what Gen Z really faces every single day and how much significance can be tied to a smartphone or Instagram account.",False
6,9,what is social about social media?,info-34248,n/a,16/08/2025,"After having watched this documentary I felt sad. Sad for my kids having to grow up in this sociall media society. It shows me, other than keeping in touch with our kids, that all of the social media and the entire internet must be controlled more to a level that is acceptable for us and for our kids. I love the internet, because it opens up the entire world for us, but the bad things outweigh the good. I know that Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and a million others care more about their profits than they care about protecting people. They should set the example, for a lot of the misery begins with them not filtering content.We point a finger to China, controlling what people can and cannot see, but is that really so bad? I disagree.Why can't all these tech giants not shake hands and build one fantastic tool, cross platform, that gives us as parents an easy and efficient control over what oir kids are allowed to watch? The tools available now either don't work or are easily to circumvent. This is what this documentary has shown to me.",False
7,10,Really eye opening,Baseballman16,n/a,16/08/2025,Really enjoyed this documentary. Think it's a must watch for parents. It's one of the only ones on this topic that actually lets the kids speak to what they experience. It's exhausting and heartbreaking hearing them deal with the sheer amount of stuff they have to deal with without the ability to cope. One gripe I have with it is it seemed to vilify young boys. I think young boys are just as much a victim to cyber bullying and exploited via porn as much as young girls. Other than that it was such a well done piece. The facts and graphs were really telling and gave you a concrete idea of how big a problem this is. I really hope we can learn how to help the situation going forward.,False
8,10,Insightful,idreamofidee,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kudos to the producers for making this film free to watch, it is incredibly important, and I've come away (hopefully) better equipped to support my own child's navigation in a world that seems so different to the one I was raised in.Would urge parents to watch this and really heed the vital perspectives shared, from both children and their parents. It is easy to watch, and though a lot of information is shared, it isn't overwhelming or difficult to comprehend. I appreciated the plethora of expert opinion, particularly by the expert from Protect Young Eyes and the woman in her 80s/90s who gave wonderful insight into what childhood was like when she was growing up.Well produced, research up to the eyeballs and touching on a topic we all seem to be dangerously skirting around (the rise of social media and the decline in mental health).",False

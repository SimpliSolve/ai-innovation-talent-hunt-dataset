1,10,Must see,hapkidoshar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Time for We The People to rise. So well done. For years the people of this nation have been told a fabricated story to benefit those who already have it all. It has been a story spun to keep the average person feeling as though they themselves are to blame for their lacking. An embarrassed future millionaire just not doing enough. If only you didn't ...
When in reality most of us are not born to wealth and will never be wealthy. However everyone should be able to have a roof , eat and prosper. We the people can do this together. Though it is heart wrenching at times it does give a ray of hope.",False
2,9,A Worthwhile Education,ollycooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a robust examination of what we can ALL agree is perhaps the most pressing domestic challenge in the United States today, income inequality. The film has a number of noteworthy qualities, including a keen sense of context that lays bare how it is that we find ourselves where we are now; a panel of experts who provide crucial color to help tell the tale; and not least a number of individual Americans who are each in their way fighting the good fight to try and make ends meet. Together, the experts and the folks just living their lives propel the narrative forward powerfully. We live in an era where it's hard to get good information. This is an intellectually honest attempt to provide what we all need to be informed. It's great to see a film like this. It's the kind of work that will make better voters of us all!",False
3,10,It Is Indeed Time to Rse,jodotcom-44534,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most powerful statements in the film 'Americonned, Time to Rise' comes from Kurt Andersen, who makes an argument in favor of wealth redistribution: ""If we divided everything up equally, the average household would have a million dollars and earn a 6-figure income...""Income inequality is rapidly becoming an issue that defines this decade. Too many people are forced to work 2-3 jobs in order to make enough money to house & feed their families. Both parents may have to work, creating a child care issue. Many don't have health care, and they go to work sick so they don't lose money to live on.The United States was once known for its prosperity, but now the middle class is supporting the wealthiest 1%, who pay no taxes, do little work themselves & want to cut all aid to the poor.The film follows the lives of a few people who are examples of the devastating reality of income inequality.Everyone in the United States should view this film. Then they should actively seek change. Current conditions are cruel and unsustainable.",False
4,10,Do Not Miss this important film!,Rose_Bleszcz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film enters our collective psyche at such a critical moment when working folks are organizing and striking at their workplaces nationwide to fight back against the enormous greed and lies of the bezos style ownership class.Sean Claffey and his talented production team have given a loud voice to all of us who are fed up and furious at the 1% types plundering our economy & our daily lives in order to buy one more mansion, one more disgusting large yacht, in this case , bezos's yacht, while spitting on the millions hard hit by the pandÃªmic's terrible economic toll.Sean follows several new unions organizing, such as the Amazon Labor Union and Starbucks Unions and several subjects trying to regain their footing after the devastation of the pandemic years..
This film has heart, soul and plenty of anger directed at those who would try to con us all
And a huge heart and soul when highlighting the way we all can successfully organize to fight it.",False
5,10,Must See,andrewsouthgate-17670,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a must see. We all work hard for our money, but wealth disparity is out of control. The cost of living has skyrocketed, but wage increases do not match. This documentary tells the story of Americans fighting to provide for their families. You will enjoy it, and you will see things that shock you.Sure, watching people struggle is uncomfortable. This is right here at home, though. These are not lazy people, living off welfare. These are hard working Americans, fighting for survival. We take for granted what we have, but if we are not careful, we could lose it all. This film is worth your time.",False
6,10,Compelling Documentary,plaprod,n/a,16/08/2025,Americonned is compelling documentary. A must see. Follow the experts and real life stories of the working class as they layout how the rich got richer on the backs of the middle class. Who are the culprits here and what can be done about it. The true life stories are compelling. A family being evicted from their home. A women truck driver looses her job. A Union man looses his job for trying to unionize his place of work. Learn how the wealth gap has increased dramatically since the 1970s. And who were the voices and decisions that help pave the way to where we are today. People will be talking about this film. Get in on the discussion.,False
7,10,Eye opening,christinarstanton,n/a,16/08/2025,"This incredibly thorough documentary is full of eye-opening statistics and jaw-dropping real life stories of the state of wealth inequality in America. Kudos to the creators- they clearly have an incredible amount of compassion for the millions who struggle in this country. There's also useful take-aways and suggestions of ways everyone can help to make things better, which I found both challenging and hopeful. I can't imagine the work that went into compiling this documentary. I hope everyone can watch it and really consider what each individual can do to level the playing field so people can live in the dignity they deserve. That we all deserve.",False
8,10,Time to stand up and push back,ConcettaBucci,n/a,16/08/2025,"This important documentary exposes the chain of historical and current events that have now made it impossible for the majority of regular Americans to achieve, much less touch the hem of the ""American Dream."" This film doesn't make connections- it REVEALS them.The film follows the stories of several American families who have watched their livelihood disappear, historical footage, statistics, judicial and political events, all interspersed with interviews with experts evaluating what has led to this point. It's a dangerous place to be right now and we can't ignore it. Everyone needs to watch Americonned.",False
9,10,Great documentary!,kevinmoore1-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an intelligent and well done documentary that takes in in-depth look into the history of unions in America and what they helped to achieve in the last century for the working class Americans. The film explores anti-union sentiments historically as well and gives insight into why unions and the unionization of certain industries rankles many in our government and the leaders of private industry.By following the lives of a handful of workers today, struggling to make ends meet for themselves and their families today, the film sheds a powerful light on how the American working class is currently so poorly treated by today's corporations. It gives hope for the future by showing how a newly formed unions are on the uptick in America and how after many years of anti-union thinking and union busting has created a backlash and given way to a rise in unionization and the power of good unions.",False
10,10,Important doc,tmarshall43,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen Americconed and it's excellent. I hope everyone can see this film. This is an excellent documentary at a critical time in our history. What these corporations are doing to workers in every industry is disgusting. I've seen it and it's very a very informative and powerful look at our need for Unions in our battle of survival against corporate greed. I would highly recommend that you go see it, buy it, rent it, and share it with your friends and family. The time has never been more pressing. The only way we survive with even a working middle class is through union solidarity amongst all industries and even then it's going to be a battle.",False
11,10,Great film!,packeysims,n/a,16/08/2025,"Awesome film my girlfriend and I really enjoyed it! It does a great job of showing both sides of hard middle class workers and corporate America politics. As someone who has worked in both construction and corporate I feel this movie provides perspective of how these situations have been created. The production, editing, directing, and ending were very very very incredible. I loved this movie I cannot wait to rewatch. If you are someone who has experience working on either side of corporate America or more middle class jobs I would highly recommend watching this film. Thank you for letting me submit my review.",False

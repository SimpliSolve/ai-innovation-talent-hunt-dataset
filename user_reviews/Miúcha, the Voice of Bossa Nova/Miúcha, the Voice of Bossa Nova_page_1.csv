1,8,Meet Miucha,bob998,n/a,16/08/2025,"I admit to never having heard of her before watching this; my knowledge of Brazilian life and culture is rather limited. Gilberto's first wife Astrud isn't mentioned, nor are his two other wives, so it's all Miucha--her music, her sketches, her daughter Bebel and so on. There is even amid all this documentary richness, a letter from Jorge Amado to Miucha's parents promoting the engagement to Gilberto. The photos and home video evidence is really engrossing and makes for the interest in the film.",False
2,10,Just fabulous,insightflow-20603,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shocking that the female narrative - that of Miucha - has been so much suppressed, especially due to her husband, Joao Gilberto, being a bully. But the film is of course much more than this, with Miucha herself blaming no-one. It's an open poetic letter. I haven't been the greatest admirer of the genre, but now I find it to be profoundly feminine in nature, and ""the three great figures"" have obviously lost in not giving this essential artist the due credit. Tom Jobim at least tried to correct what Gilberto damaged.Complete with the singer/narrator's drawings, poetry, and rich personal story coinciding with the history of the genre, the film may require more than one viewing. It's finely and lovingly crafted.",False

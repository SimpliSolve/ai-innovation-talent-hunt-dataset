1,7,A very personal movie,steiner-sam,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a documentary about a Chilean couple whose younger wife supports her husband, who has Alzheimer's.Augusto Góngora was a prominent journalist and later cultural commentator on Chilean Public Television, beginning with the Pinochet years and following. He has two children; the documentary says nothing about his first wife. He has been in a relationship with actress Paulina Urrutia since 1997; they married in about 2017, several years after Góngora was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.The documentary follows their interaction, especially during COVID-19, together with flashbacks to home movies and television clips from happier times when Góngora was practicing his profession. One of Góngora's post-Pinochet books reflected on cultural memories related to those difficult years. The documentary fashions a philosophical connection between the earlier cultural memory and the tragedy of Góngora's memory loss.""The Eternal Memory"" is a very personal movie. At first, I wondered if it was contrived reality TV, given the amiable manner in which the film initially portrays Góngora. But later, his confusion and increasing anxiety are plainly depicted. I'm not sure the memory linkage between Góngora's earlier professional life and later personal state is effective. But the film is gripping and is a challenging watch for people personally connected to someone with Alzheimer's Disease.",False
2,8,Touching and Beautiful to Observe,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival""The Eternal Memory"" is a story about Augusto and Paulina have been together for 25 years. Eight years ago, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Both fear the day he no longer recognizes her. The film was one of the best documentaries from this years festival as the film was able to capture the relationship between the couple with heartwarming sequences. Director Maite Alberdi was able to perfectly capture life of having Alzheimer's disease and was able to make the characters very interesting to observe. Alzheimer's disease is a disease that is difficult to cure and it's interesting to see a story revolving around a real couple going through this process and seeing how they are able to resolve their conflicts.Many archival footages used to describe the setting and situations were purposeful and well informative. Many of the dialogue moments were very interesting as it was very fun to observe and listen to the two main lead characters to talk about their lives and love. Along with other participants, there are some many interesting conversations provided and the tone goes from sometimes comedic and touching at the same time. From someone who has a relative who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, the film does hit home pretty hard.Overall, it's a great documentary and it's one of the best at Sundance.Rating: A-",False
3,8,It Will Warm and Break Your Heart,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's been said that one of the most cherished hopes for a loving relationship is that its partners inevitably have someone with whom they can grow old together, a time when they can warmly look back on their time as a couple with fondness and treasured memories. But what happens when something occurs that threatens to steal those precious recollections? That's one of the tragedies that can come with various forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's Disease, a condition that seriously endangered the long-term loving partnership of renowned Chilean author/journalist Augusto Góngora and his wife, actress and former Minister of Culture Paulina Urrutia. But, rather than seeking seclusion in the wake of that diagnosis, Góngora insisted on making his story public, telling the tale of his condition and the diligent, compassionate efforts of Urrutia in acting as his caregiver, particularly in helping him hold on to his memory as fully and as long as possible. Their story is sensitively recounted in writer-director Maite Alberdi's moving documentary, a film that will simultaneously warm and break your heart. In telling their tale, this title explores the importance of preserving one's memories as a measure of one's identity and accomplishments, both personally and professionally. In Góngora's case, that involves the depth of his love for his wife, family and friends, as well as the critical role he played in making the Chilean public aware of the grotesque atrocities that unfolded in the wake of the country's 1973 coup d'etat and the restoration of the nation's cultural and artistic heritage after its return to democracy with the ouster of the Pinochet regime in 1990. Those recollections, in his view, represent a depth of courage that's to be preserved and not lost to the ravages of time and illness. This Oscar nominee for best documentary feature and its designation as one of 2023's top documentaries by the National Board of Review is a striking piece of filmmaking, one that's sure to touch virtually anyone who watches it (but be sure to keep those hankies handy). When we consider what can potentially be lost under circumstances like these, any efforts made to prevent that are truly heroic steps to be commended, and this film does an outstanding job at making that known, both in this case and as a practice to be employed whenever comparable conditions arise.",False
4,10,Emotional Masterpiece: 'The Notebook' Redefined in this Profound Documentary!,yolanda_sangareau,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely captivating! I was so lost in the story that I had no idea how much time had gone by. The storytelling, as it moves from past to present, felt like an emotional symphony. Understanding Spanish made it so much more moving. Felt like watching The Notebook for the first time and in a documentary. A masterpiece that stirred my emotions like no other film in years.Moreover, this documentary highlights the profound talent of women directors, showcasing their ability to craft narratives that resonate deeply. It's a testament to the need for more recognition for this exceptional contribution to the film industry. Deserves a much higher rating!",False
5,8,"Of love, memory and identity",isaacsundaralingam,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Eternal Memory"" is a portrait of love, memory and identity as chronicled through the penultimate days of renowned Chilean journalist Augusto Gongora by his wife, the actress and politician Paulina Urrutia. It's a profound look at love and companionship and is also an enlightening study of the concepts of memory and identity... Whether that be of Gongora himself, who due to his Alzheimer's is losing his memory, or the work he dedicated his life to, that being the preservation of the collective Chilean memory and identity. It's a sad but tender documentary that is universal in its message and inclusive in its identity. It's a part of us, a part of humanity and a part of the future. Do check this out!",False
6,7,The Eternal Memory,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Filmed during the COVID lockdown, this really is a poignant and affecting love story. We are introduced to Augusto Gongora and his wife Paulina Urrutia. The former was an accomplished television journalist in Chile during it's frequently turbulent times, she an acclaimed actress and they have, by 2023, been married for a quarter of a century. What we discover quickly is that he is suffering from Alzheimer's and as the pair continue through the life, both dread what they know to be coming: the day when he will no longer know who she is. This is one of those rare documentaries where the actuality of the political trouble and strife actually serve to deliver us a bit of a breather from the intensity of this most human of stories as the couple wake up each morning without any idea what that day may bring. The lockdown scenario and the hand-held photography ensures that there are few other characters to divert our focus from this intimate and heart-rending depiction of their determination not to allow this disease to prevail any earlier than they have to. Their habits and routines are designed to elicit as many memories and triggers as possible to enable Augusto to hold onto his soul for just that bit longer, but he isn't a King Canute and even throughout the timeframe of this documentary we see that they cannot thwart the inevitable. It's not some melancholy affair, though. Their grandchildren enliven things and this couple are still very much up for the joys of life. There is plenty of laughter to remind us that it's life they want to live, not just an existence they wish to seek. From an observer's perspective we also get a little of the sense of the frustration felt by this man who, as a journalist, was a voracious reader but who can no longer enjoy his vast library. We also see a dedication and affection from Paulina who must also recalibrate from time to time to ensure that she doesn't succumb to the relentless pressures of living such an unpredictable life. This isn't an easy watch, but over ninety minutes we get an insight into just how spirit and a sense of humour can still make a difference.",False
7,8,Well deserved Best Documentary Oscar nomination,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Eternal Memory"" (2023 release from Chile; 84 min.) opens, we are introduced to Augusto and Pauli, a couple that has been together over 20 years. Augusto has Alzheimer's and Pauli lovingly takes care of him. We then go back in time, to the days when Augusto was a respected TV reporter who covered the Pinochet era, and when Pauli was a respected actress who eventually became Chile's Minister of Culture. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is directed by Maite Alberdi, who also directed ""The Mole Agent"", an Oscar-nominated documentary. Here she follows the descent of one man's descent into the hell that is Alzheimer's, and how his wife deals with it. Let me state upfront that my dad dealt with this horrible disease for years up until his death in 2007. It was as if I was watching my dad in this documentary. Exactly the same anguish, desperation, confusion, frustration (""What's wrong with me? I need help!""). This isn't the Hollywood version of Alzheimer's, none of which worse than the pathetic 2014 movie ""Still Alice"" (for which Julianne Moore won an Oscar no less). This documentary shows what Alzheimer's is really like: a vicious, uncurable disease that knows no mercy, and which never has a happy Hollywood ending, as this documentary heartbreakingly demonstrates.""The Eternal Memory"" is currently rated 93% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. Just a few days ago, it also received a well-deserved Best Documentary Oscar nomination. The movie is currently streaming on Paramount+ , where I just watched it last night. If you are interested in Alzheimer's for whatever reason, do yourself a favor: check this out sooner rather than later, and draw your own conclusion.",False
8,6,Emotional but flat,Movie_Rating_n_Ranking,n/a,16/08/2025,"In The Eternal Memory, there is a strong emotional charge from the first moment, which is maintained until the last seconds. This is the hook for the general audience, since emotionality is associated with relatable events. My biggest problem with this documentary is that the story loses its direction in monotony, falling into a plot dead end from which it cannot escape. It seems more like a video diary of the progression of one of the protagonists' illness, which also doesn't quite work, since there are inexplicable time jumps and events that remain unmentioned.The documentary only relies on its high emotionality to attract an audience and there is nothing more to tell.It's not completely flat and boring, but I would recommend other works alluding to the topic in question, such as the films Still Alice or The Father.",False
9,10,Could be the best documentary of the year,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe above statement is, of course, no faint praise, given the overall impressive outlook of incredible films in all genres throughout the year. This Oscar nominee, however, is definitely a true standout - and a very low key, emotional and sometimes beautiful, yet horrifying, outlook at life.It is expertly cut, and utilizes a nice blend of present and past through great imagery and cinematography. Incredibly well cut and edited, to say the least.Overall, definitely an eye-opening, tragic, yet in some ways hopeful, documentary, and one that is, of course, ever recommended. Very much deserving of its Oscar nomination!",True
10,7,Beautiful couple!,khalidmoubile,n/a,16/08/2025,"La memoria infinita.Augusto and Paulina have been together for 25 years. Eight years ago, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Both fear the day he no longer recognizes her.Eternal Memory is documentary about a sweet couple living together for 25 years, sharing the sweetest and saddest moments of their lives.When Augusto was diagnosed with Alzheimer, it changed everything but their relationship and it developed a beautiful manner to manage the situation from Paulina, who's a wonderful patient woman, that could and can handle not being recognized by her husband and still loving him unconditionally, they also have amazing moments together when he's in a good shape and I can say that this couple probably enjoys life more than we actually do!Talking now about the documentary, I think it was long anyway, it's a 1 hour and 20 minutes long film, but I don't think the story needed that much time to be told, I would have loved it more in short film format.",False
11,8,sharing a laugh and a dance,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Augusto and Paulina are a real couple facing real challenges in the real world. Their challenges aren't related to where to head for dinner or whether Augusto will leave the toilet seat up or down. No, their daily challenges are whether Augusto will wake up and recognize his wife, or even know his own name. Chilean Documentarian Maite Alberti climbs inside this relationship to show us the real impact of Alzheimer's Disease, and does so expertly and intimately.Augusto Gongora was a professional News Reporter/Journalist during the Pinochet regime, and Paulina Urrutia was a successful actor ... both well known in their country. We even see clips and archival newsreels of Augusto's work. However, filmed during COVID, almost the entirety of the film is focused on these two people taking each day as it comes ... the good days and the not-so-good days. And perhaps 'moments' is a better measure than days, as this cruel disease can shift quickly. Paulina handled much of the camera work so the director and crew could keep safe distance during the pandemic, and the result is a few blurry shots, none of which detract from what we are meant to see.Paulina helps Augusto with his memory of work and kids. She helps him take a shower. She reads to him when they take walks, and she cringes as he rides a bicycle. She helps him with his eye protection as they view the eclipse. They even treasure the time they can dance together. There are many times they share a laugh, and there are times Paulina cries alone or Augusto appears lost. Mostly they have their tender moments which define the relationship that they so want to hold on to ... all while surrounded by Augusto's lifelong collection of books that fill the house - most of which he can no longer read.Theirs is a love story. And it's real.",False
12,7,The Eternal Love!,li0904426,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie ""The Eternal Memory"" is a Chilean documentary that delves into the resilience of love in the face of memory loss. Director Maite Alberdi, known for her other documentary ""The Mole Agent,"" takes us back in time to explore the lives of Augusto Gongora and Paulina Urritia, a couple recognized for their famous careers in Chile-he as journalist and writer, and she as an actress. Using archival footage, the director highlights Augusto's political activism during Pinochet's dictatorship, alongside his relationship with his wife Paulina. They both confront the fear that his deteriorating memory might one day erase their love. Paulina's persistent struggle to keep her presence alive in Augusto's memory is both deeply touching and sad.This documentary is a sensitive and poignant documentary that discusses the suffering that everyone feels when the memory of a loved one begins to fade, exactly like smoke that gradually evaporates.The final half hour of the movie appears to be abruptly edited, leaving us with a detailed understanding of the couple's life together but lacking insight into the progression of Alzheimer's and its impact on both.",False
13,10,The Eternal Memory --- Love that lasts even when memories fade,sadmansakibayon,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film follows a couple, Augusto Góngora and Paulina Urritia, who are dealing with Augusto's quickly progressing Alzheimer's disease. If you know this illness you know that the deterioration is quick, shocking and inevitable, and while they both attempt to make the best of a bad situation there is no way to keep the film from feeling like an emotional punch by the end.One thing that manages to lighten up the film and make it ultimately life affirming is the fact that the couple are clearly excellent people, Augusto having been a reporter fighting the Pinochet régime in Chile, with a true joy for life and compassion for humanity which is very clear in the first stages of the illness. Paulina for her part is a very sweet carer for Augusto, and even with the inevitable frustration with the situation (when he doesn't recognize her for hours on end, for example) she tries to keep her cool, which can't be easy. A couple in love facing the end of one of themselves and themselves as a couple, it's a hard but rewarding watch.",False
14,9,(Broken) Memory,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - the movie/documentary is really well done - but also tough to watch at times. For someone who loses their mind ... it is not as painful or bad for them, but it is quite hurtful and straining for the loved ones ... in this case the wife.In this case it is not just anyone who has dementia - though I reckon if you are from another country (like me), you may not know him. Don't worry though we will get to know him better and all the things he stood up for - or against for that matter.And seeing him, full of life and force ... and then with the illness ... it is heartbreaking ... of course there is more to it and he has good moments too. But be aware there is much that might break you ... not an easy one to watch for sure ... now you know ...",False
15,n/a,Profound film about love,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this film I realised what it means to love a person to pieces. Augusto and Paulina have been together for 25 years. Augusto has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the day is not far when he'll stop recognising her. Covid lockdown makes it worse for the couple because they are cut off from friends and his condition worsens much more quickly because of the isolation. The film uses archival footage to show glimpses from their past. Paulina is much younger to Augusto Góngora, a prominent journalist from when Pinochet was in power. She is the minister of Culture. He's also very popular amongst his friends. Paulina sticks by his side as his condition fails. It's these scenes that are really touching, her dedication and commitment even as he's drifting into the darkness. It's the memory of love that sustains them, and it's this memory which is eternal, even as the physical body deteriorates. Kudos to Maite Alberdi for making this great love story.",False

1,9,The Most Funniest Film I've Seen In Awhile,marshallfg,n/a,17/08/2025,"When I realize how many lives were ruined and families torn apart in the aftermath of January 6, 2021 I didn't think even the Babylon Bee could find anything amusing about it. But somehow they not only succeeded in making me laugh out loud; but they also successfully drove home the point that the event has been way overblown.They did this by conducting on-the-street interviews. People can say their interviews were staged, but there was clearly a variety of opinions.The most moving part of the documentary was their naming of a few people (out of approximately 1400) who were charged and heavily penalized for minor infractions.That some of the people involved could be persuaded to play along with the gags after all they'd been through speaks volumes about how subversive and ""dangerous"" they really are.What's not at all funny is that people have lost jobs, businesses, livelihoods, veteran's benefits, and even homes for exercising their freedom of speech. Families have been torn apart and even relatives have been put on watch lists. And many January 6th protesters are languising in prison after all these years and still awaiting trial.I'm glad the Babylon Bee is able to help us find some humor in a very uneasy subject. Heaven help us all if we ever lose our ability to laugh.",False
2,n/a,Satire at Its Finest,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"A wonderful satirical take on the events of January 6th. The cast humorously juxtaposes the events of that day with other recent national events to highlight the hypocrisy of the media and national leaders.The documentary includes takes by actual pundits, interviews with those participating in the Capitol incursion, and statements by national politicians.The documentary is fairly high level and meant as satire - it does not drill down into the events or analyze footage or conspiracies in depth. But that is obviously not the point of the movie. The point of the movie is to drive subscriptions to the Babylon Bee enabling purveyors of conservative satire to live lives of luxury and leisure. Or to make a political point. I am not sure.Firdt!",False
3,10,The most bestliest movie on January 6th ever,yusamac,n/a,17/08/2025,"From the beginning, this movie had me laughing. The whole movie is funny, but in this review I'll only use scenes in the trailer so that I don't have to add a spoiler. In jest, it is time for you to experience the only review that this movie deserves.At the beginning, I didn't think anybody could make a film about such a deadliest day without it being super super scary. Thankfully, I was right and the reporters at the Babylon Bee made the most scariest movie on January 6th maybe ever. For example, anybody who knows anything about January 6th knows that one of the most frighteningly parts was when somebody moved Nancy Pelosi's personal lectern. You would be happy to know that the Babylon Bee showed that scene in all of its terrible darkness.Of course though, a movie can't just be scary. It must also make sense. I really appreciated how the Babylon Bee's expert documentary began at the beginning, went to the middle, and ended at the end. Also, any viewer would be happy to know that the Babylon Bee's crack reporters ask the hard hitting questions to make sure that everyone understands the truth. For example, I got really bored when the wrong alt-right extremists were explaining how the election worked, but the Babylon Bee reporters solved this boredom by forcing them to explain it using Marvel characters.Of course, like every other movie, there were a couple of problems with this one. For example, the Babylon Bee never explained whether Iron Man was elected president before or after the events of ""Captain America Civil War.""Overall, the Babylon Bee's January 6th movie is fantastic. It is an even better movie than the critically acclaimed Cars 2, a better documentary than Al Gore's ""An inconvenient Truth"", and better reporting than the amazing journalists at CNN or The View.",False

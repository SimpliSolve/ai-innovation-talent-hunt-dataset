1,7,"Simple, honest & worth it",raghavasmita,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show feels like it's just telling you a story , no drama, no gimmicks, no ""wait till the next twist"" nonsense. It's rare to see something on Netflix in 2025 that's this subtle and still holds your attention without even trying.The plot isn't stretched thin, and nothing feels forced. It moves at a pace that's natural, slow enough to feel real but never boring. You just... keep watching. Not because you're desperate to know ""what happens next,"" but because it's simply good storytelling.If you need non-stop suspense or a jaw-drop every 10 minutes, this isn't for you. But if you like stories that feel real, characters you believe in, and an overall vibe that's calm but still magnetic, this is such a refreshing watch. Sometimes the best shows don't scream for your attention - they just stay with you.",False
2,7,Interesting documentary,pik923,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell done, I enjoyed it, kept me thinking and pondering who was who and what did they know and how did they pull this off. This is a spoiler coming so if you don't know anything about the events, and what to remain in suspense, read this after watching the film on Netflix. It does not make sense that after all this careful and clever investigation how to do it, when, what was needed, what experts were needed and keeping the group small that at the very end they would be so very careless. Yes of course it is karma, and unfortunately many lost everything and nothing ever uncovered or found. Sentences seems awfully light considering the amount of damage that was done ie many businesses were destroyed and the amount stolen amazing! But how did they become so sloppy at the end? That to me makes no sense unless they wanted to be caught because of some egotistical desire to be known for the heist of the century. Worthwhile watching, enjoy.",True
3,7,Sheer audacity and brazenness makes this the real Mission Impossible,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Stolen: The Heist of the Century"" (2025 release; 95 min.) opens, it is ""Monday, 17th February 2003"", and we learn that over the weekend, the District Center in Antwerp, Belgium has been breached, with millions worth of diamonds gone. Antwerp is the diamond capital of the world (85% of the world's diamonds pass through it.) Who could have possibly done this? And, even more intriguingly, HOW? At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is directed by Mark Lewis (""Vatican Girl""). Here he reassesses after more than 2 decades how this heist was executed. The sheer audacity and brazenness of this heist immediately made me think of some of the Mission Impossible movies. Except of course this is not fiction, and it really did happen. I'm not going to spoil anything. Just sit back, relax and enjoy this real life Mission Impossible. I hasten to add that I myself hail from Antwerp, Belgium (but now a longtime resident of the US), and I immediately recognized most of the footage showing Antwerp (affectionally nicknamed by the locals as ""t Stad"", which means ""the City"" in English). I was in Antwerp just last week in fact.""""Stolen: The Heist of the Century"" started streaming recently on Netflix, which ""suggested"" it to me based on my viewing habits. Thanks Netflix! If you are in the mood for a captivating true crime documentary that is as stunning as it is brazen, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,6,"Enjoyable, but leaves a bitter aftertaste",tiwaz-65695,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the outset, it's unclear whether we're watching a faithful reconstruction of real events or a Blair Witch-style fiction. That ambiguity seems deliberate, and while it unsettles, it also piques curiosity.The restrained tone in presenting the events is appreciated-it enhances their plausibility. I understand that stories like this require certain narrative and stylistic liberties, and overall, the staging works.However, as the film progresses, inconsistencies begin to emerge, creating narrative dissonance. By the end, the viewer is likely left with basic, even crucial questions that the director appears to have deliberately avoided. That omission not only weakens the story but leaves the audience with a lingering sense of emptiness.What initially promised to be a compelling documentary ultimately dissolves into a narrative that doesn't dare to close its own doors. In the end, you're left with a ""well... I guess that's it,"" when you were hoping for something far more impactful.",False
5,7,In and Out Without a Trace: The Diamond Vault Mystery,ALPHAxVENOM,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStolen: Heist of the Century is a compelling true-crime documentary that unravels the fascinating story behind the infamous 2003 Antwerp Diamond Heist-widely regarded as one of the most brilliant and mysterious thefts in modern history. Directed with precision and backed by real interviews, archival footage, and dramatic reconstructions, the documentary gives viewers a front-row seat to one of the boldest robberies ever attempted.The film centers around Leonardo Notarbartolo and his team of highly skilled criminals, who managed to bypass layers of high-tech security in the Antwerp Diamond Center to steal more than $100 million worth of diamonds, gold, and other precious stones-most of which have never been recovered. What makes the story so riveting is not just the scale of the heist, but the surgical precision with which it was carried out. From bypassing motion detectors and infrared sensors to outsmarting the vault's elaborate security systems, the gang's tactics are mind-blowingly sophisticated.The documentary does a great job balancing the technical aspects of the heist with the human story behind it. Through interviews with investigators, journalists, and even some of those involved in the crime, the film pieces together how the so-called ""School of Turin"" pulled off the impossible. It's as much a puzzle as it is a story of crime, trust, and betrayal.For viewers who are still intrigued or want to dive deeper into the dramatized version of these events, Everybody Loves Diamonds-available on Amazon Prime Video-is an excellent companion piece. It takes creative liberties but adds emotional and cinematic layers that help fill in the blanks left by the documentary format.In conclusion, Stolen: Heist of the Century is a must-watch for true-crime fans and anyone interested in the art of the heist. It's smart, suspenseful, and a reminder that sometimes, reality really is stranger than fiction.",True
6,10,Best of 25,unknownmichael,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a huge fan of documentaries, I can say that this is my favorite of 2025 and probably in my top ten overall. The story of how these men pulled off a diamond heist from the diamond capital of the world-- in a building that could be described as Belgium's fort Knox-- kept me intrigued from start to finish. I'll spare the details, but suffice to say that this team had to think of everything and took their time doing it. It really kept me on the edge of my seat, as if I was watching a Mission Impossible movie the entire time.I can't recommend this documentary enough.",False
7,5,Strange Doc,ifsixwasnine-sw,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe story was interesting enough, but the telling of it was lacking. It wasn't suspenseful and kind of boring. Then the twist about the detective? This wasn't explored enough. The film makers seemed more interested in the look of the film than telling a compelling story. Just disappointed that this amazing story didn't get a amazing documentary.",True
8,3,Illogical,TarakB-27,n/a,16/08/2025,"1. The heist was carried out in 2003, so one week after that incident, the main culprit comes back to diamond building and the detective gets a call to his android mobile phone while he driving his bike to home. I mean seriously!! The android phone in 2003!.2. The day of heist is Feb 15th and 16th of 2003. They showed us that cctv the video cassettes were missing for those 2 days that's fine. But they revealed that after performing that heist in 15th night, the robbers take out the cassettes of 11th Feb from the rack and at that time there were no cassettes of 15th and 16th and the cassettes of 17, 18, ,19, and 20th of Feb are there in that row ( this happens in 15tg night).I mean how the hell are those cassettes got missed on the same date? And how the hell the cassettes of next 4 days were kept there ( you can't have cctv footage of tomorrow and day after tomorrow on today right??)",False
9,1,Poor Example for a documentary,pietclausen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't think I have ever written a review of a documentary. Having seen many good documentaries, I was interested in watching this one. What a disappointment! It is just a continuous natterring of a cop's voice with some background assumed happening of the heist. Watching this was a total bore and no facts were laid bare other than assumptions. Eventually it comes to a conclusion after 1 and a half hours, but by then I was totally fed-up and sorry I watched it to conclusion.",False

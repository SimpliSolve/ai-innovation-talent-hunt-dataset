1,2,Starts out great ends bad,idospasjody,n/a,15/08/2025,I had such hopes this particular show. It was really amazing with all of the documentary. I loved every moment of it until the very second at the end. Why would they do that to us drag you out through the whole time and then at the very end they just say goodbye with no explanation. I guess I'm 17 words away from being able to submit this review. Which really sucks.,False

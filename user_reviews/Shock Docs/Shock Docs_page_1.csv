1,8,Fun,mentiramivida6,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've only seen the Devil Made Me Do It episode on HBO, so my rating is for that. I love Ed and Lorrains tales of their encounters. Well those of that have been made into films. I never got to see them speak but a tiny hand full of times. I would have loved to see them like the terrible ghost hunting shows we have now in days. Mainly because the little I have seen of them they never used gimmicks, terrible narratives voices, nor seemed to speak in a way they had no clue what they were doing (as shows now in days do).This show did a good job. Nothing seemed too far fetched or overall dreadful. The minor gimmick used could have not been used. If you do a good job describing/telling your story gimmicks aren't needed.",False
2,8,Overall an 8. Ed Gein episode was a dud though,dannymitt,n/a,16/08/2025,"As soon as I saw the guy from the Saginaw haunting series I knew most of the non-documentary parts were going to be cheesy, and I was right. Wasn't really up to par with the show's preceding episodes, but I will always watch and wait for new ones!",False
3,7,Some suspicious things,ehhj-87514,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAm I the only one who noticed that his implant changed sides? On the video with the doctor it was on Whitley left ear, but when he is using the walkie saying it receives interference from his implant, he puts the walkie near his right ear.What about all that fake smoke trying to make up a climax for the movie in the end?And now everything that happens is aliens fault? His cellphone falls down and it was the aliens, he wakes at 3am and its the aliens.I understand they want to include more stuff to make a story longer for a movie and more interesting. But you add to many and you commit mistakes that affect the veracity of it.",True
4,1,Ed Gein's mother's ghost on the radio! HA!,GSK23,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched the Ed Gein episode. If the rest of the series is this laughably bad, you can count me out.This wasn't about Gein as much as it was about two hammy and bad actors playing the parts of a ""paranormal investigator"" and ""psychic medium"" staggering around Planefield, Wisconsin looking for Ed Gein's ghost. Loaded with continuity errors, bad musical cues and cheap editing; this was embarrassing on so many levels.They talked a lot about evidence, but there really wasn't anything. I mean, yeah, they had a special radio that talks to ghosts. You read that right. I'm pretty sure that wouldn't count as ""evidence"" to any REAL researcher! But, whatever. People that watch a lot of tv will believe anything, I guess.",False
5,1,What a load of crap!!,firballblaze-69689,n/a,16/08/2025,Just another stupid fake paranormal just show with laughable fake mediums. Don't waste your time. People are so stupid......,False
6,1,Cringingly Stupid and Boring,kelani,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being an anthology, you hope that there will be an occasional standout episode, but for me, that hope is fading fast. This show accomplishes the difficult task of actually making the paranormal boring.It's the same old creaky formula. Overdramatized re-creations of an allegedly paranormal event, re-described in excruciating detail by self-proclaimed ""experts"", who either come off as completely delusional or just being there for a paycheck. There's the same old boring ""dramatic"" music, complete silence to let you know you're about to get a jump scare. And acting so bad that it will make you cry with laughter. So yeah, that's one reason to watch this, it's because it is so hilariously bad.In fact, the haunted doll episode features literally the worst acting I have seen in half a century. Casting could've picked random people off the street, and they would (not could) have done a better job.We really need to start demanding more of our throwaway, garbage TV. Because this guy doesn't just scrape the bottom of the barrel, it blasts clean through it.",False
7,1,The Visitors - They Debunked Themselves,chrisolsson-94226,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou too can see where Whitney Strieber and this shows highest rated episode ""The Visitors S3. E4"" slip up in the story. Before I point it out, I can assure you I was fascinated by Strieber's book when I was a teenager. I should also point out that I've never seen any other episode of Shock Docs.I reviewed the footage and found it was not accidentally reversed imaged. All you have to do is pay attention to the wedding band on Strieber's left hand.At 53:12, Strieber touches his LEFT ear with his LEFT hand bearing his wedding ring indicating the location of where the implant was inserted.At 53:35, the ""actual"" footage allegedly shows an unnamed ""doctor"" making a possible cut on the LEFT ear of man facing away from the camera in the presence of Strieber's wife. You'll notice that you won't be able to visually identify either Strieber or his wife in the footage. The important thing to remember is the implant is supposed to be in the LEFT ear.At 01:14:10, you will see Strieber placing the radio to his ear as the radio reacts by transmitting similar sounds to those ""captured"" by this investigative team's ""EMT"" cans with lights and primitive telescopic antennae. As he does this, Strieber says ""It's reacting to the presence of my implant."" This is where he and the show's producers mess the whole thing up. He's holding it to his RIGHT ear. Not the LEFT ear where the implant is supposed to be located. Strieber's wedding ring is still on his LEFT hand negating any claim of accidental film reversal.Whoops! Rookie mistakes by the whole team.In addition, I have reason to suspect from other footage within the show that one of the show's actors was aware of this mistake. Too much was invested to nix the episode during post production.It's hard to watch most television a being 27yr trained professional investigator. Caught it quick.",True

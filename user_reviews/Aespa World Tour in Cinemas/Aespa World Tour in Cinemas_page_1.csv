1,10,The movie,fairyliquid-20351,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely amazing! It felt like you were in the arena screaming the lyrics from the top of your lungs. It felt wonderful.it was very sweet that they showed the fans before concert and in the concert. I really liked that the members talked about other members and said some TMI's, not big ones but still. If you are a true MY i suggest you to watch it!! Me and my friend even tiered up a bit at the end. And the start? OMG! I felt goosebumps for good 15-20 minutes. Loved that they also showed behind the scenes in the tour, how they got ready etc. Absolutely LOVE those parts were they practise. In short- an incredible, beautiful, interesting, wonderful movie!",False

3,10,Love this movie!!,DoctorThor,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before seeing this film, I had only listened to 1 or 2 Aespa songs. But after watching it, I'm now a huge fan of theirs. Blackpink initially introduced me to K-pop, but Aespa quickly became my favorite group, and they remain so. Their choreography and movements are incredibly mesmerizing, and their voices are just phenomenal. I particularly enjoyed Winter's solo performance of ""Lips."" The behind-the-scenes content, including the interviews with all the members, was a highlight, as it allowed me to learn more about them. The film solidified my love for the group and left me hoping to catch one of their concerts live someday. You can definitely consider me a MY now! I also hope this film gets added to streaming services sometime soon.",False
4,3,🤦🏻I'm sorry but 2 out of the 4 Girls are Terrible Dancers🤦🏻,DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just got out of a Screen X Aespa World Tour Screening.After Watching Beyonces' Film ""Renaissance"" and Taylor Swifts Film ""The Eras Tour"" , this Aespa Film Was an absolute Letdown.3 people got up and left the film 10 minutes before the end. And as soon as the film ended, this couple got up and bolted towards the exit.Aespas' Music Video Performances DO NOT translate to a Live Performance at all, and it's because 2 of the 4 Girls are not Great Dancers, they were not giving it their all and it completely stands out when all 4 are Dancing Near eachother.🌟 Karina - By far the Best of all 4 of the Girls, Best Bodily Movement in the Routines and she Looks Stunningly Beautiful 😍 too.✨ Winter - Second Best of the 4, she does Very Well in the Routines and again, very Beautiful 💙.🎤 Ningning - Great Singing Ability, but Very Bad Dancer. Too Lackluster. She needs to Drastically Improve.🤷 Giselle - Terrible Dancer, just terrible. The Casting of Aespa could of literally went on to the Street and got anyone for the 4th spot. She needs vast amounts of Dance and Routine training.Beyonce and Taylor Swift go Full Force in their Live Performances and I understand that this is a Girl group of 4, so it's even harder.So here's what to do -💃First of all, Ningning & Giselle need to Drastically improve their bodily Movement, it was lackluster as hell at times. Just terrible. They need Sharp and Strong Movements like Karina, not Lackluster and weak as hell movements.🔀 Also, change up the routines, have 2 girls do one routine simultaneously, and have the other 2 girls do another routine simultaneously.🔃 Start getting some new and better moves too. Some of the moves were generic as hell.It got so bad that the Backup Dancers were better than 2 of the Girls.1 Positive, The Stage Backgrounds looked Great, and some of their Best Songs were great to hear, especially my favourite song of theirs ""Next Level"".Overall, this film was nowhere Near Beyonce and Taylor Swifts Films.",False
5,10,Infinity/10 (Totally not biased 🙃),medranoizak,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was such an amazing concert!!! The girls slayed as always, their vocal ability is *chef's kiss 💋 Their solos are also amazing and the whole experience is amazing too!!! I really recommend you go listen to the solos before so you can sing them on the concert, though if you don't want to spoil them, sure go listen to them on concert. I love the documentary style parts too, it is very beautiful, adorable and so the aespa girls are always so charming and lovable. The members really have THAT charisma. You really have to experience it for yourself, totally recommend it!!! Infinity out of 10... The score I'd give if I could!!! 💙🌟🦋 🌙",False

1,10,Facts over narratives,gabrielzinato,n/a,17/08/2025,"""From the river to the sea..."" how do people sing that, again? Oh, right... ""...Palestine will be free"". But here's how Hamas sings it:""From the river to the sea, Palestine will be ARAB""The cruel reality of the Middle East is fleshed out in this documentary, showing the points of view of israeli jews whose family members died or were kidnapped in the attack of October 7th 2023, of palestinian citizens who suffer with the aftermath of the conflict, even palestinian children and remembering that there are innocents in both Israel and in Palestine, but also showing how there are no innocents in Hamas, who uses palestinians as human shields. What Hamas wants is not ""freedom"" for Palestine, but genocide for jews, christians, persians... Israel is just the ""small devil"" (that's how they call Israel) and their current enemy, not the only one. The USA is who they call ""big devil"". They just don't terrorize the USA ""yet"" and the whole West should understand the threat of terrorists is not local or limited. If left unchecked, it'll just keep spreading.In the broader picture, the documentary explores the role of other countries in the conflict: what does Iran (shia muslims) have to gain with the conflict between Israel and Hamas (sunni muslims)? Why is Qatar paying the university expenses of students in the USA?This documentary is available for free in Youtube with English subtitles and is a must watch for anybody trying to better understand the many facets of the conflict.",False
2,10,Great,colarusso-1,n/a,17/08/2025,"One of the best documentaries there is about the tragic conflict between Israel and Hamas. Especially in Brazil, where the press flirts with anti-Semitism, it is important to see documents, recordings and testimonies from both sides of the conflict. Furthermore, from a technical point of view, the documentary is brilliant, capturing the original languages with excellent subtitles. Really, to inform yourself not only about the conflict but also about the enormous influence of Iran, the documentary is enormously rich. I confess that at the end of the documentary I was shocked to foresee a huge setback in Western civilization. In a certain sense I feel privileged to have taught this excellent ""class"" on the subject. Bravo Brasil Paralelo for this exquisite production.",False

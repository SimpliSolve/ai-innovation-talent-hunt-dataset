1,7,ROOTS,js-66130,n/a,15/08/2025,"If a tree falls in a forest, does it hurt? Peter Wohlleben would like a word, or several thousand. ""The Hidden Life of Trees"" follows the maverick tree hugger around as he tries to make the case for a complex, communicating community of wood. Based on his best selling book of the same name, the documentary brings the lanky German to life as a media savvy eco-warrior with some astounding propositions. Dispelling some startling myths like our misguided attempt to reseed the forest instead of letting nature do all the work, is chief to the power of this film.The composting, self-fertilizing nature of rotting trees, and the connection with the entire ecosystem is an eye-opener. Wohlleben gets a little carried away though, whimsically portraying trees as sentient beings capable of high level communication. Yes there is some kind of interplay here in nature's wonderland, which humans are probably best to leave the damn alone, but social advances by trees like making agreements with fungi, would be better served with less magical wonder and more actual science.The movie works best when presenting clinical facts with beautiful cinematography, aiming at the just the right balance of eco awareness, eco dread, and possible eco solutions. Trees do appear to be more complex than anyone ever imagined and their existence is chief to our own, so a better understanding of what the heck is going on in the woods is probably a pretty good idea. Wohlleben comes across as a lone wolf advocate, which sadly, is the case for many an important cause. This doc just might change all that.hipCRANK.",False
2,10,Germany's most popular forester fights for sustainable forestry,mapika,n/a,15/08/2025,"A must see for everyone, who cares about our world!We still need to grow a better understanding about the life of plants, our trees and natural grown forests, their complex communication systems and ability to feel!
Old trees care for the younger ones next to them, they provide them with nutrition.
Planting trees never compensates cutting natural grown trees. etc.In an easy to understand and very heartwarming way the author of ""The Hidden Life of Trees"", Peter Wohlleben, together with scientists and commited private persons, shows what we do to our nature with our devestating monocultural forestry system and what we can and need to do, to stop the worldwide forest decline.He worked in tradional forestry for several years until he quit his job, when he recognised the wrongdoings of this industry. Of course lobbies don't appreciate his engagement for a change in foresting, but he keeps on touring, consulting and teaching those, who care for a change for the better.What a great, loving man!",False
3,5,Too much of a Peter show,rowg,n/a,15/08/2025,"Starting of with a sort of adoration of Peter, the main figure throughout the movie. The movie itself too fragmentic. One big glue job of topics, not necessarily added by the commentary of Peter. You better read the book. And don't get disappointed by the movie.",False
4,3,Das geheime Leben der buchverkaufer.,GerBNL,n/a,15/08/2025,"Way too much anthropomorphizing, book-, and some weird kind of religion selling. Really a pity, because trees are worth so much more. This doco hardly touches the surface.",False

1,3,Oslo men fallos competition,the_oak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is it necessary to haul these majestic halibuts to satisfy a dream of fishing the biggest monster? Spending hours forcing the huge fish up from the bottom only to release it after? Who is the monster? It's not the halibut, yet that's the title of this show. This doesn't have anything to do with what fishing is really about. Now call me some sort of outcast who does not appreciate this kind of activity from a boat. Maybe there really are those who would like to watch this documentary, but I'm calling a spade a spade here. This is my take on fishing. I do it either to cultivate a lake/river, or to catch fish that I intend to eat.",False

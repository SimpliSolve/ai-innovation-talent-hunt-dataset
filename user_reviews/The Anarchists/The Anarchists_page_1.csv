1,7,This is going somewhere dark...,wddykes,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many reviewers seem to think we're supposed to admire the subjects of this documentary. Their hubris, naïveté and bag of rocks dumbness combined with the truly dangerous nature of Acapulco for people who don't even speak the language let alone have street smarts tells me that we will eventually see what happens when the idealism of rich people mistaking privilege and hedonism for freedom meets a truly lawless system.It's a slow build but I am confident it's going somewhere.",False
2,7,Island of Misfit Toys,raiderreggid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good God - What a train wreck of humanity. This is a compelling documentary - but compelling in the way that one cannot tear oneself away from viewing the scene of a horrible accident. It's a well-done setup, but unfortunately for the filmmakers, the subjects of this documentary are so unlikeable, so cluelessly self-absorbed, and so irredeemably stupid that there is little enlightenment on offer and even less sympathy to give. Anarchists? Hardly - just a motley crew of drug dealers, fakes, frauds, charlatans, and other assorted liars, scammers, and narcissistic idiots. Anarchy as a way of life may already be nothing but a pipe dream for the hopelessly clueless, but if this cast of drug-addled imbeciles, hippies, and meth-heads, and the crypto scammers for whom they serve as useful idiots are any indication, that pipe dream is further away from reality than ever. So kudos to the filmmakers for the effort, but ultimately, one is left not asking, ""Who did it?"" but rather ""Who cares?""",False
3,6,Entertaining to say the least,gravegauze,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, because it is most important, I will note that nobody in this documentary besides the anti fascists protesting in the streets shown briefly are actual anarchists. Nothing about capitalism is anarchist at all.I enjoy this documentary because their ideology is hilarious and falls apart easily, even as seen in the documentary. The documentary is good for laughing at dumb people who believe they're smart.",False
4,7,Settle down people,danielsean-983-460871,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's funny how people who are leaving reviews are angry about the people in this show. The name of the show makes it sound more extreme then it really is. It's basically about libertarianism and or expats. It about people who want more freedom and less government involvement, or who want to leave their country. This show is very current about todays society. Tonnes of Canadians and Americans have moved to mexico over the last few years for a new lifestyle. Well see what happens in the next episodes.",False
5,7,Excellent documentary,roywyattbatty,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a good doc. A lot of these reviews seem biased against anarchism in general and exhibit a failure to understand the point of a documentary. For example: you don't have to like the people in a documentary. Some excellent documentaries are about extremely horrible people. This is worth watching. I learned some stuff.,False
6,7,Modern Lord Of The Flies,rowens-38622,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was at the world premier of Zeitgeist: Moving Forward and after the ""new society"" documentary I actually took the stage to speak to the crowd. ""The Anarchists"" proved everything I said that day. All of this anarchy, new culture and society is nothing more than what we already have. Your white skin allows you to run to Mexico and live like kings while hating on the world that gave you that privilege only to create your own hierarchy of wealth and opulence. The hypocrisy is strong with this one. I love how the couples names their kid ""Ira Bell"" but wanted a Mexican birth certificate for ""property purchases"". That's because in Mexico American expats cannot own the land their property sits on, their child born in Mexico can.",False
7,4,"Could Just As Easily Be Called ""The Idiots""",Scott-344,n/a,16/08/2025,"Episode 5 Update: I want to be fair to the show. Four stars out of ten doesn't mean terrible, but rather low mediocre. There are so many ideas that could have been explored here, but the main threads aren't about philosophical ideas or interesting personalities, but rather about greedy or foolish or alcoholic people who think they're on the road to utopia. I watch because I want to respect the work of the filmmakers... but this still isn't adding up to much. Contrary to the series' title, its promise, it's not about anarchy. Some episodes are about how bitcoin swindlers can hijack a concept (Anarchapulco). Other episodes are about bad things happening to people who've made bad decisions and at the same time been burned by life and by others. Yet other episodes are about grief. The series is a bit of a rambling mess. It's become background music to me, even though I really wanted to see an exciting exploration of anarchy. --Anarcho-capitalism only works in a world in which homesteading can legitimately be practiced. In other words, not on earth. It's basically the philosophy of ""I'm in the lifeboat, pull in the lifelines.""The people in this doc are very un-Randian takers and losers, not builders. The alcoholic quasi-leader Jeff Berwick made enough money to sail around the world before starting his little cult in Acupulco. Where did his money come from? Wealthy investors pouring money into his '90s dot-com that went bankrupt a few years later because his dot-com business was actually vapor, nothing, hot air. His partner in the venture tried to kill himself by jumping from the eighth floor of a building... but somehow failed. And yet, hobbling on crutches, he was able to recommend a book (""The Creature From Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve"") to Berwick that set him to thinking how great it would to be totally free. You know, to have other people do stuff for you while you drink on your boat that you bought after the company that you openly admit you had no idea how to run lost all its value for other investors but whose structure allowed you to escape with the loot.Another set of winners is a young couple facing decades in prison for a 2015 pot bust who decide to become fugitives... and get money from their family to go on the run to Acupulco. You know, just like true entrepreneurs do. (This couple is somewhat sympathetic to me, though. I hope they shed some of the battiness around them and have a decent life.)And then there are Berwick's organizers (because Berwick knows how to open a bottle of hooch but not much else of practical value), a couple from Georgia who advocate ""unschooling."" Because what good is a society where people might actually learn a thing or two that isn't just based on their childish whims? In fact, when your child gets an illness or a serious injury, who cares if your unschooled, untaxed society hasn't provided roads, ambulances, medical training, money for biotech research? You can simply heal your kid with herbs from your tomato patch, right? The one your parents wired you the money for.Yes, government can be a problem. It definitely overreaches. But government is nothing more than an organizing principle, a means to resolve disputes and to provide defense, including from environmental disaster. The ""anarchists"" spewing nonsense here want to tear down American democracy so they can start over. In other words, they have absolutely no concern for the disabled, for the elderly, for anyone at all who will get mowed down as society is destroyed. Theirs is a sociopath's philosophy.I'm barely two episodes in. As the filmmaker spent six years making this, starting with his initial flirtation with anarchy, i'm not quite sure if he'll have the chops to provide reasonable counter arguments to the nonsensical arguments put forward by this motley crew. As my headline suggests, I think these people reveal their naivete every time they open their mouths, but it would still be nice to hear a sober perspective.",False
8,8,Binge and cringe,catschasemice9594,n/a,16/08/2025,"A look at a movement that espouses ""anarchy"" and creates a community in Mexico. In creating this community the group seems to build an alt capitalist group. Their philosophy is based on the promise of bit coin, let's not pay taxes, and I make the rules I claim don't exist. There is nothing in this documentary that advocates for Anarchy so I am puzzles about why so many reviewers are stating that falsehood. The further you watch this film the more you realize that these new Randites are part of a cult detached from reality. This behavior is nothing new. I was around in the 60s when a similar mentality existed. I participated in it for a while til my adult critical thinking skills kicked in. Definitely we need change but it's not reinventing the old system with new versions of the old. The Anarchist is an excellent reminder of how not to build a better mouse trap.",False
9,7,Intriguing Episode 1 has wet my appetite,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""The Anarchists"" (2022 release; 6 episodes of about 50-55 min each) opens, we are on a beach somewhere and a book burning event is taking place at night, involving even small kids. We then are introduced to some guy named Jeff Berwick, who decides that he wants to live in anarchy (literal meaning: ""un-rule""), and by golly, wouldn't Acapulco, Mexico be a great place for that? We then go the ""Anarchapulco 2015"", the initial festival/gathering for those interested in the movement. At this point we are 10 min into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this series is directed and executive produced by Todd Schramke, who seems to have been embedded in Acapulco for long stretches over a period of years. Let me admit upfront that I have never heard of Berwick or this ""movement"" until now. Having seen the first episode, it only raises more questions than it answers: most of these people are kooks, pure and simple. There's never a conspiracy theory that they don't like (""the federal reserves secretly rule the world!""). Then there is this: how do these people support themselves? None seem to have a job. Third: where are the Mexican authorities in all this?Episode 1 premiered this past Sunday on HBO and then streams on HBO Max, where I caught it. New episodes air Sunday evenings at 10 pm. If you love a good documentary or are interested is understanding how far down the rabbit hole some people will go to find the ""truth"", I'd readily suggest that you check this out, and draw your own conclusion. I can't wait to see how all of this is going to play out.*UPDATE 7/27/22* I've now seen 3 episodes, and this is getting weirder and more fascinating viewing as it goes on. Just wild. Highly recommended.*UPDATE 8/18/22* I've now seen all 6 episodes, and I really enjoyed the entire mini-series, that is until the very conclusion of the 6th and last episode, which kinds just ends, like in the middle of a sentence. Then the closing credits started rolling, and I felt really let down that director Schramke didn't post an update what became of the main players in this real-life drama. Absolutely unacceptable. I was ready to upgrade my original rating of 7/10 to 8/10 but because of the way the series wrapped up, I am leaving it at 7/10.",False
10,3,Self Indulgent Narcissism,Novaj9,n/a,16/08/2025,"The trailer was intriguing so I decided to watch, but the whole way through i was just annoyed. I stuck with it because I wanted to see what happened, but essentially nothing really happens. I still don't get what the whole ""Anarchy"" movement is about, but by watching this it seems like it's people, who don't want to follow the rules of any organized gvt mainly to avoid being taxed by the IRS, who get together once a year in Acapulco to get drunk/high and attend seminars on how to break rules while staying within the confines of another government in another country. Seems pretty pointless other than people with enough money to ""operate outside the confines of societies rules"" get together once a year and have a big party for 4 days in a hotel. None of the people in the documentary are likeable on any level and, after watching all 6 episodes, I can honestly say it amounts to nothing more than a reality show with spoiled, entitled, middle aged adults.",False
11,9,Stop rating the documentary because you don't like the people in it,lhscfmvw,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPeople are giving low grades because these people were idiots or not real anarchists, don't review bomb it because you don't agree with their ideas, review the content, the format the filmmakers. And please wait and watch at least two episodes before you leave a one star review.I'm giving it a nine because it gives you several different threads that intersect about some people calling themselves anarchists, they have interesting stories, it documents important events that happened with the first crypto boom and why people would think anarchism might be the system they want and most importantly it documents it in a fun and engaging way.",True
12,6,Douchebaggapolco,donkey_dick,n/a,16/08/2025,"Never had a group of such douchers been assembled in Mexico. If anyone did have any interest in Anarcho-capitalism, they sure don't now after seeing this collection of dingleberries. Make sure to note these people aren't regular anarchists. These are like bitcoin losers who still wanna be rich and holding power over others. The story is interesting though and I found it to be a decent true crime story. Recommend for true crime fans. Not recommend if you're into anarchy or punk rock.",False
13,1,"""""""The Anarchists""""""",jakubpap,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why not name the documentary Anarchapulco? Since it's clearly about that and not anarchism? Anarcho-capitalism isn't anarchism, it's a thinly-veiled neo-feudalism.Goddamn, it's like if you named your documentary ""Socialists"" and it was about the NSDAP, or called your documentary ""Democracy"" and made it about DPRK.Do better, one wiki search and you'd actually know how cynical their use of the word ""anarchist"" is and what actual anarchists think of ""anarcho-capitalists"".",False
14,7,Documentary is good - People in it are nuts.,aevaughn-77305,n/a,16/08/2025,"Remember those kids in high school that were just ""different""?

This doc is literally about privileged adults with mental health issues and twisted ideas about conspiracies...the end.",False
15,7,Footage and sound 😎 Subjects 🤢,cindyrellaexists,n/a,16/08/2025,Can't blame the director or creator for this film. Technically done very well considering the crap subject matter and the idiots they had to interview/follow.Anarchists? Really? What a bunch of narcissists. These people were nothing but a group of bottom feeders who have yet to do anything but believe their own hype.Nice try....but no.,False
16,7,Should be called The Narcissists.,dvantmedia,n/a,16/08/2025,"At least some of them learnt their lesson. Some paid with their lives. There is not one redeeming quality from a single person in this doc. These dumb@ss Americans (and Canadians) from the freest countries in the world, still need MORE freedom. They are selfish narcissists and I'm sorry to say, but I cheered at their tragedies The doc is very well made with great access, which when you're dealing with narcissists, it's quite easy.",False
17,1,Has zero to do with Anarchism,joostice,n/a,16/08/2025,"This poorly titled daytime television pedigreed show is about spoiled, selfish, greedy, and immature Libertarians.It has as much to do with Anarchism as it does with good production and narrative. Which is to say nothing.If you want to make a show about parasitic and sophomoric quasi cult troglodytes that's fine. But do not label/title it like you have never met a dictionary, or thesaurus.",False
18,9,Memorable Documentary Series - Ignore the Low Rating,brooks250,n/a,16/08/2025,"Off the bat, I'll admit that I don't understand many of the strong negative feelings about this docuseries. I'd never heard of this movement or Anarchapulco. That said, like any good documentary, the filmmaker uses the people themselves to tell the story. And in this case, by shooting over the span of six years, we're given a front-row seat to the sweeping ebb and flow of a movement and its main figures.By reading the reviews, I definitely get a vibe from people still in this movement or its offshoots who take issue with the choices of the filmmaker in showcasing their goals and lifestyles. That's certainly their right. But for us ignorant ""statists"" it accomplished what any good documentary should do: 1. Inform us about a topic or subculture we're probably unfamiliar with. 2. Choose the right people to follow and let them tell us in their own words and show us how they live. And 3. Make narrative filming and editing decisions that allow for a coherent and accessible viewing experience. The Anarchists does all three.Also, I give this series and HBO extra points for keeping this run to six episodes and not dragging it out Netflix style.",False
19,6,"What can I say, but not the true meaning of anarchy",virginiacottrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe creators of Anarchapulco, defined by what they interpret to be anarchy is right wing liberal capitalism, generally rich people asking for freedom with no government or taxes to pay.It is not about liberty, it is not about being a critical or productive member of society creating equality, it is more or less neo-feudalism where the primary characteristic is that individuals public lives are increasingly governed by business corporations. People who are not subject to everyday laws, can create their own laws to an extent, dominate large markets, employ immense swathes of individuals, wield the economic might equivalent of entire nations, and own assets, especially real-estate, on a massive scale.It can be called techno-capitalist-feudalism wherein an insurmountable divide and stratum now exists in and between the ""1 percent"" and the ""99 percent"", or more specifically, the state-finance-corporate-aristocracy and the workforce/population.There is a couple who promote home schooling, this is not for everyone and the mother who has a baby was lucky to have an easy birth which is not the case for everyone as there was not a doctor or a nurse. The rational is based around her own personal upbringing which obviously was not good. I understand some of the rational but to preach about it, perhaps not.As a previous reviewer said, it appears to be a cult like set up that they have created. It is definitely worth the watch and it might open your eyes (if they are not open already) to the current state of 2022. It is a shame that the world does not trust government, but completely understandable.Google the real meaning of anarchy and make your own decision.",True
20,4,Sort of meandered to a weak ending.,beoir-43672,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt started off about this conference about this belief, or however you want to classify it. Then cryptocurrency weasels in, which opens up the possibility of a dramatic clash between investment scam and people who don't believe in regulations, but then like a truck driving into a mud pit, the whole thing gets bogged down talking about the personal lives, and tragedies, of two of the main people. Eh... all in all, I should have spent the time watching something else.",True
21,8,Messy reality meets a naive ideology,revchristodd-138-985726,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary starts out looking at a weird contradiction: an organized event for anarchists. At first it looks like it will primarily examine the tensions between people who are trying to forge a community based on extreme individual freedom. As it goes on though, a second story begins to develop: a murder. As we explore the tragic backgrounds of the people involved, it seems like the series is following two tangentially connected stories. But then they come together towards the end, exposing the weakness of an ideology that rejects authority and government when it has to deal with fraud, cartels, murder and people with untreated mental illness. And this becomes apparent even to some of the most ardent believers in anarchy. Questions are also raised about whether the only people who can indulge in anarchy are the rich. Very insightful if you give it time.",True
22,6,"Interesting and funny, but not in a good way.",tmac-28564,n/a,16/08/2025,".............. I'll watch a documentary about typeface, so I'll dial this up. I'll listen to folks justify their reasons for ""anarchy"". Interesting to see folks & hear their actual words, explain what they think is ""new ground"".I find it also interesting/ironic that all these folks traveled to Mexico on roads built by a government or flew in a plane that was built with safety standards; stay in homes or hotels that were built using governmental building codes; drive cars, ostensibly, built with federal safety standards, etc.In other words, why not actually go somewhere where you have to start from the bottom? Beyond using crypto - build your own homes, grow your own food, ferment your own alcohol, so you can party duuuude 🤙🏼................",False

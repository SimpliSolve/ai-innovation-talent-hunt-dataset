1,5,Pay attention and who knows,cruises-stoic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Matthieu Ricard, Brother David and Dr Tania have a lot to say, probably much more than what we heard.So if you are going to watch it, do it for them. Listen to them and learn from it! I found quite interesting, but also came up with so many questions myself.Otherwise, the camera shaking horribly, the vague questions, and apparently the shallow problem it's terrible.The camera for many times disturbed our concentration. It looses focus, shake every time and gets terrible angles.I super understand that we don't need to know more about Alejandro's life, and I truly believe he is struggling (who isn't?), but the way he tries to keep his privacy, in the end, leads to vague and shallow questions, not well trained. Everything looks artificial!I would say: watch it, but focus only on what the real deals have to say.",False
2,6,Good but not enough,douaeahmadoun,n/a,16/08/2025,"The images are good, the idea and intention behind are great. However, I personally was waiting for more. It has a great potential. I found the content not very generous. A bit disappointed by the end.",False
3,3,Wasted opportunity,andreshou,n/a,16/08/2025,"The guy who is supposed to be stressed acts like he doesn't know the answers to what he is asking and you know he is not ignorant about it and I find it really anoying because it's easily notisable. The idea behind it was good bad badly executed. On the positive side, some images are good and this might help someone who is absolutely ignorant on this topic.",False
4,10,Wonderful Documentary,joannadodge-69224,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would HIGHLY recommend this documentary to anyone in search of a more peaceful and meaningful life. The images are stunning, and the cinematography is fantastic. However, it's the wisdom that the documentary contains that most impacted me and brought tears to my eyes on various occasions. Thank you to everyone who was involved in the making of this film. I wish you all happiness, peace and much love, and am sending you all a big hug all the way from Panamá. ¡Mil millones de gracias! La veré una y otra vez.",False
5,1,fluff,marijndewit,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the most empty headed, fluff documentary I have seen in years. It is completey unlcear what the problem/ailment is that the director is supposedly suffering from, other than generic 'stress' - and it is just as unclear what the proposed solution is. This 'documentary' is not giving its viewers anything to take home with them.Just filming a monk for two days and doing one single meditation session after saying something vague about your stress levels that is hardly intelligible, is no documentary. It's just images of your holiday in the mountains. This whole documentarty is nothing whatsoever. I feel ashamed by proxy for the poor 92 year old monk, who was taken on this journey of fluff for naught. The fact that the makers of this thing don't seem to feel this shame at all, seems to me the core of the problem. They have nothing on their hands, no substance, no content, no real subject, no original angle, and still feel they can get away with creating this whole circus, fly people over, use their precious time, all to make a 'documentary' about nothing.It is somewhat of a disgrace that this has found its way to the Netflix archives.",False
6,10,Fascinating,cp-49523,n/a,16/08/2025,"Deep life reflections by Matthieu Ricard. Beautiful images. I really recommend this documentary for anyone looking to improve their quality of life.In the end, aren´t we all searching happiness?",False
7,3,Painful to watch,trashcab,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am aware of Matthieu Ricard and his mission and this was the reason to watch this documentary. Unfortunately it was very painful to watch and ultimately a waste of time with no real payoff in the end.Most of the film is the film maker and his wife whining to Matthieu and other monks about how ""stressful"" their life is. Not only that, they also keep interrupting the monks as they try to give them an advice. Pretty annoying to watch.The film feels like a student project shot with a shaky handheld camera. Editing is disjointed lacking any cohesive narrative.But the worst offence is that the movie has no story or payoff. It is a about an entitled film maker that crashes an organized trip to Patagonia to make it all about himself and his petty problems.The only redeeming thing was of course Matthieu Ricard and his lighthearted wisdom, but there's just not enough of him to justify investing 1 hour into this documentary.",True
8,4,"Great info, sad man . Poorly made",omygodgiantrobot,n/a,16/08/2025,"Had to turn it off. The cameras were constantly moving and about to make me throw up. The teachers in this all seemed very helpful and knowledgeable and I'm guessing that they really k ow what they are doing. However, the guy who made it seemed to constantly complain about the most basic things in life and how they stress him out. He had to real idea of life and apparently having children was a bad idea for him. The guy needs therapy and a real life situation to straighten him out well before dragging a guy across to world to poorly film him. I have it a 4 star for the effort but it really was not watchable.",False
9,10,Letting Go in Stressful Times,coni-52821,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is absolutely brilliant, it's a perfect way to get yourself into meditation.The movie protagonist, Alejandro, presents the information in a way that anyone can grasp, making it easy to understand. His story is relatable, and his guidance is much appreciated. I would love to see the movie come out with a continuation.This is very beneficial in helping with stress and anxieties, and helps to train yourself so no matter what times life brings you, you have a way to help yourself and the people you love.Thank you!",False
10,3,Spend your time somewhere else,esteesmimailnuevo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Basically is about a guy trying to make something out of the opportunity of hosting a great personality.Feels unplanned and lost, most of the time this guy doesn't even let people talk before shooting another basic question.This is basically a camera following someone doing bad networking with spiritual thinkers, wanting a straightforward solution for his stress problem without making an effort to find the answer in what they're telling him.If this was a vlog in YouTube it would be more justified, just don't try and sell it as a documentary.Mathew has some really good books, better spend your time there.",False
11,10,Great documentary about well being,hacquesfamily,n/a,16/08/2025,The images are magnificent. It is a beautiful teaching of wisdom.,False
12,10,Excelent.,palomacarbajal,n/a,16/08/2025,I learned a lot with this documental. Wishing everyone could see this and have a flash of light as I have. Love you all.,False
13,10,Thank You!,wellbeing-98687,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie helped me a lot to find some peace on my mind! Thank you very much! I recommend this to everyone who is in the search of happiness.Alejandro seems to be the common guy and its really easy to find him relatable. There are a lot of deep reflections presented in an easy manner.,False
14,10,just breathe.,nicolasbril,n/a,16/08/2025,"I needed this, this guide to peacefulness, and finding the mellow. It's scary and unfortunate how in a hurry to get on with life we are rarely fully allowing ourselves to just live and appreciate. I am so happy this documentary came to a streaming platform such as Netflix.",False
15,8,Nice monk teachings,rodrigovaldes-33028,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was very interesting. I felt that the stress the man experiences seems somewhat forced, but I think it is used as a tool to connect with the viewers, since we all face the same issue nowadays.Through the questions asked to the monk, he provides specific advice that can help people reflect on their own lives. The landscapes are stunning and bring a sense of peace, enhancing the overall message of mindfulness.The key here is to listen to the monk. I think the film does a great job summarizing the monk's teachings, which can inspire people to slow down, appreciate the present moment, and enjoy life.",True

1,8,Hardest working woman in showbiz,Davalon-Davalon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have read through some of the hateful reviews of ""Halftime"" on IMDB. My first impression is that people are jealous of J-Lo's success. Also, it seems that some people think she should be a different type of person than she is. They cannot seem to accept her as she is.First off, she wasn't ""crying"" when she learned she wasn't nominated for an Oscar. She was crying in reference to other comments that were written about her in an article which stated how hard she had been working and that she should be acknowledged.As for how many men she married: I'm sorry, what's it to you? Elizabeth Taylor, at one time the biggest star on the planet, married 8 times. So?One of the great moments in this documentary is where Jennifer reveals that she couldn't have done the NFL Halftime show when she was younger. She says she ""didn't even know"" who she was yet. I totally relate to this. She has finally been ""coming into her own."" She is a powerhouse of energy and commitment and dedication. She employs a team of people, she cares about others, she gives back to the community -- why do people hate her so much?Then people were going on ad nauseam about the fact that she was using ""pole dancing"" in the Halftime show. As if ""pole dancing"" was a worthless, despicable, low-life skill. She was incorporating the amazing skills she had gained by being in the movie ""Hustlers."" Which, by the way, she was great in. Outstanding.Yes, people around her fill her head with thoughts of greatness and that she ""deserved"" the Oscar. And certainly, based on all the media that supported her, it seemed that she might get an Oscar nod. It was a big deal because other than Rita Moreno (and now, Ariana DeBose -- but not at the time this documentary was made), who else of Latin heritage has been an Oscar contender?Jennifer sees life as an ""American"" and as a ""Puerto Rican."" This is one of the things that make her a unique celebrity. I do think that perhaps she misinterpreted what the halftime show was supposed to be and decided to make a statement -- I don't know if that was the right thing to do, but on the other hand, I understand why she did it.She has been insulted, degraded, laughed at for the majority of her career. And yet... she has persisted. And thrived. And succeeded.People are so incredibly stupid. They thought that because she ""ended up"" on American idol that that meant her career was ""over with.""None of those people remotely understand how precarious showbiz is, which she also talks about. You can be on top of the world one day and by the next, no one wants anything to do with you. As Jean Smart put it in ""Hacks,"" -- it never gets easier. It only gets harder and harder. And J-Lo has proved that she has the courage, guts and tenacity to continue.Yes, the show is all about her. Yes, she seems to love the attention. She has lived her life in the public eye and she shares a lot with us, maybe too much -- but on the other hand, she has a tough veneer, and she knows just how far she can go. She has risen to the top and if she never does anything else, she made her mark and opened doors for other women and men of color.",True
2,8,JLo The Perfectionist,nevenenvelop,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jennifer Lopez has always been a perfectionist. She never leaves a single stone unturned and this documentary is a marvelous example of the same. Performing hits after hits at the superbowl and offering a backstage look this is an amazing watch! JLo really showed why she's a force to be reckoned with. From captivating visuals to firecrackers to ginormous stages to intricate details to amazing choreography to live instruments and vocals (something we rarely see in pop culture anymore), JLo impressed the millions who watched the show and now will watch this Netflix Film!",False
3,8,New Respect for Ms. Lopez,vanessa70977,n/a,16/08/2025,"Without giving too much away the documentary shows us Jennifer's life from a new perspective, HER perspective. I would've never guessed that she felt that way about all the butt comments in interviews. The documentary also shows the results of those sexist remarks, and how she coped with it. JLo has gone through a lot these past two decades, and the documentary shows everything in a new light. Does this documentary make me want to go listen to her music or watch her films? Yeah, Do I have more respect for Jennifer? Without a doubt!",False
4,n/a,We literally just got rid of Amber's whining..,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTo move onto jlo's.Seriously, I don't know what she expects.When someone, anyone, who is a multi millionaire, privileged, accomplished and beautiful, no matter how they got there, when the average person, who has to scrape by, listens to this whining and martyrdom, they will not relate, they can't relate because they are too absorbed in their real problems such as childcare expenses, making the rent/mortgage, working, cleaning, etc. Etc.""Doing this for the people""? Girl, please... don't insult people's intelligence..
An Oscar for Hustlers? Is this a joke or is she too far gone?Just accept your damn fame and be grateful. You want to complain? Complain to your people. Otherwise it's embarrassing, cringe worthy and frankly, in very poor taste.",True
5,6,üí™üèΩüí™üèΩ,samsp_,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can see why most of the reviews here saying Jennifer Lopez is so self absorbed, narcissist and such. But if only you can put yourself in her shoes, being a minority and trying to build herself up in the industry which still is to this day ruled by man I would probably have the same strong headed opinion, thus would make me like a bit**.And the hour of them all practicing only for good 7 minutes performance took a whole lotta effort which I doubt any of us could easily do it. And mind you she's 50. I have a whole respect to these performers.Yeah she could be a product, but she still killed it. Hands down.",False
6,6,Not as flattering as people think.,katiefanatic-791-306918,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a disabled Latina and I grew up with a very aggressive mother who had to fight for most of my rights. Because of this, I'm extremely turned off by these personality types. Despite my disability and my minority status as a Latina, I fully admit I have a problem taking up space, something Lopez has NO problem doing. Unfortunately for someone like me, it's extremely unflattering for me to watch a documentary of a personality type like this. While most people are praising her perseverance, I just heard whine after whine after whine of a very privileged person. You can't argue Lopez isn't a hard worker. She's one of my favorite actresses but her singing and dancing leave something to be desired. Maybe she should stop whining about the oscar nomination she didn't get (that she didn't deserve by the way. 'Hustlers' was terrible. ) and focus on becoming a better singer and dancer. Until then I can't feel pity for someone who has gotten by on how hot they are.",False
7,6,Too much victim mentality drama,silobm,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerAs for an icon like JLO it's very annoying that she was always playing low profile and down.. how about normal regular infamous people or even submerged stars whom are working hard to be heard and seen?? All the documentary she was complaining about injustice and discrimination and the end was so dramatic and politically oriented playing on the contrast!! I couldn't feel empathetic although I'm not white.. and her chewing gum all the time was not nice at all..,True
8,6,Love JLo but...,Mimzzzz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI always loved JLo. There is no doubt that she is an icon and a global star especially If you know deeply her childhood. She achieved so much from nothing.I must admit that I did not liked the fact that she was so into political matter and that she wanted so strong to send her message throughout the Super Bowl performing. But the fact that the video was viewed so many many times online says that she succeded it. Regardlessly, she put a great show with Shakira.I recognized she is a narcisstic and maybe too much egoistic person who always wants more, but in my opinion she is truly a star.As for as her awards, I do not understand why would anyone think that she is a material to win such an award? Does she really thought that the Hustlers movie will win Oscars Academy hearts? Do not get me wrong but I love JLo's movie, I love to see her acting, but hello JLo - in what fairytale do you live in? LeonardoDiCaprio was waiting for too long to win his first Oscar and we talk about an exceptional actor.I know, we all have our hopes and dreams, but you do not need an Oscar to be successful and she is without it. She is firstly a singer and a dancer than an actor.JLo must admit to herself also one thing and that is that although she is a great superstar, her life is marked with her love life and tabloids. She just can not be alone, throughout her all life she was changing partners, not to mention her comeback to Affleck. She definitely has her own problems like we all do.All in all, her performing skills are beautiful and powerful and that is just it. Her performing, there is nothing exceptional, not her singing or her dancing but all in one if you know what I mean.",True
9,9,"Chaotic, but in the best way.",dphphuong,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you watch this in June 2022, chances are you're probably aware of all the bad presses/social media hate that JLo has received surrounding this documentary (i.e. ""rivalry with Shakira"", ""crying over Oscars snub""). Let's clarify this right away, all of the negativity was due to dialogues and scenes taken totally out of context for clickbait. Ironically enough, the media and societal treatment to JLo is one of the topics in this documentary, so it really drives home how after nearly 30 years in the business, this absolutely unfair, horrible treatment that people give to this woman remain nearly the same. But that adversity really puts into perspective of how special Jennifer Lopez - JLo - Jenny from the Block is. As it's said in the documentary, people really take her for granted. The documentary is chaotic because it juggles between her music, movie and personal life - but that's expected when you do a documentary about someone who can do it all successfully. One thing the documentary is very successfully at is showing how there's literally nobody else in the business doing what she does at her caliber. The amount of hard work, determination, stamina, strength and talent that it takes to juggles 3 and a half full time careers as a woman is insane. And yet, the industry hasn't been given her the recognition she deserves, and the hate from people that she receives due to misinformation is borderline bullying at this point. After watching this documentary, if you are a fan of JLo, you will grow to appreciate her discipline and drive even more. And if you are a hater, maybe you will take a look at how unfair you have been treating this woman - not everyone needs to be a fan, but one could really give credit where it's due and not fuel the hate.",False
10,7,She is a true fighter,mpanajotovic82,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't listen J Lo as much, but I know some of her songs and I have wached many of her movies. She is really very talented person and she needs a validation. She is from flesh and blood. She is only a human and we all need for others to recognize us and acknowledge our hard work. I feel for her and hope she will be as briliant as she is and give the world more songs and movies.",False
11,1,Documentary as chaotic as JLO career,jgruszkos-31653,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat hits most in this so called documentary is whining. Whining about media attention, whining about being on front pages because of the way she dresses, whining about having to share a show with equally (or more) popular (and talented) artist and whining about the fact that she would like to be great at everything, but out of acting, singing and dancing only the last one is of decent quality. Half of the documentary is full of moaning about how her one decent(ish) movie is not pilled with awards and nominations when her whole career is full of cheap in plot and horrible in acting rom coms where all she does is to play herself. The other half is moaning about how she has to share a stage with Shakira, while in reality neither her voice or her songs qualify her to hold this kind of a show on her own. JLO wanted to bring attention to discrimination and sexism in American show business, but she is doing it in such a pretentious way that the message is getting lost in a sea of constant complaints and feeling sorry for herself. Shame as it could be a powerful message to fellow Latina women and the World in general, but what it ends up to be is yet another example of why Jennifer gained a reputation of being a diva.",True
12,9,Intimate Look Behind One Of The Greatest Icons Of All Time,travistritt-22770,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOne thing you cannot deny about Jennifer Lopez is that she is literally everywhere, her social reach is undeniably amazing. Watching this and seeing the topics she covered i have to give her props for being brave and standing her ground. The Super Bowl is yes part of the doc but not the main focus the title serves as a metaphor for her hitting the second half of her life. One thing im proud she spoke on is having to share the super bowl with Shakira, The idea of them Co-Headlining was great but with no extra time it was downright disrespectful of the NFL and Jay-Z.",True
13,7,Decent Vanity Project,matthewssilverhammer,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are certain entertainers that treat their careers like an athlete or a business-person stuck in an arts world. That's Lopez. Not a diss on her, but it does make her competitiveness & desire to climb the ladder feel sadly misplaced & bound to disappoint. Yet despite this being a sweaty, calculated vanity project meant to engender us to her, it works as an entertaining, in-depth Hollywood portrait. The decision to focus so much time on her Oscar hopes was inspired & emotionally suspenseful.",False
14,4,Waste of time,severe_lady,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's start by saying I am not a super fan of J. Lo - I like some of her songs, some of her movies and she is no doubt an incredible dancer. I was curious to have a look ""backstage"" and I was very disappointed that this documentary was Jennifer b!thcing and whining for hour and a half about anything and everything - especially about her not getting an Oscar nomination for ""Hustlers"" and she having to share the stage with Shakira at the halftime show. She was complaining about her family not being excited about her movie premiere, she was complaining about her sister bringing her dog to the Thanksgiving dinner, she was complaining about the size of the stage and so on and so on.Way more talented actors have waited years to be nominated or win an Oscar, but we don't see them complaining in documentaries. And this year's Super bowl halftime show was a masterclass of how more than one superstar can share the stage without any fuss.Unfortunately J. Lo proved that she is a demanding diva and I feel sorry for everyone who works for her.",True
15,n/a,Basically Netflix (and Hollywood) just went mad,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every documentary, tv-show and movie is, nowadays, a shaitshow of w0k3ning, politics, enlighted people (that's what they believe they are), subliminal messages, feminism, this and that...You can't watch anything anymore unless is like this documentary.You can't create anything anymore unless is like f4sc1st wants.Slow clapping.",False
16,7,Messy but reliably impassioned documentary,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,16/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn July of 2019, global superstar Jennifer Lopez celebrates her fiftieth birthday. Having come a long way from her humble origins in The Bronx, New York, it is a time to reflect on her rise to the top, from the controversies she courted in her early days, through her struggles to be accepted as a Latino actress in an industry that didn't cater to her image, while in the present day, she is spurred to take a social stand on the separation policy enacted on illegal immigrants, and on a personal level, she hankers for a film award for her role in Hustlers, and puts herself through her paces preparing for a big Super Bowl halftime show with fellow superstar Shakira.It's a sad realisation of how much time has passed in your own life when you're watching a documentary charting the rise of someone who could still be classed as a household name, who you remember starting out when you were young. Unlike J-Lo, I haven't quite reached half a century yet, but time is fleeting and it will be here soon enough. But if that age is not a time for reflection, it's hard to know what is, and an intimate documentary like this is apparently how a global superstar must go about it! And so Netflix have released this imperfect but thorough and enveloping little film that sweeps you up in her life for an hour and a half.It's hard not to seem at least a little like a vanity project, and when she says things like how 'the world is watching...' her, she does feel a little carried away with herself. But J-Lo has always come off as an impassioned individual, and obviously something like this is how she goes about expressing things. But there's a wider issue than just her own exposure going on here, and like many in the modern day she's reflecting on when she broke through in the early 00's, and the cultural attitudes and casual derision minorities and women were subjected to at the time, which gives everyone pause for thought. Then these things are transversed in to the present day, with Trump's immigration policy and the Academy's reaction to a film about powerful women. It's all a bit messy and disjointed, with one issue not always following logically on from the next, but then you could say this is how real life plays out, so there's that.Whatever your feelings on her abilities as an actress or singer, this is undoubtedly a driven and determined person, who has not been handed everything on a plate and has had to work hard and overcome many obstacles to get where she is. This unbalanced but fiery and stirring documentary captures a pivotal time in her life quite colourfully and passionately. ***",False
17,9,"I.C.O.N. ""I Can Overcome Negativity""",kylieminoz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wise words from a successful Entertainment Legend. Jennifer Lopez arrives with ""Halftime"" the answer to all of the negativity and criticisms she's received over the years be it for her being constantly overexposed by Tabloid and Entertainment programs about her personal life, Social media over fabricated lies surrounding her singing career (All of which social media has blown up because lies travel faster then the truth i might add!) Halftime is a story of a woman who after 50+ years on this earth is here to offer some wise words show us what motivates her most (her fans, her family) and spread encouragement to anyone who is in self doubt and in 2022 with so much going on in the world, that's something i can get behind. Loved it!",False
18,1,Another Day Another Netflix Political Narrative,moviemom23,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI went into this with an open mind. I like JLo ok, I am not a superfan. In my view, She is talented but as an overall entertainer, not some amazing actress.Not ten minutes in, the political bashing (guess who is mentioned- Netflix never misses an opportunity to bring this guy in to everything) comes in. Then the Halftime Show development which I thought could be interesting. JLo and Shakira are chosen to do the show together. JLo doesn't seem too happy about that and I Can see why. JLo decides a stripper pole represents women's empowerment and so uses it in her show. I disagree that strippers and seggs workers are the epitome of women taking back their power. I think the stripper pole maybe is to promote her movie. You can see how everything is for publicity.I am over these uber rich, entitled, famous elites complaining about how hard they have it. While the rest of us struggling to make paychecks last. JLo is literally a one in a 100 million success story. She hasn't lived in the bronx for 40 years, yet she acts like she is still a resident. She made it rather quickly and has been very fortunate in her career. Yet she plays the victim card constantly. Somehow we are lead to believe shes been slighted as a woman of color. Poor me.She believes that Hustlers was a massive hit and a masterpiece of film. B, please. It was not well-received and the entire premise was distasteful to be honest. Yet she thinks she was unfairly passed over for awards because... you guessed it she is latina.Lets face it, today being a person ""of color"" in entertainment is a huge plus not a negative. In times where everywhere is inclusivity - which don't get me wrong is not a bad thing- JLo isn't suffering. She has more riches that she can spend in 5 lifetimes. She lives in luxury. She has it all. I can not cry for her.That is all.",True
19,9,Jennifer Lopez is Awe Inspiring! 9/10,demisdevil,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watched this omgggg i loved every single moment! The message behind this film is beautiful, there is no better time like the present, just because people count you out and try to but you down does not mean you give up! Jennifer Lopez is so underrated, she shows what it means to put yourself first. The mentality to believe in yourself is infectious i cannot stop raving about this film WOW!",False
20,2,Center of attention,sofia36,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJLo wants to be the center of attention, but only if the attention is positive.She was a good entertainer in the late 90s and early 2000s. She can dance well, she is a ok singer and and average actress. There's nothing wrong with that - she has made a lot of money and led a very privileged life.She has clearly spent more time in Hollywood than in the Bronx. Yet she plays the Latina card every chance she gets - 'oh they didn't give me a golden globe, is it because I'm a Latina? Is it because I'm a woman of color?'
No, maybe it's because other actresses did a better job than you.How can JLo be so immature at 50?! She must be surrounded by 'yes' people who tell her she's fabulous all the time.The fact that she believed she should have won an Oscar for her role in Hustlers shows complete lack of self awareness.Does Channing Tatum deserve and Oscar for Magic Mike? No! But he's not crying about it.Grow up JLo. And keep your politics to yourself.",True
21,9,Turning Hate Into Motivation - A Must See!,mileycitrus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Walked out of this screening and almost cried. The hate this woman endured for years upon years from the sexist, misogynistic and racist Interviewers and Industry giants is infuriating. People often (Myself included at one point) thought Jennifer Lopez was deserving of some of the scrutiny she got from tabloids but this doc gives u a different perspective and JLo bares it all. I'm very impressed. 9/10!",False
22,4,This documentary made me dislike her as a person,BabylonBlonde,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was pretty much indifferent when it comes to JLo, I did like her music but I wouldn't call myself a fan. She portrays herself as a victim of misogyny and racism here, even calling herself a person of color. Girl, you could easily pass for a southern european.She's moaning about not getting an Oscar nomination (that movie was so average and you can't act, accept it). Trying to show she was not taken seriously because South Park mocked her (South Park mocks everyone with amazing equality). Complaining people paid too much attention to her butt, an asset that people admired, not ridiculed.The entire documentary is extremely self serving and comes across as whining of someone very privileged.",False

24,3,I don't dislike JLo,randishme,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jennifer Lopez is a product. She isn't a singer or actress even though she thinks she is. She is a celebrity who was carefully packaged for public consumption. If she was a real singer, you'd hear her sing a ballad once in a while. If she was an actress, she'd have success outside of the romantic comedy category. She is a dancer and a celebrity. When you you think of her, you always think of how she starts her next relationship before exiting her current one. Remember how fast she married Marc Anthony after breaking up with Ben? She got back with Ben at the exact time she admitted her breakup with A Rod. She is afraid to be alone and that's sad. She has been extremely successful though and that is the only reason to watch this documentary.",False
25,8,A Unique Approach To A Standard Netflix Doc.,cerinavincent,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jennifer Lopez, the name alone a million things come to mind, Songs, Movies, Pop Culture Moments. She has solidified herself into a Business that wasn't always welcoming to Latinas.The format of ""Halftime"" is pretty standard-issue, but within that frame is the vitality and strident personality of an artist who has consistently, unapologetically done things her own way, Jennifer Lopez has broke boundaries in the Film, Music and Fashion industries, she is a staple of pop culture.Something ""Halftime"" does so well is portray JLo's personality in a way we have seen her before on thing such as American Idol and World Of Dance but also connects with the viewers in a way i didnt think she could honestly. 75/100.",False

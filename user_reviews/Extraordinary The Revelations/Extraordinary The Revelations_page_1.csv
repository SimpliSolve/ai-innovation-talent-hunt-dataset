1,1,A hole -- and not a rabbit one.,todd-13969,n/a,15/08/2025,"How to describe this? Terms like ""Ancient Aliens re-run,"" ""hubris,"" and ""Dunning-Kruger effect"" come to mind, but ""pickpocket"" could just as easily be the top choice. If you make it past the teen ding-a-ling denigrating science as ""one dimensional"" and ""looking at the past"" -- versus artists (like her, of course) who look to the ""future"" -- your intestinal fortitude exceeds mine. Despite enjoying thoughtful debate on this subject, the absence of substantial data and paltry credentials here render the film a hole -- and not a rabbit one.",False
2,3,"Much better free docs on youtube. The weakness of this doc is that it is not bringing anything new, seems to be outdated.",chrisbard-63155,n/a,15/08/2025,While its well put together the same people I seen before have nothing new to say. Same ol same ol. Much better free stuff on youtube! What is not ok is that it is advertised as a great documentary but you have access on youtube for example to free docs suvh as the ones from 7news Australia which bring Louis Elizondo and he is sharing new mind blowing ideas and stuff when compared to this doc for which I payed to see and got disappointed.,False
3,1,Garbage,bethandbrandy,n/a,15/08/2025,This is just another piece of unsubstantiated drivel. All personal opinions and conspiracy theories. Bunch of talking heads that are only identified once with very few credentials. Don't waste your money or time.,False
4,2,Anti Christian propaganda,captaintrips-47539,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's lots of these documentaries being made at the present time, lots of TV shows and specials, all aimed at gullible, non independent thinkers, desperate to shovel more of this fast food esque, poorly researched, regurgitated new age nonsense down their throats.Actually, it's been prime time, mainstream TV viewing for years now, coinciding with the apparent 'disclosure' on the UFO subject.Everybody invovled in the making of this documentary knows they are fooling you.It's so obviously biased and anti Christian, it's cringeworthy.The usual suspects make an appearance, Nick Pope,. George Noory, all collecting a pay check while doing their bit for the narrative.If anyone wants coherent, well researched, intelligent information about the UFO subject, avoid this like the plague.",False
5,10,"An historic achievement, raises the bar for films in this genre - BRAVO!",jordan2008-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a tough subject, but potentially the most significant one of our times. The producers of this film are heroes, same with the courageous experiencers sharing their stories. For the viewers who may watch this and be inclined to dismiss the thesis presented here; please look a little deeper first. There is a substantial body of cogent research to examine (see books by Dr. John Mack, David Jacobs, Bud Hopkins, and others.) And like it is with the UFO/ET visitation subject in general, the idea of ""what if just ONE of these stories is real?"" holds true.Skeptics who dismissively cite the Occam's Razor principle aren't being intellectually rigorous IMO. Certainly there are also charlatans, hoaxers, and outright liars making claims, and it's shameful. But with quality documentary films like this, including James Fox's ""The Phenomenon"", hopefully more of humanity's resources can be catalyzed and directed toward understanding and dealing with the ramifications posited by the many, many responsible and honest people making these ""extraordinary revelations.""",False
6,9,Excellent,vnynpgx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Brilliantly put together.The lineup and facts/theories discussed make you stop and contemplate the current day that we live in, and how this once ridiculed subject has already been gently ushered into the lives of everyone.",False

1,9,A deep-dive into one of Guatemala's darkest periods,vesperview,n/a,15/08/2025,"Heart-wrenching to think about how the streets of our country are stained with blood and how many people will never be found and the many families that will never have closure. The unseen footage shared from those times in this documentary, along with the powerful testimony of the survivors makes it a must-see for anyone interested in deep-diving into this dark part of our history. My only gripe is that we're never told how Carlos survived. His story was such a focal point of this piece and I don't feel like it was resolved for the viewer.Stories like these need to be told and kept alive for future generations, so I will say that it's a shame that this documentary didn't get the exposure that it deserved. Aside from a couple of screenings back in 2021 (which I couldn't attend), it's really impossible to access it.",False

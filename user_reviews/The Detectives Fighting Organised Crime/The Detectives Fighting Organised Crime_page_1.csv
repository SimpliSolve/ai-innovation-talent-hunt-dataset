1,10,One of the best documentary series I've ever watched,georgeclark92,n/a,17/08/2025,Follows the investigations of some of Manchester's (often referred to as Gunchester's) most notorious organised crime rings.Was extremely sad to see BBC pull further episodes after only 2 episodes.,False
2,10,Brilliant. Suspense throughout.,stephenharriman,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerBest crime series I've seen. Intense from the start, especially the second episode, which showed insight into a really interesting case, a well orchestrated gang devised a murder with both thought and precision. The police were faced with a difficult task of pin pointing those responsible, but it comes together like a jigsaw. Left me feeling stunned at the end, just with imagining the sheer gravity of what the lad at the top is now faced with, a long time in prison to question whether that day was truly worth it. Honestly, I maybe alone, but I did feel for him.+ Why did BBC pull the other episodes???",True
3,9,Hard hitting and detailed,nick-blakemore,n/a,17/08/2025,Really in depth assessment of cases invoking OCGs in Manchester. Not over dramatised - let's the story evolve and the investigation move forward. Certainly one of the best of this genre.,False

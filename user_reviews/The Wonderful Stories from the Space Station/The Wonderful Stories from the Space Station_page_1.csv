1,5,How could you make the Space Station THIS dull?,david_stever,n/a,15/08/2025,"This consists of a series of vignettes of various folks who've spent some time on ISS, and at least one would be astronaut who ended up being NASA support staff before crew number 1 (god, has it been that many years already?!?), while a few are uplifting and occasionally magical, many are full as dishwater. It's the space station, they shouldn't be that badly put together!",False
2,6,Decent background noise,wildinjn-95639,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seem to be decent but pretty stock as well. It has an extremely odd and drawn out soundtrack that seems inappropriate for the film, filling gaps to get a higher run time. Over all it's worth a watch if you're into space history, as candy coated as this version is.",False
3,5,TOO much music and other nonsense!,merrill-58224,n/a,15/08/2025,"Way too much overly loud annoying silly la-di-da music (constantly like every 15 seconds, LOUD) with too much background biographies going (especially in Russian language) when it should all be about the inner ISS workings what they do on the space station how where they sleep what they eat experiments worked on how space walks occur and happen how the spacecraft dock and pressurize and spend a lot of time in the glass cupola. There's just way too much talking about their backgrounds. We get it! We came to learn about the ISS not lives of astronauts.",False
4,6,Could have heard them clearer from the ISS,nrsbvff,n/a,15/08/2025,"A really interesting documentary ruined by the poor sound quality. Really loud music blaring over really important interviews or clips, so it's almost impossible to hear them. I love music, but if I wanted to hear it I would have watched a music documentary. I get easily overstimulated and I love space because it's calming - this is not calming. I've lost interest so I'm writing this review. It's doing a dishonour to all the hard work that NASA have achieved. It think I would have heard them clearer if they were communicating directly from the ISS and not with what feels like a really loud disco.",False
5,4,Wired editor.,robert_thegrey,n/a,15/08/2025,Just listen to the music. Its weird. Whoever edited this doesn't know what a documentary is. We want space stories. I don't want wired songs and transition to make it artsy. I want cool shots of space and stories about space. Booooo! I say no more.,False
6,9,Great documentary! Music too loud sometimes,steve-96856,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great documentary. Very interesting and well done. It gives one the next best thing (after actually being there) to what is like to be off planet earth. I would have given it 10 stars, but the music volume periodically gets oppressively loud.",False
7,10,Incredible,fishwife-21318,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie took my breath away. I can only imagine it at an IMAX. The music is hauntingly memorable, the stories are deeply moving, and when you see earth from the perspective of space it makes your heart ache to see how very far we are from each other.",False
8,10,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Space and Art come together.,PinkControl,n/a,15/08/2025,"I feel like this documentary only has two type of viewers. You either get what the filmmakers were trying to do with it or you thought it was boring. The raw emotion of these interviews, especially the longer ones with personal details of past experiences, is borderline gripping. Listening to somebody talk about watching their loved one leave the planet for the first time is intense. The art of the music, flashback scenes, and old footage really make this film what it is.Pretty much a must see for everyone.",False

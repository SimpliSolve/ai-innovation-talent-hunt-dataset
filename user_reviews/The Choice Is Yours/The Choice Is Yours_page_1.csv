1,10,Captivating and poignant exploration of an artist,ADGXIII,n/a,16/08/2025,"An incredible documentary with many twists and turns that will keep you wondering what's coming next. This film isn't just for lovers of hip-hop but transcends the genre as an intimate portrait of an artist struggling to maintain relevancy in the latter half of their career, and captures their journey as they search for creative inspiration and seek to reconnect with a long lost friend. Director Clark Slater brings his signature touch of weaving together a highly interpersonal story while also chronicling important moments in hip-hop history. Above all else the film is an important tale of success, loss, and finding one's self again.",False
2,10,Loved it,AMCAtlas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent and illuminating film following an artist in search of his next chapter. Dres is a fascinating character to follow -- it's easy to watch him reflect on his unique journey through being a ""one album wonder"" as a kid, to now where he's mentoring the next wave of talent in the industry and plotting his next album. The twists and turns of his comeback (a new album featuring the beats of the legendary producer, J Dilla) allow us to see the complexities of the music industry in a way few outsiders ever get to see. The Choice is Yours is nostalgic as well as a lesson in navigating the music industry. Bravo to the filmmakers.",False
3,10,Must watch for Hip Hop heads!,sadeparham,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a kid of the 90s this was such a dope film to watch. So many artists of my childhood were honored and I love that this film gave them their flowers. A must watch, truly inspiring and the team did such an amazing job telling this story. I left truly understanding how there are so many chapters in our lives and you can always get up and try again. It's never too late to pursue your dreams. This was more than just a documentary but a truly moving story on resilience, drive, and passion. This is the perfect film to watch with the family during the holiday times. I highly recommend and you will not be disappointed!",False
4,10,A Must Watch!,saelhassani,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Choice is Yours is a masterful documentary that dives deep into the life of one of hip-hop's most influential figures-Dres, from the iconic duo Black Sheep. This film captures the essence of not only his meteoric rise to fame during the golden era of '90s hip-hop but also his courageous journey after the spotlight faded.The documentary excels in portraying Dres' raw humanity as he confronts the difficult transition from rap royalty to the challenges of everyday life. His story isn't just about music; it's about resilience, redemption, and refusing to let life's hardships define you. You feel every high, every low, and every ounce of determination as Dres fights for his final shot at success.The storytelling is powerful and intimate, offering a candid look at the man behind the hits, and the complex reality of navigating fame, family, and personal growth. Fans of hip-hop, and anyone who has ever faced a crossroads in life, will find inspiration in Dres' tenacity and authenticity. The film is an absolute must-watch, blending nostalgia with a fresh look at the enduring power of the human spirit.A riveting documentary the choices a rapper made and what could've been! HIGHLY recommend.",False
5,10,Amazing film,rjwdcww,n/a,16/08/2025,"Captivating from start to finish, this documentary beautifully navigates the journey of an aging hip-hop star, Dres from Black Sheep. The film does an excellent job blending nostalgia with the challenges of today. With a compelling narrative and poignant moments, it offers a heartfelt exploration of resilience and the enduring power of music. A must-watch for anyone seeking inspiration and a glimpse into the evolving landscape of the hip-hop world. I would recommend this to any music fan regardless of age or musical preference. Big ups to everybody involved for sharing this important story with the world.",False
6,10,Impressive Storytelling,ConnorSimmons23,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc is impressively woven together. The thread is definitely Hip Hop, but the story the filmmakers captured and present is so much more. First you get a taste of Black Sheep and 90s Hip Hop, but that only sets up the characters and whats to come. You also get a mini-J Dilla doc in there as well which I wasn't expecting. Seeing his mother in there tell her side of things was not only touching but very interesting, as J Dilla's life and legacy has always been a bit in the shadows. You can tell Dres feels the weight of the opportunity he's presented with but by the time I finished watching the doc, the story had transformed way past the project, and into a very deep and personal tale of perseverance. I'd say this is an unglamorous look at music, stardom, and success but it all beautifully comes together and leaves you thinking. Well done.",False
7,10,More than a Hip Hop/ Music doc,CeeDocs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly, I came in expecting a retrospect about the group Black Sheep and that hit song, but was blown away by where the filmmakers took it. The film starts off by setting up who is Dres, the scene he came up in, then drops you off in the present, where he seems to be struggling to remain relevant but has an opportunity to create a comeback project of a life time...seems straight forward, but this is actually all laying the groundwork for a series of twists and turns that I did not expect. Watching Dres navigate these obstacles, you begin to realize this is not a Hip Hop doc, but more a film that chronicles a once very famous person, who is now more or less a civilian, dealing with the hardships of today. It confronts bigger ideas like the affects of becoming famous at a young age, fatherhood, legacy, brotherhood, friendships, and the downside/ dirtiness of the music industry. I would recommend this to any fan of documentary.",False

1,5,Poor Sound,voanncr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Right out of the gate, Paul McCartney's dialogue is drowned out by music. This continued for throughout the entire documentary, which caused me to lose interest. This is really unacceptable. Whoever mixed the sound on this did a very poor job. When the cast spoke without music it was better, but once music starts it drowns out the person speaking. Did anyone listen to it back before it was published?The footage itself looks like it was lifted from a VHS. The picture quality is washed out and grainy, and this isn't an artistic gesture done for cinematic effect.On the upside, if it is footage you have not yet seen and you are a Beatles fan you may find it a redeeming watch.",False
2,5,Watch anthology instead,inacan-90-894261,n/a,16/08/2025,This reminds me of a bootleg or low rent documentary you'd get as a bonus feature on a concert dvd. There is NOTHING new to be learned here but if your a beatle fan you will enjoy it. If you are an obsessive fan you will LOVE it.,False
3,6,Short but informative documentary on the former Beatle,classicsoncall,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerConsidering all the material out there about The Beatles over the past six decades, this documentary was probably unnecessary, although you do get a chance to hear from McCartney himself discussing aspects of his long career. The doc takes you from the beginning of The Beatles up to roughly the present day, although little mention is made of anything more current. Adding some perspective to the story are musicians like Paul Kantner, Brian Wilson and Donovan who credit Paul and the rest of the band as influences. Some time is spent on McCartney's relationship with John Lennon, but nothing at all regarding George Harrison or Ringo Starr, except for Ringo's replacing Pete Best when manager Brian Epstein thought it opportune to do so. One can't help but feel that the documentary is somewhat self-serving, as virtually all the contributors view Paul as the driving force behind The Beatles and their creative mastermind. You might pick up some useful tidbits from this short film and diehard fans I'm sure would love it. As one example, most followers will know that The Beatles made their first splash as musicians in Hamburg, Germany. But did you know the name of the club? It was called The Jacaranda, so right there I picked up something I'd never heard before.",True
4,1,Horrible Sound Engineer,szimmelman,n/a,16/08/2025,"The content of this documentary is probably pretty good, but you may never know it. The sound engineer has the background music louder than the person being interviewed. I have never seen a worse production anywhere. The videographer isn't much better. Their continual use of a blurry soft filter is evidence of just how inept and inexperienced they are. I'm surprised the production manager and/or producers allowed this nonsense.This could have been a great documentary about Sir Paul, but it fell completely flat. Neither the sound engineer or videographer should work in this industry again.Don't waste your time with this one.",False

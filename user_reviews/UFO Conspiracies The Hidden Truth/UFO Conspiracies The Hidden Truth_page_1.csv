1,5,Too much obfuscation,whymesswithitwhenitworks,n/a,15/08/2025,"Most of these types of documentaries are little more then a rehash of so called sightings or events that have happened since 1947ish. They introduce nothing new to the table. Today, the world has countless webcams, security cameras and a multitude of spy satellites, drones and people using cameras be they DLSRs or just phone cameras. Even in remote places there are cameras installed to track the movement of animals and people. Yet none have seemed to capture any images that can be positively, forensically, identified as a UFO or an Alien.Doesn't that seem strange to you?Despite this lack of real, quantifiable evidence, it's still an intriguing subject for those with an open, inquiring mind. One such sighting that I feel is still inadequately explained is the. Westall High School UFO which took place in Australia in 1966. Skeptics claim the object must have been.....wait for it.....that old furphy, a weather balloon. And pigs fly too. Fifty odd years after the incident and those who saw the object, especially those who saw it up close, are still brave enough to front the media cameras and relate their story. They have nothing to gain.Many eye witnesses of UFOs, even professional observers like jet fighter pilots etc., have, throughout the year, undergone Lie Detector testing, and a majority have passed said tests.Finally, the reviewer who said, ""If Aliens do exist, why don't they also appear in Indonesia, Congo and Peru?"" Well they do. As mentioned above, the Westall High School UFO incident is just one of many thousands that have been reported and documented in nearly every county in the world.I try to keep a balanced, open mind about the subject, neither totally believing, nor blindly denying that UFOs even could exist. But when you see crews of navy ships reporting flybys of 'Unidentified Aerial Phenomena' and confirmation from radar operators that they had locked onto a reflected signal, it certainly makes me less skeptical rather than more skeptical.Still, I do enjoy a good mystery, and it can be entertaining when a quality documentary becomes available. This one doesn't really meet that description as far as I'm concerned.",False
2,1,Dreadful misleading film documentary,lincoln-70020,n/a,15/08/2025,"Do not rent, especially buy this film documentary it's old footage and terribly made nonsense. Using same old footage from donkeys years ago. Save your money.",False
3,1,No Substance,farshadtami,n/a,15/08/2025,"Written and directed by one guy and narrated by another. No substantial information besides known stories. Nothing new nor intelligent was revealed or discussed.The narrator only provide assumptions and speaks the language and terminologies of conspiracy theories to lure the audience.If Aliens do exist, then why are they using flying saucers or arrow shaped space vehicles... and why are all these sightings or experiences mentioned in the movie happening only to US citizens and/or army personnel. If Aliens do exist, why don't they also appear in Indonesia, Congo and Peru?The movie was a waste of my time.",False

3,9,She's captivating to watch,andy-38763,n/a,17/08/2025,"I'm giving her a pass because of the pandemic. Normally, watching a rock star or celebrity live sequested in a remote, idyllic location, talking to people who are paid to listen to her, would turn me off. In this case, hearing Taylor Swift describe her creative process is fascinating. And the songs are good.",False
4,10,This is everything I could have asked for,trumanishow,n/a,17/08/2025,"Folklore will hit different now. I already consider it a masterpiece: the lyrics are perfect, the arrangement is out of this world, and her vocals are more angelical than ever before. But seeing the passion and the talent behind the making process of this album is delightful. I didn't even notice that it was almost 2 hours long because it is so good to watch them talking about the details it has. Thank you for showing us what is like to really create a body of work from scratch and turn into one of your best albums to date, if not the best one.",False

10,6,A MUST-WATCH FOR EVERY MUSIC LOVER,jeromesgabilo,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have always loved watching documentaries of celebrities and musicians. This one by the amazing Taylor Swift, which she also directed herself, chronicled the inception of her genre-bending surprise pandemic album ""folklore"". Each song was as intimate as they really are. It felt like a mini-concert that will undoubtedly pierce through any audience. It was not only emotional but fun to watch as well how deep and meaningful Swift's lyrics are through her interviews with collaborators Aaron Dessner and Jack Antonoff. It was just refreshing to see her vulnerable like that. Definitely a must-watch for all music lovers everywhere.",False

12,7,Perfect for background,daniel-hefford01,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll admit I know nothing about Taylor Swift besides what plays on the radio. I turned this on in the background while making dinner. The music was very emotional, sincere and seemed to be from the heart. What I didn't like was the script between every song it seemed fake and forced except for the war story.",True
13,10,Amazing ^1000000000. A Definite must watch.,nokuthuland,n/a,17/08/2025,"Love it. Love it. Love it.In all my years of being a Taylor fan, honestly I never imagined her work could or even needed to get any better. But man!!! Did she prove me wrong.She is good. She is really good. She is great. A living legend.This film is raw, to the core, touch your soul kind of amazing. Taylor like you've seen her before, at her greatest, but better.

19,7,Nice background noise,doomedmac,n/a,17/08/2025,"Taylor Swift is not a very interesting person, but folklore is a really great album. Take that as you will.",False
20,10,this is a moment in history,missionary,n/a,17/08/2025,"Whether you're a Taylor fan or not, this storytelling is masterful. Even if you leave out the soul-stirring songs and meaningful lyrics, this film accomplishes something we've not seen since in our generation's most trying times of wars, uncertainty, cultural and racial division. It jerks us awake to the fact that we, together, are living in one of those dire climates with COVID. The Vietnam War had Dylan to peel back our humanity and think about peace. John Lennon, too, lays bear how we really should treat one another.In that caliber, and perhaps born from desperation, Taylor Swift invites us to be a part of this experience with other artists who collaborate. A part of this moment in history. In isolation, she manages to look further inward and blossoms an idea to turn a vulnerable situation into a new-normal discovery.At the same time, she distinguishes herself yet again as a pure song-writer and artist. There's little doubt that other artists will re-think their true purpose for music creation. Shouldn't all artist be driven to create for the sake of the art, and less about the business motivation. Wouldn't that be nice. This is what happens when you remove the ego and affluent side of the process and bring back simplicity, purity.The ensemble of song and phrasing leave you with a lasting impression that there are others who are experiencing what you are going through. That's powerful. And that's enduring.Taylor Swift is a rare gift.",False
21,7,Humanizing - Guilty Pleasure Meets Real Art,mattlovesjackie,n/a,17/08/2025,"Actual hipsters let Taylor Swift pretend to be as profound as them ... and by the end, through their generosity, you see Taylor in a new light. Their chemistry materializes slowly as well, which is true to life. Take the song with the guy from Bon Iver. I've always enjoyed (and made fun of enjoying) Taylor. But Bon Iver feels more substantial and artful. But the guy works with her on a track, which feels like a condescension (but he doesn't act like it, because he's a gracious person). And then she hangs, and I see a new and exciting potential direction for Swift in the next decade. Her lyrical fun is still there, but with a bit more imagination and - oddly - depth. The collaborators eyes seem to glaze over occasionally, but therein lies their transformative generosity.",False
22,10,Amazing,sarahcx,n/a,17/08/2025,Name another artist this generation who can write like this. Deserves album of the year I don't care.,False
23,10,What we need in the middle of a pandemic,sengkimsrun,n/a,17/08/2025,"When we all thought folklore is what we needed during this hard time, little did we know Taylor's stripped down performance of each tracks on her latest album can be so calming. I enjoyed watching this film very much.",False
24,10,A masterpiece,nithyapjune,n/a,17/08/2025,"Ever since folklore released, I've been wanting an intimate live performance and behind the scenes of every song and this movie is exactly that. Taylor's vocals are AMAZING and the way they explained every track made folklore even more special to me. This album is a masterpiece and is one of my all time favourites. I'm so glad the movie was just as good. Its definitely worth the watch if you're a fellow folklore enthusiast!",False
25,10,the book behind the poem,alinpin_ugp,n/a,17/08/2025,"At one point she talks about poets that escaped their burdensome existence and lived in cottages around a lake. In some ways, this intimate insight into the creation of a very personal album achieved that and more. Everything that made this strange year to happen was beautifully poured into seventeen songs that offered hope when I needed it the most.",False

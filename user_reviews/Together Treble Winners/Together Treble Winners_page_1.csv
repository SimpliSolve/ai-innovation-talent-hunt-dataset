1,8,"City fan here, this could have been so much better",nanaz-71996,n/a,16/08/2025,"Was so excited to get a behind the scenes look into the team but this series felt largely like an Instagram reel of greatest hits. Could have spent more time with players in their everyday lives, the best parts were seeing snippets of Foden with his boys, Grealish with his dogs. Great seeing Pep at work in the locker room but they could have interviewed the chefs to talk about how they prepare the nutrition for the team. The series Arsenal did went more in depth and I really enjoyed that series. The scenes were just too short and felt very rushed even though there were plenty of episodes. Spend more time talking about Manchester Derby not just select clips of some outstanding game footage. This really could have been great but I didn't walk away getting any new perspectives on a historic season.",False
2,7,"Skip the first 2-3 episodes, then you'll enjoy it.",Graf_Z,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want a really good Man City documentary, watch Together on their youtube channel for free.They tried to recapture the magic, but the first two episodes are unwatchable, it's pointless marketing nonsense, there's very little understanding or appreciation for the game or the talent that goes in. This feels like it was made by the marketing department, no one else.The worst of it is that they are trying to make everyone like it, and the result is just bland. It's not horrible, but as a fan of the game, I really don't want to listen to some journalist explaining what Champion's League is for a full minute.All the things that worked in the original are out of tune here. That was a proper documentary, although it's on Youtube.At first, this feels like content. Well-made and well-polished, but still just lifeless content, not a documentary.Around the third episode, they tone down the nonsense and get back to football. There are still issues, there's still commentary from the two ""reporters"" who get plenty of airtime to say absolutely nothing of substance, but it's a mild annoyance.The rest is about the football, the team, Pep's talks - all the things I loved about the original Together.",False
3,7,Fun viewing for Cityzens supporters near and far,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As Episode 1 of ""Together: TR3BLE Winners"" (2024 release; 6 episodes ranging between 42 and 48 min) opens, it is ""24 May 2022"" as Haaland makes a decision which team he will join, and the choice is Manchester City. We then go to ""22 August 2022"" as Pep addresses the players about the upcoming season's challenges and opportunities... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into Episode 1.Couple of comments: this mini-series is aimed primarily at ManCity fans, to (re)celebrate and remember the extraordinary season that was 22-23. ManCity has fans around the world, and I venture to say that most of them will never have a chance to see the team play live (living in the US, I am one of them--although I did tour the Etihad Stadium in September, 2019). The best bits of this mini-series are the ""behind closed doors"" scenes. Watch how Pep addresses his players both in great moments (after trashing ManUnited 6-3: ""You were brilliant but I push you yo be more perfect"") and in low moments (after 2-0 to a low-ranked Southampton that would soon be relegated). In fact I would say that Pep is the central figure of the entire mini=series, and to see him at work is worth every minute of this mini-series. There are also a lot of fun scenes among the players (watch Halland make fun of KDB's fashion sense, to which KDB responds ""I don't care""). Perhaps the biggest surprise for me was that the one player who shows the most leadership is not KDB, or Halland, or Silva. No, it is in fact Rodri, who time and again steps up in the locker room addressing his teammates.""Together: TR3BLE Winners"" recently started streaming on Netflix, just as the Premier League, the FA Cup, and the Champions League of 23-24 are ""rounding third and heading for home"". ManCity is still battling on all three fronts again this year. Can they pull off another treble? If you are a ManCity fan, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion. If you are a football fan but not a Cityzens supporter, I'd give it a shot with the 1st episode and see if you can warm up for it. I'll be honest, if this was a mini-series about Arsenal or Liverpool, I'd pass...",False
4,7,Inside and outside of City's treble,AvionPrince16,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo yeah a nice documentary but the main interesting thing about it its the inside view of City and that intimate moments with the players and the coach .Without that , we can seek on youtube some videos about that season of City and its the same . But these special images of training, private life, funny moments and though games was really interesting and its just worth it for that and to revive that awesome season of course .It was a fantastic journey and it was nice to revive from the inside this time all the moments of City and their wonderful season . So yeah i recommend the documentary and its still pretty entertaning .Nice.",True
5,10,Excellent docuseries on one of the biggest feat in world football!,saurabh-pachpande,n/a,16/08/2025,"Manchester City's treble winning season is historic. This series gets into the BTS and challenges overcomed by the world champions! Good watch even for non-football viewers - a great tale of sporting achievement in itself. It explains the strategic and tacticals side of the game - all parise to Pep Guardiola, their manager and the focal point of this series. It's a great docuseries for management lessons - portraying real life events where team bonding was most crucial and tough decisions had to be made regarding some players. Manchester City is one of the best football teams currently and this also gives a good context for upcoming matches.",False
6,9,Hard work equals results,mbradley-18175,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary proves how hard it is to motivate a group of individuals to gel and perform as a whole. Those who said ""Pep won't make it in the Premier League"" and those that are now saying ""I could manage that team with an infinite amount of money"" need to watch this. They would very quickly learn a thing or two. The documentary is about keeping faith in yourselves and your team mates. Trusting and believing in your manager and your peers and never giving up. It's about friendship and family. It goes beyond football. It's fantastic to see the bond that is made between individuals from across the globe and how they succeed in the Man City melting pot. Great TV.",False
7,10,Want chills?,camillaldreyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely amazing team and I understand why they came together like they did! Well done MC and credits to you Pep! I must admit I laughed a little over: ""I'm 50! Almost 52"" ðŸ˜‚
My boyfriend didn't understand I didn't know Haaland - most because I'm from Scandinavia but I definitely know him now. Ever since moving to Asia it's hard to see the games without spoilers so this documentary is special. Would love to see more highlights of the games tbh. Once again an incredible story, history and well deserved success! Only wish them all more to come, happiness, wealth, health and joy! Sincerely from the Dane, Cam :))",False
8,10,Football perfection caught on camera,wmgktpry,n/a,16/08/2025,"City's 115 charges have been thrown around far too often upon this team. Pep nails it perfectly ""we won it on the pitch"" this series showcases exactly that. Say what you like about off the pitch circumstances money only gets you so far in the world of football. You only need to look at the likes of Man United, Chelsea etc to see the incredible differences. Fascinating to see some of the greatest players ever and the genius behind it, their personalities and environment which makes them the best English side I think we'll see. Great docuseries really enjoyable insight. Would have been nice to hear more from the fans as City have always had a great fan base from the Maine Road days to now must be an incredible journey from then to now.",False
9,4,Barely anything special,Hatstdgdgey-683,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not as good as arsenals all or nothing or city's first one because its super uninteresting.The choreography is great, the pep parts are good. Grealish was fun to watch with his charity work and his background. And that's pretty much itI think the viewers witnessed 1 percent of what goes , and the tactics and the real treble winning mentality is not shown to us. Most of the episodes are how players spend their free time and it's like the most boring thing to watch (yes I know footballers are humans). The part of a documentary is to show viewers what they don't know and I'm pretty sure all of the viewers learnt absolutely nothing that they didn't know after watching.The vital parts of the season like Cancelos drama wasn't shown ( which i understand as it can be unprofessional but it's a documentary you have to include that and arsenal did that with Cedric and lacazette), pep switching formations and stones switching positions. The documentary does none of that and instead shows the matches, the training, and the post match team talk.This is a documentary where you have to know the context of most of it before watching, which I think is a crime against all documentaries.All of that isn't as bad as how much footage Bernardo Silva got in this documentary, his voice makes the X button in the top right of my screen look so good and we really don't want to see him hang out with his dog.Overall this is the worst out of the bunch, they did it better in 2018 when Bernardo wasn't shown as much and we had interesting figures like kompany and Aguero, and how pep adapted to the league after an underwhelming season.",False
10,10,Brilliant,Mort_Lemur,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a Chelsea fan, but I always love these types of shows and documentaries. The chemistry between the players and the staff elevates the series and Pep is a mastermind. He is such a character. The final episode is incredible and more in depth than the others because it focuses on the champions league final. Not to say the rest of the show isn't, but the finale was on the next level. Would've loved to see some more speeches from Pep, but maybe the all or nothing show has that (haven't seen it yet). I truly hope more of these come out because we need more behind the scenes footage and coverage of all the comps.",False
11,10,Great Documentary! Remarkable story!,daniyussef,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Together: Treble Winners"" encapsulates the highs and lows of a historic football season as the team clinches the Champions League, Premier League, and FA Cup. With gripping footage and personal interviews, the documentary showcases the team's resilience, dedication, and unwavering spirit. It's a celebration of triumph over adversity and the enduring magic of football.What sets this documentary apart is its ability to showcase the human side of sport. Beyond the trophies and accolades, the documentary highlights the personal sacrifices, moments of doubt, and sheer determination that shaped the team's journey to glory. It's a testament to the power of teamwork, perseverance, and the unbreakable bond shared by those who live and breathe the beautiful game.A truly remarkable documentary.",False
12,10,Manchester Is Blue!!!!!,OfficialMrTech,n/a,16/08/2025,"This absolute banger of a series is not only for Man city fans but for all football (NOT SOCCER) fans out there.It was nothing short of historic and breathtaking specially to reexperience the final, and to finally see the behind the scenes of the high-tension Man city dressing room.To be honest the first episodes and some parts of the second episode are a bit boring, but once you get to the third and fourth episodes you are in for a treat. It was epic and amazing specially if you are watching it with a group of friends that also support Man city.Overall, it was a great docuseries and I recommend this title to anyone who loves football and particularly to Man city fans!",False
13,9,Thank you guys,franklf,n/a,16/08/2025,"The last episode made me in tears. As a city fan for years, I'd like to thank Pep and the players - you made history and you are the history! The show starts slowly and sometimes it's maybe too slow. Then it picked up as the season moves on. I loved specially the interaction between the players, they truly liked each other like a big family, even though some may just arrived before season started, truly amazing. Pep did a great job at city over the years and he sacrificed two huge loses, one to Tottenham and one to Chelsea, in the champions league before finally put handa on the trophy, which made it even more incredible. It's a very satisfying show and guys let's do it again!",False
14,1,Nothing about 115 charges,approdhks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Title: Disappointing Lack of Transparency: A Review of the Man City FC DocumentaryAs a fan eagerly anticipating an inside look at the inner workings of one of football's most influential clubs, I was left profoundly disappointed by the documentary chronicling Manchester City FC. While the production showcased the club's remarkable financial success and on-field achievements, it glaringly omitted any mention of the serious charges and controversies surrounding their financial practices. Despite the club's undeniable prowess on the pitch, it's irresponsible to ignore the cloud of suspicion hanging over its financial dealings. The documentary's failure to address these issues feels like a disservice to fans seeking a comprehensive understanding of the club's story. While I understand the desire to focus on the positive aspects of Manchester City's journey, a documentary should strive for authenticity and transparency. By glossing over pertinent controversies, the filmmakers missed an opportunity to engage in meaningful discourse about the complexities of modern football and the responsibilities of clubs to operate ethically within the sport. In conclusion, while the documentary may satisfy those looking for a glossy portrayal of success, it ultimately falls short in providing a balanced and honest account of Manchester City FC's legacy.",False
15,10,Emotional Depths and Pep's Inspiring Speeches: A Review of 'Treble Winners: City' Documentary,ayshadhesretov,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching 'Together: Treble Winners: City' was an incredibly immersive experience. From the emotional highs to the intimate glimpses into players' lives, it's a testament to the human side of football. Pep Guardiola's halftime speeches added another layer of inspiration and depth to the documentary. Truly captivating from start to finish! The final episode of 'Treble Winners: City' left an indelible mark, showcasing the raw joy of victory and the unbreakable bond between players. Witnessing the jubilant celebrations both on and off the field was a poignant reminder of what football means to fans and the city of Manchester. A truly remarkable finale that captured the essence of triumph and camaraderie.",False

14,10,A great documentary,gustavinhotavarinhoas,n/a,15/08/2025,"Floripes is an amazing lady with a brilliant age and great that I can watch a monologue spoken by her.
She is charismatic, a strong woman and a story that must be heard. It is proof that even a woman with a supposedly so peaceful life can have so much to tell and have a much more interesting life than many celebrities.
As for D'Astrain's work, the camera is brilliant, the work of the chosen soundtrack, the beautiful little cineamtography of nature and not to mention the vivid colors of the themes chosen for the subtitles. One of the best Portuguese documentary monologues released until today.",False

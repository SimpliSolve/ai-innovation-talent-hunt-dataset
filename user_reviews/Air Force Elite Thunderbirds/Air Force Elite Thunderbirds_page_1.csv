1,8,Better than expected,johnnydmiles-43286,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would expect this to appeal to the patriotic pro-military types who might attend an air show but I was surprised by the entertainment value as I don't consider myself the target audience. But maybe I am, as the boss of the Thunderbirds noted that their entire mission is to inspire people who see these performances to think about what America means to them as an idea. They certainly have dedicated themselves to their craft and of course succeed in igniting a desire to achieve great heights in America's youth, as many of the pilots relayed their own stories of how they were inspired as kids by watching their heroes and now find themselves talking to excited kids at the air shows afterwards. A good film that captures the extraordinary skill of this elite team.",False
2,7,Insane,wotiva,n/a,16/08/2025,"So let me go over the positives first. Amazing amazing filming of the flights. Not sure how they did it. I don't like air shows, but watching the acrobatics in this film was amazing.The film goes over the progress toeard being certified as a Thunderbird to give demonstrationas around the world. Displays a dedicated team, working effectively together. Like all documentaries they have a story line. Not sure how contrived it was, but fundamentally the individuals stories was also interesting (though only really touched on their stories briefly.. could easily have been half an hour longer). Good pacing, very upbeat.What I didn't like.. I've served myself, and I think these guys, while appearing calm logical types, are absolutely insane. 10% of Thunderbird Pilots die. This is an acrobatics demo team but I'm sure that death rate is higher than combat. The tight formations theu fly on are absolutely jaw dropping. Seriously I had tears in my eyes just watching them fly. God bless them, bit seriously, is it worth that death rate? Anyway I highly recommend this film. It literally amd figuratively flew by. Well done to the team that filmed this.",False
3,7,Air Force Elite: Thunderbirds - an All American Documentary?,marciorafaelop,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's be honest... if there's one thing about Top Gun that excites us all, it's the pure adrenaline those fighter jets bring.Air Force Elite: Thunderbirds gives us a taste, and the behind the scenes, of that same thrill, but with the real-world pressure of getting certified before being able to represent an entire nation like the United States, in the skies.What struck me the most wasn't just the flying and all the training everyone within the team goes through, but how deeply patriotic the whole thing is. As someone who's not American, I always find it interesting how strong national pride can be in the US. It's not performative here. In this documentary, it feels built-in. ""Service above self"" gets mentioned a few times, and by the end, you'll understand it why's that. As a massive fan of Top Gun, as soon as I saw the trailer for this one, I had to give it a shot. 1:30h and quite light to watch. It did not disappoint.What I appreciated was the balance one needs to have between adrenaline, responsibility, and the vulnerability. A big part of the documentary is focused on Lt. Col. Justin ""Astro"" Elliot who brings a layer of humanity and someone who was made for that. Even though, he had with other dreams and ambitions. He's also a husband, a dad, and someone trying to do something exceptional which is to lead a team of incredible flyers.The fact that you are walked through the roles and experiences of the rest of the team too, which counts up to 130 px, highlighting how much collective effort it takes to maintain their elite standard, it says a lot about the mission. Each formation is explained in some detail, giving us a new appreciation for what seems effortless from the ground. But of course, it couldn't all be smooth. It also follows one of the pilots in more detail - ""Primo,"" who keeps missing the final approach on one of their moves, the High Bomb Burst. It brings just enough tension to keep you pushing for him.They did quite well to bring some emotional moments which comes in the right moment, and that was the mention of Major Stephen ""Cajun"" Del Bagno, who died in a crash in 2018. It's handled with respect and proudness with an intimate interview with his parents.The final 30-minutes focuses on the evening before the big certification event. There's anticipation and camaraderie. The event itself goes off without a hitch, and the team gets certified, setting the stage for their season of 62 airshows. The documentary closes with a few grounded moments such as family time with Justin and the announcement of the Thunderbird 3 for the Class of 2024.I think, Air Force Elite: Thunderbirds is a great watch. It's patriotic, hyped up, and quite satisfactory. Even for those non-Americans.",True
4,10,Inspirational,SimonS-240,n/a,16/08/2025,"The dedication and precision of their flights was absolutely mesmerizing. Thunderbirds Air Force Elite is a stunning display of raw skill, power, and human excellence that left me in awe. What truly sets it apart from traditional flight documentaries is its focus on character-driven storytelling. You don't just witness the jets in action, you get a genuine, emotional insight into the lives, mindset, and sacrifices of the incredible pilots behind them. I loved every minute of it.I left feeling deeply moved, inspired to dream bigger, and more committed than ever to pursuing excellence in my own craft.",False
5,10,Loved it!,Pramodyadav027,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary immerses viewers in the high-stakes world of the Thunderbirds, capturing the precision, discipline, and camaraderie required to execute complex aerial maneuvers.Through stunning cinematography and in-cockpit footage, audiences experience the thrill of formations like the Diamond Pass and the Opposing Hit, where jets fly mere inches apart at supersonic speeds.While the aerial displays are mesmerizing, the documentary delves deeper, exploring the personal sacrifices and rigorous training that define the Thunderbirds.It follows new team members as they undergo a grueling two-month certification process, emphasizing the ""blind trust"" essential among pilots flying in close formation .All in all I loved watching this documentary and would highly recommend it!",False
6,10,More than just about flying!,jroosaf,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is outstanding and there are so many ""life lessons"" packed inside of the film. It's a real life, and at times emotional, look at the pilots, families, and support crew that comprise the USAF Thunderbird demonstration team. The viewer gets a peek behind the curtain on how challenging but rewarding it is to be a Thunderbird pilot. One can't help by getting drawn into ""Primo's"" rejoin issues or the impact that the time away from home has on the families. After watching, you'll appreciate the sacrifices that all the team members make to fulfill an important mission.Definitely an inspiring movie and I rate it a 10!",False
7,10,Thoroughly impressed,dohertybrielle,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't say enough about this documentary! I wouldn't say I know a lot about the Air Force, or what it takes, but this documentary did such a great job at giving you an all access insight into the unbelievable skill and determination it takes to be at this level. At so many points in the documentary I was terrified for the pilots, just beyond impressive. I loved the style and feel of how it was filmed it just felt like you knew the pilots and understood each of their stories. I hope to see more documentaries like this. Really enjoyable watch and one that I walked away from with a greater appreciation of these pilots and what they do.",False
8,1,From Top Gun to Top Bore,BaronBadger,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ah yes, Thunderbirds: Air Force Elite. I tuned in expecting jet-fuelled thrills, precision aerobatics, and a dash of military mystique. What I got, dear reader, was a red, white and blue firework of self-congratulatory waffle wrapped in a stars-and-stripes burrito.The first 20 minutes? Rather good, actually. We meet the pilots, learn about the intense training, and there's some properly impressive flying. I was sipping my tea, genuinely intrigued. For a moment, I thought, ""Gosh, perhaps this will be different. Perhaps we'll get some nuanced insight into the psychological and physical toll of being an elite aviator.""But no. Silly me.Somewhere between the slow-mo flag waving and the swelling orchestral score that could make brushing your teeth feel like the D-Day landings, it swerved into full-blown American propaganda. We were no longer learning about a flying squadron, but being gently bludgeoned by a love letter to a fantasy America where everything is freedom, justice and suspiciously good dentistry.Now, don't misunderstand me. I love a bit of national pride. I've even stood up for Rule Britannia while holding a gin and tonic. But this wasn't pride. This was a heavily scripted advert for a country that seems less interested in self-reflection and more interested in selling itself as the world's moral compass. A compass that, incidentally, spins wildly whenever oil is nearby.By the end, I half expected an eagle to swoop across the screen clutching a cheeseburger while screaming about liberty.In summary: if you enjoy airshows, motivational quotes, and documentaries that say ""We're the best!"" without a hint of irony, this is the film for you. But if you're looking for depth, balance or anything resembling humility - may I suggest watching paint dry on a Lancaster Bomber instead.",False
9,9,How a Team is Formed,sggar00,n/a,16/08/2025,"At an air show the public just sees the product. The documentary does show what all the work there is in getting to the final product. Breaks down to a degree each performing pilot and tells a little of their background before becoming a team member. Shows to a lesser degree logistics, medical, maintainers, administrative personnel and their roles on the team. So a viewer does come away with a sense of the total team and how each is dependent on each other doing their job. It is good for the public to see all that and understand it as well. Shows the hard training required to get the routines down to perfection. Really enjoyed it and believe anyone would like this documentary. On another note...wasn't too keen that some personnel wearing short sleeve uniforms had exposed tattoos showing. That did not sit too well with this old USAF retired MSGT. Doubt that would bother anyone else who watches it, but that is the only thing keeping me from giving this a 10. Highly recommend viewing this.",False
10,10,Awe Inspiring - Endorsed by President Obama.,kfdynks,n/a,16/08/2025,I live in the UK and I just loved watching this documentary about the Thunderbirds. It is inspiring to all humans. These pilots just blow your mind with the risks they take and the huge team of people behind them all essential to their success including their families. The footage filmed from inside the cockpit is just shocking and mind blowing. I must go and see a Thunderbird display in the states. At a time (27.5.25) when everyone is looking at the USA and thinking WTF this documentary shows you what is great about the USA. I did wonder if Primo's difficulties were purely for the camera and to make the story more interesting. However pulling a 7G manoeuvre is not for anyone other than super humans. Thank-you for your dedication Thunderbirds.,False
11,4,"Ok, but too sappy",lexdekkers,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen other documentaries on the Thunderbirds, and this one just doesn't cut it for me. Not enough facts about the intricacies of flying in formation or the role of the ground crew, terribly background music, and too many sappy moments.The flight recordings were great, and the computer simulations helped. Given the importance of the shows throughout demo-season, some light on the logistics of that would have been nice.I wasn't expecting some Top Gun hyped-up movie, but while it was modestly entertaining and informative, I was hoping for more documentary-type content to learn how the Thunderbirds machine works.",False

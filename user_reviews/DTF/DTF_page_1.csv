1,6,I'd have punched that dude,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not so sure I'd be friends with Al Bailey. Or if I was, I wouldn't let him direct a documentary about my life. Or I'd at least not be a maniac like his airline pilot friend Christian.Then again, I'm not an airline pilot constantly criss crossing the globe using Tinder to find new people to sleep with. I'm just a guy who likes to watch Spanish werewolf movies.Over a year and a half, Al and Christian - a widowed airline pilot - meet up in various cities and countries in the pursuit of love for one night or at least a good buzz. This also puts their friendship to the test, which you'd think will probably not survive the pilot seeing this film.That's because while the materials for this film describe at as a quest for love, Christian succumbs - more than once - to the lure of easy sex and gradually becomes someone that the director no longer seems to like all that much. In fact, Al seems like he doesn't even want to be part of his own film at times.Things get worse after a trip to San Francisco and beyond the point of no return in Vegas, where Christian buys sex toys and even rubs a used one into the director's face after drugging him at a club. Honestly, I started to wonder if the film was staged way before this point and I'm honestly not sure that it wasn't. The punch up at the Denver Airport makes me think that either this is the best real footage ever captured or a really good version of a mockumentary.I think you should honestly check it out for yourself. It's not an easy watch, but I feel like no good documentary ever is.",True
2,4,I'm calling B.S. on this one folks,pootboy-882-636843,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is almost certainly fake. the ""pilot's"" hair alone is so distinctive -- let alone his accent and odd boyish body and gait-- that he would be INSTANTLY recognizable by every single person he's ever worked with. the MINUTE this flick hit the internets, he would already have been DOXed, fired, and a massive investigation would be underway.not to mention the ""documentarian"" has only one other credit under his belt, a low budget horror flick he wrote and directed (and acted in).nice try, ya rascals. 4 stars for keeping me guessing for a bit, Al.",False
3,3,It is fake,bgruia-897-563486,n/a,16/08/2025,"The premise is engaging, but as soon as Al Bailey tries to play the concerned professional it starts to smell as mediocre acting. Then there is the spiked-drink scene where he tries to appear unconscious... If you've ever been around kids trying to fool you that they're asleep, you know what I'm talking about.",False
4,n/a,Come off it Al...,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"....who are you trying to kid?
Either this is a mess from start to finish because you got really unlucky...
Or it's a mess from start to finish because you don't know what you're doing....
Or, it's a mess from start to finish because you've crafted some kind of high art that flummoxes mere mortals like me.By accident or design....it's a mess",False
5,1,Fake and rubbish!,rebeccabooth-13532,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThat is one hour and twenty five minutes of my life that I won't get back! I think I hung on in hope of some sort of conclusion to make it worthwhile but I never got one. The whole thing seemed set up with bullish behaviours, outlandish language and terrible acting. I swear when Al was 'asleep' in the club, he would have kept his arm in the air if someone had held it up, to prove he was asleep! As for the final scene, it would have definitely got a grade D in GCSE Drama! Even if it wasn't set up, it was still pretty pointless. The production was very flawed. I genuinely feel robbed of time. Petition to burn the tapes!",True
6,10,From an air hostess...,fayebrownling,n/a,16/08/2025,"The few one star reviews from users must be from nervous pilots try to put people off watching this, as I can categorically say that this is a must watch...Working in the airline industry this behaviour is disgustingly common and kudos to the filmmakers for bringing this into the spotlight.",False
7,10,Gobsmacked by the access not surprised by the content,richardbosworth-45293,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an airline pilot myself I wasn't surprised by the behaviour, my personal conscience is clear but let's hope this documentary gets people talking about this obvious problem for our industry.",False
8,10,Speechless,kingstonlebrin,n/a,16/08/2025,"No words, absolutely no words...unusual documentary, completely insane yet ultimately captivating. These are all the words I can muster, left me in complete shock.",False
9,9,Bonkers and terrifying that he flies a plane!,neil-38732,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc is mental from the start, take s it of getting used to the voice but once your in wow. It just goes from one crazy moment to the next. Like a never ending bachelor party. How Al lasted as long as he did I'll never know. You need to see this to believe it!!",False
10,10,Jeeze!,freddiewsjfc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Crazy! Crazy Crazy! Uncomfortable, unconventional...Totally bizarre but I couldn't help but watch...Won't be everyone's cup of tea but that's the beauty and appeal of a documentary like this.",False
11,10,Engrossing!,jacoladd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tough watch at times and an unusual production but nevertheless it works...It will either get insanely good reviews are the total opposite...I'm going for insanely good given it affected me in so many ways, which is so rare with documentaries of this nature.",False

13,10,Great fly on the wall doc,jackphilson,n/a,16/08/2025,Love how this is a straight into the action observation of a somewhat crazy yet too crazy not to be true subject matter.,False
14,10,Brave and entertaining,davidbaines-21733,n/a,16/08/2025,The less said the better before anyone watches this. Took me completely by surprise. There is incredible depth when you look for it but even if you don't the story is completely engaging and shows that 'ladish' filmmakers do have brains.,False
15,10,A definite MUST WATCH!!!,danieljamesmusic,n/a,16/08/2025,"This simply has it all!
Scraps, scrapes, sex, drugs & rock n roll. What more do you want. Watch it!!!",False
16,10,I watched this 3 times!!!,saralaws,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can't believe what I actually saw...I had to watch on 3 separate occasions and different nuances appeared each time...What on the face of it is an expose of crass behaviour, I felt I missed something on first watch and oh my lord my instinct was right...this doc is more brilliant the more you watch it and I have to admit with some shame that not only did it shock me but at times made me laugh in the most uncomfortable way. this could catch fire and be the most controversial doc of this year...",False
17,10,Brilliant,petethompson-14092,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely class, great watch as we all have a friend like this üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",False

19,10,More than meets the eye,davidsedward,n/a,16/08/2025,This is the most entertaining yet troubling doc I've watched for sometime...No description needed as this will ruin the unbelievable eye watering shock value this film delivers. See to believe!,False
20,10,shockingly insane!,carolinejess-02905,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary defies description...Catfish meets exit through the gift shop meets a crazy doc about friendship, the airline industry and international sex addiction. seriously just watch it! I have no doubts there will be haters off this for various reasons but one thing you can't deny is this will create reactions and for that alone the filmmaker must be applauded!",False

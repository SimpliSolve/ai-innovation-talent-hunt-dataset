1,8,A dereliction of duty,edwin-wks,n/a,17/08/2025,"It is striking that what the wealthy residents of Kensington and Chelsea deemed derelict - the Grenfell Tower, considered an eyesore threatening the value of their multi-million-pound homes - would come to symbolise a far more tragic dereliction of duty: the failure to protect the lives of its own residents.In what proved to be a fateful and fatal cost-cutting decision, the council opted to save just Â£5,000 by replacing the recommended fire-retardant zinc cladding with combustible aluminium composite material (ACM). The cost? Seventy-two lives lost, and countless more irrevocably altered - through grief, PTSD, and guilt borne by survivors, first responders, and even the emergency call operators who repeated the doomed ""stay put"" advice.This documentary seeks to answer the question that still haunts the public: who is responsible? The supplier knew the material posed fire risks, yet continued selling it in countries with lax building codes, including the UK. There had been numerous international precedents of ACM-fueled fires. In most, casualties were avoided. A 2014 fire in a Melbourne high-rise, for example, involved 400 residents and resulted in zero deaths - thanks to swift evacuation procedures.The warnings were there. After a 2009 fire in London claimed six lives, a coroner urged reforms to fire safety legislation. The British government ignored them. One senior official is even alleged to have said, ""Show me the bodies.""This film offers a definitive and devastating examination of the Grenfell disaster, interwoven with harrowing testimonies from survivors and first responders. In the end, the tragedy stands as a damning indictment of a system warped by corporate greed, corner-cutting, and governmental neglect. Because really - what else could it be?",False
2,8,"Supporting ALL ""less regulation"" is allowing big businesses to choose profit over people",artchixx,n/a,17/08/2025,"As an American...especially in these unimaginable trump presidency days... this documentary is the flashing neon sign reminding me (and hopefully many others) that the desire to be less regulated by government is like crossing your fingers.When are more people going to understand that the people driving the ""less regulation"" train is big business?Why does it take tragedy after tragedy in places all around the world to remind people that big businesses and government will almost always choose profit & lower cost OVER people's lives?An oil spill, this fire, a train derailed-and everyone seems to remember why regulations are needed. But the loopholes for govt & big businesses are found & within a few days - some people resort back to screaming for ""less regulation"".This documentary is a reminder that when money drives your travel, shelter, food, health, etc - regulations & enforcement of them, shouldn't only become important when a disaster like this touches your life.",False
3,8,Very good overview,JurijFedorov,n/a,17/08/2025,High quality and detailed. Pretty much what I needed to understand about the disaster.They go over how the cladding was plastic and therefore an extreme fire hazard that killed the people caught in the tower fire.Greedy building managers and constructers bought plastic cladding to save money by not buying metal.The Labour government was trying to remove laws and regulations meaning creating new laws demanding fireproof material for buildings was not possible during that period.The interviewed survivors are not as detailed. They claim someone told them to stay inside and wait for rescue which killed many. This is said time and time again. Yet not a single person says who told them to remain inside. It was just claimed. By 999 the British 911? Firemen? Cops at the scene? And if some didn't get told this why didn't they run down? The documentary tells us firemen were indeed not trained for such situations where the cladding would be on fire and spread toxic fumes inside the whole building and burn it all down.It was extremely clear pretty much right away you needed to leave the building. Even laymen outside could see this and shouted this. So who told them to remain inside and why? And were those people imprisoned? If no one said it why are the survivors lying?,False
4,n/a,Grenfell: When Deadly Policy Becomes Blind Protocol,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary does an excellent job of exposing the deep flaws, corruption, and shocking cover-ups that led to the Grenfell tragedy. But what made me genuinely angry was the so-called ""stay put"" protocol.In a high-rise building - where heat and smoke rise (basic physics!) - the idea of telling residents to remain in their flats while the building burns is beyond reckless. It's a policy built on paper logic, not lived experience. It may look good on a spreadsheet, under perfect assumptions: perfect construction, flawless fire barriers, ideal conditions. But real fires don't behave like that. Smoke and flames spread fast, unpredictably. And the longer residents are told to stay inside, the greater the risk that escape routes will fill with smoke, stairwells will become impassable, and safe evacuation will no longer be an option.I'm writing this from a place where Fire & Rescue Services strongly encourage early self-evacuation - if you can get out safely, go. Don't wait for firefighters. We are taught that smoke kills faster than flames, and that moving early can make the difference between life and death. Public awareness here is clear: the higher you are in the building, the greater the danger. Every second counts.One thing I felt was missing in the documentary: some parts felt incomplete. For example, it was never clearly explained how the fire was eventually brought under control and put out. The timeline just skipped to a week after the fire. Also, a simple schematic illustrating the building's interior layout, stairwells, and the fire's progression would have greatly helped viewers visually understand the situation better.It's important to acknowledge the firefighters who risked everything and now must live with the trauma of that night. They did what they could under impossible conditions, but it's clear they were constrained by confusing protocols and insufficient information.Grenfell: Uncovered reinforced how deadly it can be when flawed policies are blindly followed long past the point where common sense and basic survival instinct should take over.I sincerely hope that every person involved in causing this disaster faces full accountability.",False
5,6,Unnecessary elements,RobertB-354,n/a,17/08/2025,"This film was very harrowing with deeply moving victim accounts. Clearly outstanding work from Peter Apps and others uncovering horrendous failings/incompetence and likely criminal negligence. There were a few areas that let this film down though in no particular order.Said person using the phrase 'working class people' instead of 'people' is not necessary. We live in a society with education access for all, equal healthcare access, equal access to information online, everyone owning the same smartphone, working rights greater than ever and more. A level of egalitarianism exists in many ways people don't recognise or appreciate. We're not sending children up chimneys anymore or dying from cholera for example. Things aren't perfect but hinting evil capitalism is to blame doesn't help. The irony of course being Netflix - a corporate beast - being used to push this message.There is also commentary the 'renovation' work to the tower was done ONLY for aesthetics. This is clearly absurd because another reason was clearly for energy efficiency. Why give factually incorrect information? Is this because admitting that tens/hundreds of billions spent all over the country on such things has lead to homes being saunas in the summer - ironically needing energy to cool down -, awful damp with poor insulation installations or worst of all flammable buildings with deadly cladding. I guess touching of this would cast doubt on the expensive crusade of energy efficiency and net zero, so instead construct a narrative this work was just done ONLY for aesthetics in the community. Ridiculous and unnecessary.Also disappointed in the mention of the developer that they were unprofessional and people had concerns. I don't recall a single example of what these concerns were except for a vague conversation regarding the 'freebie'. The disappointing thing is that it seems so clear that the manufacturer of the cladding and the government are to blame but this documentary muddies the water by trying to apply equal blame to everyone else including the council and the developer.Finally, it would have been good if someone, anyone had just had a word of thanks for the fire brigade and other first responders. It seems like these people were heroic in their duties - they are not responsible for instructions such as 'stay put'. I think this program could have done something to really highlight the people on the ground were outstanding and just display some gratitude - these people should not be taken for granted!This disaster shames the nation with a catelog of awful decisions/errors/malpractice. It should focus in on the clear criminal negligence. Instead it represents everyone equally to blame as well as pushing an agenda on social inequality - this simply won't help bringing the main culprits to justice. It just didn't need some of the misinformation and disinformation and the typical Netflix spin.",False
6,10,Powerful and upsetting,jpsmahoney,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have so many words I'd want to say but will narrow it down - it's a fantastic documentary well made and very much for the victims and against those who are at fault and not afford to name them. Crazy that Eric Pickles is now in the House of Lords making decisions. We the public did not elect him. He should be one of those held responsible for this horrible tragedy and should be in prison, not in the House of Lords !This documentary sheds light on the injustices and the lack of accountability that still persist. It is a powerful reminder that those in power must be held to account, and that justice for the victims should never be forgotten. I highly recommend watching it to understand the full extent of the tragedy and the ongoing fight for truth and justice.",False
7,10,"Devastating and angering, considering cladding still exists on other buildings and no charges yet brought",saamikans32,n/a,17/08/2025,"A very well made documentary, excellent interviews.The background and the technical aspects which were purposely kept from firefighters and safety advisory ignored is truly appalling.The residents had been trying to improve the place they lived, and the place they ahd been paying for. The way they were ignored at multiple levels is disheartening but these folks fought back. They are still fighting.This situation can happen again, causing further death and danger. These flammable materials should not be on any building, yet are apparently on many buildings in the UK and in other countries so this type of tragedy will occur again.It feels like Piper Alpha, with Occidental never being charged--please charge the company and officials and decisionmakers that concealed the danger.",False
8,10,How does this happen??,pkessler5,n/a,17/08/2025,"I enjoyed this documentary very much. It was well done. But, I cannot understand how in 2017 a tower building did not have a sprinkler system or fire suppression system. And how could the fire service have told people to stay in their homes. This was a tragedy that did not need to happen on so many levels. The company that made the flammable products were definitely at fault, but there were so many mistakes made. Here in the US, we have very strict regulations on fire protection. NO high rise would be allowed y to have families live in the building that had no Fire suppression system. They were let down by so many.",False
9,9,PROFITEERING AND MINDLESS BUREAUCRACY ARE TO BLAME,La_Tallchief,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's easy for me to sit here in San Francisco and bemoan the fact that not only the Alcoa subsidiary responsible for the unnecessary cladding, but the highest-up officials of the London Fire Brigade knew about the extreme flammability of the cladding. The fact that more than one source was aware of its extreme danger yet did NOTHING to prevent its use is devastating. The Fire Brigade's ""Stay Put"" order reminded me of 11 September 2001, when countless people within the twin towers called 911, only to be given those same instructions. We do have very good Fire Safety protocols here in San Francisco and in most of the country. I can't imagine that any US municipality would allow petroleum-filled cladding to be affixed to any building, much less a residential building. Furthermore, most residential buildings are required to have fire and smoke alarms, in addition to sprinkler systems, depending on the building's height and number of units. Grenfell Towers would surely require all of these safety measures. I was so frustrated by the fact that NO ONE has been charged with 72 counts of manslaughter or, at the very least, obstruction of justice. The fact that one of London's associated bureaucrats (Eric Pickles) was elevated to the House of Lords after the way he treated the survivors and scientists attempting to uncover the truth defies credibility.",True
10,3,Not great.,MichaelM-5020,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerNot a real documentary. Producers missing huge pieces of this puzzle. Let's start with the obvious: there was no centralized fire alarm system in a 24-story residential tower completed in the 1970s. This film doesn't even mention that. Ever. And even if UK authorities somehow overlooked this omission at the time of construction (and in the 1970s it was standard), any renovation-especially one undertaken 40 years later (2017) on government-subsidized housing-would, under U. S. code, absolutely require mandatory upgrades to fire suppression and detection systems. It's not optional. In the U. S., a retrofit of this scale involving combustible exterior materials would never proceed without a full code compliance review, including the modernization of alarm systems, evacuation protocols, and fire containment features. But in the UK.... incredibly, regulators didn't require a single life safety upgrade during Grenfell's multimillion-pound refurbishment. This ""documentary"" points to David Cameron's government for slashing regulations, but not one specific fire safety regulation was actually removed that would have explicitly prevented this disaster. The problem wasn't deregulation by decree-it was a deeply rooted, BIPARTISAN culture of regulatory indifference and performative compliance that allowed buildings to be made deadlier under the guise of vain ""modernization"". But it gets worse. In a grotesque example of aesthetic vanity overriding engineering judgment, the building was retrofitted with cladding that wasn't even rated for use above two stories. In the U. S., that would be an immediate violation of NFPA 285 (from 1998), which prohibits non-fire-rated materials on the facades of high-rise structures. That standard exists for one reason: to prevent exactly what happened at Grenfell-flames leaping floor to floor like a blowtorch inside a chimney. Grenfell burned like a lantern because the UK let it be wrapped in kindling. And when the inferno began, the tragedy was compounded by a fire brigade that, per the ""documentary"", had received no training on cladding fires. None. Crews on the scene were utterly unequipped to deal with an external faÃ§ade fire, having operated under the now-infamous ""stay put"" policy, advising residents to shelter in place long after it was clear that the building's compartments had failed and the fire had spread vertically and laterally. The result being dozens of people trapped in their homes, some of whom followed instructions to their deaths. The sheer idiocy of this response-failing to adapt evacuation strategy in real time-should haunt the entire firefighting command chain. And yet the focus of blame in this ""documentary"" shifted quickly-not to the contractors, regulators, or housing officials who actually chose and installed the materials-but to the cladding manufacturer, Arconic. Yes, internal emails from Arconic executives appear damning, that they knew it was flammable, yet the film never states they promoted it for high rises. Here's the legal and moral test: did Arconic lie about the fire rating of the product or its proper use in tall buildings? If not, they have no liability. Every building product has a fire rating. And in the United States, it was common knowledge-industry-wide-that this specific type of cladding was not to be used on structures over two stories. Am I seriously supposed to believe UK building officials and contractors didn't know that too? Contractors don't call Arconic and say, ""Is this safe for my tower block?"" They call and say, ""I need X square meters of Reynobond."" The supplier fulfills the order. It's the responsibility of architects, engineers, and regulators-not product vendors-to confirm code compliance. If Arconic didn't falsify documentation, hide fire ratings, or mislead about installation specs, then this witch hunt is a distraction. And let's not pretend the contractors weren't aware of the difference. Arconic offered an FR-rated (fire-resistant) version of the cladding, and it is almost certain they attempted to upsell it-as any responsible supplier would. But the client wanted the cheaper product. And someone, somewhere, made the conscious decision to use the cheaper, more combustible panels without upgrading fire suppression on a high-rise residential tower full of low-income families. The documentary conveniently avoids this entire issue, never once addressing whether Arconic concealed fire ratings or whether UK officials ignored information they absolutely should have known. 90% of the films' ""blame footage"" falls on a manufacturer who actually may be innocent. Not saying they are but this isn't a ""documentary"" as much as it is ""click bait"". 3 out of 10 stars.",True
11,10,Emotional Documentary. Well Done Netflix.,kfdynks,n/a,17/08/2025,"Spoiler7 years and still no criminal prosecutions.The documentary clearly shows that poor people died as a result of an American company continuing to sell a cladding product that they knew was like putting a fuel truck to the side of your tower. The documentary did not pull its punches and showed clearly the catalogue of errors that occurred. The show was incredibly emotional and had me in tears and making sobbing noises, struggling to hold back my emotions. The interviews with some of the victims who managed to escape were just heart breaking including interviews with firemen. Thank-you to the journalists who have relentlessly pursued the truth. The documentary highlights the erosion of society in the UK that started in 2008 with the austerity budget and has continued since them with essential services being put under financial difficulty for prolonged periods of time until responsible people get exhausted and just stop doing their jobs and doing what is right. Eric Pickles in a joke of a man. David Cameron is an idiot, one regulation in, two regulations out, what kind of stupid do you need to be to realise that is going to cause serious problems. My heart felt best wishes to all the victims of Grenfell.",True
12,10,"Brutal, pointy and pulling no punches",chrisalben,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary tells truly harrowing and heart-wrenching first-person accounts of the Grenfell Tragedy. It pulls no punches; asking questions which, to this day, go largely unanswered. Using a mix of survivor and Firefighter accounts along with the known, documented flaws in the cladding used, it brings home just how awful, and avoidable, the tragedy was. Seeing, and hearing onlookers crying from the other side of camera while knowing that human lives are being so wastefully lost really jolts the expected emotional response.The documentary is well structured. It leads with the initial Emergency Services' response, capturing their accounts as it all unfolded and moving between phone-shot video, Emergency Personnel Body Cams, the ensuing Public Enquiry, and ending with a poignant march by the Grenfell survivors.There is a lot to be said for the complete disregard of the Local Authority, the RBKC, the Government's response and the truly lacklustre desire for justice to be served. The companies that were involved, knowing the hazards their products posed, still refuse to take accountability for their actions. The MPs who insisted on deregulating building standards, knowing the impact and risk it presented. Theresa May's own refusal to visit the site of the tragedy, further implying that Grenfell residents were 2nd Class Citizens. All told, everything about the tragedy was not only avoidable, but displays the apathy of those that profit from the demise of others.For those that lost their lives, lost a loved one or survived such an awful ordeal, justice MUST be served. Money should not be more valuable than human lives.",True

The documentary lays bare the tragic sequence of failures, greed, and neglect that led to 72 needless deaths. It's a sobering account, yet years later, no one has been held accountable. No justice, no charges-just silence and bureaucracy. The film reignites fury, forcing us to confront a system that allowed this disaster and continues to protect those responsible.

15,3,"Common sense dictates: if a building is on fire, GET OUT!",miggidamac,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off, I have to ask the very logical and dumbfounding question: where was the automatic sprinkler system?!?! Can't believe this building passed code without having these functioning. I'm not trying to be insensitive to the victims here, but there has to be some personal agency and responsibility on the people that stayed in the building when they knew it was on fire. Regardless of what someone tells you, if a building is on fire, you get out of the building as soon as possible, PERIOD! Self-preservation has to take over at some point and there is an onus on a person to reach safety, no matter what authority is telling you differently. Common sense has to take over! Also, I don't know why there is such a blame placed on Arconic, it's the building owner's and safety inspectors responsibility to use safe products for the building that are suitable for the application. It is not the producer's responsibility to ensure the item is used correctly and for the appropriate application, especially if they've already put out the necessary information that states the appropriate application. I did not think this documentary was very accurate or honest to the actual responsibility for the fire, and went for cheap emotional tugs of the heart, rather than hard hitting questions for who is to blame. Instead they just tried to blame the ""evil corporations"", rather than the dereliction of the people who were actually at fault, although they did point the finger rightly at the government. The smug editor was way too self-righteous as well.",True
16,9,"Grenfell: A Tragedy That Should Never Have Happened""",andyrussell-99625,n/a,17/08/2025,"I watched Grenfell: Uncovered because I remember the tragedy vividly when it happened. Being originally from London, I was deeply shocked seeing it unfold on the news - knowing how many lives were affected made it all the more real.What stood out immediately was the shocking blame placed on an individual for supposedly starting the fire due to a faulty fridge. Even worse, I was disgusted by how people online targeted him because he was Muslim. What's race got to do with it? That kind of response shows how quick some are to scapegoat, instead of focusing on the real causes.The documentary was an eye-opener. It revealed how the company responsible for the cladding tested their materials and knew they were unsafe, yet those materials were still used. It's horrifying to think that corners were cut - possibly just to make the building look better - at the cost of lives.Despite all this, the bravery of the firefighters left me in awe. To go into a burning high-rise knowing the risk, trying to save as many people as possible... I can't imagine what they went through that night.It was emotional hearing the voices of survivors from such a diverse community. You could feel the trauma in their stories, and the documentary didn't shy away from the rawness of it. I didn't know much about the public inquiries before watching this, but I came away angry - especially at how the council prioritised appearance over safety, and how poor training or decision-making from various authorities might've played a part.There's clearly a lot of finger-pointing going on, but what's painfully obvious is that this disaster was avoidable. Cheap materials, ignored warnings, and a government slow to respond - it's a tragedy that still hasn't seen proper justice.This documentary is important. It informs, it moves you, and most of all, it reminds us that this should never have happened - and can't be allowed to happen again.",False
17,9,"Concise, probing account of modern day tragedy",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,17/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulIn June 2017, an emergency call was made to the London fire brigade, regarding an apparently minor fire in a flat, which escalated into a towering blaze. With conflicting advice emerging from the fire service, the residents of Grenfell Tower remained in their homes, but even with the best efforts of the firefighters, seventy-two people ended up losing their lives. Afterwards, survivors and activists rallied together to demand justice and affect change.In a year littered with devastating incidents (usually of the terrorism variety), the Grenfell Tower fire sticks in the mind on its own terms, both for the shock value of the event, and the social unrest and change it provoked in the aftermath. Nearly a decade on (unbelievable), Netflix delivers this neat little documentary, giving a human voice to those directly affected, from survivors to fire crew who attended the scene.Unsurprisingly (if you drop your biases and think about things) none of the interviewees meet your stereotypes or perceptions of how they might be. We hear from a young woman who was sitting her exams at the time and had predicted good grades, as well as a well spoken man who wouldn't have wanted to have lived anywhere else. Whether these stereotypes existed or not, it's unsettlingly clear that the company in charge of the cladding didn't seem to think much of them, having been warned of the dangers and unsuitability of the material long in advance of the devastating incident.Ultimately, the most unsettling aspect of the whole thing is that there are any number of high rises that still to this day have the same unsafe cladding, and that it's basically just a matter of time before something similar happens. The lives of the poor really have as little value in a 'first world' country as anywhere else, it seems. ****",False
18,3,Weak Sauce! Undermines the tragedy!,AtomicG-7,n/a,17/08/2025,"I remember watching in real time the horror of Grenfell from ""across the pond."" Being from NYC, the comments of a bystander claiming that it was the British 9/11 really struck me as on point. It did seem to be an event of that scope.Enter the documentary. Because it had been so long since watching the news reports, I wanted to revisit the tragedy and get a better understanding of what had happened. Instead, the documentary was the definition of ""weak sauce,"" which actually undermined the tragedy in every respect.How? I remember how in the year of the tragedy, it was concluded that the reason why so many people died was that the cladding caused the fire to spread so quickly that people didn't have a chance to escape. That's pretty razor sharp and ironclad, right? The cladding turned the building into a tinderbox. Case closed.But in this documentary, that's not what you're told. There is so much blame being cast at so many people that it feels like a game of Clue. A million different factors are responsible--gentrification, class division, telecommunications, the fire department, politicians, deregulation, ""Yanks"", corporate greed, etc. It was Colonel Mustard in the library with a gun. No, it was Mrs. Peacock with a knife in the conservatory. No, it was this person! No, it was that person!The problem with trying to cast so much blame at so many people, places and things is that it paints the tragedy as less an evil event deliberately caused by criminal neglect than a comedy of errors. In a comedy of errors, it's not that willful negligence and malicious intent caused this issue. It's just that a series of innocuous oversights happened to kick off a chain of events that combined in such a way that no one could have anticipated. (This phenomenon is also known as a ""perfect storm."") I don't think that's what the documentary set out to do, but it undermined its ""criminally negligent"" premise by trying to point the finger of blame at so many entities.Also, involving so many different entities wound up ironically canceling out each other's supposed contribution to the tragedy. Let's take the case about the fire department's ""stay put"" protocol, for instance. If people died because they were told to stay put, then how are all the other players in this saga, particularly Arconic, to blame for anything? If the building was cladded because of revulsion from gentrifiers feeling uncomfortable about it, how is deregulation to blame? If it's in the British national character to be obedient to first responders no matter what, how are politicians to blame? If the first responders didn't have television to enable them to see how far the fire had spread, how is ""stay put"" to blame?Particularly blaming the ""stay put"" protocol really left a bad taste in my mouth. Again, what I had learned before the documentary is that the fire had spread so quickly that no one had a chance to get out. By blaming ""stay put"", the documentary is implying that everyone could've gotten out safely, cladding notwithstanding. You can't have it both ways, both blaming an evil company for the deaths but at the same time imply that if it hadn't been for the stay put protocol, no one would've died.Keep in mind that I don't know how accurate the documentary is. Maybe it wouldn't have mattered what victims had been told by the fire department because the cladding was so flammable that they wouldn't have had a chance. But by emphasizing ""stay put"", the documentary undermines its own case that the deaths were caused by flagrant negligence, greed, deregulation and indifference to class suffering.That the tragedy might've been caused by a perfect storm of events actually explains why criminal charges were never brought against anyone or company. The documentary wants to lead viewers to think that lack of prosecutions are a sign of how corrupt everyone and everything is. But according to its own logic, charges couldn't have been brought. Why? Because all signs point to the ""perfect storm"" being caused by something far larger/systemic/cultural that can't be neatly pinned on any one person, place or thing, and isn't necessarily due to greed, racism, prejudice or malicious intent. In this case, it would seem that various ""cultures"" with outdated protocols and ways of thinking were the issue, similar to how dated NASA Culture led to the Columbia and Challenger disasters or how dated culture in the Aeronautics industry in the 1970s and 80s led to several devastating plane crashes.Some people might take offense to this, but that cultures with outdated protocols might've been the culprit in the Grenfell Disaster wouldn't have made the deaths any less meaningless or tragic. If anything, tragedies like this often lead to a huge wake up call that inspires sweeping cultural changes within various sectors that wind up saving more lives in the process. In this way, the victims don't die in vain; they take on more significance. They become immortalized as those whose deaths spur dramatic changes that makes life safer for everyone.If that were the case with Grenfell, the documentary could've seized the opportunity to generate the type of wake up call that would've led to massive changes in fire safety, urban planning, construction and emergency response culture. Instead, it sets out to simply paint the entire affair as a crime in which heads must roll. No talk of reform, how things can be done better, how changes can be made. Just try to find a villain and keep loved ones in a perpetually aggrieved state.I know I sound harsh, but having been spoiled with shows like Air Crash Investigation and Seconds from Disaster--which often have far balanced takes on terrible tragedies--I found this documentary sorely lacking nuance. Not all tragedies are due to mustache twirling villains, mindless bureaucrats or money grubbing capitalists. Sometimes the tragedies are caused by outdated cultures within sectors. The fact that this documentary seemed to keep stabbing in the dark trying to blame anything and everything under the sun says as much.",False

They also vaguely touch on the political administration at the time being pro-deregulation but never say what they actually deregulated when it comes to fire protection.

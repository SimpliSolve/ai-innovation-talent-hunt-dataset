1,10,Loved it!!!,hempty,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely amazing!! Really opened my eyes to how all of us deal with grief and ways to express those feelings we tend to hide. I loved the educational parts as well, it really goes to show people have dealt with grief through art since wayyyy back in the day! I really like that someone we hold so dear to us can be praised in such creative ways after their passing. All around a wonderful experience and would definitely recommend to anyone because we all have a love one pass sooner or later, and this gives you a glimpse of how people deal with such strong feelings when everything may seem hopeless.",False
2,10,A Therapeutic Journey,jena-04164,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film adresses grief in a personal, therapeutic and historical sense. I am a mother who lost her child and I found it informative and moving.

3,10,Vitally important film about the importance of releasing grief!,tara-19777,n/a,15/08/2025,"I truly enjoyed this movie and how it shares Preston's process of navigating the extreme grief he experienced after his brother died. It was quite a dedicated path he was on to create a painting once a day for a year to commemorate his brother's death. We would be much more balanced as a culture if we practiced the necessary steps to grieving our beloveds in a healthy manner.This film perfectly illustrates how culturally how we are taught to suppress grief and the why behind this belief system. I enjoyed how he talked about different cultures, like the Egyptians and how they perceived and celebrated death. I highly recommend this incredible film, It is a brilliant piece of art!",False
4,10,A must watch film!,alexwilliamsaz,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Art of Grieving"" is an Indie budget documentary but doesn't feel that way. Take it from someone who is significantly picky about cinematography and shot selection to present the story. ""The Art of Grieving"" showcases expert-level techniques even with a limited budget. I hope everyone watching this film is inspired to create on any level. There are many takeaways from this film but the one that stood out to me the most was the inspiration to let your emotions drive your creativity. Thank you Preston for bringing the audience into your mind space and showing us your true creativity!",False
5,10,Grief & expression,earl-78881,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beautiful film. I lost my mother in December and I have not been able to make art since. It's not like me. I use art to express myself or know how I feel or think. I realized as I watched your doc and listened that I've been working round the clock on my mushroom farm to avoid the studio. I realized a lot. How tight my paintings have become as I closed myself off. I find myself in the accidents and chaos. I want to get back to the way I paint, loose, vulnerable, open.When I get out of the way, there is room for the magic and connection.I watched how others connected to common & individual grief. I miss the connection I make with my work when I'm free and in the zone where the magic happens.Thank you for making your 365 paintings and reminding me that connection is so important.",False
6,10,Learning a new world after my loss,bearlyangl,n/a,15/08/2025,"On March 29, 2022, I lost my husband of 24 years. Riding the waves of grief... crashing over and over... I searched for life rafts along the way. I came upon this documentary and what a life saver! I am a fairly new painter, although my profession is a graphic designer, I am fairly new to the painting world. Combining my love of painting with my healing journey has resulted in some of my most-loved pieces. Thank you for showing me an outlet that works FOR me! Your story is inspiring and healing. I continue to encourage other creatives like me who are grieving to watch this documentary. Thank you for helping me carry on in this crazy world. ~Gina.",False

8,10,Incredibly Inspiring,DenisseAlondra,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Art of Grieving"" by Preston Zeller is incredibly inspiring on the emotional healing benefits of art. Zeller shared his journey of grieving and he also shared some of the research on how art has been connected with processing grief. I felt the final result of his artwork also paid a beautiful tribute to his brother. I'm healing my inner child and this documentary inspired me to continue healing with art. I was also able to learn why creating art has helped me. Art releases emotions in ways that words can't explain! I highly recommend this to anyone experiencing grief or healing trauma. Blessings to everyone on their healing journey!",False
9,10,A very healthy and clever way to express grieving in a wholesome wayx,bdvnhgfk,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have to admit having been and worked with many many grieving people this film really touched me. I love the clever way it shows us how to live with grieving in such a beautiful way. Using art to release ones daily inner pain and loss openly in this way is brilliant. You will never not miss a loved one but expressing that inner loss can be difficult and every single one of us is unique , as was each of the 365 works of art created that we were privileged to see. Thank you for creating this film and allowing us to share its journey. I have no doubt that this idea will help many others. You all did good x.",False

11,10,Moving Film that Encourages Personal Introspection,alexkotler,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was incredibly moved during my viewing of ""The Art of Grieving"" by Preston Zeller.As someone, like everyone, who has experienced loss, I found myself looking inward to appreciate how I've come to terms with death-or tried to-and how I've grappled with and channeled grief.Art is one medium; but, beyond the medium itself is the scale of the challenge that Zeller takes on, and the discipline and diligence that he applies to his process.One gets the sense that, if Zeller completes his challenge, he also can overcome grief. That, though, is not the way that grief works, and everyone must ultimately go on their own journey.Regardless, I found meaning in the film and Zeller's story, and I imagine that all will find something to take away from it.",False

14,10,Riveting and Inspirational,sidneymil,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was given a card with this documentary on it after telling my story about losing my mother to Covid. I did not think something would resonate with me after the horrific experience I had in December of 2020. Not being able to be with my Mom during her passing is something I can not put to words, but after watching this film, I can start my journey. Being able to walk through Prestons' story and have his grief turn into something as tangible as art, helped me understand that I am not alone. I highly recommend this documentary to anyone that is trying to make sense of their own grief. Impactful.",False

18,10,"Inspiring, Creative way to feel, express and process grief",remdolphin,n/a,15/08/2025,"My husband and I love documentaries. This was inspiring and left us in awe how someone experiencing such a profound loss channeled it to dedicate 365 days to painting and then build a display of it in his house. Grief and death is a taboo subject and it's refreshing to see a documentary capturing a personal way to express it. Grief is Universal to each individual who goes through it. The artist Preston shows how something he was passionate about Art helped him navigate, process his grief to transform it as he navigates through his healing journey. It gives viewers the ability to think about when going through trying and challenging losses how can they process what they are feeling through an option of art therapy. Taking your life's passion and helping you feel and express grief that is authentic to you.",False

I so loved it's honesty which moves upstream in contrast to our microwave, I need it delivered today culture. We can so often ignore the deeper parts of our being, banking on positivity as the path to happiness. Well this is a gut punch to fake it till you make it.

22,10,Amazing!,jay-36271,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love the message and awareness the film is bringing to such a painful topic that more often times than not gets shoved under the rug. Dealing with Grief in my own life has been difficult at times with no clear instructions on how to heal or what to do. As a man, it was nice to see a different outlet and expression for things we bottle up during hard times. I know this took a lot of vulnerability and personally many take always that led me down my own path of self reflection after watching. It's a beautiful and honest film to say the least. Worth the watch and perspective. Much respect to the Directors and team that put this together. 5/5 stars!",False

The documentary and Preston's business all center around the idea that society doesn't spend enough time talking about grief. ""The Art of Grieving"" definitely sheds a light on Preston's experience losing his brother and the need to find a way to express his feelings - it's certainly a moving documentary and a must watch!

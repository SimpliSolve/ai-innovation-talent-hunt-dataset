1,5,Embarrassingly England (again),red-canuck,n/a,16/08/2025,"A mildly compelling but disturbing watch, proving English hooliganism hasn't really moved on that much since the 70's & 80's.The actual football story aside (which was the only decent thing in this doc - well done lads!) this documentary missed a real opportunity to educate the public on football crowd dynamics, and what another shameful episode the psychy at English football grounds is sometimes still really like., especially when groups of young people are a several beers deep so long before the game.The doc completely failed to go into the additional experience of a number of player's families and dignitaries that fell foul of the mob developing outside, nor some corrupt event hosts/guards that took cash bribes from ticket-less fans to ease their passage through, and also the fans with genuine tickets (including in disabled areas) who were threatened with violence for simply attempting to access their assigned seat once reaching their zone, with zero help from stadium stewards frozen to do anything about it.The planned Covid spacing protocols went down the toilet, thugs just sat/stood wherever they pleased, taking other fans seats, overcrowding behind the goals especially, and over the access ways that were meant to be kept clear in the event of rapid evacuation etc. The list goes on.Security was a complete shambles - remember, it was just less than 6 yrs earlier, in 2015, that a coordinated terrorist attacks in Paris took place, one of which was at the national 'Stade de France' Stadium as 3 suicide bombers attempted to gain access to a France vs Germany football game to no avail, ultimately detonating themselves outside instead. Imagine the carnage had something of this scale developed at Wembley?I did not see any news of reprimands in the press following this shameful Wembley fiasco over their security and organisational shambles that could've turned out very differently. It was purely by fluke that no one died that day.It's no surprise to me that the English FA and Wembley Stadium authorities were total unprepared for the scale of chaos that ensured in England's long wait for final appearance in a major tournament.It's also no surprise to me that the 2 young men (and I use the term 'men' loosely) who effectively stole other people's money to gain access to the stadium, feel no shame in their behavior, such is the vast blatant disrespect for authority and that appears to exist in this age group. There simply aren't sufficient consequences for this kind of immature, childish behavior.And should it really be any surprise that the English FA and Wembley Stadium authorities have no shame in monetizing their failures if they can make a few bucks out of Netflix? Not really.Disappointing lacking in accountability throughout.",False
2,5,Ok doc bad message,maxcap72,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall well executed doc with some glaring omissions and missed opportunities. It seems to somehow idealize and normalize English hooligan culture. There's an odd hands off, no judgement here, attitude that pervades the 90 minutes of this documentary. The authors seem to have completely forgotten that in 1985 all English soccer clubs had been banned to play in European competitions for 5 years following the Heysel tragedy, where 37 Italians died following the actions of Liverpool hooligans during the Juventus Italy, Liverpool match. So again, Italy, England, hooligans. Fortunately this time, fate had that England lost the game otherwise there could have been another tragedy. All this escaped the authors and a pervasive moral relativism tells us that there's really no difference between the Italian dad going to the stadium with his daughter and regular tickets and the lovely fella jumping on the bus and getting into the stadium by braking down the barricades and evading the police. They are both fans that love soccer after all .",False
3,6,The English Should be Ashamed,dan-can-do,n/a,16/08/2025,"The English Hooligans are well represented and how can they not be? This documentary clearly shows how the behavior is deeply entrenched in the young male England football fan. They have a well deserved bad reputation and this documentary only solidifies that fact. Every single citizen of the country or fan of the team should be thoroughly and completely embarrassed by what happened at Wembley on this day. It's so sickening that despite my previous support of the England club, I now hope they never, ever win any big tournament in the near future. The fans deserve many more decades of football misery for this.",False
4,7,Brings out mixed but all negative feelings,Ps393,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was under no illusions that this was going to be a frustrating watch. What happened on that day was a feeling of disappointment for the end result, coupled with anger, embarrassment and shame with off field antics. This documentary brought those feeling back again.It covers the entire build up of the day of the final. It looks to understand what and how it happened, and allows some of those involved to give their personal stories and ridiculous justifications for what was, and still is, unacceptable anti-social behaviour.As an England football fan, the rollercoaster of anger and shame while watching it all continued to unfold. In listening to the modern day Neanderthals think their actions were perfectly okay and just driven by passion and a release of frustration post lockdown was just alien to me.It's reasonably well produced, but difficult if you're English with any sense of morality. It will be a constant reminder why people will be very nervous that England co-host the euros in 2028 or at least why the security is bound to be significant.",False
5,7,"An interesting documentary, but gives off the wrong vibes",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSTAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulJuly 11th, 2021. A country emerging from a second lockdown during the second wave of the Covid pandemic, and World Cup fever was in the air. Hordes of fans were eager to flock to Wembley Stadium for the big game against Italy, but were factored out by unaffordable ticket prices, and large parts of the stadium sealed off to comply with Covid regulations. Before long, chaos had broken out, with largely ticketless fans stampeding into the arena, and the security becoming overwhelmed, leaving all those who'd come to celebrate the game stuck in the crossfire.I've never had much of an interest in football, and have always felt uneasy at the tribalism and sense of raw aggression it generates in people, even if it would be better channeled through a medium like this than out on the street. Through an outward veneer, the game still generally appears a lot calmer and less eruptive than the things you see from back in the 1970's and 80's, but occasionally it can flare up again and events like those documented here can occur. I certainly remember those shameful scenes being broadcast, and how they spoiled the happy mood that I did get absorbed in, even if I wasn't following things in general. Here they're explored in more detail.As I've already mentioned, it was the feeling of something happening that felt largely consigned to the past, something you felt most people had evolved beyond, but you always knew somewhere in the national consciousness was just simmering beneath the surface, and that something like this was sadly going to bring it out. Will an Asian security guard be racially abused, just while doing his job? Sadly, yes. Will three inexperienced younger players get the same thing when they miss on penalty shoot outs? Sadly, yes. It's all encapsulated by the likes of the guy at the end, boasting about how he'll show his kids the picture of him parading about on the top of the bus, like his dad showed him the one of him breaking into the private members area. Two generations of mindless idiocy.As if to highlight how progress has improved things, things are rounded off with the women's team winning their match. What we focus on here is a resurgence of bygone times, and while this documentary does a decent job of things, there's an overly jubilant feel to the subjects and their actions that feel distasteful. ***",True
6,7,Battle lost,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - I don't know if another title would be more appropriate ... but I reckon we have to work with what we get! I do understand that England and its fans had quite a lot to look forward too. It is 2024 and there the Champions League final is in Wembley - but no English team is going to be there to challenge for the trophy (you got a German and a Spanish team left).But a couple of years ago, the national team was able to reach the finals. Against Italy - one game, everything is possible! But the structure .. the way things were prepared seem in hindsight to not have been the best.If you know the outcome (and I knew who had won the game, but only remembered while watching what occurred after the game was over), you may not be too surprised ... but we get interviews and snippets from the day and the days leading up to it. I still think as already said that the title can be perceived as a bit deceiving ... but that aside, it is horrible what some ""fans"" did after the final ... you win and you lose together! I reckon some things will never change ... and with social media giving certain people a platform ... well it won't be changing in the near future.Let's try to spread love - even in the time of ""defeat"" ... not easy to do, but better to stick together and give each other some comfort, rather than spread hate ... which should be a take away from this, not sure if it really is done in a way, you feel it serves that message .. or any message of that kind.",False
7,3,Fails to make people reflect about what happened,vlagun,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou hear a lot of interview partners and you can see lots of personal recordings and CCTV footage. There is no narrator so all the facts you get are from a more personal point of view.The interview partners consist of all kinds of people. Normal football fans, people excessively drinking and partying, getting into the stadium without a ticket but also an intimated security guard and an Italian father worrying about the well-being of his daughter. You hear stories about the love of football, racism, threats, physical fights and a little girl being thrown glass beer bottles at. This is sadly the point where the documentary fails hard. Only in the last 3 minutes ONE question is asked about how the hooligans felt about their behaviour this day. Instead we hear about their love of football and of how proud they are of what happened this day. On top of that we get a full 15 minute game summary that could have been 5 minutes max.It's shocking how many people were willing to put football over the well-being of others. It's also shocking that this documentary misses this central aspect entirely and IMHO normalizes threats and vandalism in football culture.",True
8,8,Compelling if revolting documentary,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Final: Attack on Wembley"" (2024 release from the UK; 82 min.) it is ""11th July 2021"", and England is set to play in and host the final of the 2020 Euros (delayed by a year due to COVID) against Italy. The movie starts at 8 am (12 hours before kickoff), and people from all over England are descending upon London, already heavily drinking, and many without tickets for the game. What could go wrong? At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this movie brings a chilling account of the events on July 11, 2021, leading up to the game. A number of factors were heavily at play: first, this was England's fist chance since 1966 to win a major trophy; second, as in 1966, they would also be hosting the event; third, due to COVID delaying the tournament by a year, this was the first time people would be out and celebrating en masse; and last but not least: the English authorities vastly underestimated what was about to transpire. In short: all elements were in place for a massive for a colossal breakdown of security. The footage makes for absolute compelling if revolting viewing. I cannot readily recall having seen anything like this. The movie makers keep a tight pace throughout, and this documentary just flew by in no time.""The Final"" Attack On Wembley"" started streaming on Netflix this weekend. Whether or not you are a soccer fan is frankly irrelevant. This is a documentary that shows what happens when an entire country is frenzied, with thousands of people determined to get into Wembley stadium, ticker or no ticket. SHOCKINGLY (not), pure mayhem and chaos ensues... Highly recommended.",False
9,4,Social standards at an all time low.,sirkeith7,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm embarrassed to be English after watching this. I lost interest in football a long time ago, but felt compelled to watch this and what I found was embarrassment. This my nation denigrating in to feral barbarism in the name of sport. A couple of the people that were giving their accounts of their day out were simply morons. One, who described is moment of dancing on top of a moving bus as, ""I felt like a King up there"" ; just left me shaking my head and rolling my eyes. I kind of felt sorry for him in a way. Another, felt so proud of himself to have barged his way into the stadium without paying. Congratulations mate, everyone knows your face now.A compelling watch for all the wrong reasons.",False
10,2,Horrible hooligan culture,sn3z,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary made me sick and things like this is why I can never support England even though I've lived here all my life.The glorifying of England thugs in this made me sick yo my stomach, the filmmakers have no clue and should give up making this dirge for netflix money immediately.Don't watch this if you're proud of being English. It will make you sick and we should never host another tournament ever again.Why have finals this late in the day when everyone does nothing but drink all day. I am soooooioio glad England lost, Italy were the better team anyway. These fans broke in and robbed people of their rights to watch the game.",False
11,10,An eye opening and a gripping documentary,dhananjaymalhotra12,n/a,16/08/2025,"The imdb rating of this documentary is low because of some English football fans (hooligans) who don't want the world to see their shameful acts.A country whose people have time and again judged and commented negatively about people of different races, color, religion etc, did something similar but even more embarrassing on the night of the Euro 2020.The documentary shows the true level of football hooliganism that exists in the UK and how some maniacs can go to any extent in hurting the true spirit of the sport if the outcome does not turn out as per their expectations.The documentary is an eye opener for all the football fans who are unaware of the egregious football watching fans/audience in the UK. A must watch.",False
12,1,Allowing idiots to show off what they did!,Sinhealer23,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge fan of documentaries but this just missed the point entirely.This one is basically allowing some so called men boasting about what they did!The kid that climbed on the bus and then said his Dad did something the same and saying ""I guess we just like to climb things"", no you're both idiots!The other guy that travelled to the game without a ticket and just before he sneaked into the ground realised he had no place to watch the game... What a genius this guy was, it took him that long to realise that! Maybe stay home and watch the game!I'm not English but embarrassed for them.The only people I could connect with was the Italian father and daughter, I felt sorry for them having to go through that, it does seem though that the makers of this documentary wanted to focus more on the idiot England fans and for some reason allow them to apparently give a reason to why they did it, even Covid got the blame!Honestly give this a miss and save yourself from the anger it will cause you towards the idiots that are in it and how the makers of this gave them the time of day!",False
13,1,Really..?,oliver-lucas1,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, in the opinion of the two ""fans"" (let's call them idiots for the record) damaging property is okay, endangering other people is okay, vandalism is okay, breaking and entering is okay, but racism is a step too far for them? Are you serious? Why are these two idiots not in jail? They should.be banned from every sporting event going forward and locked up to show and example to the other idiots that put countless lives in danger. As far as a documentary goes, why would you create it and show that these idiots (and the others with them) haven't been punished? How will this have a positive effect on society?",False
14,4,"Using Football as an excuse, normalized",simonmuve,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether one is a football fan, or not the behaviour portrayed in this documentary should shock you, it should make you ashamed to be English, it should make you ashamed to be a football fan. Instead by totally ignoring the consequences, by not asking the people interviewed pertinent questions regarding their behaviour what this doc ends up doing is normalising violent horrible behaviour.See it is OK to drink too much and riot as long as football is involved, there is no morality just ignorance. This documentary confirms what many of us know already, that football is followed by a lot of ignorant men driven by the fear the will ose the respect of their peers if the don't behave like they do in this documentary.View it as a warning.",False
15,4,Flawed documentary about disgusting hooligans,rjf-63090,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary chronicles the Euro Cup football title match between Italy and England at London's Wembley Stadium in 2021. The London police and stadium officials should have watched a documentary about the 2011 riot in Vancouver after their hockey team lost a Stanley Cup final game. Like Vancouver, the English authorities were totally unprepared, despite the English history of hooliganism, for what occurred before the match: huge crowds of mostly drunken young men gathered for blocks outside the stadium hours before the match starting time. Outnumbered authorities had no choice but to let the hooligans swarm in and watch the game, while terrorizing fans with tickets.The documentary, like the IMDB trailer, gives way too much screen time to a neck-tattooed twit named Dan, who broke in with the mob and offers no regrets for what he did. Time is also wasted on an unrepentant young drunk who was filmed dancing on top of a bus. Apparently, neither hooligan was arrested. The end of the documentary states that 86 people were arrested, but no follow-up on their cases is offered. In contrast, the Vancouver riot documentary focused heavily on the outing of rioters on social media, and their prosecution.The documentary loses focus when it shifts to racial insults against black players on the losing English side. A separate documentary on English racism would have made more sense. No hard questions (like why were you unprepared?) were asked of stadium officials and the police. No interviews with London and National political leaders, or soccer federation officials, were conducted. The documentary supplies plenty of information but lacks a coherent focus and is often wrongly focused.",False
16,2,Glorifying idiocy,sldunstallmusic,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary could have been quite good but the focus was really odd. It flicks between glorifying two of the thickest men alive (the two contributors who show no remorse for their actions on the day) and the racism shown to players afterwards.It almost had the makings of a good documentary and the graphics packages were solid enough. It would be nice to see what happened to the rioters afterwards and what has been done to combat this in the future, as opposed to the resolution being 'the women won a trophy later on' and the thicker of the two daft boys banging on about how his dad climbs on stuff too.Overall, loads of promise, poor outcome.",True
17,3,Shallow examination of a serious issue,rodw-77-924268,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is not the first of these ""mob"" scenes involving football in Europe and the documentary did little to examine the real problems and the poor management prior to the event.It was almost a PR doco from the Wembly Stadium authorities and equally one sided.Of even more concern, was the apparent glorification of the bad behaviour of the interviewed ""patrons"" who gate crashed the event without any remorse or understanding of the potential consequences.And then, to top it all off, after failing to make any real effort to delve into all the failings surrounding the organisaiton of the event, there was the completely irrelevent bit to try to turn it into some racially motivated happening, something that only had a very tenuous, and minor, connection.There just was too little effort to delve into the systematic failures of organisers, police and transport authorities to manage an event when there were numerous previous examples of the expected problems.A documentary maker must make an effort to bring proper balance, and investigation, if they are to be taken seriously.",True
18,1,Irresponsible Film,mark_derisley,n/a,16/08/2025,This film is a disgrace. It glorifies thuggish and criminal behaviour. Some of those thugs were in the film proudly telling the world how they got drunk and forced their way into Wembley stadium. They are actually proud of what they did. Do these people have no shame ? There was one guy who basically admitted that hooliganism runs in the family and he hopes his kids follow in his footsteps. The makers of the film seemed proud of these people too and made no effort to criticise their actions. The film sets such a bad example to young people. I hope the police will be taking action against these people seeing as they have admitted to their crimes.,False
19,1,Poorly Handled,brianculleton-10594,n/a,16/08/2025,"The events here were dangerous and reflected poorly on society. The documentary's message seems to be 'boys will be boys' despite the tragic history of football hooliganism in England. It's a waste of an opportunity to explore the backlash or punishment inflicted on the hooligans, instead the focus on them is very 'nice'. The authorities also weren't taken to task enough on the poor planning around the event. As a documentary, there should be a message or focus, but it just isn't there, which as I mentioned, is a shame as the footage and access available is in such abundance. BBC would have done it better.",False
20,5,Englands 6th January 2021,Deccomajor,n/a,16/08/2025,"Firstly i'm not a football fan, i stopped supporting football about 35 years ago when it became more about the money and politics rather than the so called beautiful game.However i do have an interest in Football hooliganism ( call it macabre ) but my view is if someone was a true fan of football why would they become a raving loon involving 22 grown men kicking a piece of leather up and down a grass filed in there underwear.What got me was the way the producers made the ' hooligans ' out to be the good guys and the security and Wembley staff out to be the bad guys, and the guy with the neck tattoo who claimed he did it because he's been climbing the walls at home through the Covid lockdown was about as thick as the interviewer who asked him the question.Personally the so called football fans who were interviewed and seen causing damage should have been bought up on charges and banned from games.",False
21,5,"An emberrasing documentary about England really, and a doc that doens't know what its about...",rchosen-193-5535,n/a,16/08/2025,"So I am an American. I hadn't heard of this incident. To be fair I'm not into sports so it may be why.I watched this and it often felt like they weren't sure what the documentary was about half of the time. Alot of times it was about the game rather then the incident the title is about. I get the importance of the game and how it fueled the incident, but so much time was focused on game stuff that wasn't as important to the incident at all.As for the incident itself. Well I came out of this with some negative reactions:1. Security/police...etc seem crappy in England and didn't prepare right nor seemed to know what they were doing. Terrible crown control. Just police with batons. That was it. You'd think in a modern England, they would be, you know, modern. People vs people sadly.2. The men in England REALLY seem aggressive and act like immature people. Way before the incident occurred, it was like watching the young adults who go on Spring Break in Floridia in the US. Except at least we can mostly control the people here. These young guys were beyond drunk, breaking laws, sneaking into the place, hurting people, breaking things, messing up traffic, cars, lights...etc.3. I really expected more talk from people at the incident. Instead we didn't get many eye witness accounts. Again, the doc mostly talked about the game instead of the incident.I think the people who made this documentary should really watch some Americans documentaries about incidents here and see why they are so popular. We get down tot he nitty gritty, the details fo said incidents. We don't go into side tangents about other things in ours.So overall about the only thing this documentary did for me was barley teach/show me the incident. And instead mainly showed me young men in England are dangerous it seems.I know Brits talk about how violent the US is with its guns. But I can see hands down that if the UK allowed guns, it would be far more violent then the US is. I mean tends of thousands young men being violent and crazy all over a silly game? Crazy.",False
22,5,Confusing message,tjharwood-21892,n/a,16/08/2025,"Did the 2 hooligans that were interviewed for this programme know they were being set up? Surely everyone who watched this saw them as what they were, idiots and criminals. I liked how the programme makers made fun of them both by making them believe they did nothing wrong. Jumping up and down on top of a bus and barging through barriers, trampling people to illegally gain access for something you havnt paid for? Yeh nothing wrong that! All just good fun. What a pair of numptys. Why have they not been arrested? I hope they are both embarrassed about the fact that everyone now knows they are morons. By the way climbing on top of a pub is very different to climbing on top of a bus in operation.",False
23,1,Booo,EsmeChiori,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why do yall white or any people have to put such disgusting images on freaking documentaries like helloo we dont want to see things like that. Don't you guys know how to make normal documentaries with no disgusting images like seriously? I dont know who likes to watch any if these anyways. These directors or whatever need to learn that those images are disgustingly disgusting. I only watched for 20 minutes or more but i deeple regret wasting my time on that wasteful show. Thank you for nothing. No im serious thank you for absolutely nothing i mean y'all could've kept it normal but nahh, this movie is 0/0.",False
24,3,"Eww England, this is gross",prfundraiser-21480,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo none of the hooligans regretted their actions?? As many reviewers already alluded to, this documentary failed to ask crucial questions to security team and the hooligans. It seemed like it was just a pat on the back for everyone. Like no one is embarrassed. And they kept saying unity. HOW?? One person even said the security couldn't have done a better job. WHAT?!! I was rooting for Italy to win about midpoint into this documentary. Britain DID NOT deserve to win. You want to act like animals? Then you don't get nice things, that's for people that don't leave their brains at home.I just couldn't understand why people started coming to the location in the morning. And HOW did security not prepare for this? As soon as they saw the crowd drinking and acting a fool hours before kickoff, they should've tightened security to the max. Doesn't England sport fans have a reputation of being volatile? Heck, don't soccer fans have this history? When I tell you I was GROSSED out. I'm American and we don't have large groups of hooligans like this in sports. Look at the 2004 red sox world series. They hadn't won in 86 years, which is WAY longer than England and yet they didn't act like buffoons when the redsox won. The redsox fans were hugging each other, even in bars there wasn't violence. England, ya'll are different and not in a good way. Ya'll act like soccer is your savior. And then you look at us American's in disdain when we're excited about church and have lively worship. What on earth has soccer done for you? Did it save you from death, sickness, financial ruin? Please tell me?? I was SO GLAD when Italy won, and the hooligans just turned around and it started to rain on them. Good! And honestly because this documentary proves they have not learned their lesson. England should never win. Not until they know how to act.",True

1,10,Many emotions,gabrielaraujof-15973,n/a,16/08/2025,"Best documentary I've ever seen, it's about Victor Schiavon (stage name: Yun Li) and Leandro (stage name: Bife), creating music that can either touch your heart or even make you cry. It focuses heavily on the production of the album 'BitterSweet Memories' and also explores the artistic aspect of the location where they worked on the album. It has its serious moments and its comedic moments (both great to watch). It certainly surpassed its predecessor in terms of quality, namely the 'Validation' documentary. I believe it's probably the biggest and best project YouTube has ever been able to have. I love this documentary... 10/10.",False

You lose your notion of time,either laughing from the comic moments between Vito and Leandro,or crying with the melodies they are creating,like ""Flores de Outro Carnaval"",translating it,Another Carnaval's Flowers(Carnaval is a Brazilian traditional commemorative date,that happens between February and March),in which he makes a tribute to a friend who passed away. It's impossible to listen to it without crying. In a few words,absolute cinema.",True

2,n/a,Very well made!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSplendid documentary about the life of a Bulgarian hero and fellow heroes of his era in which debt the nation stands, but has almost forgotten. The the dynamic of the related political history of the time is weaved in neatly and comprehensively such that I could form a clearer and fuller picture. Watching gave me a time warp sensation, as if the spirit of Tane Voivoda and all other heroes was reaching out across time and space and imparted with their life story a message of faith, courage and strength, which many of us today are so badly in need of. The nation has forgotten its heroes but the heroes have not forgotten the nation even in the heavens beyond.",True

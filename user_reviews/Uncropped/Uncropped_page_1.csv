1,10,Fantastic,regnewman-15425,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a really awesome to watch. In addition to the subject's story being interesting to learn about, the subject's photography is really incredible and provides a rich trip through history. You really get a glimpse into multiple different eras and feel like you get to go on a little journey.In addition, seeing New York City portrayed throughout the film at different periods of time is also a really fun element of the film. As a New York, I love to see the city portrayed in films, especially throughout the decades. I've watched the film a couple of times and each time I notice new things and it continues to be fun to watch!",False
2,10,Wonderful doc with a fabulous photographer.,mickeylawrence,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is one of my favorites. James Hamilton is an awesome photographer and his photos was a walk down memory lane for me. From the late 60's to 2010? Hamilton's brilliant photography brought back my history. The documentary took me inside the beautiful photos and the times they represented. D. W. Young's direction made it seem very personal and at the end of the film I felt I knew the cast of characters personally. As he worked for the Village Voice and many fashion magazines and was on the set for most all of Wes Andersons films, it seems as he photographed every famous celebrity, and the one with Alfred Hitchcock smiling was one of my favorites.A must see for anyone who loves photography, the movies, NYC, and current history.",False
3,1,Seven-Point-Five? REALLY?,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hands down this is the worst biography/documentary I have ever seen.I had no clue who this guy was before watching the movie and frankly, after seeing it, I could not care less.It basically shows the career of some dude who was able to shoot famous and semi-famous people back in the dark ages.Only the guy, when interviewed is boring beyond belief. Further, his photos are horrible. There is nothing special about them in the slightest. In truth, they are rather amateurish.I honestly believe I could do better. The difference between him and I is that, by his own account, he schemed and lied and misrepresented himself to get close to the people he photographed. That makes him a genius?I sincerely think that the current 7.5 score is from people close to the project. It has to be.",False

1,7,Comedy and activism blended,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Comedian Noam Shuster Eliassi tackles a well-examined and comedic take on the Israel vs. Palestine situation presented throughout this documentary with both humorous, serious, and emotional backdrops of it's nature. Using both personal footage and live footage at her comedy show, it blends pretty well with what Eliassi is wanting to explore and discuss. Discussing both about the culture, religion and issues between Israel and Palestine, and offers a female perspective of how they feel and what they feel about the event.I kind of wish it is a bit more balanced on certain aspects but it's solid.",False
2,n/a,Stunningly personal and powerful,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is why I love documentaries. With a film like this you just jump right in to somebody's life and authentic lived experience. What's deceiving is that the filmmakers put you in such a close position right inside the emotional action that you forget you're not actually in the room or in Noam's heart or mind. The personal is so political and this documentary makes that so clear there is no separation. BRAVA!!!!! I thought the cinematography was exquisite, patient, and yet also courageous. And the editing was almost a character in the film as we dipped in and out of really powerful intersections.",False

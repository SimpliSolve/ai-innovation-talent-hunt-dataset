1,6,Pretty boring,diggler2002,n/a,16/08/2025,Hard to believe that someone as funny as Levine can make such a boring documentary. Her podcast My Dad Wrote a Porno is hysterically funny. This is just drivel.,False
2,10,Very engaging... not what I expected,csdlogue,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no idea what to expect with this show, however have watched all now and pleasantly enjoyed.Some very complex and indeed bizarre subjects covered but was done so in both a very delicate and informative way... whilst maintaining a good level of humour.Alice is very clearly has some kind of gift at getting people to lower theie barriers early on and connect with them, but whilst also keeping a good professional distance. Amazing interview technique not often seen. She was the perfect vehicle for this show as got the balance of humour and respectful just right.mWould watch more of these, or indeed similar series where complex matters are explored by Alice.",False
3,10,Brilliant documentary.,speedisabadfilm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think this is one of the best documentaries I have watched - Levine delivers an amazing balance of humor and respect that comes with naivety. I am familiar with Levine as part of the My Dad Wrote a Porno podcast - with that in mind, I think she was a perfect fit for this, she comes into it with some knowledge of what everything is and 'odd' proclivities of the sexual kind, but she's not all-knowing which is brilliant for a viewer who knows very little (which I, personally, am already in some of the lifestyles detailed within). It allows her to both break tension and inform the viewer without leaning two heavy on one or the other.There is a good amount of people interviewed with massively varied lives in this world of sex. My only complaint is I would have liked to hear about a wider ranger of people and how they interact with the scenes and lifestyles, but the series is not lacking for not including this - it just would have been a nice addition.I really, really hope more of this gets made at some point, exploring more and more sections of these communities. It's a real breath of fresh air to see these people with these interests get treated like human beings rather than comedy fodder.Definitely worth your time.",False

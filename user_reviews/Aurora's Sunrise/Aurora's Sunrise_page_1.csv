1,10,Amazing film!!!,marieek-54773,n/a,16/08/2025,This film is truly a life changing event for all viewers! I am suprised that people from turkey are commenting as this film never premiered there so the comments are clearly false. Sad to see false comments to push hateful agendas. Please watch for yourself I watched with my family and could not stop crying at the amazing story line! We'll done to the Armenian community for showing this film the power. The actors and actresses do a terrific job and were able to bring the main characters to life. I cannot explain how amazing the film is!! Again do not read the false hateful comments from people who have been conditioned to hate people they do not know and a film they never watched!! Watch it YOU WILL LOVE IT!!,False
2,10,Amazing art film,sooze23,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing realality. Astonishing, spellbinding. Why was this brutal history left out? I had no idea that this genocide of Armenians happened. The artwork was so beautiful, so lifelike. Wonderful animation. Everyone should see this film. You will be so grateful to be American. I don't know what else to write. If l say anything more it will be spoiling the ending. I'm going to post it on Facebook because it's such an important film that everyone should see. I cannot understand why this was not mentioned in history books and in school. We all knew about the Jews, but not the Armenians. Watch it with your loved ones. Parental discretion is advised.",False
3,10,"Amazing, heartbreaking and inspiring",pianoartcookie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAurora's Sunrise is such a beautiful, masterful film that puts you through the horrors of 1915 and showcases the incredible bravery of Aurora Mardiganian. It is a seminal film to watch both as an Armenian and as any person, at all. It's an incredibly human film.The 1915 events are harrowing, but not unique. We must educate ourselves and learn from history, we must forgive but never forget. Time and time again we see genocide after genocide. History repeats itself, even in the current day where we'd like to think we've grown enough as a society to stop these crimes.If we hear the stories of those from the past, maybe we can learn to hear those now.",True
4,10,The best book,maryannparonian,n/a,16/08/2025,This book is one of the greatest. It shows a true perspective on what actually happened to our Armenia and doesn't cover anything up. Some people have been taught with lies about what happened but if they read this they will know what actually happened so they can learn the truth and understand how most Armenians felt at that time. If you live anywhere but Armenia you should read this book to help educate yourself on what happened because soon you may not be able too. I loved reading this book and and trying to feel and understand what this poor girl had to go through just so that she can be free.,False

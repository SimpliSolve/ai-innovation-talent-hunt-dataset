8,10,Would give more stars if I could,jackquelynloubriel,n/a,16/08/2025,"The real, raw experiences and vulnerability shown here by not only Boome, but his peers and family makes this feature so enjoyable to watch and learn his story. The guerilla-styled documentation of the otherwise left-unseen hustle between the shows and spotlight is pieced together perfectly. I was already crying halfway through! Definitely an emotional ride of real struggles and strife, all while never using those obstacles as an excuse or a crutch when leading toward success, but fueled it instead. So glad this was created and we will cherish Boome's legacy!",False

10,10,"Inspirational story about a Rapper, Father, Brother following his passions",qccjfwqwk,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary really hit home. If you've been following Boome for a while you know how passionate he is about the music he makes and the message he wants to put out to the world. However, this documentary follows his journey on how he became who he is today, who inspires him, and who made him the man he is. There are so many quotable moments in this doc and the vulnerability Boome shows is very pure. I'm glad to have watched this and learn more about him, and I respect his artistry ten fold.",False

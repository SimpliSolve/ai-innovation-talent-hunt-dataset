1,9,Very promising,fireangel-80711,n/a,16/08/2025,Sam and Graham have a fun and witty banter throughout the show. The scenery is beautiful and Sam seems to be narrating throughout the episode. It's definitely nice to see your favorite characters from the beloved outlander series as them self and not portraying a character. I think the show has a potential to be very Entertaining. I enjoyed the first episode very much and will tune into see the next episode.,False
2,9,Worth it,jdowdell76,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never watched Outlander so I'm not too familiar with these actors, but I found this delightful. They have good chemistry and have made an enjoyable show.",False
3,9,My only complaint is,amybourque,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe show is just too short!! I want longer episodes! The scenery is beautiful Scotland was supposed to be my first trip abroad for my 45th birthday this year, maybe I can make it for 50. This show will definitely give me more ideas for when I finally get there.
I do hope that future episodes will go more into the subjects we are just getting a taste of. I had to google things, I had no idea what a langoustine was. I loved the teaching scene on the pete bog.
I do hope that we get more information for Sam and Graham. Sam mentioned that he spent early years in Edinburgh. It would be nice to have a hometown tour from where both men grew up, maybe with some insider information. And I can't wait until the dancing episode. I love to watch Graham dance. (If you have never seen it, google it!)
Ok, two complaints then... longer episodes and too long of a wait in between! I want to see it all NOW!",True
4,10,I'm in love,brendamaille,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love, love, love Men in Kilts, Sam Heughan and Graham McTavish. Full disclosure...I am a huge Outlander fan, but even if you have never seen Outlander, you will still be entertained and you may just find Outlander will be your next binge. I had high expectations for this show and episode 1 surpassed my expectations. Sam and Graham ooze charm, humor and good looks. Their banter is so entertaining and funny. They have it all. The third star of the show is Scotland in all its beauty and majesty. The Scots whom they encounter along the way in episode one are enthusiastic and dedicated to their craft and seem amused and bemused by Sam and Graham. The 30 minutes flew by and I can't wait to see the remaining episodes. Slainte Mahth!",False
5,10,Love watching the friendship while learning,leah_65,n/a,16/08/2025,Sam and Graham were great on the show with such a good friendship. It was funny and u learned different things about Scotland. I enjoyed the different hosts and when Sam lost his bet and ran naked into the water. I liked the funny part where they jumped into the barley. They were just fun to watch and talked about Outlander which I love.,False
6,10,Excellent series but made for the American viewer I'd say..,scotsdavy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent series but think it's really made for Americans to watch. We can't get it here in Scotland which is weird seeing as it's all about the clans, people and scenery etc. Not enough time is spent wherever they go, just a snippet here and there. That said, worth a watch and 10 out of 10 from me.",False
7,10,"Fun, just Fun. We need this Fun!",skc-17400,n/a,16/08/2025,"I normally don't enjoy docu/travel/road trip shows because they drone on too long. What makes this one fun is the short snippets that are just right for me. Beautiful landscapes, interesting colorful places. Narration is nice. Banter is funny, silly, awkward at times, but all just fun. Like a breath of fresh air, relief from all the other angry, sad, downer programing around. Netflix take notice!",False
8,10,What a GEM,whytevs,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is possibly the best travel show I have seen. Sam and Graham are so in sync with each other and their dialogue is full of wit and banter. They are competitive, funny, charming and it's obvious that they have a special friendship. I have a big happy grin on my face from beginning to end. The 30 minutes flies by and it is a real shame the episodes are not longer. It's a quality production with breathtaking cinematography and showcases Scotland so well. I cannot get enough of their wonderful antics.",False
9,10,Refreshing and Fun!,chelansite,n/a,16/08/2025,"During this pandemic there has been very little to enjoy and to look forward to. Men in Kilts has changed that! Sam and Graham have teased us with trailers and messages for months about their upcoming journey, and now we get to experience it in its full glory (well, in half hour increments).The first episode is a basically a love affair with Scottish seafood and whisky! We learn about peat, which I found fascinating. We watched Sam and Graham appear in many different outfits (I think I will start counting how many times they change clothing) and tease each other like best buddies do. It is fun to see how much they enjoy each others company. They tell great stories and are the best of friends despite the 20 year age difference.I look forward to watching all eight episodes and planning my trip to bonny Scotland!",False
10,7,"I really enjoy these two gentlemen, but...",equipagekm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Okay, I'm fairly obsessed with Outlander and have been since it's debut in 2014. When what started out to be a proposed podcast by Sam Heughan evolved into a road trip with Sam and Graham filmed for a series I just loved the idea. But after viewing episode1, I'm afraid I was fairly disappointed. It felt as though they try to have too many venues in one episode and rush through those venues too quickly. And the banter if scripted wasn't particularly well written, but if ""off the cuff"" felt almost forced and uncomfortably so at times; like ""hey, we'd better have some clever, witty banter between us because we're great mates"". As much as I love Outlander, when there is only 30 minutes to cram so many locations into those 30 minutes I don't feel clips from Outlander was necessary. Listen, no one is more surprised at this review than me, but it's what I went away with. Here's hoping the next 3 1/2 hours are time better spent. My fingers are crossed!**Five episodes in now, and still feel pretty much the same. This show isn't horrible, by any stretch of the imagination. I'm just disappointed, and for all the reasons stated above after E1, as the episodic formula has remained the same.",False
11,10,Production of Men in Kilts is Top Level!,schmidtcarole,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew it must be good considering how much Sony/Starz was willing to spend on advertising this show. They knew it was ""gold"". I expected Sam and Graham to be marvelous, witty, charming, smirky and we got all of that and then some. What I wasn't expecting was the high production of this show. It was TOP LEVEL! Brilliant and Award worthy! Kudos to everyone involved! Can't wait to see the next installments!",False
12,7,Like the Idea**********But,lindaclark-898-902009,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like the actors and the idea but the stops are rushed. In the first episode the fishing and dining experiences could have been so much longer. I don't care for the van chit chat as it seems forced. Just the facts boys!! Fill out the subjects and it will be great. Just did my ancestry and have quite a bit of Scottish blood so I'm enjoying it. Great scenery and historical places, just ,too short.",False
13,5,Underwhelming,markstevenson-92860,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTwo episodes available and disappointed so far. So much potential to showcase a charming country, spectacular scenery and a couple of charismatic actors. But the locations are rushed, the banter is forced and the whole thing comes up short.There are some spectacular images but could be far more time spent just taking in the unparalleled beauty. The banter between the two has its moments but it doesn't come across as natural. And it seems they cut down the locations to the bare minimum.A stop in Edinburgh is a one course meal in one restaurant. A distillery tour is a quick visit in a peat bog and mainly them laying down in barley. The two have manly ""competitions"" that are just... underwhelming.Hopefully they eventually hit their stride, but so far this is only for the most devoted Outlander fans, and even then you've likely got better options.",True
14,10,Entertaining!,loristeranko,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you've ever wondered about the beauty of Scotland but was put off by dull other travel shows, this one gives you knowledge, laughter, and history all rolled up on a thirty minute trip in a RV camper van with the stars of Outlander: Sam Heughan and Graham McTavish. 8 episodes categorized for each segment is just fun to watch and as for Sam and Graham they have a good time picking on each other with silliness that it is hard not to laugh at. I Thoroughly enjoyed this series and am hoping for another season (s) to come! üòÄüëçüèºüëèüèº",False
15,10,Amazingly entertaining,Siddhartha14,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is interesting and very engaging. The personalities of the stars are really on display. Some parts appeared to be fairly ""scripted"" but mostly it just looks like they are having a lot of fun. We learn a lot about Scotland too, which is a bonus! Highly enjoyable!",False
16,9,Excellent,macbell2012,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having watched only 3 episodes, this series is excellent.
I am sure both Sam and Graham could continue on with more seasons!",False
17,10,Absolutely brilliant show!!!,laub-27733,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm an avid Outlander fan, and could not wait for Men in Kilts! It was everything I hoped it would be! Funny, sweet, educational, beautiful! Only complaint is they need episodes to be an hour, in order to fully appreciate all the detail!!! I cant wait for more!!! And I cant wait to get back to Scotland, again. What a country!!!",False
18,10,My idea of a road trip!,teresaholm-27176,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sam, Graham and Scotland as we've never seen them before. Stunning scenery, tidbits of historical facts and traditions have you wanting to make Scotland your next travel destination. The camaraderie and banter between Sam and Graham add a touch of fun to this half hour docu travel series. Certainly worth a watch.",False
19,10,This Is A Great Documentary To See,santurcedc,n/a,16/08/2025,Watching this 30 minute series was an escape for me. The country of Scotland is so beautiful and I wish I could live there away from the crime and confusion in the United States. The seafood shown looked to be very delicious. Sam and Graham have a great chemistry on screen in Outlander and off screen.It was like seeing father and son hanging out having a great time. I look forward in seeing the remaining episodes.,False
20,7,Better than the book,ranchofiesta,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery rarely does anyone prefer the ""TV show"" over the book, but in this case it's a ""yes"" for TV.
Considering it started out to be a podcast, changed to a book (which I must admit they got it written, edited, and printed in what felt like record time!) then they shopped it to Starz, which everyone knew Starz would jump on!
My first impression, episode 101 is ""What? 30 minutes? The episode is only 30 minutes??"" Then I watched it. Very enjoyable, nice to see Sam tends to drop into a Scots accent after so long in London. Probably a bit of mimic, but lovely to hear nonetheless. Of course beautiful scenery of Scotland. I could almost smell the food, the peat, the sea.
It left me wishing they'd put more than 3 minutes in at the restaurant, it just seemed rude to rush through - I'd have enjoyed hearing and see more from the Chef. Outside-seaside cooking needed more too. More in the distilleries. Just more.
Will I be waiting excitedly for next week's episode? Probably not, but I'll watch it if I happen across it. I do enjoy Sam and Graham together but I hope it doesn't turn into caricature any more than it already has.",True
21,8,Fabulous!,NikkiFromSiberia,n/a,16/08/2025,So much more than a travel show and it perfectly shows off beautiful Scotland. The episodes are short but zesty and the duo is quite dynamic and funny.Hope we get a second season!,False
22,6,Sometimes entertaining and informative but too superficial,dave-benson53,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHaving read the book and enjoyed our two tours of Scotland, I was really looking forward to this series. The first four episodes have been entertaining and I'm enjoying the banter between the two even if it seems a bit forced and scripted sometimes. The specific sequences focusing on food, the distillery, music, and the ""supernatural"" were informative and influence me to want to go back to Scotland yet again.However, I'm finding the presentation in general to be too rushed and superficial. Each episode should really be an hour long and go into more depth, particularly with regard to the locale of each of the sequences. Given how wonderful the cities and landscapes of Scotland are, it would have been much more fulfilling if, for example, they spent time exploring more of Edinburgh in depth in the episodes in which they visit the city for food tasting and visiting the Greyfriars cemetery.I will continue to watch the remaining episodes, and encourage anyone who has not visited Scotland to do the same, but I am hoping that they will spend more time exploring and showcasing the amazing scenery and landscapes of Scotland to the same extent that they focus on the culture and the cute banter between the two.",True
23,5,"Not In My Wheelhouse - Unscipted, Awkward and Uneventful",mha-NewZealand,n/a,16/08/2025,"While, without doubt, these two men, through their various portrayls in 'Outlander' the TV series, have impressed and compelled in their excellent dramatic deliveries on-screen; reality TV-wise, their characters, for me, just do not translate or resonate.Again, from my own personal preference, whatching people consume Scotish quisine is not entertaining, and nor is conducting awkward interviews. Equally, I did not find their often ill-timed and apparently unscriped banter either entertaining or engaging. In full disclosure, I could only whatch the first episode. Perhaps, later in the series something changes. Not recommended. However, from what I can see I am deeply in the minority. Many viewers seem entirely compelled by this production, just not me.",False
24,10,Just great,markbowden-60259,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched the last episode, and all can say is brilliant, my ancestry is also Scottish, so the show was even more special for me. I hope it returns soon, a show with history, humor, and class is a winner, Sam and graham are like fish & chips, they just belong together. Well done.",False
25,10,Loved it!,carolehnelson,n/a,16/08/2025,This show has beautiful scenery and the camaraderie between Sam & Graham is so much fun to watch & listen to. Love the accents too. You will find yourself enjoying it & smiling. I can't wait for episode 2!,False

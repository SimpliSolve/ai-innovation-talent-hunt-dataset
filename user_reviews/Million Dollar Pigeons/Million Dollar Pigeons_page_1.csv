1,8,Oh yes...,philip-00197,n/a,17/08/2025,"Million Dollar Pigeons is not only what it says on the box - it's contents are well blended and cover, just about, every aspect a novice on the subject may require. We are provided; a glimpse into the ""sport"", the different motivations that drives the various practitioners and behind the scene footage of various profiteers.On the whole Fitzgerald has hit the documentary sweet spot; in a neat little package he has managed to convey a feeling for what his subject ""is all about"". If all documentaries were this well structured there would be a lot to learn in a short space of time.Even the dramaturgy is pretty decent - arguably ""anything pigeon"" couldn't have been made any more exciting or interesting - especially for someone starting out with no knowledge and little interest in the subject.",False
2,9,"Pigeons, pigeons, pigeons!",tordseriksson,n/a,17/08/2025,"Like many good stories does this fantastic documentary tell an amazing yarn, but this time based on a true story.But this is about pigeon racing and how it became a multi-million dollar industry, and how the biggest race collapsed and the founder's charming widow disappeared with all the millions.I have no insight in pigeon racing, more than a visit to a pigeon racing club as a school kid,But it is an expertly told yarn, and it takes us from Irish amateurs, via American and South-African pro breeders, to the big event in South Africa, where things develop into a sad farce, where everyone seems to loose all their money invested, and the lady mentioned above, disappears, with all the money. Just like that, after having been involved in building the gigantic race together with her husband, that passed away some years back.Smells like a Ponsi Scheme from here to Kindom Come, but was it?!The director doesn't tell, but in the end we learn that a single pigeon has been sold on an auction for over $2,000,000!And similar races are now held in Thailand!",False

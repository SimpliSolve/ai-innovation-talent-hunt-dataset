1,1,Why? Nothing new,greatphildead-56265,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing new just the same information.It's a horrible tragedy, but whats really a tragedy is all rhe unanswered questions. What is there to hide? Without the transparency one has to think it was some sort of false flag. Im just saying if you've really looked at everything that happened, so ething smells rotten in Denmark. And it's the day the USA started it's downfall with the patriot act and homeland security powers.It's really crazy, wonder if we will ever truly know what really happened. Im not a crazy tin foil hat person but after you watch all the docs from all different angles something isn't right.",False
2,9,Boring mashup,imdbfan-9368141582,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is not new. It is a Frankenstein of other, better documentaries. It is ai narrated and even gets timing and facts incorrect. Like showing Kevin Cosgrove's final call as the north tower fell but he was actually in the South tower. Even the narrators script is just chopped up parts of there films or series.I didn't expect to learn anything new from this documentary but I didn't expect to see such a blatant instance of poorly executed plagiarism.It also felt very cold and emotionless l. There was clearly no heart behind this project it was just made as an easy way to get views on a subject that still interests people without having to do any actual work. There is not a single piece of new footage or information for something that claims to talk about the people effected after the attacks. There are no recent interviews or updatesThey also make zero mention of flight 77, the Pentagon, or the heros of flight 93 which in my opinion are just as important parts of ""the day the world stood still"" as what took place in new York.Recycling is great for the environment but not so much for a documentary.",False
3,9,The day that changed America forever,PreciousHuddle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once in a while that 9/11 documentary that comes out painfully but always with respect reminds all of us, even if some of us hadn't been born yet, the tragic events that led, took place and affected, especially in the US, many American families that still to this day mourn their loved ones over this horrific event.The documentary narrates the events that slowly unwound the terrifying last moments of the existence of the famous twin towers, a landmark but also a symbol of power and resilience of the Unites States America.Footage that many have seen before as well as some unseen footage is present throughout some parts of the documentary.No matter how many times one sees a documentary or even footage of this significance on sites such as you tube, no one can truly fathom nor comprehend such tragedy and horror.Documentaries not only should inform, with respect, dignity and truth, but also make its viewers aware of the facts and events that preceded that horrible day of that dreadful but also calm and sunny, 11th of September, 2001.",False

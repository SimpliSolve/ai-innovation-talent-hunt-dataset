1,2,Could've been picturesque...,salman-98129,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerIt was perfectly going on until they started mentioning her exes. The visuals are okay to begin with but they have constantly dragged some moments until it feels like it is a school assignment assigned to an amateur to make a mini documentary on your favourite pop star. The narrator is very clear and coherent while speaking and she is perhaps the only the good thing you can jott down if asked to what you liked most in this bland documentary. They forgot to include her MTV's moments for which she won tons of awards for Midnights. The Grammy's Nominations? The Billionaire Status? Her Business Tactics? And yeah where's Speak Now Taylor's Version? They are missing out on a lot of events.,True

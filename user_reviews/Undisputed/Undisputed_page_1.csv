1,10,The biggest fight of this century!,DeepBalboa,n/a,15/08/2025,An incredible hour long documentary describing the biggest boxing fight of the century between the two best heavyweights to crown the greatest prize in the sport - the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world and the baddest man on the planet.The documentary shows the 12 rounds of action split into sections with footage leading up to the fight itself. The last two sections from round 8 onwards is absolutely gripping and I was in tears at the end of it when the winner is announced.Special shout out to Teddy Atlas in the way he describes the greatest fighter of our generation - Oleksandr Usk who will defy the odds once again because he just knows how to win.,False

1,8,"I don't like this! I defeated the Dark Lord, isn't that enough?",TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis consists of interviews(new and old) with the cast and crew, all of whom have something compelling to add within their area of expertise(and there is a very clear love of what they're working on), clips from the subject, behind-the-scenes footage, and incomplete effects shots.It's 126 minutes(or just over 2 hours) long, the last two being end credits but with footage over it. This is found on Disney Plus, as an extra for The Rise of Skywalker. It spoils a lot of the title, and so will this review, so that I can go into more detailThey talk about the magic of the franchise. Completing the third trilogy. Expectations. Everyone's jobs. Making it Leia's story. Using the footage they had from Awakens. Being respectful. Building it around Fisher(RIP), and remembering her. The training where Lourd plays her real-life mother. Martial arts. Choreography. The intense Eunice Huthart. Examining the evil that we humans can engage in. The Emperor. Fixing the helmet. Sally Guiness. Richard E. Grant. Domhnall Gleeson. Screwing up takes because of dialog. Threepio getting a better role. The massive celebration. Aki-Akis. How to work in a desert. Explosions. The sinking sand. Giant snake. The Force Dyad. Shooting practical, instead of on a green screen. Emotionally straining material. The duel in Kijimi. Zori, and her shared past. John Williams, his talent and humility. Babu Frik, the puppeteering, voice. Bugs. Setting scenes in the aftermath of the OT. Struggling with the blade. Creating a sound design fit for a creepy haunted house. Figuring out how the throne room collapsed. Rey's past revealed. The spraying of water. Han appearing. Raising the X-Wing out of the water, to bring things full circle. Poe taking over. The spiky shadow. Ben Solo. Sliding off the Star Destroyers. The horses. Putting a camera on the wing. Denis Lawson. How bittersweet it is that it's over. Cycles. Handing on legacy.I recommend this to any fan of the property. 8/10.",True
2,8,Very insightful well made documentary,Jguy10,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very well made documentary highlighting the making of Star Wars. As a filmmaker myself, I found it very interesting",False
3,8,emotional for being a close,HERMANO_MANSON_DIXIT,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary that portrays the process of creating Star Wars: Skywalker's Rise and since it is the last film in the series there is also a combination of scenes and interviews from the original series.
Originally it appeared as extra material from the home edition of the film, it shows all the behind the scenes of the filming, better known as backstage, with the main emphasis being on the entire technical team, on all facets of production, be it design, construction, effects or even the overwhelming amount of extras from some scenes.
It is interesting because we can see details that watching the film of course escape us, such as the scene in which John Williams appears, all the objects that surround him represent some of the 52 films for which he was nominated for an Oscar or that one of the Extras as a First Order officer is Sir Alec Guinson's granddaughter, the original Kenobi.
Beyond tastes or grudges for characters or the evolution of history, it is a must for any fan of the saga.",False
4,6,Decent enough documentary,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"There was a feature length documentary made for each Star Wars film in the most recent trilogy. Funnily enough, the better/more interesting the film, the better the making of documentary. The Last Jedi had the best, having a more personal and emotional focus on director Rian Johnson, while Force Awakens and now Rise of Skywalker have solid but far more traditional documentary features.This documentary is probably a more engaging watch than the uneven and ultimately disappointing Episode 9. It's strange to see all this work and passion go into a movie that ended up feeling soulless, but if there's a problem with the writing of the film (as well as unforeseen things like Carrie Fisher passing away before she could film anything for the final episode) then maybe it isn't as surprising.So no matter what, showing behind the scenes footage and detailed work that went into this film doesn't really make me like the film itself more, but I do respect and now admire a lot of the work put into things that you might not consciously notice, like background extras and detailed costumes and special effects that might only be on screen for a second.Seeing that technical work behind the scenes was fun. Hearing some of the filmmakers and actors talk about the story and how ""emotional"" it was is less compelling, because I don't feel as strongly as they do (or as strongly as they seem to- cynical as I am, I suspect this is all a bit sanitised, and not quite as personal or intimate as that aforementioned Last Jedi documentary).",False
5,2,Unbearable.,klaushutchinson,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you thought the final film was terrible, well they've gone one step further with this documentary. Even the unseen footage from the original films can't save this drawn out piece of nausea.",False
6,1,Insult to injury,mgstewart-18138,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow! That was physically painful to sit through! Talk about taking a dump on someone's face and telling them its chocolate!! The extent of Darth Kennedys delusional fantasy is on full display here. This ""documentary"" contains more fiction, and demonstrates more imagination, than the last three episodes of the star wars franchise combined! Ignoring all evidence to the contrary, this film (unsuccessfully) attempts to convince, anyone, including what remains of the diehard fans, that ""rise of skywalker"" (ah!Palpatine!hem!) wasn't the excrement fulled dumpster fire, which it so clearly was. Watch this borderline mocumentary if you feel like being lied to and patronised.",False

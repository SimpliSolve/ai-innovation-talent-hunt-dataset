1,6,The Octopus Recipe Didn't Work,zozocam,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, this story does not justify its 88-minute runtime, sorry. There's simply not that much content in it, at least in this form. It could easily have been told in a ca. 40 minutes and would have made a great short doc.The pangolin, while undeniably adorable, has limited behaviors and therefore limited filming possibilities - although the cinematography is superb. But after a while, it feels like you're watching the same happenings and same shots on repeat.The human character is a kind and nice person, but not particularly charismatic or compelling. I felt that almost any of the other people involved in the rewilding effort could have made for a more engaging protagonist.It feels like the creators tried to follow a similar formula to My Octopus Teacher, though with a different narrative, but this time it just didn't work. Especially not at this length.",False
2,10,Magnificent documentary,imdbfan-45476,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Kulu's Journey"" so beautifully captures the relationship between a pangolin and his human caretaker.In many ways, this documentary is a tribute to the unsung heroes on the frontlines of wildlife conservation around the world - sacrificing their time, relationships and worldly possessions for the animals they care so deeply for.Without people like Gareth Thomas, pangolins will be reduced to nothing more than stories of a bygone era. It's thanks to volunteers and conservationists alike that we are able to share our planet with such incredible species.A must watch, and another stellar documentary produced by Pippa Ehrlich and her team.",False
3,10,I needed this.,XmarxM,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't tear up until David lifted Kulu at the end-now my eyes are swollen and my heart feels so full. Seeing him feed this tiny, trembling pangolin, whispering to her with that gentle kindness, I felt something crack open inside me. There's no heavy-handed lecture-just pure, vulnerable moments that make you want to stand up for these creatures. Pippa Greenwood has a gift for letting feelings breathe. I keep replaying that final scene in my head. It's rare to feel this small and hopeful at once. I'm still crying days later. I can't shake its gentle power. It left a permanent mark on my soul. .",False
4,10,Absolutely loved it!,justindedeugd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this. It touched me deeply and left a lasting impression. Pangolins are such gentle, innocent animals - there's something so pure about them. Watching this made me realize how vulnerable they are and how much they need our protection.The whole experience felt intimate and real. It wasn't just a documentary - it was emotional, beautiful, and meaningful. I could feel the love and care behind every scene, and it really pulled me in. I found myself completely absorbed from start to finish.Honestly, I could watch a whole series like this. I'd love to see more stories about pangolins being rescued, healed, and released. These kinds of films are so important, not just to raise awareness but because they remind us of the quiet beauty of nature and the power of compassion.So grateful I watched this. It stays with you - highly recommend it.",False
5,10,Life changing story for Gareth and the Pangolin!,andrewg-36210,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic story of a selfless person giving everything to help another harmless species suffering at the hand of the human race, and the pangolin in return providing the guiding star during a time of need back to Gareth.The cinematography was brilliant, showing scenes of untouched nature in the beautiful landscapes of South Africa, very impressive lightning and thunder storms, and some what seems to be crazy nights spent under the stars in a world of predators.It was really well portrayed, directed, and edited throughout providing a thorough, emotional, and gripping story from start to finish.",False
6,10,"most are endangered, glad people care",saamikans32,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many rare animals have been poached and killed for their body parts for 'traditional medicine' (said 'medicine' loosely) or sold as exotic pets. SO cruel.I am thankful there are those kind humans and scientists and government officials out to stop poachers and this horrendous trade. All pangolins are vulnerable to critically endangered on all land masses. I hope these efforts are successful, and make people realize how important our living records of ancient life are, like these pangolins.Thank you for making such an informative and natural documentary about an amazing animal, and the amazing people trying to protect them.",False
7,4,My Pangolin Teacher,edwin-wks,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Joburg man describes himself as a hyperactive child and has always doubted whether he's good enough, probably because he could never sit still and couldn't make it through high school. He then spends his youth in motor racing and partying, leading a life of debauchery and lack of consequences. That is until two of his friends die in an accident, causing him to take stock of his own life and wondering the meaning of it. Here in the making of this documentary, he finds his purpose looking after a juvenile pangolin, initially named Gijima, then renamed by him as Kulu, because why not.The precious pangolin cannot express its consent to anything that it will be subjected to for the sake of this documentary and its storytelling, which chooses to focus on the handler's supposed redemption, rather than the terrible plight of pangolins in the poaching world. Isn't it curious that the most vulnerable pangolin in the program's care, Gijima, was placed in the hands of the most inexperienced handler, Gareth? It is clearly nothing more than a plot device to raise the stakes for Gareth - will he succeed or will he prove a failure yet again? How nail-biting.Just like in My Octopus Teacher, this documentary prioritises the human element over the animal subject. It comes across as the pangolin having been twice exploited; the first time by poachers, torn away from its mother, only to be rescued and cast in a supporting role to humans who are seeking purpose, recognition and perhaps a second Oscar win for Best Documentary. What's more on the cards is a diagnosis of ADHD for Gareth. Unfortunately, he doesn't make a compelling protagonist and his personal history feels intentionally vague, so I was unable to invest in his story. Save for cute shots of Gijima, I was thoroughly bored.",False
8,10,The Documentary That Touched My Soul,SafiyeH,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't find the words to describe this documentary-it's that good. It pierces right through your heart. The scene where the pangolin is rescued from underground is especially powerful, evoking an overwhelming rush of emotion. I remember feeling something very similar while watching My Octopus Teacher.This is one of the most touching documentaries I've ever seen about the unspoken bond between a human and an animal-a connection that needs no words to be deeply felt.Endless thanks to the director and everyone involved in bringing this story to life, and for showing us just how unique and precious the pangolin truly is.",True
9,10,A truly beautiful and moving documentary,MrF-42,n/a,16/08/2025,"I truly loved this documentrary. Reading through some of the more negative reviews on here, I feel like a lot of folks have overlooked some key points the film was trying to make about the difficulties of the rewilding process. I think that those who feel that the Pangolin's walker, Gareth, was being too hands on or cuddling the Pangolin too much need to also take into account that the Pangolin was literally just a baby when it was rescued from the illegal wildlife trade and needed to, not only gain the weight to help him survive the wild before release, but, also, needed to learn the skills that would help protect him from future predators. A baby pangolin needs 24/7 round the clock care. I can't imagine that a total lack of nurturing would have benefited the Pangolin. Kulu also needed to have a certain amount of familiarity with Gareth as he was taking Kulu out on the reserve every day for months to forage and learn to be wild again. In the film Kulu was shown to often be making a run for it, so I never got the sense that he was being conditioned to "" not be afraid"" of humans. I think that it must have been difficult to give Kulu the space he needed to learn how to be wild, while at the same time helping him avoid the electric fences and other dangers. The rewilding process here was not at all a simple or straightforward feat, and I feel the film did a good job of explaining this. ""There was a fear of failure"". They were open about the fact that there were learning curves, but their previous, less hands-on attempts to rewild the Pangolins had been failing and they needed to change their approach. I was personally fine with the amount of screentime and backstory that Gareth had in the film, and enjoyed his narration and his commentary that Kulu helped him change the way he saw the world was moving. He volunteered over a year of his life for Kulu's rewilding, and is now working on projects to modify electric fences to help further save Pangolins. I enjoyed hearing a little bit about the people who are helping these beautiful creatures. I loved this documentary and can't wait for Pippa Ehrlich's next one!",False
10,n/a,Amazing little 85 million year old dinosaur cousin,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"My cat Angela & I are obsessed with this Netflix documentary.These amazing little creatures have been here for 85 million years. They evolved with the dinosaurs. But Chinese poachers are capturing them, killing them for traditional medical treatment. Unless drastic measures are taken, these innocent, perfect ""unicorns"" will be extinct within 2-3 decades.But don't think it's all fear & negative predictions. They are establishing a rehab for them in Africa & it tells the story of the man who hand raised this precious Pangolin. I really hope as many of you will watch this & spread the word so these ancient ones won't disappear.Thank you & my cat thanks you too. She is glued to the screen every time we watch it. This is a worthy cause to support.",False
11,10,Blurring the Lines Between Belief and Disbelief!,Adhogati,n/a,16/08/2025,"What makes this a captivating, magnificient watch is one part direction, one part visuals, and eight parts Anne Nikitin.As much as the documentary moved me, it was due greatly in part to the earthly, seismic, tectonic, and elemental soundtrack.Merging deep bass with the rumbles of thunder, soothingly seguing into the sound of rain against the backdrop of soulful ululations of Venda folk songs, the music transports you into a world of goosebumps.For the purists, this might not be a documentary, but then, does it really matter? The film brings to light the plight of one of the rarest, most reclusive, most ancient of mammals to still roam the earth.I would much rather call a movie, but that would be doing it a disservice. I would call it a documentary, and that would be a stretch.What it can, however, be called is a love letter. A love letter to nature. A billet doux to the underdog. A liebesbrief to one of the geekiest, quiestest, and unassuming of mammals.Watch it, and make everyone around you watch it!",False
12,3,Not What I Expected,JC-4455,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI admit I knew nothing about pangolins before watching this film, and expected to learn a lot about them. But the pangolin was almost secondary to the character of the man who was caring for it.What concerned me even more, being a wildlife rehabber myself, is the caretaker did not treat the pangolin like a wild animal. But instead was constantly coddling it as if it were a pet cat. Bringing it inside a building at night, following it around everywhere, petting it, picking it up. This seems like a death sentence for the pangolin. This animal needs to fear humans, not think they are his friend. This animal is not a pet. It is supposed to be wild. This caretaker was not trained on the basics of rehabilitating wild animals. It is imperative to keep them wild and make them afraid of humans. Especially in this case where poachers are causing the demise of this species. Honestly it made me really mad. I felt that the caregiver was better suited working for a cat or dog rescue organization, and the woman supervising him did not seem much better. I hope and pray these pangolins truly are being given a second chance and I'm misinterpreting this, but as a rehabber it seemed like they were doing so many things wrong.",True
13,1,Not Really About the Pangolin,CurtisB-9,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who loves pangolins, I had high hopes, but this documentary misses the mark in a fundamental way.Wildlife documentaries usually succeed because of their unpredictability. Crews follow wild animals for years, capturing whatever unfolds. But here, everything feels pre-planned. You can tell that the paperwork, budgets, and professional film gear were all in place before the story began and only then, conveniently, the human protagonist ""falls in love"" with a pangolin as is required. It doesn't feel like an honest story, it feels like one manufactured.My Octopus Teacher was, as the name suggested, about a person's experiences with an octopus. Despite being presented as Kulu's story, this is really about the person caring for him. And that's a problem in a genre where authenticity is everything. The pangolin ends up feeling like a storytelling device rather than the true subject.And in that case, they could've chosen a more likeable lead. Instead, we end up with arguably the most annoying voice I've heard which would otherwise be fine, if he wasn't narrating the entire thing.Yes, kudos to Netflix for raising awareness about pangolins. But when you watch this with a critical eye, it comes off as scripted, and honestly, a bit cringeworthy. Pangolins deserve better.A more accurate title? Pangolin: Kulu's Handler's Journey.",False
14,1,What did I just watch?,MaryL-643,n/a,16/08/2025,"Over an hour of my life I won't get back. Absolute waste of a potentially good documentary, although the pangolin is quite adorable - there are far too many contradictions throughout this doccie if you pay attention. An odd main character who made it all about him and essentially using Kulu to feel better about himself, way too many scenes in between that have no correlation to the pangolin. Exaggerated graphics and sound, camera angles needed work as certain scenes made me feel quesy, horrible music - besides Kulu being one of the most cutest things on the planet - an annoying experience overall!",False

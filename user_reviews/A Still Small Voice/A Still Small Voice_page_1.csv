1,7,The Voice Lingers,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival""A Still Small Voice"" is about an aspiring hospital chaplain begins a yearlong residency in spiritual care, only to discover that to successfully tend to her patients, she must look deep within herself. The film explores throughout from long takes of discussions with patients, nurses, and hospital workers as the camera observes and sits there throughout without much movement. For the most part, it remains interesting.The discussion provided by each participants feels nature and all words felt they were coming right from their heart on how they feel and what they believe in. The technical aspects were great as the camerawork and sound design offer great insights of the environment. The pacing is slow and there are moments that felt clunky and some discussion moments that did feel a little laughable.But the film does a pretty good job exploring the insight of spiritual care amongst hospital workers. Hospital workers are some of the most stressful positions in the United States and having to understand their sides and seeing what they are going through is quite interesting.Pacing needs improvement but that's about it.Rating: B+",False

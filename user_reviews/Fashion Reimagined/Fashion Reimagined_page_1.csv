1,10,"Beautiful, hopeful documentary about true meaning of sustainable fashion.",natalielederman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is beautifully shot, directed and produced, and artfully tells a story of a designer's journey in educating herself - and us - how to design at the true intersection of sustainability, education, art and passion. Inspiring without being preachy.The movie itself chronicles the journey of Amy Powney, who heads UK brand Mother of Pearl, and who - after winning Vogue's Best Young Designer of the Year - chooses to use her prize money to really test the clothing production industry and process by transforming her label and making a collection sustainably from start to finish.It has inspired me to educate myself more, consume less, and better focus on true mindfulness in my day-to-day life. Quite an impact for a little documentary film, but its impact was powerful, and should be distributed and enjoyed widely.",False
2,10,"A Must Watch Documentary that applies to ALL of human activity, not just fashion.",musicartculture,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows us - albeit the challenges - the changes that must take place in all industries - not just fashion - if we are to preserve the planet, treat nature and animals with care, respect human dignity and carry out ethically, socially, ecologically and humanely responsible businesses. The interesting aspect of the film is that the fashion industry is one of the biggest culprits of unsustainable practices in terms of its carbon footprint, use of pesticides, exploitation of labor, mistreatment of animals, among other grievances. After watching the film, you will think differently about buying clothing and know that change is possible and that you can help enable it.",False
3,10,So smart! So Chic! So Important!,ruthiewyatt-14524,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc is a MUST watch! Not only does this film provide invaluable knowledge about the harmful effects of the fashion industry on the environment, people and communities but tells the story of influential designer Amy Powney who brings such heart to a bummer subject all while designing gorgeous sustainable clothing.It's not preachy and leaves you feeling inspired rather than hopelessly shamed. Also beautifully shot and edited! Bravo to the director Becky Hutner! Show this film in schools, theaters and everywhere!",False

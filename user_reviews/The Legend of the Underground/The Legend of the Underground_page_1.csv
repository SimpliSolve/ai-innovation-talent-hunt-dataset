1,7,What's it like to live in fear in Nigeria,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Legend of the Underground"" (2021 release; 86 min.) is a documentary about what life is like for the LGTBQ+ community in Nigeria. As the movie opens, it is immediately clear that homosexuality is prohibited in Nigeria, driving gays and others in the LGTBQ+ community underground. We are introduced to Micheal, who describes his ordeal, which led him to move to the US. Now, after 7 years away, he plans a return visit to Nigeria to see for himself how things have changed (if at all)... At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.Couple of comments: this film is co-directed by Giselle Bailey and Nneka Onuorah. Equally important, the film is produced by John Legend's Get Lifted film company. To say that Nigeria is a dangerous place for the LGTBQ+ community, would be the understatement of the year. The Nigerian authorities are openly and without any shame or scruples encouraging the hunting down of anyone suspected to be ""different"", leading to senseless and shameful violence against those who are ""different"". Beware: there is shocking footage in the film of such incidents that I found difficult to stomach, which of course is the entire point of having that footage in the film. Kudos to the film makers, who clearly spent a significant amount of time ""embedded"" in the LGTBQ+ community to provide this rich yet frightening portrait.""The Legend of the Underground"" premiered earlier this week on HBO and is not available on HBO On Demand, HBO Max, Amazon Instant Video and other streaming services. The DVD/Blu-ray release will follow in due course. If you want to get a clear sense on what life is like for the LGTBQ+ in a truly homophobic county like Nigeria, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False

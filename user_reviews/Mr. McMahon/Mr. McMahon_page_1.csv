1,8,Mostly recorded in 2021,usajohncena,n/a,15/08/2025,"Big wrestling fan here, already knew most of the stories that were told, though I did learn some things I didn't know, like for example things about Vince's childhood. Thought the production was really good & watched it all in one day, but the single most important thing people need to know about this is that it was mostly recorded in 2021 which means that you have to wait until the final episode for all the recent allegations. This is why I understand why wrestling fans especially, will have maybe expected more cause they already heard many of the stories, but I still think its a good watch, not an epic watch but a good one, where you will also learn more about other wrestlers from the way they speak about Vince.",False
2,7,Take it with a pinch of salt for what it is.,willicatgirl,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary has to be viewed in the current climate that WWE & Netflix have a deal, & both have a shared interest in promoting Raw in 2025. So if you are a long-term wrestling fan, this disjointed documentary won't tell you anything new.It clearly started out life as a puff peice for WWE & Vince McMahon, who gets to talk a lot about himself while not really revealing anything much about himself. However, there are some unintentionally creepy moments in his interview that Netflix exploits to the full. The talking heads on the whole say positive things about McMahon, & even those who speak out against him feel like they've been specially selected by Vince, so that he can rebuke their comments & knock them down like skittles. Whether he does this successfully is up for debate.The documentary appears to have been shelved in 2022 when McMahon stepped down as CEO. You can almost feel the bitterness when Netflix puts up the caption that McMahon ceased all interviews at this time, leaving them high & dry. When WWE & Netflix brokered a deal for Raw, the finishing of this documentary must have been on the table as part of the deal, timed to promote the new partnership. Then the law suit happened, & what you are left with is a mess of a final episode.The last 15 years are glossed over, & if you don't know much about WWE, you are left thinking John Cena was the last big superstar. Roman Reigns is relegated to someone who just wanders around in the background & a few match clips. The second half of the episode covers the law suit, but here Netflix hands are tied. As the investigation & law suit are not concluded, & they are now linked to WWE they really can't say much. It's just a few rehashed news clips & screen shots of text messages briefly flashed on screen which leaves the last episode, & series on a whole, feeling like a disappointment. Perhaps McMahon sensed this & has spoken out about distancing himself from the project, & there's a story that he tried to buy it back to keep it from airing. This just sounds like Vince McMahon the showman/the promoter, generating heat for the show to get people to watch it, & it worked. He's probably laughing behind the scenes, & reinforcing that he's still involved with the WWE product, without officially being involved.",False
3,9,"Very interesting to watch, but not always the most pleasant",asc85,n/a,15/08/2025,"I started following the WWF in the mid-70's with Bruno Sammartino, all the way through the Hulk Hogan era, and then only sporadically after that with Stone Cold and The Rock. So I have to say I was probably looking forward to this more than just about anything that has been released on streaming in the last few years.Professional wrestling used to be so secretive, but now that McMahon has admitted the whole thing is more entertainment than a sport, many of the secrets have been revealed. I've seen some things over the last few years that have revealed some of it, and this documentary confirmed and revealed more for me.As for Vince McMahon, he is a very polarizing, complex man. Think along the lines of Bobby Knight, Donald Trump, Woody Hayes, or George Steinbrenner. So I'm not sure what to think about him as a person, but as a businessman, he is a genius to do what he did with the transformation of professional wrestling.Most documentaries on streamers are endless, and should be cut down. Conversely, this is only six episodes long. I think this could have easily been 10 episodes, and still would have been interesting.",False
4,9,Early Christmas gift for the Millennial WWF fans,toshki-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Disclaimer: Yes, I know WWE is fake wrestling! I didn't know it as a child, and that was the fun of it. Coming to the review:OMG!! It is just so amazing to see the legends of WWF and all the back story. The people in the US may know about everything in the documentary. You gotta remember, WWF was global and most of us didn't have access to all the back stage drama. The real stories, the WCW vs WWF drama all of that. We only saw what happened on Raw and PPVs. There was no internet back then as well for us to get the information.If you resonate with what I have shared, you will love this documentary, as you rightly should!!",False
5,8,An entertainment mess...,dan-havard,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFor something with the title Mr. McMahon this largely serves as a history of the WWF/E for 80% of it, a 10% look at Vince behind the scenes in WWF/E and 10% the numerous scandles sprinkled in. One episode is full of scandals and lawsuits then followed by an essentially a run down of the Monday Night Wars.It's hard to understand how this has been made for, the informed wrestling fan who knows the history of the business and looking for true insight into the mastermind behind it all is left wanting, the casual viewer with a good knowledge doesn't gain much and the casual viewer looking for scandal and lawsuits gets a massive history on pro wrestling.No one is ever questioned on the difficult topics, Vince and the female referee is zoomed through, Linda isn't asked about it and how she feels about her husband having a consensual (in Vinces mind) rumble with an employee in a limo.Overall for a 6 hour mini series I have gained about 30 minutes of new knowledge and took a lovely trip down nostalgia lane.",True
6,6,A toxic personality,edwin-wks,n/a,15/08/2025,"""When we stop growing, we die"" is what McMahon said. It is ironic because the man has not grown emotionally since his adolescence. Paul Heyman, the voice of reason among the talking heads, said it best, that McMahon is overcompensating for the deprivation that he endured in the first 12 years of his life. He was abandoned by his biological father and severely abused by his stepfather, resulting in a core belief of defectiveness. Nothing he has ever achieved, no amount of success or adoration, will ever truly be enough to heal that inner child who still feels inadequate because daddy left him.It may be true that, without McMahon's voracious appetite to make something of himself, we would not have the behemoth that is the WWE. However, his true legacy lies in normalising domestic violence, fuelling misogyny and encouraging toxic masculinity in the storylines he conceived of to achieve ever higher ratings, including putting his own family drama on full display in his shows. What kind of person accuses his daughter of being selfish for not wanting her wedding televised on pay-per-view, and then arranges a wrestling match against him to humiliate her?Despite his insistence that Mr. McMahon is only a character, it is nevertheless one borne out of and embodying his unconscious desires, a medium through which he can express his true self with impunity. Mr. McMahon was his Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card; ""Oh, I did something wrong? That was my character, not me"". He is not a role model to any man, not even his son, from whom he withheld affection and validation the same way that his own father did to him. This man lives in the fantasy that he does not perpetuate abuse in spite of his abusive childhood and clear evidence to the contrary. This documentary is one of abuse and the legacy of abuse, more than it is about wrestling, and it need not have been six hours long.",False
7,6,Confusingly dull.,EugenusRex,n/a,15/08/2025,"One would think there was ample juice in the life of Vince McMahon to flesh out a 6-hour Netflix documentary; apparently not.I had high hopes for this series; I enjoy the current glut of wrestling documentaries (more-so than I do wrestling, itself) and the trailer gave me the impression that this would be a compelling behind-the-scenes glimpse into the life of the enigmatic Mr. McMahon, rife with insight and nostalgia. Instead, this documentary is more-so a strained and plodding history of the WWE composed of: old footage, one-dimensional interviews and a surprising lack of input from Mr. McMahon, himself.It altogether feels like a documentary made by someone only vaguely interested in the subject matter, at hand, cynically hoping to exploit the attention of a devoted pre-existing fanbase. We live in something of a renaissance when it comes to wrestling documentary/podcast output but when putting this alongside the like of A&E's biography series and Vice's 'Dark Side of the Ring' and 'Who Killed WCW?', this is, by far, the weakest of the bunch.If you want insight into the life and mind of Vince McMahon and his career at the helm of WWE, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere.",False
8,9,Hugely watchable.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Vince McMahon took WWE (WWF) to new heights, fending off competition, scandals, even deaths, but where do the lines blur between Vince McMahon and his on screen character, Mr McMahon.It is genuinely like a soap opera, it's so outlandish, so over the top, so extreme, the characters feel exactly that, unlike any possible real person, and that's the appeal I guess, it's almost like a real life cartoon.It's unreal, even for someone who gave up on wrestling probably in about 1998. McMahon is shown in the titles as a slightly crazed looking puppet master, and that's exactly what he is.It's pinch of salt stuff, that is until the final episode, where it takes a dramatic shift, and suddenly feels very real.Very well made, goofy interviews, as well as some very serious ones. It explores various different elements of wrestling, the people, the business, the mistakes, deaths and injuries, it even talks about its bright future.Great entertainment.9/10.",False
9,6,Interesting but too sugar coated,chunkylefunga,n/a,15/08/2025,"The series itself was interesting but he was way too heavily edited and way too much was cut out, which is unusual for a Netflix production.You could see that money had just been thrown at the wrestlers to talk but that Vince et al had very clearly told them not to actually tell anything real or dark about the industry.It's basically a pg telling of an industry that is clearly very known for abusive and abhorent behaviour. Not to mention Netflix basically just mention all the sexual harassments and rape accusations as more of a byline than actually getting into it.In the end it's just part story of the rise of the WWF but doesn't really tell you anything shocking or groundbreaking.Not really sure what the point of this series is because it certainly isn't to help the victims of the industry.",False
10,8,"Gap-Filling, but Dire Warnings Therein...",tariqmk,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who started watching in 2003, I always knew as a kid that there was a lot that happened before my time and as awesome as I found the WWE (for a few years), there were even more mind-blowing things that I had just missed.This documentary does a great job at filling in so many of the gaps I always knew I had missed out on. The characters I knew as responsible for delivering great moments of my childhood, Eric Bischoff, Paul Heyman and more ... they all came from competing shows! They were once the arch enemies of the WWF, then masterfully incorporated into the product.I knew nothing of the history of the 'territories' and how Vince McMahon ruthlessly grew his empire and eventually emerged as the victor.This documentary also did a great job at showing just how ruthless of a businessman Vince McMahon was and is. Everything in and around him was seen through one lens only, how much it could benefit him and his business monetarily. This meant former enemies and traitors would be easily brought (after being bought!) under his wing as his own loyal employees.Ultimately, while many may admire how Vince was able to build such an empire after coming from such a traumatic background, it is hard to ignore that he was ruthless to many around him as a result. He involved his family in scandals, failed to pass the business to his son and finally dies a theatrical death on the sidelines in nefarious ignominy.Was it worth it? Was it all the expression of a man hurt by the trauma of his formative first 12 years of life? I think so.While the documentary was great watching, I learnt many lessons from it. The utmost being that to reach the upper echelons of financial 'success' in our age you have to sideline everything and everyone else.Paul Heyman said it best in the documentary.""Vince doesn't own the business, the business owns him"".I view this documentary as both a fascinating insight into the shows I loved as a kid and also a stern warning against ever becoming as ruthless as Vince turned out to be.Recommended viewing.",True
11,7,Kayfabe and the Birth of the MAGA Cult,markhsims,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTHIS EXPLAINS A LOT. Watching this story unfold catapults the viewers into the sausage-making process that is professional wrestling entertainment. While at the same time forcing the viewer into the overlay that is MAGA World. In both instances, when the kayfabe is revealed, both super fans and political supporters are confronted with the eerie similarities and the inability to accept that their reality is a well orchestrated illusion of fiction and storytelling. If you are wondering just where did this MAGA fanboy crowd cut their teeth, look no further than the WWE phenomenon of the late 90's and 2000's.Trump is a Vince McMahon cyber-brother, grown in the same lab from weirdly cross-contaminated Petri dishes. The family similarities are eerily reminiscent of one another. From the early childhoods to the ongoing familial dysfunction. Trump even played a role in one of McMahon's storylines. Both men have been accused of sex crimes. Both men lead a cult-like fan-o-sphere.The inclusion of Linda McMahon in the WWE storyline is reminiscent of Ivanka's role in Trump's political storyline. The presence and exploitation of their children, particularly their daughters is both sick and frightening. As the individuals in this documentary look back at the ""dark period"" of the WWE storylines, they do so with revulsion and faces that cringe as they recount everyone's participation as ""actors"" in the WWE family saga. Linda McMahon even goes on to serve as the head of the Small Business Administration in Trump's Administration after two failed attempts at being elected for two different U. S. Senate seats from Connecticut, losing out to Democrats in both races.Watching Vince McMahon take in the adoration from those whom he surrounds himself, and particularly the fan-packed arenas, something at a level Trump longed for but could never achieve is mind boggling. But, watching the cheering and adoring crowds, who bought tickets to the WWE shows, fixated on what McMahon had created is like watching the crazed, misinformed lapdogs who have stood in line for hours so that they can act as Trump's sign holding cheer leaders, taking in every word as they willingly accept as reality everything they both see and hear. The similarities will cause many viewers to wonder whether McMahon had given birth to the Trump movement, or did Trump simply take McMahon's script and insert himself into Vince's world of make believe.Did the kayfabe created by McMahon and the WWE become the script for Trump's gonzo election and the dumpster fire that was Trump's term in office and everything that both preceded and followed his term in office? Interestingly, the documentary filmmakers were driven to insert, post-production, the added disclaimers of the allegations made against McMahon for sex crimes and sex trafficking-something similar to the allegations which have dogged Trump since his first run for office sometime in 2016.This film will please WWE fans, shock those who know virtually nothing about the evolution of wrestling entertainment, and provide an ""OMG, look at that"" moment for political junkies wondering where the MAGA crowd was birthed and what drives their enthusiasm.This documentary on ""Mr. McMahon"" may turn out to be one of the most prescient political films of the cult that is the Trump MAGA movement.",True
12,3,Whitewashed Rubbish That Fails to Hide the Obvious Truths,epbomb,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI tried to go into watching Mr McMahon with as open a mind as possible knowing that Netflix and the WWE and its parent company TKO are currently engaged in a long-term contract for the WWE programming to be broadcast on netflix. And, as I ultimately expected, the documentary was both painfully and unnecessarily long and whitewash is the truth about Vince McMahon.While this documentary was supposed to be Focused Life in career, almost the entirety before it's six episodes are documentary pieces about the rise of the World Wrestling Federation in the 1980s, the first few wrestlemanias, the Monday night Wars of the 1990s, and the evolution of the combination of the WWE brand with the UFC brand into the current product.The documentary tries very hard to make Vince McMahon a key player but secondary topic to the WWF and WWE brand, product, and wrestling. Much of the first two episodes highlight recent man successes as a businessman and how the World Wrestling Federation, Hulk Hogan, and WrestleMania brought professional wrestling into mainstream Society and mainstream popularity.Hulk Hogan, who threw the years has had a strained relationship whispered Vince McMahon and the WWF and WWE brands is one of the key speakers throughout much of the documentary seemingly nothing negative at all say about Vince McMahon, and strives to create another new narrative about his steroid use and the steroid scandal in the early 1990s.For reasons I can't possibly comprehend, Tony Atlas is the primary speaker throughout the entire documentary. Tony Atlas presents a very neutral, whitewash memory of Vince McMahon's taking control of the WWF in the early 1980s and basically all of wrestling until 2000.Notably missing or interviews with any of the wrestlers who through the years criticized Vince mcmahon, questioned the ethics of Vince McMahon's leadership, and or work to unionize, improve, and heightened health and safety standards of professional wrestlers behind the scenes like Jesse The Body Ventura and Bruno Sammartino. The documentary works hard to discredit Jesse The Body Ventura and his efforts to unionize professional wrestlers as well as Bruno Sammartino and his widely publicized criticism and objections to the use and acceptance of use of anabolic steroids beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through to the 1990s.Too much of the documentary is spent discussing how the World Wrestling Federation and Hulk Hogan brought wrestling into the mainstream in the 1980s and 1990s and almost a whole episode focuses on the Monday night Wars tween the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling in the 1990s.During these episodes Vince McMahon is portrayed as an astute professional and businessman who was able to navigate professional wrestling into a billion dollar business and become one of the most recognizable heels ever as character on screen. Except for loose descriptions of Vince McMahon's childhood in the first episode, Vince McMahon's personal life is not at all examined.Every time ethical issues, legal issues, or sexual misconduct issues arise during the documentary they are conveniently white washed over as Vince McMahon doing what's best for the business, Vince McMahon doing what's best for the company, or Vince McMahon knowing exactly what cards to play to beat the legal system.It is not hard to see between the lines in this documentary, Vince McMahon is clearly not a good person. The portrayal of Vince McMahon as a character and the constant repeating that Vince McMahon the person and Vince McMahon the character blur into one fails to cover up obvious and blatant misconduct, abuse, disrespect, and sexual misconduct.The documentary doesn't even bother to try to cover up or make excuses for the World Wrestling Federation's, and later World Wrestling Entertainment's, corporate and management structure cover up and finance hush money payments to dozens of women and men who alleged Vince McMahon coerced or forced inappropriate sexual conduct and rape, sex trafficking of female employees.The documentary also carefully whitewashes over the strong-arming and coercion of pro-wrestlers as well as the dereliction of due diligence for safety measures to protect the professional wrestlers leading to serious injuries as well as the death of Owen Hart.At the end of it all the documentary was disappointing, it failed in every aspect to provide true insight into Vince McMahon the person and not Vince McMahon the character on screen; It did however solidify suspicions I have made through the years regarding Vince McMahon. This one sided documentary strives only to make Vince McMahon look like a victim of circumstances and an otherwise excellent human being when all the evidence presented put together shows him to be a degenerate power-hungry miscreant and hypersexual who abused his power.As a professional wrestling fan, I am embarrassed to have let the WWF/WWE product blind me for as long as it did. Ten years ago I became a devout independent wrestling fan - I don't think I could ever return to the WWE product again.",True

14,9,Wrestling has more than one royal family.,aymaantaha,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first episode of Netflix's docuseries ""Mr. McMahon"" dives deep into the life and career of Vince McMahon, the controversial figure behind WWE. Directed by Chris Smith, known for his work on ""Tiger King,"" the series sets out to explore the rise and fall of McMahon, offering a comprehensive look at his impact on professional wrestling and the darker aspects of his legacy.The episode begins by establishing McMahon's early life and his initial foray into the wrestling business. It paints a picture of a man driven by ambition and a desire to transform the wrestling industry. Through interviews with McMahon himself, his family, and various WWE personalities, the episode provides a multifaceted view of his character. McMahon's charisma and business acumen are highlighted, but so are his ruthless tactics and controversial decisions.One of the standout elements of the episode is its use of archival footage and interviews. Smith has meticulously compiled over 100 hours of interviews, capturing candid moments with McMahon and those close to him. This footage is interwoven with clips from WWE's history, creating a narrative that is both engaging and informative. The episode does not shy away from the controversies that have surrounded McMahon, including allegations of sexual abuse and trafficking. These issues are addressed head-on, providing a stark contrast to the public persona McMahon has cultivated over the years.The episode also delves into the evolution of WWE under McMahon's leadership. It explores how he transformed the company from a regional promotion into a global entertainment powerhouse. Key moments, such as the creation of WrestleMania and the rise of iconic wrestlers like Hulk Hogan and The Rock, are covered in detail. The episode highlights McMahon's ability to innovate and adapt, but it also underscores the ethical compromises he made along the way.One of the most compelling aspects of the episode is its portrayal of McMahon as a complex and often contradictory figure. On one hand, he is shown as a visionary who revolutionized professional wrestling. On the other, he is depicted as a manipulative and morally ambiguous individual. This duality is captured through interviews with WWE insiders, journalists, and former wrestlers. Their testimonies provide a nuanced perspective on McMahon's legacy, revealing both admiration and resentment.The episode's pacing is well-executed, balancing historical context with personal anecdotes. It moves seamlessly between different time periods, offering a cohesive narrative that keeps viewers engaged. The editing is particularly noteworthy, as it juxtaposes McMahon's public statements with behind-the-scenes revelations. This technique effectively exposes the gap between his public image and the reality of his actions.However, the episode is not without its flaws. Some critics have pointed out that it does not delve deeply enough into the experiences of McMahon's victims. While the allegations against him are mentioned, the focus remains largely on his career and influence. This has led to some criticism that the series is too sympathetic towards McMahon, failing to fully hold him accountable for his actions.Despite these shortcomings, the first episode of ""Mr. McMahon"" is a compelling start to the series. It offers a detailed and balanced look at one of the most influential figures in professional wrestling. The episode succeeds in capturing the complexity of McMahon's character, providing viewers with a thought-provoking exploration of his legacy.In conclusion, the first episode of ""Mr. McMahon"" sets the stage for a gripping docuseries that promises to delve into the highs and lows of Vince McMahon's career. Through a combination of archival footage, interviews, and expert storytelling, it paints a vivid picture of a man who has left an indelible mark on the world of professional wrestling. Whether you are a wrestling fan or simply interested in the story of a controversial figure, this episode is a must-watch.",False

I enjoyed the stuff about his family and upbringing, but I wish there were more wrestlers and/or backstage people who aren't ""yes"" people.

Never liked it. But this show that recalls its history from the biased creator family business point of view is exquisite. It is so good. I even cried in the last episode when the banished son returns. I know in 2024 this show should be cancelled because of sexual misconducts, but you should still watch it. It is fun. There are so many rebondissements as the fake wrestle characters intersect so much with the real life humans.I still am not interested in watching wrestling. Are you kidding.

I know this is taped way before the McMahon trials, and I don't know what the producers cut from the tapings, but they're not even trying to hold him accountable for the what he did. For example the work load Hulk Hogan talks about. McMahon clearly denies everything, but the producers don't seem to encourage him to look back, look inwards and take responsibility and reflect on his behaviour. That bothers me.Otherwise it's always fascinating to learn about stuff behind the curtains.

20,9,"Probably the best history of WWE documentary series, don't expect",wisdomwasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't expect a big beat up of Vince McMahon here. Being mostly filmed before the last damaging allegations, this is more a focus on Vince McMahons business mind - and how he swallowed the whole wrestling world under his ruthless ambition and business acumen.It's at its most interesting giving an insight into the workings of Vince McMahons mind, he reveals more than he needs to at times (including how he has sometimes said things to get ahead and sway/program others as promotion), the other most interesting is the history of WWE. I learnt a lot although some WWE die-hards will prefer the Dark Side of the Ring.It doesn't shy away from the allegations, and is better for it. Bret Hart, Dave Meltzer and Eric Bischoff are great interviews. Vince is too reserved at times. He's a brilliant mind, and a brilliant villian, but potentially not a good guy.

The talking heads selected for this barely got a chance to tell anything of note, even though they are involved in the business more than some people selected for, say, dark side of the ring. I can't imagine how anyone that's not a fan would be interested in watching this, and even casual fans would probably not find anything interesting in this. The production value is okay. Perhaps this can serve as a retelling of a certain period in history of wrestling years and years in the future, but currently I don't see a point in watching this, let alone with its current length.

22,3,Wasted Opportunity,GEO6100,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mr. McMahon presents itself as a deep dive into the life of Vince McMahon, but it falls short of delivering anything truly groundbreaking. While the documentary may be informative for those unfamiliar with the subject matter, for anyone with even a basic knowledge of McMahon or wrestling, it feels repetitive. Much of what is covered has already been explored in other documentaries, and if they had focused solely on new material, it could have easily been condensed into a single 90-minute feature instead of stretching it over six hour-long episodes.The documentary also feels more like a general history of WWE and professional wrestling than a focused examination of McMahon himself. Key aspects of his life, including the allegations of sexual misconduct, are only touched upon at a surface level, with no new or in-depth analysis. It rehashes familiar territory without offering any fresh insights.What's most disappointing is that the documentarians clearly set out to create something transformative, yet instead only manage to reiterate well-known information. The inclusion of a few voices we haven't heard from before does little to elevate the documentary, as many of the individuals chosen add little substance. In the end, it's a wasted opportunity, lacking both depth and originality.",False
23,9,An excellent documentary series.,FONYMAHONEY,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a kid, I hated WWE when everyone else my age was utterly entranced by it. I was a sickly, eccentric dork (still am, in truth) and I just found the machismo and hamfisted 'fakery' impossible to connect with - and if I'm honest, culturally, being a child, I found it a little bit scary. It crept into the playgrounds - I definitely took a few beatings from people imitating Stone Cold or The Undertaker, and as an active non-viewer of wrestling, those beatings and the merch everyone seemed to have were my entire frame of reference of WWE - and I deeply disliked it.I often felt like an outcast as a kid, and often got things wrong trying to 'fit in', but having now watched this fantastic series, it seems my adolescent instincts around WWE were right on the money.The extent of the sleaze and underhand tactics rife within wrestling normalised under McMahon's stewardship is simultaneously shocking and utterly unsurprising. The entire time, he was hiding in plain sight - and it's a damning indictment of the susceptibility of many people to manipulation and PR.The way it's told, however - it's sensational without being sensationalistic. It's articulate without being condescending, and insightful in a way which wouldn't have been possible had this documentary been released at the time of filming - and the extraordinary good fortune to get a lot of legitimate criticism of & striking candour from the pro-wrestling industry at large is both prescient and enthralling.Despite the relative deep dive, it still feels like just the tip of the iceberg - and I doubt we'll ever know the full extent of McMahon's malignance. But wow, what an awesomely fascinating world he built.",False
24,9,Disgusting Man Yet Creative Evil Genius,psgorio,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was curious being an old school 80's to early 2000's hardcore wrestling fan so I took a peek at this documentary on Netflix and it really stunned me. It was an amazing portrayal of the man behind the curtain in both good ways and bad, showcasing the start of Vince McMahon's rise to power and fame after he took over his father's business to his sheer and utter fumble and downfall with the plethora of sexual allegations and trafficking charges being filed against him. If you're a fan of wrestling, more so the glory days of wrestling, you'll definitely get a lot out of this too. There's a ton of flashbacks to many famous moments throughout the rise of the WWF, walking your thru the various eras from the golden age to the attitude eras and Monday Night Wars. And sure, maybe if you're like me watching a mogul in power use his power and wealth to get whatever they want may get you a wee bit mad, but you can use that anger constructively to further embed the fact that quite simply there's no reason to ever give any man like this the time of day when they clearly have no respect for you or anyone for that matter. Not even themselves. But do remember the good times during the 80s and 90s about the glory and golden age of wrestling and that the man was a damn fine storyteller and evil creative genius that managed to keep audiences invested for a very long time until all of his competition was defeated. But outside of that, he was cutthroat, arrogant, ruthless, savage and a downright despicable especially when it came to human decency and the treatment of women that will do whatever it takes to win no matter the cost. Even if it means sacrificing people's livelihoods, moralities and emotionally scarring them along the journey. One person who they interviewed said something that made 1000% sense about Vince as a person. He was only monogamous to one being in his entire life. And that thing was his business. And he didn't run that business. That business ran him. He was cursed by it. Plagued by its very existence. Whatever the business demanded he did. He could not sleep eat or function until the businesses hunger was satisfied which is almost never.",False
25,7,Merely okay,arron-hustead,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's entertaining, but apart from Bruce Prichard's statement in the last episode that Linda had a terminal cancer diagnosis a quarter of a century ago and Paul Herman's story about Vince trying to get Shane to stab him in the heart, there wasn't really anything I hadn't heard before. I'm sure others knew all about those things too, so for many there was probably nothing new here. No names were named in the allegations against Vince that we didn't already know. The first five episodes are rehashing all the different eras of McMahon's running of the WWE that fans have already heard a million times. The new stuff is all in the second half of the last episode and again that just rehashes the details from that which are already known to pretty much everyone that wanted to know and a good deal number of people that probably didn't.",True

1,10,A MUST WATCH,meganzajec,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing and very important documentary about feelings in men. Life changing experience of dissolving the pain and trauma. Men in therapy. Something we need to see more often. Thankfull for men to talk and acknowledge the deep rooted issue of supressed feelings resulting in aggresive partiarchy and giving themselves voice that precedes that. It's important for us women to value and cherish the vulnerability in men and not shame them. This documentary definitely gave me a bone to chew, to remind me and help me in my own relationship with men. It's heartfelt, psychological, insightful. Highly recommend anyone to watch it especially men.",False

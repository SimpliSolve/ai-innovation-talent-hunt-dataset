1,10,Long overdue,jessgrant-666-609605,n/a,15/08/2025,"This new film is a welcome breath of fresh air. The documentary offers a powerful counter narrative to the mainstream celebration of pediatric Gender interventions.Only time will tell if cross sex hormones and voluntary mastectomies become the next lobotomy or opioid scandal: if they do, it won't be any thanks to the medical and political establishment that's gone along with this experiment for too long. It turns out the science on this issue is far from settled, and the Nordic countries have now rejected the affirmative model of care so prevalent in the US.The film is very well made, with good pacing and engaging characters. Their is a fierce courage in the filmmakers willingness to tackle such a fraught topic.",False
2,1,Propaganda!,Marynewcomb2013,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf people who are actually uneducated in gender dysphoria would take time to learn about it, we would not be having the problems with people right now!! This ""documentary"" is nothing but propaganda! Before starting hormone replacement therapy, you have to be evaluated! That evaluation is not something that happens real fast either!! You have to take tests and go through sessions with a trained psychologist! The trailer for this even try's telling you on this that this is not what takes place! It makes it out like you walk in & walk out with HRT medication!!Also, when a female to male person transitions, the HRT deepens their voice! If the desire to go back to the body they had before, the changes to the voice do not go away!! It takes a long time to change that with vocal coaching! Also, physical changes would still be present!! What I am getting at is this, not a single one in this ""documentary"" is who they want you to believe they are!! It's all fake, even the reviews it has gotten are fake!! I will also tell you this, a physician does not handle gender dysphoria or even HRT in anyway, shape or form! Reason I say this, they have a physician talking about it! You have to see a specialist to get HRT!!It's amazing how just a little knowledge of something makes a huge difference!!",True
3,9,Informative and Courageous,Danusha_Goska,n/a,15/08/2025,"Affirmation Generation features several detransitioners and also medical experts discussing the transing of children. Many medical articles are featured and quoted. Beautifully and professionally produced. Information you will not find elsewhere. Compassionate. Challenging. The video was censored for a while but is now viewable on Vimeo. Young people, parents, and medical professionals should all watch it It should be shown in classrooms. The filmmakers all identify as ""left coast lifelong liberals"" The facts presented are not biased, they are just facts. I watched the film twice in order to get all the information on hand. Will watch again.",False
4,1,Damaging and dangerous,leelevy-90193,n/a,15/08/2025,"Was looking forward to seeing this-
turns out it's an exercise of confirmation bias that promotes ignorance and ultimately, hate.This film (title/premise) will be used as 'facts' in a war against trans children. Ultimately destroying more lives than they supposedly aim to help.If the producers wanted to help children they could have taken many other approaches than they damaging approach they took. They misrepresent the high hurdles involved in transition and focus on outliers.Positioned as an anti-big Pharma film, it really is an anti-care, anti-child and anti-trans film.No doubt, this will be used to prevent care and ultimately increase the high rates of trans teen suicide. But hey, they probably view that as a good thing.Who funded this, Ron DeSantis?",False
5,9,One you can share with your liberal friends,drfood-14976,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are a conservative worried about pediatric gender medicalization, you have many places to go. If you are a liberal, not so much! This is something you can share with your liberal friends.I love this documentary because it covers this burgeoning medical scandal without getting into politics or religion. It shares the stories of six different detransitioners, with very different stories, and includes information from a wide variety of subject matter experts.Most of the unaffected world is just waking up to the scandal, but it is a scandal. Watch this and be ahead of the curve. Trans people deserve all their rights, but the decision to transition is not a simple one. Right now there are thousands of children, youth and vulnerable adults being told that transition will solve their problems.",False
6,10,"Compassionate, Comprehensive, Thoughtful",sunnybeezsf,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw this when it first came out on Vimeo as ""Affirmation Generation"" which I think was a better title and graphic. The new graphic is debased. However, this movie doesn't demonize transpeople at all. It just thoughfully highlights the whole host of problems that most people are concerned with when it comes affirming children and young adults. There is a lack of quality mental health services for this age group. But big pharma has stepped in with a ""cure"" to all their pain and angst. The activists who are well funded by big pharma shut down the showing because they don't want people to question this juggernaut. There are alternatives to affirmation protocols that support trans people which much of Europe is returning to. But then big pharma which runs health care in the US doesn't make the big bucks.",False
7,10,Super important for this Generation and future ones as well.,tonysimons-27161,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerWas quite thorough and informative. I hope it reaches the demographic that truely needs to hear it. Such a shame that so many have already made such a harmful journey. I don't understand why Vimeo saw this as being against community guidelines. It's simply an informative documentary to attempt to prevent people from making a change to themselve they can't turn back from. And highlights the untrue facts that people have been lied to about transitioning. Affirmation Generation documentary reveals all the things you don't get told by therapists and doctors who support affirming care. Truely a must see.,True
8,10,Outstanding and essential viewing,chantesayers,n/a,15/08/2025,"An outstanding documentary. Thoughtful, professional journalism that doesn't sensationalise, but treats the subjects with respect and dignity. Essential viewing for everyone, especially parents, educators, health care professionals, social workers, and those who've only been shown the 'happy rainbow', without the reality. The sensitive subject matter is approached in a careful and thoughtful way. No gimmicks or shocks or autogynephile behaviour. The clear language approach makes it suitable for older children as well as adults. Each interviewee is honest and speaks from the heart. Highly recommended.",False
9,10,wow. incredible side of a story thats clearly being surpressed,rosspeters,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am absolutely shocked at how viciously this movie is being repressed by amazon. Doesnt show up in search results for the exact title. Took about five minutes to navigate to the page to actually write a review...anyway...Incredibly refreshing to see the negative consequences that these people are facing and very revealing. The data presented is incontrovertible and the personal stories are so touching and tragic that it really helps to create a sense of urgency for this issue, because more and more CHILDREN and unwell people are being preyed upon by activists and corporations for their own sick gains.Outstanding.",False

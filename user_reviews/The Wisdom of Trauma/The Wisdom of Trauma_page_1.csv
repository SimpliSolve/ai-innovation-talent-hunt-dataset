1,7,Interesting perspective,margineanvladdaniel,n/a,15/08/2025,"I liked it, but it lacked something. I don't know if it should have blown me away like the others, but it did raise new questions which I will use. Nevertheless, I recommend it! Well done!",False
2,9,surprising yet well-thought out information,erinwade-76266,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's an overview of Gabor Mate's work and research. I really appreciated the film. I would like to see more in-depth pieces on the different aspects of trauma that were covered here, but that would take hours and hours, obviously. Connections were made that surprised me with new knowledge, and I did feel that I learned a lot. I did appreciate the range of people who were given voice, especially including the prisoners. That aspect of the film made a strong impression, and was a powerful statement on how troubled people enduring trauma are disregarded in our society until it' has become a crisis, for the individual and for society. I would like to see the film again, as a lot of information was presented. Since it focused on several individuals, groups and aspects of trauma, going rather rapidly, I feel that the information needs to be allowed to soak in more. It is, after all, an overview.",False
3,10,Everyone should see this!!!,rebekagati,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film understands and shows trauma, the root of our deepest wounds in ways I have never seen before. I am truly grateful for this film, it is honest, human, painful but beautiful at the same time. I find it very helpful for healing and reconnecting with ourselves and also to learn more about trauma, addiction, disease and recovery.This is the first time ever that I am posting a review here, but I felt that this movie is so special and more people should be aware of its existence.",False
4,10,Nobody is talking about what Gabor is. Very important,mordaviram,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie is talking about issues openly, and it made me feel better.It is not around solutions or a way, but rather about experiences and ideas. We need more things like that nowadays. The Jail scenes were powerful.Gabor speaking with a woman who was a victim to abuse in her youth :
Gabor: ""If your child was going through this, who would you want that child to speak with?""""With me""Gabor: ""And who did/ could you talk to?""""No one, I had no one to talk to""Gabor: ""That's the trauma.",False
5,10,Incredible,karynrburns,n/a,15/08/2025,Everybody needs to see this. Everybody has trauma and this is a great introduction to doing the work. The concepts make so much sense and Gabor Mate is so brilliant. This gave me more motivation to put in the work in rediscovering my true authentic self.,False
6,10,Raising awareness about trauma's impact on individual and social wellbeing,workgood,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dr. Mate has been on a one-person campaign to help people deal with past traumas and move on with their lives.After decades of working with people - first as a doctor, then as a real physician who takes the time to care about his patients and help them heal, he shares his realizations in laymen's terms.We need to change the way we raise children (to be more present and to not violate their biologically evolved expectations for care). Adults need to move past their storehouses of unprocessed painful experiences so they can move on with their lives.If delving a little deeper into these topic is interesting to you, then you'll like this movie.",False
7,10,"A film from the heart, and a work of art",michaelstoft,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is brutally honest while at the same time being hopeful and tender about human potential- honest and tender in the most eloquent way possible. I am not exaggerating when I say that I don't believe that this film could have delivered its message any more impactfully, at least for me.Perhaps the film is excessively focused on Gabor Mate's work, which might impart a cheesy glamorized halo around him in the eyes of some viewers, but at the same time, I was able to follow and appreciate the contributions and insights of other professionals and survivors throughout the film. For his part, I considered Mate a kind of cinematic anchor, a unifying thread through the work and experiences of others, which contributed to an overall sense of structure and cohesiveness within the film.This documentary is truly a film from the heart- in my mind (and heart), a work of art üòä‚úåüèº",False
8,10,One of the best documentaries i have watched!,saqibfbs,n/a,15/08/2025,Brilliant presentation one of the most important subjects that need to be addressed in the world today! Must watch!,False
9,5,Too centered on the character of Gabor Mate to the point where it almost felt like worshipping him and his message gets lost along the way,samuelrein,n/a,15/08/2025,"The good:
-the parts where prisoners are talking about their own traumas and doing some kind of group therapy
-the interviews with (ex)addicts and (ex)homeless people where they talk about their lives in a trauma informed way
-some of the talks of Gabor Mate about trauma and how we are living in a society that traumatizes people and fails to help those who are traumatizedThe bad:
-overall the documentary felt like a big Gabor Mate worshipping session rather than being about trauma which is a shame in my opinion and was even unerving at times. I mean, seeing him surrounded with groups of photogenic women in awe in front of him....
-the parts where you see him doing some kind of express therapy to some people in front of an audience, it made me cringe. I looked like some typical personal development guru doing these big workshop events with a large audience and I can't imagine how this can provide any of the needed intimate and safe space needed to do trauma work. I can't imagine anyone being comfortable talking like that in front of an audience and making sure they talk in a microphone and keep the audience entertained with witty comments while doing trauma work. So if it's not trauma work being done bur a mock session, what is the point of it? Do people benefit by from those type of 'shows' about trauma?-the part with someone doing some kind of psychedelic therapy session in with Gabor Mate. The substance used is not explained and while i did enjoy seeing how Gabor runs the session, i thought interviewing the patient after the session and how he feels good now also felt oversold. I have done a number of psychedelic therapy sessions and am well aware of how one can feel permanently healed during the afterglow phase but after a few weeks or months a lot of the feeling of being healed can vanish. Nothing wrong with psychdelic therapy, it is a worthy endeavour but i thought it would have been more honest to say how long after the session was the interview with the patient.-finally and my biggest frustration with this documentary is the feeling someone has turned the whole thing about Gabor Mate into a personality worshipping business and is trying to get as much momentum as possible. Probably to make money ultimately. I might be wrong but it reminded me of how Wim Hof the 'Ice Man' has a son who is running a business to promote and maximize value out of his father's work and public image. Again it's not that bad but it just feels like there something inauthentic about it. I wish the documentary would have been less about Gabor Mate and more about trauma.",False
10,10,Dr. Gabor Mat√© is THE GOAT!!!,guidedbyvoices-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"I follow Dr. Mat√© for years now. I love him and his work...helped me so much with my own trauma and addiction! Being forever grateful for that!!! <3Can't recommend this film too much!Go watch it! He wisdom in it, has the potential to heal you!!!",False
11,10,I learned more about myself during this film than I expected,amelkhalil,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this movie as part of a movie night. I read so many psychology books and thought I learned about all the depths of my trauma, this helped me see how some wounds are really deep and why. It was extremely educational and broke things down in an understandable way. It provided valid commentary on today's society and how learning about these topics, addiction and trauma, not only requires knowledge and education but also compassion. It was a great watch and I'm grateful that someone in our group recommended it. Gabor's work in general is consistent and spot on. A true humanitarian and he cares about our future .",False
12,10,Best documentary about Trauma,petrosiliuszwackelmann,n/a,15/08/2025,"Its such an important Film, I agree, Everybody should See it. I really recommend. We live in a traumatized society today. We need Trauma sensitive education and Trauma sensitive healthsystem. This film is a contribution to a Trauma sensitive society.",False
13,10,The movie that changed the way I looked at myself,AK1475,n/a,15/08/2025,"For more than 2 years now I'm fighting for my life.I was hit in a ""hit &run"" accident.I lost a part of my body and a lot of parts of my Saul. In a long process I'm now starting to understand what happened to me. Why I am the way I am an only now, little by little, piece by piece realising the trauma I was in almost all my life. Alone. How I've lost my authenticity for survival.Only to fit in and be loved. This movie truly changed my life. The way I think of myself and the way I used to see my self.Now I'm learning how to be more forgiving. Not to be so angry Towards myself.Learning how to change the patterns of my thinking. Understanding that it wasn't my fault. I've only surviving...",False
14,10,THE ONLY REALIZATION AND KNOWLEDGE HUMANITY ACTUALLY NEEDS,avishekgadal,n/a,15/08/2025,"DR. Gabor Mate has proven himself to be the most strong and daring person on planet simply because he shouts people at their face that ""i have right to be who i am"" .Every human being on planet feels the same, just he has the ability to put it forth. Every human being is simply a moulded character by his environment. Because world runs like a factory does not mean everybody has to be identical perfect model product, and the mismatch and misunderstanding comes into play here , , no shame, no guilt, no fear what so ever, , we have to have this knowledge of trauma, parenting ways, guardianship and other character building science studies in every courses and political agendas, culture, belief systems and societies through out the world, , , i guarantee, world will not bring war and terror but love and beauty in coming days.",False
15,5,"Good sentiment, light on science",Nordom112,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the general approach towards appreciating trauma is definitely welcome, it is nothing too radical and has been part of psychology for years.The methods and suggestions depicted tiptoe between science and pseudoscience with no reference to studies whatsoever. I also can't help but notice that the documentary revolves around one person and his brand rather than the full range of approaches, definitions and meanings of trauma that exist, that a title like the above would lead me to expect.Unfortunately, for me it is a romanticised advertisement and awareness campaign rather than a documentary.",False
16,1,VERY VERY BAD AND POOR APPOACH,ioanna_duth,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dissapointing!!!!!!This film and the direction is so doctor focused that has been raised to an authentia just to balance the lack of really and focused knowledge for the abject of trauma. This is a total waste of time for those who have read AT LEAST ONE book of psychology. Is all an advertisment and nothing more .Please do not see it is very very bad justprefer a book even those articles in the internet say more than this......
This guy has no knowledge at all im so dissapointed from that i have read leaded me to see the film and also to pay 8 eyros for this. This guy is a true narcissist as all that they are not have anything to give.",False
17,1,Like watching a Cult leader and his followers,reinraf,n/a,15/08/2025,"As this was produced by a company called science and non-duality, I was expecting to hear about Advaita Vedanta (Hindu philosophy of non-duality) and modern science's response to human trauma and suffering. Instead, what I've got to see was a new age messiah who uses hallucinogenic drugs to treat his patients and makes one casual reference to Buddhism.If you are genuinely interested in true philosophy and real science, stay away from this. Zero science or philosophy, more like an advertisement for Gabor Mate. As a fellow Hungarian, I was keen to learn about Mr Mate but I would rather advise everyone to avoid him and his so called teachings.",False
18,1,The next big scale charlatan,b_velkova,n/a,15/08/2025,"Outrageous. Just outrageous. The next big scale charlatan. I was afraid he might disappoint but that's such an understatement of what he's doing.Extreme narcissist and a cunning manipulator, Gabor Mate becomes a doctor to make himself needed by the ill and now has extended his dependents to virtually everybody because who isn't traumatized? His own definition couldn't be more inclusive: ""For trauma to happen you don't need Second World War [...] You just need parents who are so alienated from their own gut feelings that they will let their infant cry without picking them up and that child is desperate for a relationship. That's all it takes.""Actually I agree with that and with a lot of the other stuff too. Yes, people disconnect from their feelings when they become overwhelming and develop all kinds of addictions (could be to drugs, alcohol, or food, but could also be to work, sports, or sex) to sustain the painless world they would prefer to live in. And, yes, authenticity means to stay in their pain instead.And here comes the trick. Because nobody in their right mind would prefer the pain, a bigger reward must be promised. Salvation is possible, says the holy doctor, outside your trauma the world is actually truly painless, you just have to follow the path I'm showing you, from rebirthing to social revolution... Or otherwise, get cancer.I deeply feel for the people who are filmed though, for they are so clearly residing at an even higher level of disconnection. Listening to their precious human stories told in pseudoscience terms truly breaks my heart. I almost lost my own story the same way and am still struggling to recover it.The film is airing till the end of the week, watch it at your own discretion.",False
19,4,An industry for rich weak people,sofianeca,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the same time so many not using words the same way. Words like trauma. So many places on our planet where you cannot biologically survive what the participants of this movie had survived. So many rough moments or even normal life called trauma here. Weak American > so many people. Too many. Why? No, I cannot accept that. Sorry. The buyers are going to buy with or without my comment, indeed.",False

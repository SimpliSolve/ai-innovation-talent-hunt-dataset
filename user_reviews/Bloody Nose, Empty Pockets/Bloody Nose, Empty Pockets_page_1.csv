1,6,"Beneath the Booze and Cigarette Smoke, There's a Heart",Jared_Andrews,n/a,15/08/2025,"Enter a Las Vegas dive bar on its final night before closing. The inhabitants are as shabby and unremarkable as you might expect, at first glimpse at least. When sticking around to observe them for an entire night, you begin to understand the humanity of these so-called societal rejects and failures. Sure, they might be unshowered, wreaking of booze and cigarettes, and unable to come up with a single answer to Jeopardy! but they are people who crave and deserve a sense of belonging just as much as any 9 to 5 office employee. There's a heart to this story that offers a dash of hope. Then the bar closes and everyone moves on.",False
2,6,"If something isn't an actual documentary, it shouldn't be categorized as such",Pdubbly,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sure it was believable and entertaining, but finding out afterwards that it wasn't a real documentary, changed the way I viewed it. For better or worse.",False
3,8,"Drop in and stay a while, then drop in again.",mmelocchi,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPark any and all biases you may harbor against Las Vegas, dive bars, drinking, smoking and even self-destruction in the parking lot and enter the Roaring 20s and stay a while. This movie is like a song you may not like the first time you hear it but love after hearing it again. I initially thought while watching it the first time that I would not come back to it prior to the Laemmle Theatre site 48-hour subscription's expiration. I was drawn in for a second viewing and saw how much I missed the first time. This movie looks, sounds and feels like a classic Frederick Wiseman documentary though with more heart. I'd like to marry Marc, the musician bartender in the first part of the film!",True
4,7,It's not a feelgood film,michielhagedoorn88,n/a,15/08/2025,They described it here as a feelgood film. It is not.,False
5,9,A mosaic of a film.,ppccaarr,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this film very believable and as a former bartender I know many people who could have been characters in a place like this. The film builds slowly in mosaic fashion and creates a multi-dimensional depiction of a so called ""third place"" that has real value in our increasingly corporate homogenized world. I really liked the film.",False
6,8,I miss bars,stephenstephenbyrne,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was initially kinda angry when I found out this wasn't a real documentary. I had this weird emotional dump. It's hard to describe but I felt cheated in a way.Thankfully though it also works as a regular narrative film, so I've gotten past them feelings and tried judging it based on that. A fictional film with mostly non-actors. And by them standards, it's still very very good. One of the best of the year actually. Which kinda begs the question, why did they even feel the need to try to sell it as a doc in the first place?",False
7,8,Very humanising,chrislawuk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Story of everday people, many of the characters wouldnt look out of place in a Charles Bukowski novel. There is a full spectrum of characters on display, all of whom are keen on using alcohol as a coping mechanism in their daily struggles. I love documentaries like this, especially as they age well. Be interesting for people to watch in years ahead. Its a slice of everyday life for working class people, and insight in to issues faced today. Emotions flow high and nobody holds back on unveiling their personal lives 100%, makes for an entertaining watch. Laughs, libidinous behaviour and arguments - bar Life.",False
8,8,WHAT A FANTASTIC FILM.,benighted2005,n/a,15/08/2025,"How do I even begin to write this review? Just wanted to chime in and say this off beat film is about a bar in Las Vegas closing down. The whole film focusses on patrons to the bars - alcoholics, middle aged people, unhappy people, people complaining about their lives, what could have been - all well behaved despite their fragile undercurrent. Loved, loved it.",False
9,1,it's not a documentary and it's not even in las vegas,howboutthisone_huh,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSpoiler alert!!! Nope. Google it yourself. It's not a documentary and the bar never existed in las vegas. It's not even a mockumentary, or a parody. This is just some low brow hipster production by some nits probably looking for a free vaca to vegas to shoot b-roll. I don't even understand why they bother with the charade except maybe to rag on whoever is stupid enough to believe any of this is true.I don't know what genre this movie is but it's genuinely unauthentic. There are some scenes shot in vegas but google it for yourself, the bar scenes were allegedly shot in new orleans and it's not even for certain, it's a real bar. It's certainly not staged right for a bar in las vegas. Where are the gaming machines? A bar in vegas without gaming machines is a closed bar. Where are the security cams? So you might be thinking what difference does it make, and you'd be right except the movie is also terribly boring and I couldn't help thinking somebody was making fun of me for watching this. Anyway, after a mins, I wanted to go to a real bar, in real vegas btw, and hang out with real people but many bars in my area are closed and those that are open, aren't worth the risk during the season of the 'C'. So, I had to settle with a few ones at home and my new friend, zoom.",True
10,9,My Kinds Bar,rdhjndm,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love my London pubs but wish I was American or atleast eligible to come visit the states and it's dive bars.Old school English pubs have a similar ambiance with drunks, middle class and has beens but there's something missing . The music culture perhaps or the vastness of the country which makes the bar a world of its own .. I'm still 258 characters short to leave a review so I want to ask where are the best dive bars in the states? New York? Vegas? Boston? Hopefully one day I can visit Rudys in NYC if it's still there. There are too many chains in the U. K. like Be At One and O'Neills, they aren't real bars.",False
11,1,Meh...smells like plagiarism,thejeta1,n/a,15/08/2025,This is not a pinch on Hotel Coolgardie. Which clearly these filmmakers copied the idea from...,False
12,4,What the heck did I just watch,tintuvjoe,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't watch this garbage.What the Sodom and Gomorrah crack sniffin movie is this? I am glad I didn't choose this to watch with my fam based on the ratings. The whole movie was the drag, kept skipping 30sec through entire thing, never changed. If this is considered as a movie I can make one this weekend. This is like those paintings that sells for thousands and all it is a white canvas with few dots in the center. And I can't ask why, it's art lol
They should've fallowed the black veteran dude around more, can't believe veterans get treated that way in this country. Saddd!",False
13,5,Not a Las Vegas Bar,jhamrick2-419-380671,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie and dive into the lives of these bar flies is fantastic! I love the story and watching people who love their neighborhood watering hole. However, this does not take place in Las Vegas. This bar has never existed in Las Vegas. There are a few pickup shots from the city, but everything else is filmed in Louisiana. As a Las Vegan born and raised, it took this movie from an 8 to a 5 very quickly. It's disappointing seeing a film try and fail so hard to capture what Las Vegas is really like.I recommend it for the human side. Attempting to set it in Las Vegas takes away more than it adds once you see it's not a Vegas Bar.",False
14,n/a,Nathan for you episode?,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,From all the reviews I'm reading... it's sounds like a movie version of an episode he did to get smoking back into bars.,False

1,10,Riveting. Possibly the best thing I've ever watched.,rorymccarthy-94675,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some may argue, that the ""troubles"" (too trivial a term for the ""Horrors"" they were) are past history, and to let it rest.No.You can learn from history, and hopefully avoid a repeat of it. (sadly due to human nature a faint hope).This series examined the history of people who were involved in, (and those not directly involved), who suffered as a result, through absolutely riveting interviews interspersed with well selected news items. The interviewees came across as being totally truthful with very little disingenuity. (In a very few areas I caught a whiff of BS)My background covers both sides involved, so a lot of the material was familiar to me. I do have an opinion on the root causes of the problem which allowed the ""Horrors"" to escalate, so perhaps at the start was viewing it in a slightly partisan way, but having watched this it's made it even clearer that no side ""won"". Everyone lost. Bravo to the team who made it.",False
2,9,First Class,thefish-30909,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow, what a find. First its a wonderful history of the ""troubles"" - if you want know the background of how it all started, the conflicting beliefs and views and where all the anger came from it does a great job. But the real tribute to this production is how it does it. Interviewing all sides, exploring all the different perspectives and revealing all the pain, anger and suffering on all sides. The futility of all this hate and violence, the unbearable suffering and pain inflicted by all parties on each other - the sheer waste of so much life. A truly remarkable insight into this terrible period of life in this part of the world. A must watch.",False
3,9,Essential,xmfbpy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Terrascotia has taken the trouble in this forum to make a strong argument against this series. I respect that person's point of view but I profoundly disagree with those conclusions.My wife and I finished watching the series last night and we have both urged our children and others to watch it. We are both 69 years old and lived through the events in Belfast and in Derry.I never felt that watching this was providing vicarious thrills. Rather I felt that this format presented vividly the experiences of individuals from different traditions in ways which seemed very fresh and honest. There was no attempt to provide a detailed history - this was done very well in the Spotlight series - here it was all about what the Troubles really meant to different people at the time and in retrospect. Some of it was very difficult to listen to but so worthwhile.Making it about individuals, not just 'sides'. I was grateful for this timely reminder of how awful things were / still are in some ways and especially for giving a voice to victims who tend to be conveniently forgotten in the rush to garner votes.",False
4,9,War without filter,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"We've all heard the story of how war, then eventually peace, came to Northern Ireland, usually told from the perspective of the major protagonists: the politicians, and the terrorists who became political leaders. Their self-justifications can feel over-familiar and self-serving. But this series interviews a collection of ordinary people, affected by the conflict in various ways, telling their stories with remarkable honesty. Instead of carefully crafted apologies and non-apologies, they tell us how it was to live through ""the troubles"". I found myself full of respect for many of these people, but understanding even of those who made choices that I hope I would never have done; and impressed by (but also seeing the limits of) the resilience of the human spirit. Even if you think you've had your fill of Northern Ireland documentaries, this one is well worth watching.",False
5,10,Emotional,Pat-a-kavanagh,n/a,15/08/2025,Growing up in 80s in Dublin this was just something that was happening on the news. This brought the reality home to me for the first time. Two hours up the road was so far away back then. This is possibly the most important thing I have ever watched on tv. Mind blowing insight into the ordinary peoples lives at the time. I knew all of these story's but not like this. The emotion of the people talking about the time and the journeys they have been on are incredible. This should be shown to kids all over the world to show how division in a community can bring such hate and murder to the most ordinary of people.,False
6,10,Informative,misspudding,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was born in the 70s and grew up as a child in the 80s in the United States. I am an American of primarily Northern Irish (and British) ancestry, and when hearing news stories about bombings and violence I remember thinking how horrible these people who could have easily been my family if they had stayed. But I was a kid it was across the pond so whatever so I forgot five minutes after heading the news story.I thought the approach to the film, a 5 part series of slow interviews, was a snooze fest at first. But as you watch the series, you realize how the Troubles went from isolated events that didn't register to families and communities being torn apart. It really builds and drives home the point that these were just ordinary people.Really enjoyed this and learned a lot.",False
7,8,Worth a watch,baggieboinger,n/a,15/08/2025,"I very much enjoyed this series.I remember as a child watching the nightly news reports on the conflict and growing up in England, how we were targets for the IRA.Many British cities were targeted by the IRA, including my own, in the Birmingham pub bombings.The participants interviewed provided their view on events in Northern Ireland. Recollections from UDA, IRA, UFF and members of the British army, amongst others, are provided.I felt their views came across as honest. There are many harrowing recollections of family members murdered by different factions and how they themselves took part in murder and bombings.It also shows how people can change and how the Irish population were eventually ground down by the whole thing. Thankfully, the peace process was eventually achieved.The conflict will stay in my memory as a horrible dirty war, with atrocities carried out by all sides, and for what?",False
8,10,An Outstanding Look Back At My Childhood,Big-Bad-Barry,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't grow up in Northern Ireland, although the news throughout my childhood was dominated by events in Ulster.This series is one of the best 'oral history' programmes I've seen. It's like a mini 'World at War' for the 70s, 80s and 90s in Northern Ireland. It features primary accounts from those involved in 'The Troubles' on all sides with the benefit of hindsight.I watched it with my kids who enthralled. They were horrified at the atrocities that took place in a corner of the United Kingdom just a generation ago. It provided a hard hitting context the the lessons they're taught at school which will hopefully prevent this from happening again.",False
9,9,"Was Glad I Saw This, But Very Sad to Watch",asc85,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was growing up during the time of The Troubles, but I live in America, and I am not Irish, so while I was aware of all of this going on, the immediacy was never there. Also, being an American, there are not a lot of things out there to watch and learn more about The Troubles. Maybe this documentary just barely scratches the surface for some, but for me, it was a very educational experience.As others have noted, I was also taken aback (but in a good way) at the rawness, authenticity, honesty and the ability to self-reflect of most of the people in this documentary, both Catholics and Protestants alike who discussed their experiences. To me, this was as balanced and down-the-middle as humanly possible, and I also appreciated that very much.",False
10,9,Incredibly Honest,frjosephmcgilloway,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the best documentaries I have seen on just about any subject. However, I know this subject well, so I can confirm the stories are true. They are told from the perspective of those who experienced the events, and told with incredible honesty. Even when I disagreed fundamentally with the perspective, I still found myself convinced of the honesty of the storyteller.My only niggling concern was the lack of a detailed explanation on how Northern Ireland came about - British imperialism. The UK is to Ireland what Russia is to the Ukraine...400 years after the invasion.To this day England does not understand Ireland. To this day England has a sense of right to be in a country not made by human maps, but by geography itself - it is a separate island, with a native people. In this documentary the Irish are still being referred to as 'terrorists' by the same people who are currently supplying ammunition to the Ukrainian fight for sovereignty. Contradiction???",False
11,10,A rare European war,kevincraw,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary was worth the PBS membership alone. As an Irish American (Catholic), I knew a little about the conflict but was ignorant of of the facts around the significant events of The Troubles. The producers show how political disagreements in the late 60s early 70s devolve from peaceful protests into roving street brawls at first, and a decade(s) long tit-for- tat campaign of violence. I especially liked the perspectives of the common British soldiers patrolling the street. I knew about the ""dirty protest"" from the movie In The Name of the Father but the documentary shows it in all its graphic detail. Truly revolting but a window into the brutality of the conflict.The film depicts the constant string of bombings in horrifying graphic detail, made even bleaker when set against the backdrop of cloudy weather, grainy 70s film color, and the post modern architecture of late 70s Northern Ireland.Some of the interviewees break down when discussing the past. I had no skin in this conflict but if I did this film would have devastated me.A masterpiece.",True
12,6,Feels a tad hastily put together,JurijFedorov,n/a,15/08/2025,"It seems like people from certain regions love documentaries from their region. But the question should be if this is the best way to introduce The Troubles to outsiders and it's not. Mainly it's hard to really understand what is happened what year and where. They could show an IRA terrorist attack then show a map with a dot on it. Maybe zoom in after showing it then show the photos and videos of the attack. Always have a year for everything. It's can be quite jarring to have David Cameron respond to Bloody Sunday and then Margaret Thatcher respond in the next scene. Are we just flying all over the place here?When talking about multiple attacks in the same city they just mention it's multiple bombs. How many? How many died in each explosion? We never find out. Obviously if you know about all this stuff already then the extremely emotional interviews is all you need. But newcomers will be quite confused and the thick Irish accents don't always help. They overly focus on these modern day interviews that often fully take over. Instead of having a narrator they just use such interviews and are afraid of even narrating simple facts which does make the history here extremely hazy. I get it's an emotional and controversial topic, but when it's so emotional you are too afraid to even explain things properly it becomes an issue. They try to not say anything to always stay fair. And indeed this part is fully archived as both sides will feel it's fair. But that's not hard to be if you just avoid having a narrator and skip over most historical facts.They also interview quite a few IRA members that often praise terrorist attacks and at times wish they had killed more people as they absolute hate British cops and politicians. It feels a bit brutal when we for example see an off-duty cop visit his newborn at the hospital and get shot and killed in the parking lot. Shot in the back without even trying to harm or attack anyone. And the killer got 2 years in prison for it because of a political deal with IRA. It makes it unclear what the themes or morals are here? Some IRA members starved themselves to death in prison to be considered political prisoners instead of regular criminals. As they saw their cause as an act of war against a brutal regime. But shooting a man out of uniform is typically a war crime. So are they soldiers fighting for their country or just plain criminals? Some of the bombs also only harmed civilians. Again hard to understand what the goal even is? To make them so afraid they will vote for Sinn Fein or move back to England? The documentary could at least have tried to get into morals, values, and ideas. What is the plan here?The pro British side for sure come off better here as they are cops or military men constantly appealing to fairness, non-violence, and democracy. The pro Ireland side is represented by terrorists. I'm not sure this ends up as being fair to both sides. ""Killing people is fine"" is surely not what most Irish people think about political conflicts otherwise their elections would be a tad more spicy.From this it does seem like a Northern Irish problem. Ireland the country is barely mentioned. The Catholic Irish are mentioned as IRA supporters in Northern Ireland. Living in poorer conditions and feeling marginalized so they rebel helping out IRA members if they need to hide weapons or flee cops. Meanwhile the richer Protestants are quite British. But it's not quite clear what the goal of IRA even is here. They claim they want greater voting power and maybe join the rest of Ireland but it all feels hollow when the goals are not really aimed at improving conditions or focusing on certain proud values. It feels like terrorist attacks for the sake of terrorist attacks. The biggest political party in Northern Ireland today is Sinn Fein. The party that represented IRA politically. So whatever the voters want this is a legit way to join Britain, EU, Ireland, or become independent. They have all roads open to them via their voices and the Irish side in Northern Ireland has just as much support as the pro British side.Each death here is presented as a disaster. But it's a shame IRA interviews and talking points are not really showing much emotional care. Then again if you join a group to plant bombs in civilian areas maybe you won't ever grow an advanced emotional repertoire no matter how noble the underlying cause is. They do show outrage when it pertains to their own religion and family being harmed, but not much else. Unlike former ISIS members they are still proud of their actions seeing it as essential freedom fighter actions.",False
13,5,Troubles Not So Far Away,Lejink,n/a,15/08/2025,"In deference to the balanced content of this five-part BBC documentary on the Troubles which overtook Ireland and more particularly Northern Ireland in the late 60's, my assessment of it is straight down the middle.The idea is simple, get individual members of the public to speak candidly about their experiences of the times and illustrate them with contemporary TV news footage and presumably let the viewers make up their own minds as to whether the actions of both sides of the religious divide and indeed those in government and upholding the law were right or wrong. There are no ""expert"" retrospective summaries by talking heads, we are simply taken through the years from the commencement in October 1968, with remembrances of most, but not all, of the most significant events of the times leading up to the Good Friday Agreement of April 1998, which saw an end, at least for the most part, to hostilities on either side.What certainly comes over time and again is the way everyone adapted to the hellish ""new normal"" of the times, with bombings and murder an almost everyday occurrence. Every interviewee has a point of view and many are even now sensitive to showing themselves in public admitting to things they did or were party to in the past. Sat in front of the camera, with only a few promptings by the director, they revisit the traumatic times through which they lived.Many of their tales are absolutely horrendous, with people on both sides justifying to themselves even today some of the terrible things done in the name of a cause. For me the film just showed how easily even ordinary people can lower themselves to barbaric and repulsive acts of torture and murder. All will say they did so for their country or more particularly their vision and version of their country even if that meant cold-bloodedly shooting or blowing up innocent people because they disagree with you or even just have a different religion.I was both repelled and compelled to watch these remembrances and must admit that some of the atrocities recounted I either didn't know about or had forgotten about. It's not for me to judge these people but even now, when most of the violence, bar the actions of some extremists, has receded into the past, it's clear that very few of the participants here have any feelings of regret or forgiveness in their hearts.I found the programmes very depressing and difficult to watch. I do think I would have better appreciated a more documentary approach to this admittedly difficult subject showing more of a political context and overview of what was happening and why.I was growing up at the same time as the Troubles in a city, Glasgow, which has a particular connection to the sectarian divide of Northern Ireland, meaning that much of what I saw and heard was very relatable. Would I have gone down the same poisonous route as so many did across the Irish Sea, well I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have and I just wondered at times watching grim interview after grim interview if the producers couldn't have found more members of the public who took no side in the conflict and denigrated the actions of the paramilitaries on either side.What the programmes did show above all else was how easily humanity can fall to acts of barbarity and cruelty especially if it's under a flag, even a national flag, of convenience.",False
14,10,A Film About Destinies...,Mika_US,n/a,15/08/2025,"Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland is a deeply moving documentary. Its masterful blend of historical analysis and personal stories allows the viewer to see the conflict in Northern Ireland from many different perspectives.The film offers a unique perspective on the events that shaped this difficult history and gives a voice to those who lived through it. Eyewitness interviews and archival footage create a powerful atmosphere, immersing us in a reality that is sometimes forgotten.The directors' work deserves praise for its balance and objectivity, as well as its sensitivity in highlighting the feelings and experiences of people living in this region. Once Upon a Time in Northern Ireland is not just a documentary, but an important lesson in peace, tolerance and hope for the future.",False
15,3,The Trouble(s) Weren't Worth It.,torrascotia,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yet again we have another documentary about the so called troubles in Northern Ireland, this time using a talking heads approach.It outlines how the IRA kicked off the troubles by murdering two off duty British Army men, who were there on a peacekeeping mission to protect the population from harm.What it shows is that a civil rights movement was hijacked by terrorist extremists who wanted to start a tit for tat killing spree which lasted around 30 years, because their stated goal of leaving UK rule simply wasn't going to happen by force.Of course many idealistic people engaged in the violence which was directed by those at the top. And this is where the limitations of the series start to show. Firstly there is little analysis of the events, its focus is on personal experience. Secondly the only people involved here are either innocent victims of the violence or those at the bottom of the command chain.The problem with the first omission is context, while the second misses the voice of those directing the violence and why.As a result you do not actually learn anything about the troubles, its more of a vicarious thrill for some to hear the war stories. This is potentially problematic because for one there is always the potential for these problems to start again and there is also the fact that some, particularly in Scotland, the troubles are enjoyed as entertainment in some circles.Its obvious for this show that nothing was actually achieved politically from any of the violence, things only happened once that stopped. It was also obvious that many didn't want the violence to stop. Some were happy at the ongoing carnage and these were the people calling the shots as was said by one of the participants. Without access to these individuals the documentary is two dimensional and is mainly an emotional experience piece without focus. Its quite repetitive and simply too long for what it is. Better editing and analysis is needed for this to have a high rating. It seems people are overly excited about hearing stories from people who planted bombs etc they have lost the ability to critically think about this series. There is an Imperial War Museum doc on the same issues on YouTube which is superior and won't take up six hours of your life. Check that instead.",False
16,1,This doc is biased.,dcnseancostello,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hard to watch. It is clear that the documentarians have a bias in their reporting. It's sad how they gloss over Bloody Sunday. No acknowledgement of the fact that it was a peaceful protest that was set up as a firing squad shooting at children by a military that was supposedly sent in to protect them. It is disappointing that they go into great lengths of the IRA's part in the Disappeared, but no mention to the UDA's similar acts. It is clear that there is a bias towards the unionists. I pray that peace continues, but we cannot rewrite history. I would encourage anyone who watches this to watch Bobby Sands: 66 Days. It will give a more complete picture.",False

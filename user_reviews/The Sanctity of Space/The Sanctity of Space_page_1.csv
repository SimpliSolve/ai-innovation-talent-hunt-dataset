1,10,Wonderful tribute to the life of Bradford Washburn and a wild first ascent in Alaska,andrewmarquisxyz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film goes far beyond most of the climbing and adventure films of late, delving into the backstory of Bradford Washburn's life and contributions to modern mountaineering, science, cartography, and aerial photography. His passion for all of these endeavors and his lifelong love of his wife set a benchmark for a life lived fully that for many reasons will never be repeated. The climbing in this film and years of effort and obstacles that it took to accomplish this objective is wholly inspiring whether you're an adventurer or not. Kudos to Freddie and Renan for bringing this 15 year quest of adventure, filming, research, and homage to us.",False

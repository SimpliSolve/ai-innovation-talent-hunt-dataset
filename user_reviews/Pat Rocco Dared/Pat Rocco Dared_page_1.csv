1,8,Good documentary of a gay film pioneer,chong_an,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pat Rocco was an early gay pioneer who made erotic (but not pornographic) films, often with his subjects ending up naked, kissing and caressing. He also put his talents to use in documenting the early gay liberation movement, including parades and speeches by Harvey Milk. Here, Charlie David ""interviews"" him - or lets Rocco take us down memory lane, as we are shown clips of Rocco's films. There are interviews with other analysts, and documentation of Rocco's other charitable work.I liked the clips, both as illustration of what he had done, and as a way of avoiding the talking head syndrome. As Rocco was before my time, I am happy to get to know him and his work.",False
2,7,"Beautiful men, interupted by talking heads",baygelldawg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pat Rocco made movies. Way back when. And they featured beautiful men. And the beautiful men were frolicking, walking through the woods, holding hands, kissing, and caressing each other. The affection, romance, and pure beauty of the men is still an amazing statement today. No tattoos, no piercings, no waxed and shaved bodies, no dirty talk or rough treatment. These men love and respect themselves and each other.The filmmakers interivewed Pat Rocco shortly before he died and found vintage footage of him to include in this tribute. Unfortunately, they also recorded interviews with ""experts"" to tell the audience what to think and how to react. The unintentional incongruity between the appearances of the ""experts"" and the men in Pat Rocco's movies shows how far we have strayed from our natural bodies in an effor to be ""edgy"" or fashionable.It would have been far better to let Pat Rocco's romantic, playful, joyous work speak for itself instead of bombarding viewers with folks telling us that this work was groundbreaking, important, etc. Don't you think we can see that for ourselves?The added interviews make the movie feel padded. Repeating some of the vintage footage only adds to this feeling. And it is a shame because there must have been hours of additional shots they could have used instead of showing us the same clips two or three times.If you are a gay man, treat yourself to this movie if you can find it. But you might want to fast forward through the talking heads.",False
3,8,Pat Rocco was a revolutionary.,devinbundy-80058,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an entertaining and informative documentary. I did not know films like what Pat Rocco created existed, especially in the sixties! They are X-rated, yes, but they seemed more tasteful, artsy, than the more hard core X-rated. Pat Rocco was a revolutionary. Not only creating gay-positive art, but also fighting for gay rights, starting charities and shelters for gay teens. He was a cornerstone for gay rights. A trail blazer, he paved the way for others who wanted to create gay-positive films, photography, art. A real pioneer. I want to see these films brought to life. What a hard working and special guy.",False
4,10,Great documentary!,xogorel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed so much this well deserved tribute to a courageous artist that made a great statement of freedom, love and art with his films. Charlie David made a wonderful job in this documentary that showed us Pat Rocco's story in such beautiful interviews, images and sequences. In my opinion, Pat Rocco was able to make his vision and his dream a reality that contributed hugely to the liberties we have now, and this documentary is an accurate reflection of his legacy and all the barriers he needed to demolish to succeed. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn about our past, to improve our future. A great movie!",False
5,9,A Very Moving Documentary,trioseven,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pat Rocco was an artist, a visionary, an advocate. And after watching Charlie David's documentary ""Pat Rocco Dared"", it's clear to me, Mr. Rocco was also one heck of a fine person.Wow, what a ton of natural charm! The documentary is filled with scenes of Pat Rocco serenading Mr. David with ""Cheer Up Charlie"", laughing over memories of his friends and coworkers, and sharing some of his most memorable film clips.It's a treat to get an inside look at where Charlie David drew some of his inspiration. ""Pat Rocco Dared"" is a beautifully presented, informative, and personal tribute to a very important person in our history.",False
6,8,!! Important History !!,thebarksdales,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another fantastic documentation of the queer community by Charlie David.Pat Rocco was a visionary, an artist, an advocate; a servant even. Overall a seemingly fine example of humanity, Pat was an incredible person who deserves to be remembered for his trailblazing filmmaking and LGBTQ+ activism.I'll be completely honest in admitting that {before watching this documentary} I knew very little regarding Pat Rocco. However I enjoy everything I've ever seen by Charlie David and am always looking to educate myself more regarding LGBTQ+ history ... 'Pat Rocco Dared' was an absolute #winwin for me!!",False
7,10,Fascinating Life,bellabarratt,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'd never given much thought to the first male/male kiss in cinematic history. And I certainly had never thought about the artistic representation of homosexuality on the big screen.Charlie David's new documentary about Pat Rocco opened my eyes to so many different things. Not just Pat's films - but to his activism, his charitable works and, I think most importantly, his 45 year relationship to his husband David.I enjoyed the clips of the films, of course, but I really found the discussions between Charlie and Pat the most engaging. I'm so glad Charlie got such great footage.This documentary is for anyone who loves cinema, gay representation, or just to see a trailblazer in action. I highly recommend it.",False
8,10,Excellent Documentary!,ajhomeu,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary film gives a glimpse of the history that much of North America is unaware exists. Charlie David, an actor, producer, director, and audiobook narrator interviews Pat Rocco, an iconic filmmaker that documented the Queer community through various film media beginning in the late 1960s, combining art and activism.As a cis/Black female in my 50s, I think it is abhorrent that people in the LGBTQ community do not have all of the rights afforded other groups in the U. S. Why not?Pat Rocco furthered the cause of LGBTQ rights as a true pioneer. He showed that ""love is love"" during a time when police harrassment of the LGBTQ community was rampant (and often expected) in Los Angeles, one of the most liberal cities in the United States. I highly recommend that you watch this very well-made and entertaining documentary!",False
9,10,Many delights in this one,idasue,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had been curious about this since I saw it available for streaming and when offered the opportunity to review it for Gay Romance Reviews, I jumped at the chance. I enjoyed it so much, I purchased it. There were lots of things I enjoyed but three things made me purchase it to watch again. First, the personality of Pat Rocco and his enthusiasm for making movies was infectious and a joy to watch. Second, it was wonderful to know that during those times, he was making films where gay characters were in love and happy rather than as they were depicted in so much fiction of the time as having to die, be the villains or have other awful things happen to them. Finally, I lived in LA during several of the years depicted in the films and the biographical parts about Rocco's life and it was surprisingly moving to relive those times through the shots in this film. A joy to watch all the way around.",False

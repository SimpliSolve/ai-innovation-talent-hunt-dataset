1,10,History repeating,whotheff,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows how Bulgarian people perceived the end of WW2 through by old historic records. In a well structured way it shows details which were long forgotten or masked by the followed communist regime. I wish more Bulgarians could see it so they can avoid repeating the same mistake. Excellent work by the archivist who gathered all the document data and historic video. This documentary also contains a lot of old, black and white footage from that period (1944).",False

1,8,Surrounded by Idiots,rebelphotollc,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just finished watching ""Gary"" on Peacock. In reviewing the documentary, I can honestly say he was surrounded by idiots his entire life. Starting with his parents, Being available, but not being fully integrated on what was going on from a financial and personal perspective in your child's life.He made the money, all they had to do was make sure it was being allocated correctly. I'm not sure why they could not have picked up a book to read on entertainment business or even hire someone to teach them entertainment business. Or even hire people to run quarterly audits. There's no way $18 million should have just vanished. Second, the wife he married was a complete dimwit and soulless individual, she isn't even a real person. Thirdly, The realist person that was in Gary's life seem to have been Dion.",False
2,8,Informative yet infuriating,chris_rowe-881-168820,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen after 10 minutes you realise the ""shock main guest"" is potentially someone who ended the man's life, I feel entertainment hits really murky waters. The woman does herself no favours, she's so cold, she remembers the practiced words to look loving but she's about as uncaring as satan.The story itself is interesting, I know a lot about the different strokes years and all the troubles for all 3 kids, like his ex wife I felt Howard Sterns show and callers were the last straw for poor Dana Plato who was manipulated for her looks and lived an awful drug riddled existence till age 34. Willis although looking well and caring, had some dark times,But Gary had a life of misery really, from pain and poor health, to a helping drug literally killing your growth and puffing your cheeks out, it sounds like a marvel film making the hero, it gave him an iconic run on two shows, which haunted his existence and to which he got no money from.Gary desperately looked everywhere for love and was obviously intense, none of the relationships seemed organic or healthy, only a few friends seemed what you'd expect, the blockbuster employee and his manager were the only two who cared.He was wired differently and wasn't into the physical but due to his rotten parents stealing all his money and acting stupid, he had scars ontop of scars. The parents knew, the dad taking about demons, guy seemed insane, the lies were easily see through, amazed they got away with it all, I know the later case but don't think it helped.From then in it's just the cold dead eyed wife, no one heart no compassion and no one to advise her how bad she looks doing this. That 911 call summed it up, poor guy died from hate, when all he wanted was love.Best kid actor ever
Iconic show
Tragic end.",True
3,n/a,Did Gary Coleman think he was 'God's punching bag?',n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Back in 1978, when Gary Coleman was 10 years old, author Scott Peck published his book, ""The Road Less Traveled."" One of his famous quotes is, ""Life is difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths. It is a great truth because once we truly see this truth, we transcend it.""Gary Coleman had a difficult life and he had a hard time transcending it. He once questioned if he was ""God's punching bag."" He had an illness requiring him to have a kidney transplant when he was only five, and medication which gave him a puffy face and an adult shortness of only 4 feet 7 inches.Even though I never met him I had a connection. Back when IMDb still had discussion threads Coleman and I ended up commenting on the same thread and we also directed comments to each other. Nice comments and I remember thinking how unusual it was to be trading messages with a famous actor.Now, seeing this biographical sketch streaming on Peacock, I understand what was happening to Coleman during his 30s and beyond. No longer the childhood star he found it increasingly difficult to get acting roles. He had living expenses, he resorted to several things including working as a security guard, a job that landed him in court after punching someone who made a rude comment.Coleman's difficulties were compounded by the people around him, even though by one count he was paid $18Million over his glory years several people skimmed money, including his parents, and as a struggling adult saw most of the money gone. With good financial management he should have been set for life.Coleman was smart and articulate but in many ways also immature. He put too much trust in others and did not take enough interest in his own business until it was too late.This program uses many old clips of Coleman himself, some on TV shows or movies, some as himself in interviews. Plus clips from interviews with his parents, agents, and friends. I found it interesting and a worthwhile viewing.",False
4,7,GONE TOO SOON...!,masonfisk,n/a,15/08/2025,"A 2024 doc about the short, successful but ultimately life of one Gary Coleman. Being probably one of the most recognizable & successful young actors of his generation when he got his role on Diff'rent Strokes (a groundbreaking sitcom which posited a white rich man who adopts 2 black kids) where his catchphrase 'whatcha talking about...?' became a pop culture trigger but after his own health issues (his kidney transplant at a young age pretty much stunted his growth & kept him perennially diminutive), the sheen of his role soon wore on him. Another personal issue would come about when his parents annexed Coleman's monies for failed ventures which prompted him to sue them partnered w/his questionable nuptials w/a much younger & to be honest immature woman leaving the last few years of life anything but pleasant. Using talking head interviews w/the people who knew him & copious clips of the man himself, you can't help but feel sympathy for this man who gave so much of himself to entertain others.",False
5,6,Stuck In Height & A Hit TV Show . . . .,sundayatdusk-97859,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've read about Gary Coleman throughout the years, but never had much interest in him, and never watched his TV show. Thus, I did not know if I would watch this entire documentary. I ended up having no problem watching it until the end. The doc moved along nicely and wasn't repetitious. It does offer some good insight into his life, but not enough to make it more than a sympathetic look, lacking in critical observations.For example, why did Gary Coleman choose to marry the woman he married and still live with her after they divorced? She was a not-too-bright user who hit him, just as he hit her. With his fame and medical condition, he could have easily found a kind, nurturing woman, such as a nurse, to marry; who would have dedicated her life to supporting and taking care of him. Did he want to keep feeling like a victim, and replay over and over again the way he felt others used him?His parents were interviewed and they weren't portrayed as the demons some think they were. His first agent was interviewed and he also did not come across badly. His best friend was constantly interviewed, and there seemed nothing nefarious about their friendship, even though his father had his suspicions. The only one who came across badly was his ex-wife, but I somewhat doubt she was responsible for his death. The two of them were a trainwreck waiting to happen, and you don't need a person to cause a trainwreck.",False
6,7,Gary Coleman was so much more,bcirilli,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've got mixed feelings about this documentary. Partly because it's stated multiple times throughout that he wanted peace and to leave celebrity behind. But, the true point of it was to show just how talented he was and that he was so much more than his infamous character Arnold. He was let down by so many people, including the public, who refused to see him any other way.This documentary highlights his health condition, his talent, his relationships, and the people who either truly or possibly loved him. That's for each one of us watching to decide. I'm leaving it with the point of the documentary. He was so very talented and it was so unfortunate that he never had the opportunity to show us his full range.",False
7,9,A different drumbeat beyond the iconic Arnold,Rodrigo_Amaro,n/a,15/08/2025,"This examination on the late child actor Gary Coleman (1968-2010) offers a full view on the many controversies surrounding his life and career,
and just a few glimpses about his work and talent. To the most devoted fans who expect to see a lot from his moments of glory, humor and the perks of
fame, you won't be seeing much of those in ""Gary"". Peacock followed family and friends, colleagues, lawyers and agents, and no one outside of his inner
circle to present the viewer's perspective in seeing a talented and charismatic child dominating the screen in the incredible ""Diff'rent Strokes"" and
other smaller projects. But to the ones who follow rise and fall and controversies of an actor, this one offers a full view that doesn't disappoint
and it generates curiosity in those who don't know much about Gary.What dominates this special are the countless dramatic moments that followed Coleman, either dealing with parents and agents
who micromanaged his career and finances to a critical point, where the actor was being literally robbed by nearly everyone around him. It's sad to
say it, but it's the usual textbook that followed many child actors/artists through decades (rare these days, but still happens). But seeing the scope
of things, what happened to an already frail kid with many health issues, and that ""fate"" of dealing with untrsuty people followed him even when he got married later on, it's tragic.The presence of his parents, the wife and the agent who profitted of him can revolt the most sensitive viewer - I was in total disbelief seeing
their ""serious"" act on screen. Gotta have a lot of nerve.But it also follows his true loyal friends who helped him out whenever needed (Dion Mial,
who later became his manager after a falling out with a previous agent, shares many amazing stories of genuine friendship. Lucky folks might have
a buddy like him). Co-star Todd Bridges and a few others who worked on ""Diff'rent Strokes"" offer the good stories from behind the scenes of the show,
and some serious ones concerning Coleman's dad bossing around on the set.I can't offer a view of Gary Coleman as a fan since I know very little about him, in fact I only know him because of that show (called ""Arnold"" in
here) which had a re-run a lot later but very popular to audiences. I didn't know about the whole issue concerning his death and the foul play suspicious on the
ex-wife, and that really took me by surprise. But if comparing with other documentaries made about important personalities, I can understand the criticism
and rejection some viewers will have with this project since it's too downer and focused on gossips or ""he said/she said"", and very little about his work
and attempts to rebuild his career outside of the Arnold Jackson character. We have plenty of great clips of his TV and cinema work, but without the input
from critics or artists who were inspired by Coleman, there's something missing to understand one of the greatest TV icons of the 1970's-1980's.Yet I was thrilled with it. It was a quite emotional journey with many surprising facts, dramatic moments and some humored as well - I couldn't resist
laughing at his loan/credit commercial where he was poking fun of his downer financial problems. And viewers can take a closer look at Coleman that goes
beyond Arnold: the funny kid; the brave kid who loved his work and continued with it despite being sick; the young man who struggled a lot, almost gave up
of everything when things weren't going his way, made some mistakes but kept going facing the obstacles. It's mostly a downer, but there are inspiring moments that can make
you look at things in a positive way, and just be critical of this fame thing and how it ruins bright talents who aren't sheltered with a great support
network. As Mial says, this was a cautionary tale. 9/10.",False
8,10,"Very moving, sad story",xWRL,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interviews with many of the people closest to Coleman, notably his ex-wife and his longtime former agent and manager, along with his closest and dearest friends, who state the case for why that first group was responsible for a life that Coleman him expressed as being full of misery.The film is very well edited, especially given all the ground it covers and the huge differences among those interviewed about who's to blame for what. The film also shows a beautiful degree of compassion for all that Coleman went through in his life without covering up a few of the times when he exhibited questionable behavior.",False
9,4,Sad story that is lacking in depth,phae_dra,n/a,15/08/2025,For an excellent behind the scenes view of what Gary was really like on the set of Diffrent Strokes I highly recommend reading Todd Bridges biography. Todd provides a lot of detail and context that was sorely missing from this documentary. The majority of people know Gary Coleman from DS. Yet much of his experiences on the show was glossed over in this documentary. The behavior of his parents on set was legendary. Particularly his father--although his Mother was very much a stage mother. It is a sad and familiar story. Why so much screen time was given to his ex-wife is bewildering as she didn't know him very long and she was clearly a just another leech in a long line of leeches--who sucked the money and life out of Coleman. Her 911 call was suspect IMO giving details in a calm voice while there is blood everywhere and your boyfriend is unresponsive? Strange.,False
10,8,A sad and cautionary tale,mandelaalum,n/a,15/08/2025,"I grew up watching Gary Coleman since I was a baby. In particular, the sitcom Diff'rent Stroke was a family favourite. This documentary help shed light to the up and downs of this young man who could have still been alive to this day.It is a cautionary tale in that he could have enjoyed the millions that he worked hard over the years yet as a minor (and I somewhat do not blame him for this), he had to entrust his money to a group of individuals who took advantage of him. It is even worse that he was Black.His story is a cautionary tale never to entrust one's money to individuals who at the end will take advantage of you.",False
11,5,So bland,dmzdhdyn,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerThis documentary is so bland. They reuse the same music over and over again.There are so many unanswered questions and this is so open ended.It's such a tragic story and it's so sad people didn't treat him any better.Gary I hope you are at peace now.If it's true that his parents did what they did it's an abomination.The whole documentary though just feels like such a cheap telling of his life.I would say skip it unless you really really want to watch it.Again it's such a cheap feeling documentary like he see on one of those free streaming servicesGary you deserved so much better.,True
12,3,Not enough material and not that interesting,RIK-22,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerYet another documentary that tries to drag out a 45-minute story into 90 minutes.Basically, a child star, with some serious health issues, gets taken advantage of financially by his very naive parents and their business partners.Its not really a surprise that any child star struggles with becoming a non-famous adult, its more the norm than the exception.No mention of Gary's personal mishandling of his money though. According to this documentary he lost around 40% to 50% of his money, but that still left him about 8m, which is a decent amount, so how he ended up broke, is not covered.They drag out his last relationship and his death for quite a long time. They try to raise some suspicions around his death, but don't offer any real evidence to prove either way if it was an accident or not.If I understood correctly, he was able to communicate after the accident, so wouldn't he have said something.Edit: Grammar correction.",True
13,4,What is this documentary talking about?,joebloggscity,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's something very uncomfortable about this documentary on the turbulent life of the precocious talent that was Gary Coleman. For a generation he was loved wherever his flagship show ""Different Strokes"" was shown, and broke down various barriers without even needing to try but just be himself.The reality was that behind the curtains, it was all another story and this documentary is meant to be trying to reveal the reality. However, as Gary Coleman has passed away, we are left to rely on a series of contributors whom we are wholly left mostly unconvinced by their sincerity or honesty in their recalling of the young man.It makes the entire documentary difficult watch, as we know that he was a maturing male stuck in the body of young boy.Like many others, I was charmed by Gary Coleman in his heyday and loved his exuberance & humour. Sad to see how life transpired for him and certain of his peers.This documentary probably on what they had on hand, should have been buried. If it's meant to reveal the truth, I'm not sure any judge would be able to give a final judgement on what was presented.Give this a miss I think, and really maybe now let's leave Gary Coleman to rest in peace.",False

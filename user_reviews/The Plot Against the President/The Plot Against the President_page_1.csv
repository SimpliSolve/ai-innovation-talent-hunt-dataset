1,6,Funny how 85% of the ratings gave either 1 or 10 to this documentary,Xori,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not America, but the rating on this really shows the divide in America at this time. This clearly is a right wing documentary, but it doesn't necessary means everything in it is wrong, since left wing media had its fair share of propaganda too. You just have take it with a grain of salt and do your own research. Let's hope the next few months are peaceful and healing because a great nation like America does not need this right now.",False
2,4,if this is...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Supposed to clarify what really happened in the 2016 election, over alleged russian connections, insider inside insiders inside, crooked fbi bosses and protocols, dizzy dossiers, lured gop's or dpc's, where the cia and nsa and dic, and even pence making a pound against the most alleged poisounous of all, the general over all generals in charge of intelligence ,flynn... well then you must look somewhere else, cause this complicates the simplefact .if you like documentaries with 100's of different comments of halftruths, have a go, not for me the grumpy old man",False
3,6,Good content. Presentation could be better.,Larry-R,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the various tiny pieces of content are solid in and of themselves, I don't think they're stitched together into a clear story, although It might be fine for a viewer who already has a clear understanding of everything to see some people involved talking about it. The biggest criticism I have besides the lack of clarity was the unnecessary, distracting and counterproductive interview clips of some sort of shadowy hidden figure with a masked voice; the last thing this story needs is more anonymous sources.",False
4,n/a,Never Again,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone rating this a ""1"" clearly did not watch it. They obviously based it on pure emotion out of their hatred for the former President. So let's get out of the way that I am an Independent with liberal, conservative, and moderate positions depending upon the subject.You know like MOST Americans.Now as I was watching this, Edward Snowden came to mind. This was precisely the type of thing he did not want to happen, sacrificing everything to prevent it. And here we have a President who was clearly the victim of it. If they can do this to the President of the United States absolutely no one is immune. Doesn't matter the political affiliation, race, gender, religion, or ethnicity. That, more than anything else, should be the takeaway here. Once a Monster is created no one can control it. That means sooner or later it will be coming for you too.Pretending it did not occur, or cheering because it happened to someone you do not like is absolutely insane.",False
5,9,Chilling.....,flicklover,n/a,16/08/2025,I found this documentary by chance because it was not promoted at all upon its release. I get why the major media networks would ignore it. It is very much an indictment if the way that they have behaved in the last 4 years.It is a very straightforward documentary told from the point of view of congressman Devin Nunes. It chronicles his investigation of the various attempts to link the new Trump administration with collusion with Russia in the 2016 election. It also deals heavily with the framing of General Michael Flynn. The film contends that he was a threat to the intelligence community as the incoming National Security Advisor to the new president. It is pointed out by the very people involved how this man was railroaded and how the FBI obtained FISA warrants through lying and omission. The interviews are very straightforward and informative. It is truly disturbing that the beauracracy can wield the power to ruin someone and undermine a president. But the film takes big issue with the media. How the media was complicit in pushing the narrative of corruption and Russia collusion to hurt President Trump. The way that they took any story that would hurt the President and push it without caring if there was any evidence at all to support the allegations. It is truly disturbing to see a media that is supposed to be a watchdog of the government just push whatever narrative that would hurt a president they hated. I wish the film would have gone deeper and explored the story even more.I get that most people's opinions on this documentary will depend on their politics but it shouldn't. What seems to have been done here is criminal and shouldn't matter what party you support to see that this whole thing was corrupt and is the kind of thing that shouldn't happen in a free country. Anyone with intelectual honesty should be horrified.Not be ok with it because you don't like who won in 2016.Grade: B,False
6,1,Fake-umentary,cherylannhartz,n/a,16/08/2025,"It should be illegal to call this steaming pile of lies a ""documentary.""",False
7,10,"These people are still walking the street, unpunished",Akodi,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary spelled out clearly in chronological order how attempts were made to overthrow the President.I'm amazed that after all this evidence, not a single person has been questioned or indicted regarding this coup attempt.To anyone dismissing this remember it's all fun and games when it's against someone you dislike but history tells us these things will quickly turn against someone you do like, then it won't be so entertaining.",False
8,1,Pure stupidity in movie form,ianjustfloors,n/a,16/08/2025,"From start to finish it's subjective,one sided , non contextual and pure speculation.There is nothing remotely passing as testable facts and has been produced for an audience of one person only.File under alex Jones related junk",False
9,8,Democracy Dies In Darkness,Instant_Palmer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Applying the Washington Post slogan, every American should see this documentary to gain perspective and greater understanding of the ""Russian collusion"" narrative devised and manufactured to undermine and impeach President Donald J Trump.Truth and justice were never served in that undertaking, and the cost paid by us all rocks the foundations of what makes America the greatest society in History.Regardless of ones' political views, the truth of who was involved, the money trail, disregard for ethics, and manipulation of disinformation by political leaders and a largely biased news media deserves illumination for our all sakes, lest our Democracy indeed fades away into darkness.Well-paced and avoiding tedium, this is a well-made documentary and is highly recommended viewing.",False
10,1,More Blame game with nice editing..,Znoodles,n/a,16/08/2025,"Devon Nunes as ""intelligence""? As a California resident, the blatant lies & violence provoking retoric is sickening.
Anyone can splice ""facts"" together & produce a documentary.
Anyone else curious as to why the ""star"" of the show isn't listed in the credits? This man & his flat out lying & cheating has been voted out of office. Stop with the conspiracy theories! Enough is enough!
Who doubts there is corruption in government? Not me.",False
11,10,The Truth regardless,rdagazzz,n/a,16/08/2025,There are plenty of topnotch individuals speaking the truth candidly regardless of their personal feelings about Trump. We know Kash is not a Trump fan yet the truth is the truth regardless.,False
12,7,First things first,cordenw,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a political documentary so there's not much in the way of facts that you can rely on.
If the very same story was done by the other side, they would be equally convincing with their point of view.These backroom operatives literally hate each other and will do anything , say anything, lie and cheat and spread bad publicity, to get the results they want.Now, I look at the current story from the point of view of a lifelong socialist who grew up in poverty back in England. A person who had a justifiable chip on his shoulder because of the terrible inequity in English society.Bear with me for a little background before I get to the reviewSocialism was an honorable pursuit in those days because so many of the underclass were treated like beasts of burden. Feed them and water them and you don't have to do anything more.So, I was led to believe that a vote for Socialists would even the playing field, would ease the chains of poverty and develop a more just society.As it took a toehold we saw the introduction of HealthCare, Universal Education, Workplace Reform, Unemployment Insurance and Social Housing... all immeasurably good progressions.Then socialism lost its way; in taking away some of the necessities that are the individual's responsibilities and assuming them for the State, incentive was nullified. This was compounded by the socialist's inability to manage its reforms properly, tax income just gushed down the drains.They got so carried away with their anger at the monied classes that they expanded their programs to the point where it was more beneficial for some to stay at home and do nothing.
Eventually you didn't even have to leave home to get your benefits.The biggest weakness was that their anger blinded them to things they could have learned from the capitalists.This picture became clearer as I grew older and realized that I would get nowhere in this life if I just sat on my ass and complained, so I did something about it.I got a good job with the Government with unionized protection, didn't like the way the Union was run, so ran for President and was voted in.It was this seminal moment in my life that I realized that the Union Organization was more cruel to its members in many aspects, than the Employer itself was.The executive were all driven by blind hate. The most radical of them were intractable nutters and after a couple of years of this I surfaced as an unapologetic right winger, they never forgave me for it.This background is just to lead you up to the side I fall on when it comes to reviewing this Doc.Even though I think President Trump and his backroom boys have played some dirty pool (and some of them are real scumbags), I am convinced that the Democrats (and the Press) have been unable to come to terms with his election and would do whatever it takes (legal or illegal) to discredit and unseat him.They are driven by that same blind hate that has driven them from the start and biggest casualty is the country as a whole.With this current sitting, the animosity overrides every decision and it comes through loud and clear in the movie.I really don't know who to believe, there's nobody got up on the lectern and provided a vision for the country or a set of beliefs we can aspire to.It's all ""he said, she said"" and a country without a compass.",False
13,1,Ridiculous,labng,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think even the short passage of time since the production of this cartoon has made it even more laughable. Luckily for the United States, Nunes has decided to no longer sully the Senate with a bid for re-election. MOO.",False
14,n/a,Facts Matter,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here is a well laid out explanation of how Obama , Clinton , conspired to to use illegal wiretaps ( worse than watergate ) before and during Trumps transition and well into his Presidency . It demonstrates the criminality of the FBI and deep state actors all under the Obama administration and Clinton campaign / DNC .",False
15,1,Full of conspiracy theories,brianmarci,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know how this actually became rated as a documentary because it is full of conspiracy theories that have been proven false from the Republican Party itself.. The Senate intelligence committee published a report into Trump and debunked most of this movie which is mostly hearsay itself. The movie actually draws conclusions on almost no evidence or eyewitness accounts and draws on ""conclusions"" by hyper partisan politician.",False
16,9,Very interesting to see the truth about the media manipulations,rrr651,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe media has the capability to totally distort news by adding their opinions and creating half truths and calling it news. It is fascinating to watch them change the news to fit their agenda. But is is also very sad to see their manipulations.,True
17,1,GREAT DOCUMENTARY IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LAUGH,chrislake-59368,n/a,16/08/2025,The claims in documentary have been proven wrong multiple times by multiple intelligence agencies. If you enjoy seeing just how pathetic the Republican Party has become then this is a decent passer of time. If you're looking for factually based content this is not for you.,False
18,10,It will rearrange reality before your very eyes.,jerryrego,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're too young to remember the Senate Church committee, the inner working of the US intelligence agencies are unfamiliar to you.The most skilled at deception and false narratives, currently work (directly) for the media that inundates you on a daily basis.This is a ""must see"" to understand the full story of how the intelligence agencies moved against a sitting president, and nearly succeeded.",False
19,1,Critical thought process,jayjpsullivan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whereas the impeachment hearings necessitated the presentation of evidence and subsequently found Donald Trump guilty only to be pardoned by the Republicans, this movie is little more than conjecture and provides little if any supporting evidence for the position it maintains. This movie is just another press conference except with editing, music, lighting and I'm sure in many cases a well-crafted script.",False
20,10,Corruption at the highest levels,atabac01,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether one likes or dislikes the president it is pretty clear that there was a plot to overthrow him. The plot both failed and succeeded.
It failed because the wrong presidential candidate got elected. It succeeded because it haunted the president for more than 3 years. Not only people who were behind the plot have not got punished but they were also able to persecute innocent people to cover for their deeds. Every American should at least watch this movie.",False
21,1,A laugh riot! Funniest movie of the yea... Its a documentary? Oh dear...,james-leroux,n/a,16/08/2025,"Only thing funnier than this drek are the legions of trumpers flooding the site with positive review. Kind of reminds me of the great battle in the comment section for ""Suing the Devil"" when the producers literally threatened to sue me for thinking the movie was bad.",False
22,10,What will happen?,WKYanks,n/a,16/08/2025,Only one indictment?Some need to go to jail here.A sad state of affairs for the USA.,False
23,1,How do you rate lies told competently?,jjr-76474,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well a good liar is just a successful crook, as is the guru to which this sad sack of lies is dedicated.Unfortunately a bunch of people are tired of truth and democracy, and even more unfortunately they are good at concatenation of distorted facts and mobilizing editing of falsely presented images.I have always been in love with propaganda films. I believe propaganda is the natural honest language of movies, fiction and realism are its lies. The use of images to shape reality in a message, rather than anchor the message in reality, is the truest use of the visual. Therefore from Riefenstahl to Santiago Alvarez, i genuinely admire the propagandists of the moving pictures.And i must say that Amanda Milius is a promising addition to the list. But the bad part is that agit-prop is a fun mind game for people who chose to be informed, a dangerous brainwashing for those who enjoy not being informed. And in these times and place this movie can and will do a lot of harm.",False
24,1,This is not a true story,billiematteo,n/a,16/08/2025,Just because it says true story in the description does not make it so. This is a story of alternative facts. While you watch it remember that you can look up the actual facts. Flynn was one of the heroes of this story but he was convicted. He was pardoned by Trump on his way out. These are the kinds of alternative facts that lead to an insurrection and so many people thinking Trump won this election while losing all the court cases... It does not add up.,False
25,10,The documentary is just as riveting! A must see!,sandraponzone,n/a,16/08/2025,Just watched and then immediately shared with friends and family via texting. Very powerful and it's scary as hell to know that we may have never known had Trump not won and Devin Nunes and others had the guts to expose it.,False

1,10,It's hard to believe this is a true story,stephencwebster,n/a,15/08/2025,"But it is. This is the craziest true story I have ever seen.My name is Stephen C. Webster and I'm the journalist who wrote the most about Barry's exploits in the United States, before he fled the country with his now deceased ex-wife and her son. I am also featured in this series, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I watched the episodic premiere of ""Never Get Busted"" at the Sundance Film Festival in 2025 and came away extremely impressed.The filmmakers tell me they have cut this episodic series into a feature film spanning approximately 100 minutes, which I'm sure is compelling, but the original cut is four hour-long episodes. I cannot even fathom how much quality content they would have to cut to fit this into 100 minutes, but I'm sure the end result it exceptionally compelling nonetheless. I hope that the much longer version gets released, but we shall see. I just feel this is a massively bingeable series, and honestly should be expanded beyond four episodes. David and Erin are imminently competent filmmakers and researchers, and Barry is basically the next Tiger King as far as I can tell.For anybody who cares about justice, freedom, civil rights, and the appropriate enforcement of laws in the United States, this is a must watch. It's Bonnie and Clyde times Black Lives Matter, not so much a documentary as it is a roller coaster ride, so strap yourself in because Never Get Busted is one of the most insane true stories ever committed to film.",False
2,10,Truth is stranger than fiction.,Pioa74,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just watched this and am both pissed but not surprised. I know there are good cops out there, but they're seriously outnumbered by the corrupt ones. The fact that many of them are in management positions makes it even worse. The 2nd Amendment of the Constitution protects our God given rights to protect ourselves against enemies both foreign and domestic. When these public servants go beyond the ambit of their delegated authority, they are both the foreign and domestic enemies.Too many YouTube videos out there exposing the corruption in so many police departments throughout the country. The people aren't educating themselves well enough to legally deal with the systemic corruption in so-called law enforcement. People need to wake up and educate themselves in the difference between public and private. These @$$ clowns are nothing more than glorified corporate security guards. The only thing they regulate is commerce. Period! They work for municipalities which are simply corporations. It's a business. If you're in your private capacity, they have zero business or jurisdiction dealing with you without your consent.If you don't know your rights people, you don't have any. Ignorance of the laws is no excuse. If this documentary and the plethora of YouTube video's of police corruption doesn't get you to study up on what's up, then your stupid @$$ deserve to get bullied by these thugs with badges.",False
3,10,Wild ride,SJT-0,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is easily the best documentary of 2025!At its heart, Never Get Busted! Is a powerful indictment of the war on drugs, but it's also a celebration of the weird, wild ways people fight back against injustice and systemic corruption. If you're a fan of true crime or just love a good David vs. Goliath story with a psychedelic twist, this film is an absolute must watch.",False

1,7,They fell short,kyashack,n/a,15/08/2025,"What could have been an amazing and informative and inspiring documentary was a snooze fest. Nothing against attorney crump I am not sure what the film producers were even trying to convey All over the place
I was looking forward to this and they didn't do him his justice.",False
2,10,With all the Low Rating I Knew it was Going to be an Important Documentary!,WIVEGI,n/a,15/08/2025,"As I'm writing this, the rating is a 5.2, however there is not one negative review. That tells me that the low ratings are probably from people who didn't watch it, but saw scary words like ""Civil, BLM, or George Floyd,"" and rated it a 1, because....that's what they do. Wouldn't want to risk making a white person, especially kids, feel a little discomfort by exposing them to the truth, right? They may realize how America's past created and still relies on systemic racism. Yes; if you voted for Trump or are still backing Trumpist Politicians, I'm referring to you. BTW, I'm a middle-aged white american woman.If others had rated it fairly, I would've rated it an 8 instead of a 10. It was interesting, and for all that Mr. Crump has done, his name should be better known. I didn't know anything about him and I think the documentary could've done a better job of pointed out the overall significance of the court cases he was involved with. Perhaps they realized that their target audience would understand the context of events, as I did. It's also a possibility that he had some influence on the the documentary and if he's as humble as how he appeared, he may have wanted his accomplishments downplayed.",False
3,10,Netflix Can't Miss,tiffanyrolandalane,n/a,15/08/2025,Another amazing documentary from Netflix. I never knew all the other low profile cases Ben Crump worked/works on and this truly opened my eyes. He is doing great work for the community and protecting peoples rights period. Netflix did a great job reflecting his personal life and humanizing him without overexposing his family.,False
4,10,The bird which is the bald eagle,andrewparkin1,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerAn intimate vérité look following the life of maverick civil rights attorney Ben Crump as he challenges America to come to terms with what it owes his clients.,True
5,10,A perfect profile film of a modern Savior,pammo1949,n/a,15/08/2025,"This biographic profile of Benjamin Crump's life and personal sacrifices should be viewed by everyone. What motivates a person to choose a path that is dangerous and threatening with the level of conviction he has shown is remarkable and historic. My favorite words are ""financially unsustainable"". If nothing changes - nothing changes. He is bringing about change and laying pathways for every victim of a civil rights violation. These are not small cases but major cases worthy of representation by ALL law firms and no longer will victims have to be satisfied with being just a victim. Thank you Benjamin Crump - you are a HERO. Not some fictional character but the epitome of what Justice should look like for all Americans. The production was well balanced and and produced with a veil of mystery at first but the mystery of dedication and drive for the disenfranchised was clearly revealed. Kudos
to the director and the camera man that followed those precious moments in your life to share with us.",False
6,10,Beautifully done,lanfred-34113,n/a,15/08/2025,Beautiful doc. Though we see and knew the outcomes going through them again through his eyes was powerful. Loved seeing his history and the relationship he has with his mother.,False
7,n/a,Inspirational,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know why people rated this movie low. To me, this is a movie shows how humble and genuine Mr. Crump is. It was really sad to hear so many black people got mistreated, and not many people are willing to be in the front to fight for them. Mr. Crump has helped countless families which moves my heart a lot. May Jesus keep him and his family safe.",False

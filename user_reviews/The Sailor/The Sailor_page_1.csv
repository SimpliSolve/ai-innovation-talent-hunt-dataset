1,7,Pretty good-*spoiler alert,jess-96309,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Sailor has a good story to tell, the filmmakers kept it pretty light, and did not really get into the heavy stuff. I think they could have made a series of this documentary, because he did so much in his life. The documentary style is ""fly on the wall"" with not really any interviews, they just follow him around and film him and listen to him tell stories. I don't know how this could be an inspiring film on sailing, it is full of regret and alcoholism. I can't stand sailboats myself, I have gotten sick every time I went on one. I do think it is interesting that Paul did all that sailing, and finding deserted islands and basically living the dream, no responsibility and just pick up and go, but it looks like it took a toll on him, and he has a lot of regret about his life. He says life is just a joke and it's only for fun, and that is how he lived, I think that it is very sad, how he was basically stuck in that gross sailboat drinking booze all day, that is a nightmare scenario, and he could not even afford to fix the boat motor at the end, so he sails off with no motor for safety, he probably died out there on that voyage.",True
2,6,"To each their own, I guess.",sailorjjr,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSo, I think we humans that work the typical grind always think about ""what if"" I had done something I loved instead of sitting behind a desk (or whatever you do) for 50, 60 or more hours per week. I think this doc tells us ""what if"" looks like.Sure, it's ""cool"" to blow off the ""normal"" way of life and do as you please, but everything has a price. Is it worth it? I say it's not.First off, I could never live in the squalor of that boat. It's disgusting. He's turning 80, has no money, lives in a boat that should have been sunk 20 years ago, and is a stone alcoholic.He has kids he never sees, he has women that he's pushed away, family gone, all so he could be Popeye and smoke weed and get drunk 24/7.Sorry, not my idea of a life well lived. But, to each their own. I guess.",True
3,10,Poignantly beautiful,chesbaydelta,n/a,15/08/2025,"As an 80 year old sailor who yearns for the sea and a stiff wind and who still looks at boats-for-sale, this beautifully filmed documentary made me wistful. I, too, am pushing off for my last voyage...DAMN IT. Really good film, but watch it before you are 50 so you can buy a boat and sail...if only on weekends.",False
4,10,Superbly filmed and says so much about the human condition,markadams650,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary film deserves more than one award in my mind. There's so much more to this film than just following ""The Sailor"" Paul in his day to day life. The filming introduces visual metaphors by the bucket load and combined with Paul's dialogue makes this a wonderful study on what it is to be human albeit from a the perspective of a hedonistic free spirit who now realises there is a price to pay . There is also a wonderful display of humanity shown by the interaction with the locals who obviously care for Paul and support him as if he was part of their own family and yet not expecting anything for their efforts. A superb cinematic observation on being human, and not a lot about being a sailor. Congratulations to all who put this masterpiece together.",False
5,9,Existential Masterpiece,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Here's a man who chose the freedom of the open ocean as a lifestyle. In a way it chose him, as he was born on a boat. Now at 80, with little money, an old boat and a tired body, Paul Johnson faces the consequences of his lifestyle. Was it worth it? This film does not answer this question or any others. The viewer is left to draw their own conclusions. Elegantly styled as a hybrid of narrative with direct cinema, this film brings the viewer in scene and never lets go. The protagonist's questions are also our own. If not yet, someday we will be in a similar situation, taking stock and reflecting as we face the end of our lives.",False
6,10,Nice film,HumbleMensa,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a lovely little story, documentary of his life lived just as he wanted. If you are a lover of sailing and familiar with him, it's definitely worth a watch. I won't give anything away here, but it does leave you thinking and wondering and even wandering. The filming is well done, very casual but professional. The scenery is amazing and the dialogue is very youthful in a way that age wises you. I'd classify this as a feel good sort of story and after watching, if you didn't know of him, do look him up because you may just be surprised at what you will find. I am very glad they produced this film and that I watched it.",False

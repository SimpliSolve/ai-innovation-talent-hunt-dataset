1,8,Great film for the uninitiated but lacking for enthusiasts,alexjdominguez-51499,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ever since I could remember, Jim Henson has been apart of my life. From Sesame Street, the Muppet Show, Muppet Babies, Fraggle Rock, Dog City, the Storyteller, and all his movies. Growing up, Jim Henson was inseparable from my life. When I heard about this film, I was so excited to see bits and pieces about Jim Henson that I never knew. Unfortunately well the picture did take more attention to building up the man and having us understand his genius, It felt lacking. For some reason, they decided to keep a running time of two hours. Suddenly, in his darkest time after the Muppet show ended, when he was flourishing the most creatively, the crew decided to rush that second phase of his career and jam it in the final 30 minutes of runtime. I wanted more detail on the storyteller or his failed Jim Henson hour. I wanted them to talk about Dinosaurs The sitcom. I wanted them to talk about the creature shop and how they created Yoda and the ninja Turtles. They didn't interview George Lucas. Ron Howard knows George personally and they didn't get him? I wanted them to interview his peers in directing. I wanted them to interview the celebrities who were a part of the Muppet show and Sesame Street. They only interviewed one person, Rita Moreno. Very strange. Yes I know a lot of them have passed away, but there are so many others they could have put on there. They didn't even interview Conan O'Brien, who divulged on his podcast that not only did he go to college with his daughter Lisa, but he ran the Lampoon with her AND knew Jim Henson personally. He was even there for the funeral, which was just glazed over, not even showing the clip of all the muppets coming out on stage to sing for him. I wanted more. Yes, there have been very few specials about Jim Henson, but the wealth of material he left us deserved more. Make it a 4 part series like the Beatles, or a Two Parter to bookend the before and after Muppet Show career. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm a fanatic and I'm still probably discovering things to this day. There are way bigger Jim Henson fans than me so I won't say I'm disappointed. I loved the film because it's about Jim but I wanted way way more and it would take a lot to satisfy my appetite. I just thought it was going to be a big project like The Beatles was and I felt a little mislead. Please watch it, enjoy it and learn more about the man. I hope there's another series that goes into depth what he was about and what he made.",False
2,9,Excellent Rare Clips,smgrigal-74583,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler*Semi-Spoilers*I own and have seen virtually every documentary that has been put out on Jim Henson and The Muppets so I was quite curious what Ron Howard could dig up for another one that might be new. Sure enough, he surprised me, ESPECIALLY with the vintage behind the scenes clips from the 50's and 60's of Jim and his troupe.It is a beautifully constructed documentary with wonderful stories, heartwarming interviews, and hilarious clips. My ONLY gripe is that I feel it ended a little abruptly. Not bad by any means, but I think I would have rather them closed out with more examples of his influence and legacy after we lost him. Watch it; you won't regret it.",True
3,7,Someday we'll find it. The rainbow connection,TheVictoriousV,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jim Henson is the movie-maker that got me into movies. When I saw The Dark Crystal at age five, I was never the same again. This was when I first felt that I simply had to know how movies get made. Later on, I became a fan of Muppets and Fraggles alike (yes, I got to the Skeksis before I got to Kermit, at least in terms of adoration) and by now, I consider Henson one of the most important creatives of the 20th century.He changed the way I take in art, and did this and insurmountably more to countless others around the world. Even all these years after his death, he touches generations of people through his colorful creations -- so lifelike, nay, alive in spite of so clearly not being ""real"". In Ron Howard's documentary, Jim Henson: Idea Man, we see most of his life laid out (albeit sometimes in disappointingly brief snippets), from his youth to his early TV gigs (like those 1950s Wilkins Coffee commercials where a Kermit prototype puppet commits murder indiscriminately); from the inception of Sesame Street to the rise of the Muppets and the bona fide celebrity status of Kermit and Miss Piggy; from the creation of The Dark Crystal (which also involved the opening of the Henson Creature Shop) to the disastrous release of the now-beloved Labyrinth.Meanwhile, we learn of his personal life and the way he inspired, not just us, but those around him. In one notable moment, Frank Oz recalls how Henson pushed for him to co-direct The Dark Crystal, as Henson felt he himself lacked something that he saw in Oz.The documentary is cleverly presented, making good use of projectors, stop-motion interludes, and some animations Henson himself created before the Muppet years. Unfortunately, it is missing -- or just barely mentions -- a lot of information about Henson's life that would have made this documentary go from good to great. Still, it is a worthy celebration of that Rainbow Connection (sorry) that Henson created between all of us.",False
4,10,Beautiful Tribute for Jim!,lucybnichols,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was absolutely the most heartwarming documentary I've seen yet! Since I was younger, I've always been obsessed with the Muppets! I always thought Jim Henson was just the ""puppeteer"" for these famous puppets. But from this documentary, I've learned he was so much more than that. He was a creative mind that wanted way much more than just being a children's puppeteer. I've learned that he's done more creative projects than just the Muppets. Like other muppet documentaries, it doesn't show the true side of him and his work, like this does. This just gives a more of an inside scoop of his life and his reality. For the most part, seeing the others who have worked alongside him pay tribute, is just so beautiful! If you're interested in him and his life, I most definitely recommend this! To conclude, It's such a heartfelt, heartwarming tribute for Jim Henson. I'm just hoping this lives on for generations to come and that we celebrate his artistic work.",False
5,10,oh my gawd...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is some of the most majestic of nostalgic feature length documentary making, a film about Jim Henson, the godfather of tv puppets, whether in commercials, childrens tv or for all us grownups who had '' the muppet show'' as a pillar of inspiration to comedy pranking...its a full run story about a man , and a workoholic that died younger than me, but developed and enveloped hundredfolds in products and creativity, a voice actor out of the giants, and not to forget all that comedy that comes out of that bodily figure and puppets...i'm stunned by this production, it ends far too abrupt, just like the man himself, but all the memories he has made in all and everyone weighs heavier than the loss, like he said himself, ''im just on another plane'' when talking about neverland and beyond. So therefore, one of few men that can make me smile instantly, has now got his own biographical documentary, a film that me, the grumpy old man , will recommend just for good memories...",True
6,n/a,A labor of love,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I knew immediately that this bio documentary about Jim Henson was in good hands (Ron Howard directing) with the opening, played out against the rousing music of Charles Mingus in one of his trademark barn-burning performances. The story is one of unbridled creativity, and the movie, along with authoritative commentaries by the likes of Frank Oz and Jennifer Connolly, speaks for itself. Howard is especially successful at the poignant way he handles Henson's sudden death, which I had forgotten even though I was a reporter covering the movie industry 34 years ago when it occurred.One element that hit me out of the blue was a shot of George Lucas on screen during the coverage of ""Labyrinth"". It reminded me how difficult it would be to make a documentary on Lucas's life, and how there are book-ending similarities in his career relative to Henson's: both were once experimental filmmakers in the 1960s (THX 1138 4EB versus Timepiece), later becoming entwined in the commercial side of the entertainment business with huge financial success, and their creative achievements ended up in the domain of Walt Disney (himself an analogous figure in history).",False
7,7,Beautiful if a little rushed,masonsaul,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jim Henson Idea Man is an earnest tribute to the life and legacy of a visionary. It celebrates puppetry for the incredible art form it is whilst offering a personal look at the effects of fame. It moves along at a satisfyingly easygoing speed up until the final stretch where it suddenly speed runs through a lot of major beats to get to the end but other than that it succeeds at being a beautiful and emotional documentary.Ron Howard's direction wisely imbues the film with a lot of colourful flourishes and a generally inventive nature in a noble attempt to match the creativity of his subject. It's the usual chronological narrative that charts Henson's life from his beginnings all the way to his untimely death and each little flourish works with the story it's telling, even through the end credits. The footage gathered is amazing and the anecdotes from the people in them are delightful and heartbreaking.",False
8,8,The trajectory and work of the revolutionary and visionary artist,aguilera-felipe,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Jim Henson: Idea Man"" shows us the trajectory and work of the revolutionary and visionary artist known as the mind and personality behind the Muppets. With a wide variety of interviews, supporting material, and great admiration from director Ron Howard, this documentary provides us with information that goes far beyond the creation of Kermit the Frog and his group of puppets. It's a journey through the motivation, relentless work, perseverance, and great talent of a character who, along with his wife and team, always sought to surprise, innovate, and change the possibilities that television offered.Jim Henson is undoubtedly a pillar of creativity and positive artistic attitude in recent years, and his legacy will be indelible not only for the relevance of Sesame Street for a generation of children or the cultural phenomenon that the Muppets brought to millions of viewers. He is also a source worthy of admiration and inspiration in a world where everything may seem already defined.",False
9,7,"Jim Henson, the genius",m-sileo,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is a beautifully crafted tribute to one of the most imaginative and creative individuals of our time. Seeing Henson, Oz, and the talented team of Muppeteers at work, performing just below the frame, was both surreal and slightly heartbreaking. It felt as though I had seen too much behind the curtain, losing a bit of that childhood magic where Kermit, Piggy, Fozzy, and Gonzo were real to me.While the film is visually stunning and expertly made, I felt that certain parts of the 80s were glossed over, leaving me wanting more depth in that era. However, the use of stop-motion was a wonderful addition, complementing the storytelling beautifully.Ultimately, this documentary paints a touching and heartfelt portrait of an extraordinary man, told through the eyes of those who knew and loved him. It's hard not to be moved by the end, and it's easily one of the most enjoyable projects from Ron Howard.",False
10,10,Wonderful Tribute to a Wonderful man,SHB_73,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary by Ron Howard is a fascinating look into the life of the late great muppets creator Jim Henson. The documentary takes us back to the early days of Jim's life in Mississippi. From tragically losing his big brother in an automobile accident to creating Kermit from his mother's coat. Many of Jim's friends and family participate in the documentary. People like Frank Oz and his son Brian Henson describe what Jim was like to work with and his life as a father. We see many behind the scenes footage of him performing the muppets on Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, and his films such as The Dark Crystal and Labrynth. Jim was on the verge of selling his company to Disney when he tragically died on May 16, 1990 from bacterial pneumonia. Ron Howard does a fantastic job with the documentary showing us rarely seen footage of him and also explaining how he persevered when no tv studio would take a chance on The Muppet Show. Jim always said he would love to leave the world a better place and thankfully his creations continue to do just that. Idea man is a fascinating look at the life of an incredible man who left us far too soon.",True
11,6,Jim Henson: Idea Man,henry8-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Documentary charting the rise and rise, with very few falls, of the man who created the Muppets. Directed by Ron Howard it does kick off in a rather excessive, almost psychedelic fashion with endless fast cutting which I found annoying but it soon settles down. Whilst obviously it is fascinating to find out how Sesame Street, The Muppets, Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal etc were created, it was equally interesting to try and understand the man. It would seem that just about everyone adored him, but that he was a hugely driven man who whilst enjoying his creations, never seemed satisfied eg he cancelled The Muppet Show after 5 seasons just because it was time to move on. He would work ridiculous hours, desperate to create new things and when becoming ill refused doctors. Whilst he loved his large family, it would seem that they still came a close second to his art. I suppose therefore Howard has given us a better than usual insight into what great genuine talent looks like - nothing's perfect.",False
12,10,Creative Genius - Wonderful Human Being,tiberius-32495,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fantastic biographical account not only of Jim but the Muppets too.Jim's boundless creativity makes you question what wonderous creations we would be treated to today had he not been taken from the world so early...
Watching this is an emotional rollercoaster for any true Henson/Muppet fan, his legacy will continue in our hearts and with his family.The world learnt so much from his shows like Sesame street, not just reading and counting but empathy for our fellow occupants of this earth both human and animal alike.When I watch this movie/doc I'm left with those emphatic words of Elmo ""Gotta love me!"" well Jim we always did and will do forever!Thankyou Ron, Frank and the Henson family for this wonderful insight of genius.",False
13,7,Wonderfully interesting and very entertaining!,MovieswDan,n/a,15/08/2025,"On May 31st, Disney+ released the documentary feature profiling Jim Henson, the great puppeteer behind The Muppets and Sesame Street. Just like pretty much every other kid who was born in the 90s, I grew up watching these programs and was excited to learn more about the man who created them. The doc is directed by Ron Howard and features interviews with family members and co-workers including Jennifer Connelly, Rita Moreno, and Frank Oz.This is a very interesting and entertaining documentary that also teaches the viewer that anything is possible if you truly believe in yourself. Henson was turned down so many times that most reasonable people would pack it in and give up. Fortunately for the world, however, Henson never gave up and eventually found a network to give his show a chance. If he just rolled over and gave up, the world would never have been introduced to The Muppets.Jim Henson: Idea Man is now streaming on Disney+ and if you want to know more about the brilliant mind that is Jim Henson, I recommend giving it a watch.",False
14,1,Zzzzzzzzzz,hjqdgcsmrb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I (from the depths of my soul) wanted to love this film, but 15 minutes in on a Friday eve around 6pm I just couldn't tolerate how flat and undeniably boring it was. I'm a huge Jim Henson fan and don't feel that this docu did him justice at all. I saw 'The Contestant,' this week and wow!! That film was mind blowing, so for me, 'Idea Man' was the slowest paced, boring and unjustly production I've seen in a long time. Given all the footage there is in the ether for anyone to pull from, and the best this director could do was use 1000's of stills is pathetic. This film as so poorly directed I'm stunned I turned it off. I'm so disappointed and I hope, that at some point I give it a second chance. Until then, I'll use my Friday night to my advantage. Sorry for the terrible review.",False
15,9,Jim Henson: Idea Man,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought this was great.This is a feature length tribute and biography to the great man that was Jim Henson.It features lots of the people who worked with him, and forms a wonderful education about who the man was and what he stood for.The talking heads don't get in the way, and there is a lot of rare footage to be seen and enjoyed as well.I didn't expect this to be as moving as it turned out being, and just hearing the ethos and beliefs that Jim Henson had proved to be inspiring.I hope people enjoy this well made documentary as much as I did and that it encourages Disney to do more with The Muppets.",False
16,10,"Wonderful, insightful tribute",rozza-34691,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having been a lifelong Muppet fan, it was a joy to watch this documentary and learn about its creator. Idea man is the perfect title and will make sense once you watch it.Insightful, candid behind the scenes stories from cast, crew and family really paint a picture of the man, you almost feel like you know him.Lovingly made documentary using rare footage and clever editing to show Henson's work throughout his career. You can tell that Ron Howard has a lot of respect for the man and his work and that this was a labour of love for him.This has given me an even greater appreciation for his work, I wanted to rewatch all of The Muppet Show as soon as I finished.A delight for Muppet fans but also a great documentary in general.",False
17,8,Great Biography With Annoying Music,paulwetor,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I was in high school, Sesame Street came along. I had study hall before lunch in a small room where we could watch the show on TV. That began my interest in the Muppets and Jim Henson. This documentary is a great view of the history of both.That said, I'm halfway through and the music is annoying. I'm trying to listen to people talk, watch the pictures, and there's distracting music playing that interferes with the sound.It's not flowing music, it's short and choppy. That would be fine for scenes that need to imply action, but it's people talking in short, choppy words. The music is ear-catching when it should be subtle and not distracting. Music should be an additive to scenes that don't have dialogue. When people are talking, let them talk!",False
18,8,Great documentary,davidallenxyz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This isn't the first documentary I've seen about Jim Henson but it's certainly one of the best.It combines fantastic access to archive materials, many of which I had never seen before, and a selection of insightful interviews with key collaborators and family members.Particular highlights are the footage of his early creations, including ""Sam and Friends"" on local TV and his experimental short films from the 60s, before the happy accident that was ""Sesame Street"". It's also good to see the important role his collaborator and soon-to-be-wife Jane played.I was slightly surprised to see that quite so many big names were involved in the production of the documentary. I suppose that indicates the status of Jim within the industry. Not to be dismissive of Ron Howard et al, but any documentary filmmaker could have done an equally good job if they had access to the same materials.",False
19,10,Wonderful and excellent!,iloveseaotters,n/a,15/08/2025,"I got a subscription to Disney Plus specifically so that I could see this movie and it paid off in a huge way. This is the most amazing documentary. I didn't know that much about Jim Henson before now and I learned so much about him, mostly that he was a wonderful, wonderful man.""Idea Man"" packs a lot into its timeframe and not once did I look at the clock or press pause to see how far along I had gotten. Every segment was interesting and the segments on Sesame Street and The Muppet Show made me laugh out loud.I can see why this is titled ""Idea Man"". It's the perfect title. I liked that there wasn't a narrator but that there were interviews, footage, etc. I learned a lot about Jim Henson's family and his homelife and I didn't realize that he'd contributed so much to the creation of Sesame Street.It really is fascinating and such a wonderful tribute to Jim Henson.",False
20,2,Hagiography pathetic even by Howard's standards,khungus-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWho exactly does Ron Howard think he's manipulating at this point? Nobody cares anymore, about him or his subject here and the results are embarrassing at best. This is a muppet clip show, a paid infomercial on the genius of Jim Henson with levels of insight on par with an elementary school newspaper interview. Nothing here is explored in any detail and every talking head brought on adds nothing more than hollow praise.I came out of this learning nothing and actually disliking Henson even more than I did going in. I'm not a Muppet fan. The charm wore off sometime around 1980 and I firmly believe that (with the exception of the Sesame Street characters) society wouldn't lose a minute of sleep if they vanished without trace tomorrow. But that doesn't mean an exploration of Henson's life can't be interesting. He was a powerful Hollywood figure for years, surely he had his share of demons. But instead he's painted here as a benevolent, caring genius. A man who created a show (Fraggle Rock) because he thought he could put a stop to warfare. This kind of megalomania is just screaming to be expanded on but Howard glosses it over like everything else in the movie.This is lazy, lazy filmmaking by a hack director paid to drum up interest in a fading brand that he seemingly has little interest in. Just an awful experience.",True
21,10,good movie,angilneupane,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJim Henson was not just a puppeteer; he was a revolutionary storyteller whose work transcended generations. As the mind behind The Muppets, Fraggle Rock, and his collaboration on Sesame Street, Henson brought humor, heart, and humanity to every project. His ability to infuse simple characters with complex emotions and wit made his creations universally loved.Beyond his work for children, Henson pushed the boundaries of what puppetry could achieve. Films like The Dark Crystal and Labyrinth showcased his ability to create immersive worlds, blending fantasy with profound themes. His innovative use of animatronics and practical effects set a benchmark in visual storytelling.Henson's legacy lies in his ability to connect with audiences of all ages, offering laughter and life lessons. His untimely death in 1990 was a huge loss to the entertainment industry, but his creations continue to inspire joy and creativity worldwide.",True

23,10,A MAN GONE TOO SOON...!,masonfisk,n/a,15/08/2025,"From earlier this year comes this Disney + documentary original, directed by Ron Howard (Splash/Willow), about the creative giant Jim Henson. Tracing his roots from where one could see the glimmer of his famous characters used for advertising (you can find a compendium of his Slousser's bread spots on line) which were uncharacteristically violent yet pointed but when the Children's Television Workshop made him an offer he couldn't refuse, full autonomy, Henson went to work on what was to become Sesame Street debuting in 1969 which would revolutionize what children's programming would become (& still airing to this day to boot) but after his time there, where he'd corral an old working buddy, one Frank Oz, to work w/him he'd go about trying to sell his next idea which no American TV station wanted to 'okay' until he went overseas to make The Muppet Show which would also garner acclaim, attract the crème de la crème of talent & would end at the height of its popularity feeling he did all that he could from the format. Next on his list of doables was films where The Dark Crystal (a personal fave of mine, I saw it like 3 times opening day) & Labyrinth would further push the envelope for puppetry & one's imagination. It would seem nothing was impossible for Henson as towards the end of his life he managed to sell his company to Disney (which frankly hasn't done very well w/the property) but his abrupt death (from complications of pneumonia) is still being felt to this day as the 'what was next?' for the man was never answered allowing us, forcibly, to enjoy what he did give us.",False

1,7,"Insightful, affecting, and a raging fight for justice! [+66%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"What's particularly remarkable about this true-crime documentary is how it focuses more on the judicial aftermath of Vanessa's killing than the details of the crime itself. Here's a story where even the family of the deceased victim know very little about the whys, primarily due to its occurrence at Fort Hood, a US Army post, and the fact that military law is vastly different from civilian law. It is pretty easy to connect with the Guillens and the people who support them, and that isn't just because they're immigrants. It could be one of the reasons for sure, but there's still a lot to appreciate here - be it the plight of the younger sisters (especially Lupe, who's like a shining beacon of hope) or the mother who lost her daughter at such a young age, the lawyer Natalie Khawam who joins them in their fight for justice, and the folks who came out to support them in passing the bill for independent prosection of sexual assault cases in the military.While the family's effort pays off to some extent (and it's depicted as a victory moment), the concerned folks remark that it is just a first step in many. Credit should go to the makers for not sensationalizing the details of the crime, and instead, pulling us into this emotional journey of a family that's fighting a relatively big fight. So, if you're looking for an investigative, details-driven true-crime piece, this might not entirely hold your interest. It definitely did hold mine (with slight pacing issues), as the story progressively moved into a more insightful, affecting space.",False
2,5,1st Bill Not Passed Blamed on Trump,ryapo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would of rated this a 10 but because the producers and writers decided this would be good media blaming Trump for not passing the original bill was bogus. At the time the House and Senate was Democrat majority. At least Trump saw the sisters, Biden did not when the sisters came out to DC the 2nd time.I give Mayra much praise for giving life to this bill and I'm sure now 2022 she truly understands what involves with political science. I was happy to hear the mother and Mayra give their true thoughts on the superiors of Fort Hood and place them on alert because they need to resign. I hope in the years coming that Mayra will be a future congresswoman, she has that fight and gumption instilled in her heart and soul.",False
3,10,powerful and patriotic,Filmmaker101and102,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film had me in tears 5 min in and over and over again. One family, 1st generation really shows what it means to love, protect and care for each other against all odds.The story deals with a lot of issues and it deals with them well, but this is about family and the Latino community uniting above all else. It made me proud. It made me sad. It made me want to make this country better just like the family in the film does.This is also about a social movement that blew up online and if you go on twitter, this film is getting to people. I thought I was just feeling extra emotional but this film has people balling their eyes out.It's also fast moving. Was never bored. Just overwhelmed with emotion.",False
4,2,Terrible job at telling this story,ercfunk-445-950046,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSeriously? THIS is what they came up with for this documentary?!They barely cover what happened to Vanessa. Then they follow the family around trying to get answers and frankly, not finding any. Then they cover the legislation they try to get passed to change they way the military handles harassment and assault cases... but they never explain any of it.This makes me ask, did they understand any of it? The process for reporting Harassment or assault? They push for this bill to pass but they don't cover any part of what the bill has in it. What would it change if it gets passed? Why didn't the filmmakers think that would be something viewers would like to know?I have great sympathy for the family, however this documentary spends far too much time on them and not enough on Vanessa.",True
5,9,"Great documentary, very watchable",ar_brierley,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is really well done, not much ""time wasting"" with fillers or going over the same stuff again and again. It documents the tragic case of Vanessa Guillen, who was sexually harassed and murdered while ON DUTY at Ford Hood in Texas, and how the military immediately went into 'damage mode' by not investigating her disappearance, and by covering it up for 2 months. They should be ashamed that there is SO much sexual abuse and intimidation in the military, which either gets reported but no action taken, or else doesn't even get reported through fear or repercussions. God Bless Vanessa, her legacy lives on through her family's love and advocacy to make positive changes to help others.",False
6,3,"Should be titled ""I am Vanessa's Grieving Family""",AshyKnuckz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a retired military member and knowing how inconsistent the military justice system is, I was looking for some compelling insight into what happened to one of our Uniformed Sisters. Instead, I found myself constantly asking how all of this ties into Vanessa's murder. I continued to watch to the end, hoping that the last 30 minutes would provide some groundbreaking connection between the murder and all of the efforts made by the family in reforming military law.In this documentary, Vanessa and the facts surrounding her death were overshadowed by a loose connection to sexual harassment/assault in the military, and we see her serving as a figurehead for a cause while her grieving family strives to have her name attached to a law bill that is passing through the system to be approved. We hear very little of the suspect other than he was a troubled coworker who murdered her and then kills himself before being captured. We were made aware of an accomplice girlfriend who was still awaiting trial. We understood that Vanessa was very liked and loved, and had sexual harassment complaints against a supervisor that went unaddressed.I am actually angered by this film that, in essence, is supposed to be a feel-good justice-served type of documentary. When you get past the story of the grieving family and their journey to make a legislative change, you realize that the main issues are missed and never discussed. The holes in the system leading to Vanessa's demise are never patched. What was the motive for her murder (other sources state it was a cover up for an affair)? What type of soldier was Robinson, other than one who disregards COVID protocols? Why were they both on duty that day when home-quarantine was apparently in effect for Ft Hood? Who else was there that day that were potential witnesses? Where did the murder take place? Why did it take so long for Ft Hood to respond to her disappearance (seriously, within 30 minutes I had people who came to my overseas off-base residence to find me when I failed to answer a 2am phone call)? What else was known about the accomplice and her relationship with Robinson?If you don't have the answers to those types of questions (even if it is a military cover-up), then you don't have a documentary about what happened to Vanessa Guillen. Without the vague connection to sexual harassment, her story unfortunately dies too. Perhaps Netflix should have waited longer for the trial of the accomplice or more information released from the murder investigation before releasing this film. As is, this film appears to be a filler, akin to a great YouTuber who puts out a half-baked video because they need to release content on-schedule.IMO, Vanessa and her family deserves better. In the end, Vanessa and her family still has not received justice and the passing of the sexual harassment reform to military law seems like a method of pacification at its highest level. There is still much more to this story that will soon become public knowledge, and releasing a part 2 of this film is just not going to happen.",True
7,8,Interesting documentary but I have a question,leafe-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was a terrible incident and the fact that predators like this are in the military is not tolerable. I'm an army veteran (1970-73). My question is in regards political side where John McCain is defending the military command structure on the Senate floor. John McCain died on August 25, 2018 and Vanessa Guillen was murdered on April 22, 2020. I don't get the timeline.Otherwise this was a good way to document the tremendous pain that a family endures after something like this. The other thing I remember in the military although it was 50 years ago was all command structures are not the same. There were good places where predators like this would never be tolerated. I say this as a counterpoint to the broad brush that all of the military are like the environment at Fort Hood.",True
8,1,This is not a true crime movie,BerryHay29,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is not a true crime documentary. It's about how the family pushed for legislation for sexual harassment in the military and does not have anything to do with ""why"" she was murdered. While a noteworthy cause, the trailer for this did not accurately portray the premise of the documentary and did little to explain why she was murdered. There was little in the documentary that focused on her death and the atrocities she experienced before dying. Again, not to minimize the importance of legislation needed against those who rape and sexual harass women in the military, but this documentary doesn't do well with explaining the details of her death.",True
9,10,Must watch - One of the best documentaries,mixitupmxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an emotional and powerful film that covers a lot of ground. The story is well structured, fast paced and really dives into some complicated subject matter about the military chain of command, military legal system and getting legislation passed.The film gives you just the right amount of information about the legal framing to follow the story, but leads with the personal stories of the subjects of the film, which are the heroes.The focus is on a family that makes a really incredible choice - they take on the US military in order to get justice for their sister.One of the most important films. Really worth the watch.",False
10,3,"Not a good documentary, long and not engaging",toryandrew-22186,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is way too long. The focus on the family is not interesting. There is a lot of ignorance about the law around the living suspect not being read Miranda, the way bills work. This is even from the expert lawyers. It's a sad story but it just goes on, there are errors, there is a ton of humble bragging that diminishes the family. It's not very coherent overall. It's not a good watch.It is a documentary about the sisters, it spends a lot of time mentioning how young one is. It never gives a motive for the killing. It shouldn't have been made before the other person charged had a judgment, it's too open ended not well made.",False
11,10,"Riveting documentary, breaks the standard formula",FilmreviewerUK_US,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doc shook me to the core. It was emotional and offers quite a refreshing point of view.If you're expecting a traditional crime doc, then maybe not your cup of tea. If you are open to watching something more interesting then the same old formula of gore and exploitation, this breaks the mold.This film gave me some hope, not only about democracy but humankind as well. A beautiful testament to a young woman, the legacy her family has built in her honor.This felt intimate, thoughtfully crafted, sensitive and fair. The filmmakers handled this delicate story with gentle care and as a viewer, appreciated that. Imagine this was gut-wrenching to make.I simply can't get this film out of my mind.",False
12,2,Not very good,MovieCriticOnline,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch it. I vaguely remember the case several years back and initially thought it was gonna be a murder mystery. But it wasn't.It took forever just to get to the death of Vanessa. Like 1/3 of the film. Then it became about military reform and I have no idea why. Because that story went nowhere.I am sure there was a story in there somewhere, but they totally missed it.The suspects came and went in like 2 minutes. It was all like throw-away tidbits, rather than the focus of the film, which was a shame.It was basically 90 minutes of hearing grief from the family. But is that a movie? I say no. I sympathize with their loss and feel terrible for them, but in movies, even documentaries, there needs to be a story and not just emotional testimonials of how sad they are.Like with most Netflix documentaries, they are way too long and add way too much fluff.There were a lot of allegations of sexual assault, but they never connected that to the murder. Just seemed like a sideshow.It had very little to do with Vanessa and much more about her little sister becoming an activist and good for her, but again, was that the movie they needed to make?The filmmakers really had no focus on anything or made no connection to anything.I don't like documentaries that rely on a bunch of speculation. ""it could have happened"" or ""it likely did happen."" That is not the basis for a whole film.If you want to watch compelling documentaries go watch ""Don't F with Cats"" or ""Making a Murderer."" This was a mess.",False
13,10,Emotional,film212-27160,n/a,16/08/2025,"What I liked:1. Dealt with issues that could easily be dry, boring and slow in a really compelling way issues like legislation.2. Doesn't indulge in the gore of the crime in an insensitive way.3. This is a story that is shocking, sad, hopeful and inspiring. It really captures all kinds of emotions.4. Moves fast. It's clear. It's complex.5. It makes you think about it afterwards. Sticks with you.6. I like the music through most of the film and the song at the end with the singer.What I wished it had:1. Wrap up of the criminal's trial. I just looked it up and saw the trial got delayed and maybe Netflix didn't want to wait to see how that finishes out.2. I liked this topic in a film form but also think there's a lot to it and could be a series. I thought the narrative was pretty solid, but wouldn't mind a follow up.3. Archival heavy in some parts - guessing couldn't be avoided.",False
14,1,A whole lot of nothing,oseguera-18079,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerNot at all what I expected was hoping for something insightful and was met with disappointment but then again this is Netflix. It focuses too much of her family and not enough about what happened to her. The mother is very annoying acting like she knew this was going to happen before she went to the army. This was a rare instance. The only people to blame are the people who committed the murder not some giant entity that is the army and the ridiculous solution to close a multi billion dollar installation like fort hood? Not likely. No explanation about how she was murdered and who were the ones responsible they were just brushed to the side Netflix needs to stick to facts and not emotional and irrational feelings the mother in this documentary needs a reality check.,True
15,10,"So sad story, I cried",swimonna,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a story... there were beautiful words in the documentary that impressed me. The lawyer's word was ""They're afraid of anyone who can solve this case"" and that little girl said ""I haven't had time to mourn"" and her Mother said ""God lent me money and took her with her""... so sad there was definitely a reason for Venessa's death. They made their voices heard thanks to their strong sisters. I was proud of the little girl. At the age of 16, he is shouting with a megaphone in assemblies before he can reach maturity and experience his adolescence. And as they say ""This feeling will never go away"" it's totally a joke that the troop base didn't give any explanation and tried to look for the missing soldier 2 months later! They literally made fun of the family. And ignored reports of harassment. Also, why didn't they reveal the name of the abuser? They knew and knowingly went on TV and said ""it has nothing to do with harassment"". Totally sad. I always say America's legal system sucks.",False
16,2,Horrible and just all false,tiffgalore-07576,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis documentary shouldn't have even been made. As a victim of sexual harassment and assault this was told all wrong. As a parent if your child came to you and told you they had been sexually assaulted wouldn't you as a parent go to where your child was an find out answers or even tell someone in the government? Why did they wait so long to tell anyone? And also that lawyer was just a horrible lawyer. No matter where you go anyone can be sexually assaulted or harassed even at a job. So why shut down a base? Just put stricter rules. Horrible and not good at all. I know there will be a lot of people who agree with this because it's just sad and horrible.,True
17,10,Brilliant and complex film,reviewer2023,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never cry watching anything and this film brought me to my knees. The filmmakers expertly navigate the complex issue of sexual trauma in the armed forces (US) through one heartbreaking case - Vanessa Guillen.The 1st half of the film is gut-wrenching as Vanessa goes missing, the military stonewalls, the Guillen family desperately search for Vanessa and answers.Vanessa's found (won't fully spoil) but her family shift gears and decides to take on the military and the dysfunctional culture, policies that enable pervasive corruption and sexual trauma to take place frequently.Fort Hood in Texas is the base Vanessa was living/working at and it had decades of insane levels of corruption - everything from a prostitution ring, missing soldiers, mass shootings, human and gun smuggling and it just continued... and might still, but Vanessa's family worked to minimize the corrupt practices but more work is needed. This film should help.The film is well constructed. The story works - it's complicated. There is a lot of old footage, news footage, but some gritty and beautiful cinematography too.Seems like a hard film to make and it's done well.",False
18,1,Lacking,The_Boxing_Cat,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only thing we hear is about the grieving family- which is understandable, but it shouldn't be the only thing we learn.This is a rare occurrence on military bases, though terrible for Vanessa's loved ones and family.This documentary was lacking- we never learn what happened to Vanessa. It felt like half of the story wasn't being told.Also, they should have been voiceover in English- this wasn't interesting enough to read subtitles.I'm am done with Netflix!They will take a ninety minute documentary and drag it out for five or six episodes (luckily that didn't happen with this documentary).I wouldn't bother watching this- I'm guessing those high ratings were from friends and family members.Terrible what happened, but they should have done a better job.I do NOT recommend.",False
19,9,"Solid, hard hitting documentary that Netflix can do well",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,n/a,16/08/2025,"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulVanessa Guillen was a young Latin American woman, whose dreams did not conform with traditional gender norms. She wanted to make her name either as a boxer, or in the military, and went with the latter. Making her family extremely proud, Vanessa settled in well at the Fort Hood military compound for a while, but quickly grew disillusioned, and complained of sexual harassment and abuse by her fellow cadets. She was later found murdered in a shallow ditch, spurring her mother Gloria, and sisters Mayra and Lupe into a ferocious battle for justice, and exposing a top down culture of corruption at FH, whilst effecting a change in the law.If their general original content is somewhat hit and miss, Netflix can generally be relied on to produce a solid, insightful documentary, and this, the feature length directorial debut of director Christy Wegener, would be one such example. A shocking, unbelievable true life tale of institutional corruption and evil, it shines a light on a marginalised voice, in the shape of a young woman from a minority background, and the failings and betrayal of an organisation meant to protect her. Of shattered dreams and shattered hearts, finding the strength to rise up to demand justice and change.No longer able to fight her own corner, Vanessa's legacy rests in the hands of her mother and two sisters, who are (without generalising) a typically impassioned Latin American family, dealt the most shattering of blows. You can feel the fire raging within them, as they chase their campaign around the company, rallying legal experts, lawmakers and even (then) President Trump in to making Vanessa's life matter. This was a young woman whose only crime was to pursue a dream and make her loved ones proud, and it's truly shocking how the apparently most honourable, and most deserving of respect, people actually behave when forced in to a corner and told to justify their actions, as we've seen in other recent documentaries such as Athlete A. It really makes you feel uncomfortable.There are some people who sadly end up having more of an impact in death than they do in life, which things like the death of George Floyd (whatever you thought of him) proven, and someone like Vanessa Guillen has the power to do just the same thing, and maybe even better. ****",False

1,8,Insightful,TakeTwoReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"We were all stunned when we lost Robin Williams weren't we. It was genuinely shocking. Depression we thought. The sad clown. Well maybe in part, but only a small part, by no means the whole story. Williams committed suicide at 63 in 2014. Why? the world wondered. He was brilliant, talented, loved, what a waste. He had battled addiction, everyone jumped to conclusions. All of which were and are wrong. This documentary seeks to find some truth, some reason. That truth lies in the post-mortem diagnosis of Diffuse Lewy Body Dementia. A little known disease that effects the brain and the body. A bit like Parkinson's. Give something a name and you can build from there. That's what this film does, painting a picture of a devastating disease that moves fast, is incurable and always fatal... and he had no idea he had it. I think that makes it worse, if he'd have known, maybe he'd have found some peace, understanding what was causing his anxiety, paranoia, memory loss, confusion... but who can truly know. Much of this is made up of interviews with friends and neighbours, people he lived with. Despite being a global star, he lived a pretty humble life. Nice house, nice neighbourhood, but he wasn't hidden away. The other side, is specialists explaining how this disease works and how it would've effected Robin. What it did to his confidence, caused him to withdraw slowly. Good days and bad, the bad slowly outnumbering the good. Mercifully there's a lot of history too, an overview of how he came up. It's a pleasure to relive such an energetic career. Seeing that alongside explanations of how his brain was unwiring and the dementia it caused though is very sad. In many ways this jumps between the good and the bad, the way he might have. His relationship with his wife Susan, his friendship with Christopher Reeves, but lots of science too, overview stuff, but giving you a sense of what was happening. It's a tough watch. There's no happy ending. There's a little more understanding though. RIP Robin x",False
2,7,Robins Wish,marmar-69780,n/a,16/08/2025,"Robins Wish is a very good documentry that showed what happened to one of best persons that ever lived on this planet and how his life sadly ended.Im not gonna lie this was a hard thing to watch mostly because we were watching how Robin after he made so many people happy and to appriaciate their lifes more,that he had to suffer because of horrible desise.Story about him was shown in a very good way here and it put a even more respect from me towards him,sure this isnt different from any other documentry in a style but it doesnt need to be",False
3,8,One hard documentary to watch yet interesting,lisafordeay,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerRobin's Wish is a 2020 documentary based on Robin Williams struggle with Lewy's Body Dementia as well as the aftermath of his death on August 11th 2014. The documentary features interviews with Robin's 3rd wife Susan Schneider,Shawn Levy(Night At The Museum director),Robin's close friends and neighbours.Similar to the last documentary Come Inside My Mind that documentary was based on Robin's life,whereas this one was aimed at his misdiagnose with LBD,what it does,what the symptoms are as well as the brain cells which gradually dies.Having been a massive Robin Williams fan since childhood,I was really heartbroken when the news broke on his death 6 years ago. He was such a tremendous kind soul(never met the guy) but he loved making people laugh and cry.At least his legacy will remain in all of our hearts forever. He left us with some great movies and he will always be my favourite comedic actor next to Jim Carrey.",True

5,7,Fine documentary,edlc1970,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a fine documenrary about a fatal and disabeling disease, and a great actor/comedian.

6,10,Amazing documentary 10 stars,kenny-99158,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't usually write movie reviews. Absolutely loved it, never heard of Lewy Body Dementia .
What a devastating disease, my dad died from alzimers so I can relate.
Really explains what Robin his family and close friends went through. Puts to rest all the rumors the media spread.
I actually met him once on his way to an event and he stopped took pictures and talked with everyone that asked. So yes he was really the guy you saw.",False
7,7,nostalgic and also heartbreaking.,Anudeepsambaraju,n/a,16/08/2025,"Premise: Robin's Wish (2020), is a documentary recounting the final days of the beloved actor, comedian, lovable person Robin Williams. His battle with Diffuse Lewy body disease which is incurable, how it impacted him. The story is narrated by his wife Susan Schneider, close friends, and neuroscientist. The saddest part is, Robin never knew his enemy, what is he suffering from. Neither his doctors had any idea until 2016 by then it was two years since robin left the world.Review: Robin Williams is widely creative, undoubtedly the greatest improvisational actor can fit into any role, no one can keep up with his humour, more than all he has been generous, a loving human always spreads happiness unconditionally. This film recalls the life and legacy of Robin from friends, neighbors, colleagues, and his wife, Susan Schneider. As we all know by now, Robin didn't commit suicide because he is depressed or addiction problems. He was suffering from rare Lewy body dementia (LBD). LBD Is a case of progressive dementia that leads to a decline in thinking, reasoning, and independent function because of abnormal microscopic deposits that damage brain cells over time.The movie primarily focuses on the final days of the robin, his struggles, and more importantly, his strength. Despite fighting a war inside his brain with an unknown enemy, he still kept a smile on his face. He made the world a better place with his morals, generosity, humour. The movie also features some scenes of Robin Williams from documentaries and talk shows. Where we see highlights his major roles and how he brings laughter to people around them and his philosophies of life. This documentary also raises awareness about LBD. The symptoms and risks are talked by neuroscientists.Verdict: As a fan of Robin Williams, this movie is nostalgic and also heartbreaking. Robins Wish (2020) Pays Tribute to the beloved actor Robin Williams, a full of life human being. Oh, captain my captain, you will forever be remembered.",False
8,9,Stays On Topic And Is Ultimately Better For It,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"When making a documentary about Robin Williams, it is so easy for the proceedings to turn into little more of a ""greatest hits"" compilation, so to speak. Cut together some of his best film scenes, talk show appearances, and stand up routines, and that doc would get a 7/10 rating form me in perpetuity. But in order to add something original to the coverage of Williams' life, an outside-the-box topic must be picked and stuck to. That is exactly what ""Robin's Wish"" does and is ultimately a great doc because of it.""Robin's Wish"" is very focused on the final few months of Robin's life--where he was clearly in an odd mental decline--and then the post-death diagnosis of Lewy body dementia. Largely shepherded by his final wife Susan, the record gets set straight here that Williams did not die of depression or drug use. He had a medical condition that quite literally attacked his brain.Though incredibly well put-together, this doc is often very difficult to watch, what with the knowledge now that Williams was struggling with a disease he never fully understood in life. For a man in which a quick brain was his stock-and-trade, it must have been devastating to be stripped out that and not understand why.About the only reason I can't give ""Robin's Wish"" the full 10/10 ranking is because it lacks input from many of his closest family members. Unfortunately, I believe this is because Susan Williams is not looked upon fondly by certain family members and a division exists there. That being said, there are no sour grapes aired out here. It more just a ""conspicuous absence"" sort of deal.Overall, though, this is a top-notch look at the last days of Robin Williams' life, and the type of legacy the diagnose of Lewy body disease may have on his future legacy. Though incredibly sad in spots, it is also inspiring in that Robin's robust life legacy can be used to help others battling similar brain ailments.",False
9,7,The suicide of Robin Williams,DLochner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who Really Knows Robin Williams? A person who decided to commit suicide. The many speculations about the suicide of Robin Williams are finally put down here. The documentary goes deep into the possible causes of death of the great actor, but at the same time illuminates his intense life and his fantastic career. An intense life for a fantastic actor.",False
10,10,Very Accurate and Thorough Documentary,timzilar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I recently lost my step-father after a 2-3 year-long battle with LBD. Similar to Robin, he had an incredibly brilliant mind and was an outstanding member of every community he was a part of. The silver-lining of Covid-19 allowed myself and my wife (fiance at the time) to move across the state and live with him and my mom for the last 6 months of his life. I never thought in my wildest dreams that at 25, I'd be put in a caretaker position quite like this. Experiencing all of his degredation from the REM activity to vivid hallucinations to loss of basic math skills and name/face recognition to horrid states of depression and anxiety, etc.....it was a horrible way to watch someone leave this world, especially with such a powerful mind and kind heart quite like his. This documentary portrayed all of these occurances with Robin Williams and all of the reactions of family and close friends are experiences that I and many others experienced almost to a T. It is such a surreal process to be a part of and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Although it's tough to watch, I'm glad that this information has been captured so accurately and that more of the world will be able to get a glimpse at LBD. I would hope it gets reviewed and studied more so that eventually there will be better preventative measures for others in the future. I wish peace of mind and I send my thoughts to all who were close to Robin Williams, as well as anyone who has also experienced a loved one with this sinister disease.",False
11,7,Quality Documentary,jroze13-18-86744,n/a,16/08/2025,This was such an eye opening intimate look into what Robin Williams was dealing with mentally. I think it helps fill in the blanks where some of us might have missed crucial information about his disease. Quality interviews and information from people close to Robin was the best part.,False
12,10,It made me ugly cry,danieshe,n/a,16/08/2025,"He was such a brilliant man and this tought me so much about how humble he was and how much he struggled in the end.

13,1,Passing the Blame,Kamandi73,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dubious documentary that seeks to blame an undiagnosed illness for Robin Williams committing suicide. Keep in mind that Williams was mega-wealthy and had access to the best medicine and doctors in the universe. The fact that Williams spent his entire life addicted to cocaine which gave him his hyper-active comedy style was not explored much.The fact that once Williams stopped doing cocaine he felt that he could not be funny anymore was not discussed much. The fact that his family seemed to live mostly apart from him was not discussed either. Why did they leave Williams alone all the time when they knew he was suffering from deep depression? The fact that Williams lived alone and in isolation while depressed, and had nobody that cared about him was a red flag. There are a lot of factors to blame for William's suicide.",False
14,10,Heart Breaking Documentary,SHB_73,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOn August 11 2014 one of the funniest comedians in history tragically killed himself. Robin Williams always made me laugh ever since he starred on the TV show Mork & Mindy to his dramatic roles in movies such as Dead Poets Society, Awakenings, and his Academy award winning role in the movie Good Will Hunting. When news broke of his suicide I was in a state of shock, and I was crying. I couldn't understand why he did it and I was angry. But news came out of the disease he was fighting and didn't know he had it. This documentary does a great job of explaining Robin's battle with Lewy Body Dementia which affected his brain and had he been diagnosed with it earlier it could have been treated. There is no cure for this disease but the Documentary shows how it affected his way of life. Many of Robin's friends and neighbors talk about his last days leading up to his death (how he acted) and how deeply concerned they were for him. The most heartbreaking story is when his wife Susan recalls the day he died. The documentary gives excellent info on the disease Lewy Body Dementia I felt so bad because Robin was truly suffering. Robin's Wish is an excellent film I'll leave with this quote he gave in the movie Jack: Make a wish, think of me, make your life spectacular.",True
15,9,A beatiful documentary and touching tribute,maccas-56367,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful documentary in memory of Robin Williams. It doubles as both a touching tribute by those who loved him most, and an awareness piece on Lewy Bodies Dementia.I was definitely left with a good idea about the kind of person Robin was outside of his films. His talents are featured here, but it's more about him as a person and the film is all the better for it.It doesn't shy from the tragic nature of Lewy Bodies, and I learned a lot about it I didn't know. The anecdotes from Robin's neighbours and closest friends were touching and a nice break from the dark tragedy of his illness.The love story of Robin and his wife was what I loved most. When combined with stories of Robin's time entertaining troops and visiting people in hospital, you're left with an inspiring, uplifting film.For all its darkness, it manages (quite fittingly) some essential laughs too. It ends on a really beautiful note and gets you thinking about life itself and what truly matters most.RIP Robin.",False
16,10,"Such an eye opening look into at what happened to Robin who had a uncurable, hard to diagnose disease.",rchosen-193-5535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like many people, the news of Robins suicide shook me to the core. I refused to accept it. How could someone so happy take his own life? When I heard later it they discovered what he had (after his death), it made much more sense. Watching this was very informative and despite making me feel better knowing he didn't perhaps take his life on purpose, it still hurts more to know he was suffering with something he didn't know he had and was taken away far to early.If you watch this you will need Kleenex, though as much as it is about Him and what happened, it's also a tribute to a once a lifetime person. Hope you found your wings Robin.",False
17,9,Thought Provoking and Interesting,bruno-83,n/a,16/08/2025,"We have all seen or heard Robin Williams in some form of media where he has made us laugh or simply enjoyed his performance. This documentary tells us the story of his battle with Lewy Body Dementia and up until his passing having not being diagnosed. Susan takes us on her journey of finding out and understanding LBD explaining and telling us of Robin's symptoms and struggles with it. Interviewing people who were close to him, this documentary is mostly a sad journey but incredibly interesting and thought provoking. If only Robin knew what he was dealing with instead of the unknown, he may have been able to manage his thoughts and feelings better. I highly recommend this documentary even just to capture this brilliant comedian's life of giving and leaving us so many laughs.",False
18,5,Something is not quite right,mattymbrie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirstly, this is an interesting documentary about a fascinating man and the tragedy of Dementia with Lewy Bodies. The nature and severity of how this affected Robin Williams is heartbreaking.In terms of the narrative and perspective of how this documentary is told, something is decidedly absent. Specifically, I find the absence of Robin Williams' children and Bobcat Goldthwaithe as telling. Take that as you will, but some readers will perhaps understand my scepticism.Still, the world is a poorer place without Robin Williams and he is sorely missed. We can continue to enjoy his legacy with the body of work he left for us.",True
19,10,Thank you Susan Schneider Williams,captronray,n/a,16/08/2025,Robin's Wish revealed the beauty and power behind the mind of one of the greatest entertainers of all time. He was a loving soul. Thank you Susan Schneider Williams.,False
20,10,Raising awareness on a little known and devastating disease,RebekahE99,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary does a good job laying out what Lewy Body Dementia is and what it does to people. It's depressing and a little hopeless, because sadly right now that's how the disease is. There is no effective treatment and very little hope that things will get better any time soon. I think it is important for people to learn about this disease, how many people it affects, and how hard it is to diagnose.I just learned this month that Robin Williams passed away from this disease, and this greatly upset me for the simple fact that this has been out for about seven years and I didn't know until now. The lack of awareness around this disease and that this is what killed Robin saddens and scares me, because my dad died from it, and if Robin dying from it didn't bring attention to the disease, what will? I am glad that the LBD Foundation and Robin's wife are making some progress in awareness and research, but I wish I had more hope that science will find a cure.I would sum the disease up in three words: Scary, confusing, devastating.My dad passed away from Lewy Body Dementia in 2009. He was 67. He suffered GREATLY from 2016-2019, when the disease was kind of jump started by a heart surgery he had in 2016. He had all of the same symptoms as Robin, but he was not able to function as well as Robin. He never went back to work, and the main word that sums up his state until his death is: fear.
For us it was fear, sadness, and confusion. We didn't understand why he was so afraid, why parts of his body would seem to shut down, why he had constant anxiety, panic, and doubt, why he would say weird things, why he kept going downhill and none of the dozens of medication or therapies they tried helped.
We didn't have a diagnosis until the late stages. The worst thing about not having a diagnosis for me was our doubt over whether his behavior was due to an illness or if he was making stuff up. He was having hallucinations delusions, and we didn't know this was going on or how to deal with them.I want to be less scared of this disease.",False
21,9,"A chance to know the man we only heard, saw and loved.",mayankmalviya,n/a,16/08/2025,"The honesty which the filmmakers have applied is amazing to see, also I really learned dome nicest of the techniques in documentary filmmaking. We loved Robin, and you will like this nice tribute the lovable man as well.",False
22,10,Deeply moving and informative.,SnobReviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heartbreaking, impactful and informative; ""Robin's Wish"" goes deep inside the mind of a creative genius and a disease with no cure.In this documentary, Robin Williams' wife Susan tells the story of what really happened to one of the greatest entertainers of all time and what his mind was fighting.Offering interviews with family and friends closest to Robin Williams, this doc will pull at your heart strings. Don't expect a film about Williams' life and career; this beautifully made doc talks about the disease he tried to fight and what it was like living with that. A very insightful film that fans of Williams should watch, but also to learn about a silent disease. Not everything unfolds the way the media portrays it and this doc is proof of that. A must-see.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!",False
23,4,Warning: attempt at misinformation detected in here,TooKakkoiiforYou_321,n/a,16/08/2025,"In particular about the fact that, just by simply browsing on the web, it becomes clear that Robin Williams, a person of whom I'm a fan too, died not because of his unfortunate, uncurable brain illness but because of a suicide act due to the effects of said illness. Yet, for reasons completely unknown to me (prejudice against suicide, I guess?), William's widow tries to paint the death of the guy, a normal human suffering an irreversible illness that he didn't know and who totally was NOT a warrior of any kind, as a result of the illness itself and not because he committed suicide due to the effects of the illness on him and the pain he suffered. Which me, as a fan of him, I find highly insulting of Williams, the situation of completely loneliness he was trapped in and the fact that, even if there's no need to be obsessed with ritual suicide like the Japanese are, unless you're NOT in the situation in which Williams was there's no judging of his last act involved of sorts, meaning you don't need to feel shamed of passing his suicide as the thing it was. Other than that, this documentary is not as focused as other reviewers made it, there's too much rambling about William's third marriage (it's a documentary focused on his last days struggle or his life in general?) or him going to entertain the US troops, something that, unless you're an american, you don't care one bit. The previous documentary on William was not the best experience ever, but this, compared to that one, ends being tedious at best and insulting at worst. This is the second and last time I'll ever watch a documentary on an actor I am a fan of, I can guarantee it.",False

25,10,"Robin's Wish - Oh Capitan, My Capitan",stargateguy1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Robin's Wish wasn't the documentary I was expecting at first glance. I was ready for something that would go back over his life of roles and characters and the people he impacted. Wow. Was I not ready for this tear-jerker. I really enjoyed learning Robin's background as a person and being taken on a ride of his life. I especially liked all the truthful information presented and explained that the public media companies often neglected to report. Hearing about how he was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia really got me. I've been around people with Parkinson's, dementia, and Alzheimer's. But Lewy body dementia was new to me. I found it so inspiring that someone who had this awful disease, and wasn't aware that he had it, could continue being the best they were. Robin really had it right in his belief in life. Once you realize that there's so much more than you, you have only just begun. Dead Poet's Society, a film I was shown while in high school, was where I got to see Robin act outside of animation and I really loved that. He was such an amazing person and he never stopped caring. Hopefully some of the other actors in Hollywood would take on his example someday. You will be missed, Robin. Thank you for all the joy you brought to this world, and thank you for all the joy your characters keep bringing to it too.",False

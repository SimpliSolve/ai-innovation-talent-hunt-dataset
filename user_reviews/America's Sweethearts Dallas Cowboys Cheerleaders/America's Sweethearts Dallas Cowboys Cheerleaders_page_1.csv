1,8,Come on people!,bredagain,n/a,16/08/2025,"It seems like a lot of viewers missed the point of this. It's as if some of you thought you were rating DCC directly. If you found the music tense instead of bright, it's because it's supposed to be. If you found the way the cheerleaders are spoken to in a toxic manner, you were supposed to. If you were disappointed this wasn't about hard working dancers loving their low pay part time job because it's ""tradition"" and was instead about toxic workplaces, impossible beauty standards, and the exploitation of women's bodies, you're a part of the problem. The DC as an organization has the money to pay these women a reasonable salary a hundred times over. At the VERY least bodyguards. Lastly the constant Jesus talk was meant to highlight how and why it's so easy to take advantage of a group of young women.",False
2,8,America's bitter-sweethearts,gmjmdnjj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think the show did a really good job at capturing the process and the experience of the girls and the management. Personally, I found it fascinating. I'd be happy to watch them make the 2024 season all over again.I felt sad and moved, even stressed!, for the majority of it - but ultimately it was a fair display of the business and industry. Show biz isn't a pretty biz. Sports is a money making machine and ultimately that's the goal.Only a few girls are really picked to be the focus - which makes sense in terms of time and storytelling but I feel like we only got glimpses of the personalities on the team.It shows the hard work, determination, ethics, passion, brutality, stress, commitment, etc.The question does remain - how do these girls endure so much stress, over work, deterioration of the body. Severe physical and mental health- for so little money/payoff?I guess I'll never truly understand the sisterhood and community (to the point that's it's their personality and identity) that their life revolves around.",False
3,7,Both Joyful and Heartbreaking,pandora1988,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really enjoyed finding out about the behind the scenes stuff like the abhorrent pay and incredibly tedious beauty standards. Hearing them insult the hair and makeup and bodies of these young ladies was quite stomach churning. Finding out they have to pay for their own calendars, don't get to keep their uniforms and get paid a pittance while being gaslit into believing it's a privilege and that's enough pay in and of itself was an eye opener. These young ladies spend a lifetime training to become a DCC and continue to beat on their bodies with practice and performances, many requiring multiple surgeries while very young. That is not a privilege IMO.With their pay so ridiculously low, they really do make it so only people with money can do it. Sure, you can work a full time job on top of cheering. But, again, making a pittance per game and appearances, while not being allowed to take sponsorships, makes it nearly impossible to do unless you come from a wealthy family.All that aside, the bonds the girls create is a wonderful thing to witness. They really do seem to enjoy what they do. That doesn't make their treatment any more proper.",True
4,6,Interesting but disturbing too,con-fan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was amazed at the talent of these young ladies and wish they had shown more of the auditions because they are really fantastic dancers. Then their dance ability sort of gets cheapened to doing those sexualized moves on the football field to get the men drooling at them in those tiny white shorts. I know it is tradition and how can you change the outfits after so many years, so it's not like I expect that to change and it didn't bother me that much as the girls like wearing them. The girls really are gorgeous and seem very personable but you know they must stress over gaining an ounce in those outfits and weights must be like 115 on average. They work very hard. I did love the Thunderstruck routine. It was exciting to watch. I couldn't understand the hyper focus on Victoria only for it to be for nothing in the end. I thought she was one of the most striking cheerleaders on the field to watch, and yet all the leaders did was put her down all the time, I didn't get it, and it never made it make sense for the viewer. She lacked energy? She was as good or better than the other girls. Reece was adorable on the field but I got tired of her baby voice in her interviews and the whole boyfriend thing. He seemed nice but it was all just like why is this going on and on. Just were too many boring interviews for the most part. I am not sure why certain girls were giving interviews constantly and others were not even talked to. The whole thing was WAY TOO LONG. I had to skip through most of it to the more interesting parts. I'd be interested to see another season IF they can cut it down to less time, IF they can show less interviews and show more dancing and do a lot less blah blah blah talking.",True
5,9,Bittersweet Sweethearts,cutie7,n/a,16/08/2025,"My favorite documentaries are the ones that don't need to explain everything for you and just show you things as they are, letting you form your own opinion. ""America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders"" on Netflix does precisely that, peeling back the glittery facade to reveal a world teeming with misogyny, toxicity, and emotionless aliens in human form. We witness super talented women being worked to the bone, paid next to nothing, and yet being told this is a ""privilege"" and a ""job."" The stark contrast between the glamorous image and the harsh reality is jarring, and will leave you cringing and in awe at the exploitation masked as opportunity (ESPECIALLY if you're a feminist).This documentary is both heartbreaking and infuriating, a bittersweet yet important watch. It touches on subjects of mental health, depression, toxic environments, generational trauma, eating disorders, and even suicide. The treatment of these women is a devastating reflection of the broader societal issues at play. ""America's Sweethearts"" doesn't just entertain; it forces a necessary conversation about the costs of maintaining a facade of perfection at the expense of human well-being.",False
6,7,Interesting Documentary about extremely talented Jesus freaks,Koneko_XP,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very interesting to see some sort of cult like group, that work incredibly hard to fight for a spot in a cheerleading team. Most of them dedicate their talent to God and Jesus instead of them working incredibly hard.It's interesting to see American cheerleading culture to its finest. You have to look a certain way, act a certain way and put on (fake) smiles to be able to join this elite group, where you purposely injure your hips, back, feet, etc. They do this to please the coaches/judges, because they can be thrown out of the group whenever the coaches think it's time. Sometimes they don't even give a reason, but just because they like someone else a little bit more.I respect their hard work and dedication, but it saddens me that these girls are ruining their body and self esteem for validation and (hopefully getting) minimum wage, sometimes less. They are being judged on everything, including: losing or gaining weight, feeling sad or less energetic, nervous or not limber enough.It is filmed well and is an emotional rollercoaster.",False
7,10,Shocking,jql_longhurst,n/a,16/08/2025,"$25k a year to sell your soul and body to a billionaire. Maybe that's what Hollywood has always been too. Being cut for being too short, or smiling the wrong way, or not having the '""it factor"". Hollywood. Hip replacement at 25 years old? All for the honour and joy of being part of a sisterhood. But for $25k a year? Netflix owns the global franchise for sports and entertainment exposes and this one is as good as Drive to Survive in its own way. Utterly compelling. The steely inhumanity of The Owner is probably normal for corporate America, But is it acceptable? Slave labour in todays world isn't right.....",False
8,6,Interesting,putnam-jennifer8,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this documentary drama series was interesting to see the inside of this iconic organization. A lot of people are going to scream sexism blah blah blah but there is certainly a tradition here that is highly respected. The ladies work so hard to make the team. My biggest appalling moment was finding out this is more of a hobby instead of a full time paying job. Also the physical toll that cheerleading is on the body. There's definitely a ""type"" to this space, and I'm definitely not one of them, but I gained so much respect for these ladies after seeing their dedication and commitment and heart into becoming a Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader.",False
9,8,Enjoyed the concept but painful to watch at times,Sunflower_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed seeing behind the scenes of the DCC, as a European I'd somewhat heard of them but didn't know anything about them.It was hard to watch the coaches and owner of the stadium critique the women's bodies and looks and seeing Victoria in particular being treated badly. It reminded me of America's Next Top Model at times with the awful judgment of the girls, I mean one girl got called out and cut for being too short after stating there wasn't a height limit.Didn't like the constant cult like behaviour from Reece either as it was really off putting to watch someone constantly talk about religion. (They toned it down in season 2 assuming it after seeing everyone commenting on it).They seem to put their bodies through a lot of trauma both mentality and physically for next to nothing income wise. The girls seem to really enjoy it which is nice and they all seem to get along and they all seem like nice people.Overall it was an interesting watch but also sad at times. I hope Victoria never goes back to DCC.Edit: after watching season 2, I think Kelly & Judy realised they weren't coming across very well on camera so they became a lot softer in season 2 which was nice to see. However I went to watch the original DCC making the team 2006-2021 out of intrigue and they're absolutely awful to the girls throughout the whole show, like really bad. It makes me wonder how much the makers of the Netflix show has had to cut out to make them seem better or they're just acting for the camera. I'd like to think that they've grown with the times.Also I hope Chandi is doing ok, from the way they put it out on the show, no one on the team other than Jada seemed to support her. Seemed to me they wanted a 'villain' in each season (Victoria in the first and Chandi the second) but it came across to viewers more like they needed support and no one was there for them.",True
10,n/a,"America is the sickness,...",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This 7 part doco is a well funded story that looks good and does well. It has all the structure, flesh and hallmarks of what that old pamphlet ""How to make a documentary for Netflix"", required.Thing is though - if this is what America is all about, then geez! We're doomed.It would have been good if the producers could have shown some of the love and community that apparently they are famous for, but No. It was absent.Not without content though - In the last reunion episode we had a lady that was an original 70 model, currently battling and surviving from ovarian cancer.Would have been good to see how the DCC came together and supported this sister.But no, there is no footage or record of that,...because it didn't and doesn't happen.America and it's values take centre stage here. We're screwed.",False
11,6,Talented powerful women get reduced to sex symbols,andartarius,n/a,16/08/2025,"This right here is why everything in our society needs to change, art is extremely undervalued and is always compressed down to cheap theatrics when in reality there is so much potential in all of these young women, this cycle of objectification is so endlessly toxic and the girls keep asking for more because they dont know any better.I appreciated the camera work and how well it was crafted but it just shed such a dark light on these outdated practice , turning women into object of sexualization in order to make easy bucks while these girls are horribly underpaid for their overwhelming artistic talent.Not only that but it shows how in the end whats missing in society is places where people work together and get that sense of camadery, which is probably what all of these girls are after in the end, they just want to feel like they belong, like we all do, because we live in a society where everyone is in his corner trying to make ends meet and a lot of people later in life lose that sense of cohesion with society.",False
12,10,Fascinating look at the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,kelly-90368,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating look at the ""DCC"", as they call themselves! Tradition, history, passion, values, sisterhood are the focus. But, the real standout is the absolute athleticism and skill that these young ladies have, along with intelligence, poise, and beauty. They 100% sign up to be scrutinized, evaluated, judged, and ultimately given an opportunity to showcase their talents and join what seems to be a sorority of many generations of GCC. The backstories of some GCC are featured, along with the directors of the organization. I like the ""real"" scenes - hair up in curlers, no makeup, no filters. These young women, like the rest of us, have insecurities, fears, love and loss. They attend church and pray. Ultimately, whether you're a cheerleading or football fan or not, you will find yourself rooting for them! Here's to a Season 2!",False
13,6,Appalled at the outdated views of the coaches and lack of compensation for the women,kristinrutkowski,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started watching this show because I thought it would be inspiring to see athletes (similar to Cheer) compete and perform and train (in dance) to be their best selves. Once I began watching I was immediately turned off to hear how litttle these women are paid for their time, dedication and efforts. As someone who grew up dancing I know how difficult it is to find a career in dance and this show proves that these women are truly not valued. They give their blood sweat and tears to this team (after having to work their real jobs during the day) just to receive so little compensation to be on one of the most famous cheer teams in the world. I was appalled.Then there was more.... They analyze every part of their bodies, don't want them to be fit (just skinny), bring them up then tear them down. Cut 2 brown girls first (more specifically one was so entrancing to watch and had the most beautiful fit body - of course that wasn't why they said they cut her buuuttt I'm just making my own assumptions).Anyway I get that these women need to look good in the costumes. But it's 2024- time for some different (still fit still thin) body types. Athletes, bootys, boobs, short hair..... they exist and people like them. These old women with old views should retire. Makes me sad to see.",False
14,5,An Unknowing Exposé,GirlRebuilt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Meant by those involved to paint the organization in a positive light, I felt this series highlighted the misogyny, the exploitation, and the objectification of these women. Paid a repugnantly small salary, these women devote their time and destroy their bodies to be part of something that is frankly beneath them. Many of them are highly educated, most of them have had years and years of formal dance training. Surely they can do better than this. But as one of the veterans said, they had ""drank the Gatorade"". Eye-opening for those of us unfamiliar with the franchise and worth watching as it exemplifies one of the ways in which the patriarchy is still alive and well, and how some women are perpetuating it.",False
15,7,Sex for Jesus?,elwyn-92813,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was both a fun and perplexing watch. Fun: very good dancers. Perplexing: why are they doing this? Re the latter question, I was most curious about newbie Reece.I couldn't tell whether Reece is naive, simple, or just very good at rationalizing that selling sex is something God and/or Jesus want her to do. Reece is a very talented dancer who says she's going to attract people to Christianity by dancing in an extremely provocative way in a very revealing costume. All you have to do is look at the faces of the men during her audition -- one even calling for a ""cooling off"" period after her dance -- to know Jesus isn't what they were thinking about. The same can be said about the larger audience at the games -- other than maybe thanking God for the revealing outfits.I also felt badly for the woman who sent in the audition tape of her dancing in what might be her living room. She is an ordinary looking woman, not glossed and curled, a little overweight, rather clumsy, dancing in gym shorts and a crop top rather than in a sleek matching costume in a dance studio. When you see the production quality of the other audition tapes, as well as the mass production quality of the women, you know there's going to be no other response to her than the one they give: just NO. And that's not the unkindest comment they make.",True
16,8,Emotional and insightful!,suse-04098,n/a,16/08/2025,"I will not lie to y'all, the first time I started watching this I didn't make it through the first episode and almost didn't pick it up again. But I am really glad I did and then I proceeded to binge this show in two days. I really loved this deep dive into the DCC, their sisterhood, and the girls behind the cheerleaders. But from a European perspective this was also incredibly American to watch! The amount of religion and belief is time and time again surprising to me, and just some people- I don't even have words for them. But still, a nice emotional and insightful documentary about the joys and pains of being a DCC and very worth a watch.",False
17,6,Do People Realize This Is Their Choice?,Oh_Capital,n/a,16/08/2025,"User critics act like these girls are slaves and have no choice. As if they are forced to do these cheers and participate in this process. Is it crazy and cultish? Yeah sure. But these girls chose it. Not only that but they are glad they've done it, even amidst all the crap they go through. Should we not take their word for it? Are they liars?Okay, now the review.Overall a fairly good documentary. The narrative is compelling in the first few episodes. Each girl fighting for one of the coveted thirty-six positions. The culture has a lot of cult in it. I say it partially in jest but it is bizarre how obsessive these girls are to get into DCC. Thats part of what makes this series interesting. The sisterhood is the bright spot amidst the cutthroat nature of the process. Without it this would just seem like a tragedy. The series is a little long. They could have shaven off three episodes easily. After the Final Cut it just slows way down. The editing was weird in parts, scenes going on longer than they should, or just including scenes that add nothing. Some of the background music choices were bleh, but these days it's to be expected. Not a mind blowing documentary, but not trash either. A solid six.",False
18,10,Even better than CMT,jmcbrayer-48763,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was so sad when they cut the CMT show ""Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team"" a year or two ago. Honestly, I like this better. It was a much more comprehensive view of the organization, the cheerleaders, their lives on the team and outside of it, as well as how it's all changed over the years. Yes, they absolutely should be paid more. However they make the decision to tryout and stay on the team knowing how it is because they love the experience and the team. That's made very clear in the episodes. I really hope Netflix brings this back another season!! Definitely worth the watch, I recommend it for anyone who likes the original show.",False
19,6,Season 2,lgrosser58,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust finished season 2. Loved seeing several of the team go to bat for better pay and win! I liked the individual stories of the girls but dislike how the coaches, especially Kelli, continue to push the perfect image to these young girls. It's totally doable to have a team of great girls without berating them and cutting them for not being gorgeous or perfect. Keli also loves the camera on herself, almost constantly and it takes away from the team and purpose of this series. Did not even get to see Thunder, which they are famous for, because it's always about Kelli. Would love to see more dancing as a team on the field and not as many clips of groups at practice.",True
20,9,layered and compelling,JoElliot,n/a,16/08/2025,"I expected this to be a snooze fest - I've seen clips for Making the Squad and had zero interest. That said, the producers knocked it out of the park with this one. The end result is a layered and finely drawn portrait of - gasp! - strong, driven women working tirelessly toward their goals, pursuing their passion, and lifting each other up (rather than tearing each other apart).The series does a great job showing the varied backgrounds and personalities of these young women and, in some cases, their families. We also get to see Kelli and Judy and get a glimpse of their trajectory with the organization - theirs truly feels like a labor of love. We thoroughly enjoyed it.A note: I would love to see DCC pay these women a living wage. It would also be nice to see them leave the split landing for the Thanksgiving game only, or just take it out altogether.",False
21,7,Hideous,CathleenR-14,n/a,16/08/2025,"2 older women running these young girls into the ground. Making them count to 8 for hours and hours. The Cowboy organization needs to streamline and modernize this "" cheerleader "" concept. It's ridiculous to put them through such a grueling exercises to become a "" cheerleader."" It's cheerleading not Carnegie hall. The 2 older women feel powerful and I can see they enjoy putting these young women through this and having the power to choose who gets the coveted blue and white uniform. It's hideous!! Seriously this comment is too short! I have to include more characters just to post this
Really!!",False
22,8,Excellent documentary,MickyG333,n/a,16/08/2025,"8.0 stars.I don't binge through documentaries very often, but I watched this in two days. The similar ones, although totally different, NFL documentaries like ""Hard Knocks"" and ""Quarterback"" are male oriented (obviously) but for some reason they aren't nearly as interesting. I can't pin it down, but this cheerleader documentary blows them away, at least for me. It's not about ogling pretty women, not at all. Looking at these girls, they are worn out and stressed all the time. There is hardly anything attractive about those aspects of the show. We get to witness the grittiness of their experiences and interactions. What I find interesting is that this seems to capture the reality of it all, as if they just figured out how to capture it right. I bet you anything they will change the format and delivery for next season and for me it will be a major downer, but somehow so many people will come out of the woodwork and say, ""season two is so much better"", and all I can say to those future reviewers is that I disagree, season one is perfection.The few things I didn't like so much are they focused on too few women and didn't share the camera with a few more. I would have liked to have seen ten girls' experiences instead of 5 or 6. They focused on a couple women exclusively for at least half of the show and that wasn't the best decision, however the show is still tremendous. Just add a few more ladies next season, please.",False
23,7,"""Fresh Cheers, Familiar Spirit: A 7/10 Take on 'American Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders'""",bijsterboschjaap,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who has watched nearly every episode of ""Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team,"" diving into ""American Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders"" was a fresh experience. Immediately, the enhanced production quality stands out, marking a significant upgrade from the earlier CMT series. Although at times it may seem a bit exaggerated, this likely varies based on personal cultural and geographical backgrounds.The series excels in its deep dive into the lives of both rookie and veteran cheerleaders, providing a well-rounded view of the individuals and the organization. Unlike its predecessor, it continues beyond the first game, offering a more comprehensive glimpse into the season.However, the transition to virtual try-outs, necessitated by the pandemic, loses some of the personal touch that live auditions offered. The suspense and joy of discovering one's progression in person at the board, and the celebration of making the final 36, were highlights that I missed in this iteration.The absence of familiar faces like Kitty and Mellisa, who brought a unique energy to the show, and the reduced focus on dance routines and special guests, were also notable. The calendar photoshoot, always a fun segment, was another casualty of the condensed format.Despite these changes, the series holds promise. I'm hopeful for a renewal and an extended season that can recapture some of the traditional elements that fans, including myself, cherish so much.",True
24,5,Girls just want to have equal pay,bagamerifanni,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet me start off by saying I had absolutely no prior knowledge about DCC or watched any other shows revolving around it so I was absolutely shocked.As a European, it was hard for me to grasp the concept of cheerleaders and why these girls would go through SO MUCH to be a part of DCC, but I think the show did a great job of building anticipation and hype around being part of the group. Not knowing what I was going into I found the show super disturbing and I even had to pause several times as some of the dialogue made me so mad. The two matriarchs of the show Kelli and Judy were so manipulative, emotionally abusive and just downright awful to these girls it was hard to watch.These women are elite athletes who are expected to not only be skilled dancers, entertainers, good-will volunteers but also must look picture perfect with a full face of makeup and bouncy hair reminiscent of a beauty pageant and a uniform as skimpy as dental floss. On top of all this, they get paid next to nothing to be there as the coaches put it ""it's a privilege to be a part of the group"".The girls are regularly monitored, and we learn from Victoria that they used to weigh them several times a day to make sure they were keeping to their weight then they have the nerves to tell some of the girls off for ""not fueling their body"" or ""not having enough stamina"". I'm afraid the call is coming from inside the house Kelli. They also meticulously go through each and every picture of the cheerleaders from games in order to ""correct"" anything wrong with their appearance including telling Victoria to not put mascara on her lower lashes. WTF? Imagine being torn apart like that by people you look up to and consider an inspiration.They also continuously make snarky remarks about the girls being ""unsocial"", looking ""sick"", having too big of a distance between their belly button and their underwear (yes, really). Is it really a wonder that so many of these girls have mental health issues and look terrified to interact with the two coaches?By the end of the show I realized that DCC basically operates as a cult, putting newcomers through a hoard of awful challenges, giving them rings to signify their commitment to DCC, making these girls believe that they're doing this for the happiness of the fans and leaving their mark when they're really just upholding a sad, miserable, outdated system created so that men can have something to ogle at during football games.I was so disappointed with the backwards thinking in this show and I was so happy to see Victoria decide not to come back for another season. She deserves so much better, all these cheerleaders do.",True

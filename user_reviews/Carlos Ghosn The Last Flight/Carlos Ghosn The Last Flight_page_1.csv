1,8,Fascinating but unbalanced,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNick Green's documentary tells a very interesting story. Some years ago, Reanult purchased a stake in struggling Japanese car company Nissan; Nissan purchased a (smaller) stake in Renault in return; and the two firms set up a joint venture as well. One man was chairperson of all three companies: Lebanese businessman Carlos Ghosn, who was talented, ruthless and greedy, in accordance with all the stereotypes. But when the French state increased its stake in Renault, the Japanese wanted out; and struck by having Ghosn arrested for self-enrichment. It's unclear if his behaviour was indeed illegal; arguably, it should have been, but there was politics involved in his imprisonment. In spite of being under fierce surveillence, Ghosn managed to smuggle himself out of the country, fleeing as luggage loaded into a private jet. And as far as it goes, it's a good story, mostly narrated by Ghosn himself. Here is also the limit of the story: it allows Ghosn to present himself as a hero. No prosecutors or representatives of Nissan would take part in the film. At the end of the movie, it's revealed that the Lebanese mansion where Ghosn now lives was bought and renovated by Nissan at a cost of 40 million dollars. On one hand, this is a tale of a persecution; on the other, it's also a tale of the impunity of the rich. The film lacks balance, and only hints briefly at the second side of the story. I'd like to hear the other side as well.",True
2,10,A modern-day story of a tragic hero.,vyto-39570,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Nissan company was circling round the drain. Ghosn came in and turned it around and restored it to profitability. As a result, Nissan reciprocated by trying to get him thrown into prison. This is disgusting beyond words. There was absolutely no proof of any malfeasance. But that did not stop them. A horribly tragic example of no good deed goes unpunished.PLEASE DO NOT BUY NISSAN PRODUCTS !!!Some other aspects of Japan come out in the movie which are also very depressing.Criminal courts in Japan have a 99.4% rate of convictions. This suggests that they are trying to outcompete North Korea in running a kangaroo court system. No honest court system can have a 99.4% rate of convictions.It is apparently okay in Japan for folks to hate non-Japanese people, just because they are not of Japanese stock. I have met many wonderful Japanese people. But it is shocking that a significant fraction of the population would have such attitudes. By comparison, I am an American. But never in my life have I encountered anyone saying the non-Americans are a lower form of life.The movie is very well made and in a straightforward documentary style. But you can't help but emerge very moved by this extreme injustice done to this man. Please note that nobody has ever proved any malfeasance on the part of Mr Ghosn; they merely drummed up accusations against him.I do not understand the comment that the subtitles are inadequate. Maybe there was some early version where this was the case. But when I watched the film (February 2022), the subtitles were completely satisfactory. So if they were initially problematic, evidently this was fixed.",False
3,10,The most intelligent man on Earth,georgemachreky,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a man , and what a documentary!! , If you want to know the rise and the fall and the escape of carlos ghosn this is your documentary, and how he played the Japanese government.",False
4,9,He wasn't part of the establishment,grovesjcs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nissan spent over $200M running a smear campaign against Ghosn. That says it all. Nissan was failing bigly before Ghosn saved them. Never buying a Nissan again.Japan government illegally detained him. Even a UN special investigator concluded Ghosn was arbitrarily detained. Japan has a 99.4% conviction rate. No honest judicial system has that. Japan government is corrupt.Nissan and Japan also conspired to get one of the Board members, an American citizen, illegally detained and convicted on no evidence. Done with Japan and Nissan.And France didn't support Ghosn, who turned around their ugly car Renault (would die if not subsidized by France) business because he ""wasn't part of their global cabal i.e. WEF.In the end, was that the way for a 64 yr old man to spend the rest of his days for saving at least two car companies? No.",False
5,3,Needs better subtitles,mrkharvel-254-233068,n/a,16/08/2025,"The subtitles are so bad, that unless you speak both French and Japanese, you'll miss about half the content of this documentary. Other than this, what you can understand is a very interesting look at modern business.",False
6,9,A Master that became victime of an international conflict of interest.,ahmed-hammoud,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazing story of how a genius manager can become the victime of an international conflict of interest between two powerful economies. Regardless what is said or believed, Carlos Ghosn remains The Master of Managing to Excellence.",False
7,4,1 hour of Tabloid Journalism,kk-carrie,n/a,16/08/2025,"My mistake to watched this with higher expectation. The perspective of the documentary can be : A boy who wanted to prove his worth by his capability and not his background nor the people's acceptance, but eventually landed a similar fate with his father. A man who started from nothing (or really?) charmed his way up to be picked by Renault, subsequently got his head tangled in his own cloud nine and unfortunately mired in the melding political and business affair that was already a rickety alliance from the start.This documentary did something like that but in touch n go method. Yes he's charming some people like him, then he did this then he said that. I get it, avoiding too much dwelling in his personality may be perceived as bias. Then elaborating from his perspective and actions as a CEO or culture clashes? He cut costs; shut down factory and terminated people. He didn't show up for important festival. He is a gaikokujin. Really? How about him going through all Nissan's financial paperwork and found that Nissan invested in many failing business, or appointing seniors based on seniority and not capability? I could go on but that's how a lot of wasted potential content for this documentary that could have not only appeal to the sarcastic bitter corporate rats but also to the layman.",False
8,4,A very interesting story but an exercise in frustration,uma-48712,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story hooks you and you are really engrossed in it when bang- the scene cuts to a French business correspondent who is talking in French. You wait and wait hoping that the subtitles appear but all you get is a caption saying ""Speaking in French"" or words to that effect. You end up missing info which may have been important but who knows? And it always happens when things are getting interesting. And there are a number of interviews with the then Japanese justice minister and Carlos' lawyers- all in Japanese and again not subtitled. The crazy part is there is an interview with his ex-wife which is in English- and then you have a Japanese audio translation overlaid on top of it. Merits an 8 if not for the lousy subs.",False
9,1,Subtitles are Useless,fiegehen,n/a,16/08/2025,Subtitles provided only in English but not for the French and Japanese narrative therefore you only get half the story. We Pursued this for half of the Doco then gave up in frustration. Appalling production.,False

2,10,Persepolis is the cradle of democracy in the ancient world,yasertayefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"All sources of documents and historical evidence in the world show that the Persian and Achaemenid civilizations were built with the original and glorious attitude of their founder ""Cyrus the Great"" and with the unique tact of ""Darius I"" its light shone on the whole world. Today, after thousands of years, no civilization has reached the glory of this democratic and advanced empire. Persepolis and Pasargad were two pieces of the lost paradise of the ancient world, and discovering its secrets can clearly have the greatest contribution to the world today in solving the problems and complexities of great empires. This responsibility rests on all the world to guide future generations with open and wide eyes to the history of our world by reviving the culture and civilization of our predecessors.",False
3,10,The first great empire of the world,mahdiajerlo-89340,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler(550-330 BC) was an ancient Persian king in Western Asia founded by Cyrus the Great in 550 BC. It reached its greatest size during the time of Xerxes I, the Achaemenid Empire in its largest territory extended from the Balkans and Eastern Europe in the West and to the Indus Valley in the East. This empire was the largest empire in the world until that day and had a total area of 5.5 million square kilometers (2.1 million square miles). More than 30,000 clay tablets and a number of stone tablets were found in 1312 by archaeologists in the northwestern corner of the throne. The discovered Jamshid clearly shows that the workers in Takht Jamshid (unlike the workers who built the pyramids of Egypt) not only in Takht Jamshid but in all places and government institutions, received sufficient salaries, and in addition, they had a ""monthly ration"" and More surprising than that all of them were ""insurance"" üè•
Cyrus the Great says: ""When I entered Babylon, I happily sat in the palace of the kings. Marduk, the great God of Babylon, brought the free people of Babylon to me, and I worshiped him every day, countless soldiers. I came to Babylon in peace. I didn't allow the cruel behavior against ""Sumer"" and ""Akkad"". He said, Cyrus, the king who worships him, and Cambyses, my son, and all my soldiers, and we, glorified his Lord with joy. Also, this empire was the world's first superpower. The Iranian plateau presented the world's first great empire to human civilization.",True

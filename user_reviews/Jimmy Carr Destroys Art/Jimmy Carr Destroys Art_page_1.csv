1,1,Complete waste of time,batantx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Worse take on cancel culture I have ever seen. I have no clue who Jimmy Carr even is but I have to say he's definitely no comedian as his jokes are not funny in the least. They must have had to use a ""Laugh Now"" prompt card to get the studio audience to laugh.I dont understand this show in the least as it's a cancel culture show where they take two pieces of art both done by agreeably horrible people ""pedophiles, murders, racists"" and allow the audience to vote on only one of the two pieces to destroy but only after giving the life story of each of the artists.How are you doing the world a service by not only publicly exhibiting these pieces of supposed art to a worldwide audience but also giving their life story?This has to be the dumbest show I have ever wasted my time watching....",False

1,3,Just A Lot of Talk,bookahddiction,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really disappointing. This is supposed to be the work of the family of the late investigator, Lou Smit. It's nothing but 46 ways to say, ""I knew the parents didn't do it"" or ""There was an intruder"".But PRECIOUS little evidence follows these two sentences in this ""documentary:.I;m sorry I paid to see it.",False
2,2,Very revealing!!,awells-76390,n/a,16/08/2025,"That is, ONLY if you know ZERO things about this case. This seems like another way to milk cash out of this haunting tragedy. It purports to uncover new possibilities only to hint towards a list of possible suspects. Nothing is actually ""revealed"".",False
3,2,The most biased documentary?,jacobjohansson-50807,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHonestly... I've seen tons of documentaries on the JonBenet case. There are good ones and not so good ones. This one is... not one of the good ones.If you are supposed to present an investigating documentary, where the purpose is to ""reveal the truth"", then you need to dig into every aspect, interview people from all sides of the case, look at every story and every clue. There are no pure angels, there are no perfect acts from any individual in any case where a child is murdered. BUT this documentary only portrays one side and that this is the truth. No questioned asked. No proof presented. No nothing.Seriously. This is probably the most biased ""investigative"" documentary I've seen. I cannot even see it without laughing.The question of ""what really happened"" remains. There are tons of interesting theories. This documentary presents NONE!",True

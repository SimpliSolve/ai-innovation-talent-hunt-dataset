1,8,Deserves more recognition,mrouttt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Across several citizens interviews, this documentary portrays well the actual hell Mariupol's community endure during the first months of their neighbor illegal invasion.Several videos was provided directly by the people who suffers the complete obliteration of their city.Judging by the different score on IMDB and elsewhere, it is a shame that no more people took time to bring this in their wish/to watch list.This is short enough for everyone to include in its planning and will definitely make you realise what the Ukrainian people is fighting against: the return of the fascist threat on European soil.",False

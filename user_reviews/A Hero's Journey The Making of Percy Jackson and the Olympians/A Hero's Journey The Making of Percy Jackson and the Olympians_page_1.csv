1,10,Absolute Masterpiece,caitlinbeard-19285,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is my favourite documentary ever. Not only was I engaged the whole time but I was learning and grinning. I adore how they've done it in order so you get to feel like you're growing up with the actors/cast too. I prefer this to the show as it really showed me what it was like to experience something so amazing. Rick and the whole crew did an amazing job putting the sets together and the show, so to be able to watch that be built brought me so much joy (Expecially seeing the energy and happiness of everyone there). I think my favourite part of it was how we really got to see how the main trio are outside their character as for me that is just as important as who they're acting as. For anyone who is considering checking this behind the scenes out I would very highly recommend as I'm sure you'll love every minute of it like I did.",False
2,10,AMAZING,Orange_Crush2,n/a,17/08/2025,"I love this documentary! I want to be an actor so I just love watching how all of this works behind the scenes. Also, the cast is all so nice behind the scenes to each other and they are very playful. It's fun to see all these things you've watched camera-ready on Disney+ being filmed, and honestly this is just a treat for the entire family. GREAT JOB Disney. Disney+, Rick Riordan, Walker Scobell, and the entire cast and crew of Percy Jackson. This documentary (and the show) is really worth checking out. \
Thank you for reading my review and I'm so excited for Season 2, which has just been announced!",False
3,10,Great insights into a fantastic series,wrxsti54,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerPercy Jackson and the Olympians has almost single-handedly rescued Disney from the financial woes of a string of failed productions. This rendition of Rick Riordan's books hit the bullseye with fidelity to the books, a stellar cast (especially the child actors) and excellent effects and costuming. This documentary shines an excellent light on just HOW this feat was achieved.It is almost universally acknowledged that the chemistry between the three lead actors Walker Scobell, Leah Jeffries and Aryan Simhadri is what makes the series. A Hero's Journey forensically examines this chemistry with a fascinating look into the lives of these three children with filming replete with interviews with both parents of all three.At the top of this large talented pyramid of actors sits Walker as Percy Jackson, an actor of such consummate skill and sheer energy that belies the fact that for all but a few weeks of the 8 months of filming, he was only 13. His fit into the character of Percy Jackson is so good it's as if he was born for this role. Whilst the large numbers of adult actors, directors, writers, educators, acting coaches and stunt people who were also interviewed were unstinting and fulsome in their praise for all the trio, their comments about Walker give the viewer the insight they need to understand why Percy Jackson has been so popular and how Walker, who is on-screen for almost every minute of the 4 hours of footage across the 8 episodes, carried this show despite only starring in two prior movies (The Adam Project and Secret Headquarters) shot only one year earlier.",True
4,10,Interesting what the parents have to say,djbayldon-18658,n/a,17/08/2025,"The movie Percy Jackson and the Olympians was not my cup of tea, I was impressed with the acting and this made the series a little more enjoyable to watch. The young lad who plays Percy Jackson seemed to have put a great deal of effort into his character, this is rarely seen in todays world of, 'winging-it.' Moreover, the parents were very interesting to listen to. Peter Scobell was very passionate about his children who were involved in the series it takes a real man and dad to stand by his children with such passion (One must watch and listen carefully to understand what I mean). This was a nice touch by those who decided to make A Hero's Journey: The Making of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. I wonder if Peter Scobell will take up acting/singing?",False

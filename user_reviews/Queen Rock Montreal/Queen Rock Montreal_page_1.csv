1,8,"Hugely Enjoyable, Even On Your TV",david-meldrum,n/a,16/08/2025,"A terrific document of the band at the height of their powers - inevitably I'd have preferred to have seen it in the cinema, on an IMAX screen. But even on my own TV it's spirit-lifing, life-improving stuff. Freddie really is at the top of his game here as a front man, and he exhibits his soaring voice to beautiful effect ... also showing off the benefits of his opera training by repeatedly fitting more words intelligibly into one breath than should be humanly possible. The only down side is that directors of these films really should remember in the edit that I, like most other concert-goers, never left a gig thinking 'Gee, those drum solos should have been longer.' See also a couple of other noodly instrumental passages. Otherwise, highly enjoyable.",False
2,10,INCREDIBLE!! CATHARTIC!,alonate,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this in glorious IMAX on Friday 1/19. It was unbelievable! The remastered concert footage in high definition (4K I assume) was fantastic. It looks like it was filmed only recently. The sound was also out of this world. You could really feel the thundering drums and bass as if you're watching live in person. And the performance? What's there to say? Freddie Mercury was at the top of his game. An absolutely gifted performer with a beautiful voice. Brian May's guitar playing was also awesome. There were certain guitar effects that he used that would pan through out the the theater. Mezmerizing! To say that this IMAX presentation was amazing is an understatement. I was so floored by experience that my wife (who also loved it üòÅ) and I went back and saw it again 2 days later. Do yourself a favor. If you gat a chance to see it in IMAX, don't pass it up.",False
3,10,Queen Rock Montreal Was A Pretty Spectacular Experience Overall,HabibieHakim123,n/a,16/08/2025,"We Will Rock You indeed, even in this pretty small Montreal Forum venue, Queen the band still able to make one of the most intimate yet theatrical and magical and full of rock energy performances i've ever seen, in this beautifully well shot concert film and great restoration, the lighting, the production, even the smoke effects, and not only Mercury but each member of the band was at their best, they are the Champion and they are the one that Play The Game, 95 minutes of untiring performances, the one that felt too short, Queen Rock Montreal was a pretty spectacular experience overall and i'm glad to be one of the few people that actually able to see it in the great IMAX experience, it's absolutely worth it even if you are still a new fan, this concert alone could be a great introduction to one of the most iconic band of all time, God Save The Queen.",False
4,10,Feels almost like being there!,christineballone,n/a,16/08/2025,"I envy the people who were there. Such an amazing experience. Freddy's voice is at its peak at that time and spine chilling! Thanks to the people who restored this to perfection. The colours, the close ups and the quality of the music is out of this world! I'm a fairly new fan only for the past 10 years or so but I saw Queen in Toronto in 2016 with Adam Lambert which was amazing but I have to say seeing Freddy perform like this he's in a league of it's own! Compared to the music today ( Taylor Swift comes to mind) I can actually hear the words and there is melody I can remember! I'm going to put on my stereo earphones again and keep watching on my big screen!",False

6,10,"A Stunning Tribute to Rock Legends, Capturing the Magic of a Live Performance",hasanozsoy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was initially expecting a low-quality concert recording, but guys... this was nothing short of amazing! From the opening notes to the very last seconds, Queen's performance was absolutely electrifying. Each song was delivered with incredible energy and precision, showcasing why they are considered one of the greatest rock bands of all time. The production quality was superb, making it feel as if I was right there in the audience. I am immensely grateful to everyone who contributed to bringing this iconic performance to us.

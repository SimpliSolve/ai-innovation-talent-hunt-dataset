1,8,"Blistering indictment of the CIA's post-9/11 ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Forever Prisoner"" (2021 release; 119 min.) opens, we are briefly introduced to a prisoner held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who amazingly has never been charged with a crime and who has no right to appeal his imprisonment. We then go back in time to the horrible events of 9/11 and the dramatic fallout afterwards, as the Bush administration is desperate to show the American public it has things under control... At this point we are less than 10 min into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from esteemed and Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney (Taxi To the Dark Side, Agent of Chaos, The Armstrong Lie). Here he looks back at what happened to Abu Zubaydah, believed to be involved with or have ties to the group responsible for 9/11. He was captured in 2002, and brought in for interrogation. As it turns out the FBI and CIA had very different ideas what would make effective interrogating. The CIa prevailed, and charged ahead with its ultra controversial ""enhanced interrogation"" program, a/k/a its torture program. With stunning effect, Gibney lays out how the CIA misled, if not outright lied, about the program. Even worse, the program turns out to be massively ineffective if not counterproductive. I cannot easily recall a more blistering indictment and utter rebuke of the CIA, and how it has damaged not only the intelligence community in the US, but also America's standing in the world, period. Gibney has plenty of insider talking heads who narrate their story calmly and with devastating effect. Your blood will likely boil in utter disgust and disbelief as you watch the sheer ignorance and incompetence within the Bush administration in the post-9/11 era.""The Forever Prisoner"" premiered on HCO earlier this week and is now available on HBO On Demand and HBO Max (where I caught it last night). If you have any interest in what unfolded after 9/11 or simply want to get to the bottom of what the CIA's ""enhanced interrogations"" were all about and how they came to be, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,8,"""Temporary discomfort""",CatTales,n/a,16/08/2025,"The facts of this have been presented elsewhere so it's not breaking news, but is still a compelling two hour view. One fact however, which might have been overly simplified, was fascinating. The ""expert"" psychologist who failed to understand that torture is about manipulation, not an easy path to truth, was himself so easily manipulated. When repeatedly told the hypothetical ""what if there's another 9/11 and you didn't do all you could?"" he went on the warpath, willing to do anything heinous. It says alot about him, not doing any due diligence or honest evaluation of his work which failed compared to normal relationship-building techniques. The initial methods of interrogation were bad enough, and what any normal person would consider torture...the ""enhanced"" interrogation was of course torture. Or what the psychologist called ""temporary discomfort."" Like Rumsfeld comparing his not sitting at his desk to prisoners being made to stand. They needed to minimize and dismiss torture because of their guilt. They knew it was indefensible for any reason, even national security, and was just a form of revenge.",False
3,10,Shocking and terrifing,solojere,n/a,16/08/2025,"The forever Prisoner is a shocking and terrifying documentary about Abu Zubaydah, the first high-value detainee subjected to the CIA's program in Guantanamo Bay, later identified as torture by those outside the agency. I recently Watched Camp-X, which is also about Guantanamo Bay, and I wanted to know more about what actually happens there. But I was unprepared for this documentary. It is almost unbelievable what we as a country did to these people. The scariest thing is that it is still going on and that there is nothing stopping the CIA from doing it again. This really is a must-watch documentary.",False
4,9,See For Yourself,scottdarin,n/a,16/08/2025,A very good and important film. Do not listen to to right or the left in reviews on this. See for your self and decide. This film has nothing to do with Marxism or leftist politics. It also has nothing to do with conservative conspiracies. Rather it dissects what has happened over the last twenty years in our reaction to 9/11. This film also doesn't believe all terrorists are innocent. If you believe that than you are just stupid. People watch films through their own filter. Leave the politics at the door.,False
5,9,Look inside,drjgardner,n/a,16/08/2025,This is an important film as it goes inside the actual behavior of what happens during these types of incarceration. Think of it more as a docudrama. The actins is good and there is a high degree of tension. It's not an easy film to watch.,False
6,10,One more time we see how Americans are,kikajezakon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Half of americans think torture is okay. Is this for real????I actually can not believe what have I just seen and heard.You - Americans, have a big big big problem!!! And it's just getting worse!!!!",False
7,9,Painfully true,sunbeamsfairy,n/a,16/08/2025,I have always had a skewed view of the CIA and FBI. After all they Coined the term conspiracy theory to throw people of the scent of what was actually going on. This is even more eye opening of the horrors that the powers that be will goto to get what they want. It is a total abuse of power. A total lack of restraint . Its sadly nothing new though. MK ultra is another perfect example of the CIA going to far. What gives them the right to be able to do this to people is beyond me. I am under no illusion techniques like this are being used still as the US government will go to any ends necessary to get what they want. Even worse they seem proud of it! Terrifying and barbaric.,False
8,5,Some Americans should be in Gitmo,Mustang92,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot one of Alex Gibney's best documentaries. He really gets into the weeds on this one. While some of that may be necessary, given the subject matter, we're left at the end -- in essence -- with nothing much having changed. And NO ONE was ever held accountable. The bad guys -- besides Abu Zubaydah -- are several Americans, including former CIA Director George Tenet (he really is a piece of you-know-what and should be in prison himself), along with James Mitchell (a psychologist) and Jose Rodriguez (the former director of CIA's Counterterrorism Center). These men are pieces of you-know-what. They should ALL be in jail for their inhumanity, their violation of human rights, their implementation of torture techniques.Sure, Alberto Gonzales (former Attorney General in Bush's cabinet) and John Yoo (another horrible attorney in Bush's White House) are to blame as well. Along with VP Dick Cheney, of course. But for James Mitchell and Jose Rodriguez to ""carry the water"" and implement the torture techniques against prisoners, when there was never any evidence that torture actually works to get prisoners to ""talk""... they should be held accountable. And James Mitchell made $81 Million dollars from our Government for doing this! He laughed all the way to the bank. And at the end, he justifies it all with, ""I believed I was working to save millions of American lives from the next, worse terrorist attack."" Really, James?? You're a liar.All the behind the scenes fighting between the FBI and CIA... don't know that we needed all this in this doc. There's always infighting among major agencies.Anyway, this film could have been streamlined. And all the quick cuts of redacted cables? They're so fast you can't read a lot of them while listening to the voice over, and ultimately, what's the point? Why do we even need to see these? Is there really nothing else that can be shown onscreen? This was all a bit too much.",True
9,10,much better than expected,loozzotys,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great editing. Great narration. It still doesn't mention that there was no full explanation why third tower went down, so the first few minutes is more of a US government propaganda perspective why US was attacked and why US was not able to prevent it. But the documentary is well made overall. Feels like how a Michael amoore Doco is made.",False
10,10,"Truly Eye Opening, Shockingly Entertaining",fossilfonder_e,n/a,16/08/2025,"For someone who doesn't regularly seek out political documentaries like this, I found this film to be surprisingly entertaining. Dare I say, it is perhaps the funniest film about government sanctioned torture???It was incredibly gripping and an infuriating look back at the key players responsible for the U. S. government's torture program. It also brought to life the world of Abu Zubaydah in a creative and compelling ways. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in better understanding the events leading up to and unfolding after attacks of September 11th, without feeling like they're watching a news program. Well done.",False
11,5,"Details the ""Enhanced interrogation "" of one post 9/11 detainee",dale-51649,n/a,16/08/2025,"The filmmaker did an incredible job scoring interviews with people involved in the torture of a detainee in the frenetic post 9/11 world. A substantial majority of Americans had believed we were above this activity, and also that it didn't work, since people will tell you anything they think you want to hear when you inflict enough pain.A perpetually smiley Ali Soufan gushes about questioning prisoner Abu Zubaydah , yet makes sure he emphasis that ""he would nut interview him naked, he would nut go in""... I don't know why he was so determined that we know this, when the man had been hung by his arms, waterboarded, sleep deprived with screaming music , froze, and had multiple other horrid things done to him that sounded like torture . It reminded me of when John Wayne Gacy had killed like 35 dudes yet when interviewed he kept adamantly exclaiming that ""he wasn't gay"".They had a psychologist named Mitchell with no experience interrogating writing up basically torture techniques for interrogation. I am amazed they got him to talk about it on camera . They should have taken a tip from physicians and not to let psychologists do to much damage by limiting them to talk therapy only , they are not allowed to prescribe drugs , they shouldn't be allowed to prescribe so called ""interrogations "".This was well made but the content made me less proud of my country than I was before. Well made, but it made me too depressed to give it more than an ambivalent score.",False

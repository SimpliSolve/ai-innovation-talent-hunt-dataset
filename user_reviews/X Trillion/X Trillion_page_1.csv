1,10,Eye opening... not full of blame and shame,jeffreyswiggnsjunkmail,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not a super eco-environmentalist, but I firmly believe in cherishing and taking care of what God has blessed us with and first and after my relationship with him and my family has to come the world He has provided for us. This documentary does a fantastic job of showing you how badly it is taken care of by us and where all that plastic naturally ends up by the design of how the oceans are designed and work.Where most documentaries on a subject like this spend so much time blaming and shaming the public (which is the person watching it most of the time) for the very problem they are trying to solve, this one presented the problem mush like you should if you would want someone to become interested in resolving it. It had vague knowledge of this plastic pyre, but no idea of the enormity.I also as a father of two daughters admire that a team of ladies chose to embark on this mission accomplished with grace, class, and professionalism in a day and age when most female eco-activists are shown to be almost lead to violence (or do go to violence) in the quest for their passion of their mission. These ladies documented, presented, worked, collected, and did everything you expected a actual professional objective thinking scientific person who wants to solve the problem to do.Well worth the watch.... i wish the was a solution that could be made, but world politics and greed will always prevent it.",False
2,10,Important message presented perfectly.,taverner-44305,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a strange media landscape to try and send factual, inspiring and world changing messages. We witness how the powerful, who make money from polluting the planet, control media narratives and of course how people believe the total lies (even leading to right-wing racist riots) have no moral compass to guide them. Add to that the trends of completely unreal 'reality TV' and the fast paced change in trends young people are used to, and making a documentary that talks to all is tough. The personal story of Eleanor as a dedicated mother, the scientists back stories, the shock of seeing plastic so far from land and the detail of how it has toxified all living things was a clear message. Maybe one day politics will be science driven, peace driven and this documentary and every person working to save the planet will be a success.",False
3,10,A rare message of hope in a bleak world...,jamesb-96781,n/a,16/08/2025,"Heartfelt congratulations to the filmmakers! I really enjoyed this film, which is not always the case when watching content about our wanton destruction of Planet Earth. The all-female approach brought real emotional depth to the undertaking, and you could tell that this voyage really was one of discovery for most of the protagonists, many of whom had never been to sea, let alone the middle of the Pacific under sail! The jeopardy was thus very real, and I got the feeling that all 14 of these wonderful women were going to walk away from their experience and do great things for our environment - a touching message of hope in a fractious and bleak world. Bravo!",False

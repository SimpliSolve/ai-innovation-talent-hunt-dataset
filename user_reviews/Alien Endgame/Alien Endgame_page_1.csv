1,2,ODD FEAR MONGERING PSEUDO DOCUMENTARY,epluribusunumusa,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an odd ""wanna be"" documentary that uses, among other things, scary ""monster"" cartoons to bludgeon the point that you should be scared of UFOs. This pseudo documentary wants you to know that the scary monster UFOs are coming to kill you. This clearly is done by Military Industrial Complex types that are pushing an agenda that the ""monsters"" are coming. Since the monsters are coming to kill us, the government must increase the military defense budget to buy weapons to fight a ""space war."" And, if bludgeoning you with the narrator telling you how bad the UFOs are does scare you, then monster looking cartoons - yes cartoons, the type you expect to see on a Marvel cartoon show - are used to complete bludgeoning you with fear mongering. This is a very hokey pseudo documentary, produced by military industrial types, designed to scare the crap out of you, to convince you that war is coming, and that we need the give the Pentagon more money to protect us. In other words, this is a total piece of crap that does nothing to further the topic with clear sober intelligent conversation. Two stars, instead of one, because there appear to be retired military types , that experienced UFO encounters, providing legitimate testimony.",False
2,2,Fearmongering at its finest...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Needless to say that I had never actually heard about this 2022 documentary titled ""Alien Endgame"" prior to stumbling upon it by random chance here in 2023. The synopsis sounded interesting enough to make me sit down and watch it.Well, I really wanted to enjoy this 2022 documentary from writer Rich Emberlin, but I have to admit that ""Alien Endgame"" was actually little more than just fearmongering. This felt like something that was meant to instill a fear of the unknown and fear of extraterrestrials in the viewers.For a documentary, then they dropped the ball here, because it felt rather biased, and everything was steering the audience towards the edge of a cliff. Fear is what they wanted to panhandle with this 2022 documentary. Nothing more, nothing less.I found no enjoyment in watching ""Alien Endgame"", and this is certainly not something I would recommend you to sit down and waste 87 minutes on watching. Some of us suffered through this so you don't have to. You're welcome.My rating of ""Alien Endgame"" lands on a two out of ten stars.",False
3,1,How stupid ?,kinafari,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is such a disappointment in my opinion. If aliens were going to attack the planet, they would've done that already.It seems the main focus of this documentary is to ""identify an enemy "" seriously?? The drama level is so high, the stupidity is so high too. What a waste of my time!I was hoping for an informative documentary about what the government has been hiding and instead I get to know about ""a potential enemy "" and from my perspective it's only mission is to create a potential fear of ""the others"".Please do something interesting with your time like reading Dolores Cannon books on aliens.I'm speechless.",False
4,7,Watch it with independence,brettjmerle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was actually a decent documentary. I'm well read and researched on this topic and so I found the witness testimony to be valid. There is a clear and obvious attempt to interview military witnesses and many of these witnesses have remarkable things to say. Most importantly, their stories align with what other researches have found in books by Robert Hastings and/or Leslie Kean.What brings this documentary down, like many other like it, is the notion that this obvious obtuse attempt to porject this phenomenon as malevolent. It may well be, but we really have no idea, and the director makes a clear choice to steer the narrative in that direction with embellishment and dramatization.If you can watch this documentary while ignoring these obvious attempts to dramatize, its actually decent.",False
5,1,I had high expectations,lallolu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a person that is very interested in UFOs, alien and time travel films and documentaries. Therefore, I was excited to see this documentary. Alas, what a disappointment. I stopped watching at about 15 minutes since the whole thing was becoming ridiculous and things didn't add up.First, why are they so emotional about having seen a UFO. Why all the crying and shaking. I definitely did not get that.If the UFOs wanted to come and take over, why didn't they do during all those encounters since they apparently had the capacity then.The men probably saw something, heck maybe even UFOs. But for whatever reason they have decided that they want to be scared for life about it. And then they are trying to transfer/create the fear of what is ""coming"" to us. After more than 70 years. Common, please!",False
6,1,What a load of crap!,dancingtreespirits,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYes UFOs exist but no they are not scary and terrifying and are not coming to get us. What a bunch of bologna. This is extremely laughable. The military guy that starts off in this documentary is seriously trying to make us believe he is crying and so distraught by what he has seen, but he can't shed any tears. Then they show him being hypnotized in his past so he can remember everything from his military days, but he's wearing the same boots, he's the same weight etc.. If the ""others"" that operate the UFOs wanted to eliminate the people on earth, they would've already and they wouldn't have knocked that meteorite in half those years ago that would've blew up Russia... Are you really going to believe this nonsense? I couldn't keep watching this after the first guy ""crying"".",True
7,9,Interesting a new approach to the alien issue,rich6845,n/a,16/08/2025,Awesome new approach to the alien subject. I found that the people interviewed for the show were very real and believable. The variety of the stories was very compelling.,False
8,1,I was going to give 2 stars for an involuntary comedy show but...,vacyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"But watching other commentaries (thanks lads) I realized this is purely a deliberate attempt of discrediting all true information about real UFO sightings. The amount of telenovela-like (soap opera) emotional highs about how much the ""victims"" (who did not suffered any physical damage) suffered from the aliens who were ""stalking"" them by following their ships without attacking them or by disabling some nuclear weapons without killing them made me thing this is a movie made by gullible amateurs. Further on in the movie I realized this is not possible, especially after the surrealistic comments of the so called ""reporter"" who is explaining to the ""witnesses"" how the things really happened. And the other comments confirmed my second thought that this movie is not candidly stupid-funny but 100% deliberately fake to discredit any real information about aliens or UFO's.",False
9,1,I should have known I was in for disappointment.,uavrpv,n/a,16/08/2025,"Normally I like these UFO documentaries.I have come to know over the years if it had Neil Tyson or Michio Kaku that is is going to be bad. This one had the latter.Spread the fear where there is nothing to fear.From what I see the fear mongering is trying to make us believe the government and defense contractors are our friends. After the last 7 years that is not a hard sell, it is an impossible sell.The only war that coming is the psyops from our own government trying to BS us that the boogiemen are real and our government that has not shown us in the last 3 years that they care about is will somehow be our protectors.If the aliens do show up I'm giving them directions to a gun store and Washington DC. I trust them more at this point.",False
10,1,Aliens are not hostile,joris-46507,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am convinced that this documentary was only made to scare people about aliens. The stories that have been told seem very unbelievable. Aliens certainly exist, but they are not hostile. I believe they are here to protect us and the Earth from total destruction. This is the only reason they show interest in nuclear bombs. Not because they are afraid of it but rather out of concern that we don't bomb ourselves into destruction. Aliens are loving beings. They are watching over us and I am glad they are there. That's why I'm not afraid of nuclear war. If humanity were to ever be completely destroyed, it would be entirely our fault, not the foreign beings. Again, aliens are not all hostile.",False
11,9,A fresh and detailed perspective.,elijahda-89728,n/a,16/08/2025,Love the investigative approach taken here. Provides detailed accounts of events and allows for the audience to process the presented information for themselves. Interesting subject and engrossing execution.,False
12,8,Great insight into UFO Pentagon reports,dlaguna-61526,n/a,16/08/2025,The US military stories were shocking and revealed that UFOs are indeed real and may be threatening to our planet. Rich Emberlin and the rest of the team were great.The animation elements were a pleasant surprise that really helped retell these astounding stories and bring them to life.,False
13,8,We all want E.T.s but we might get face huggers..,borys-t,n/a,16/08/2025,"The thing about aliens is.. if there is anything to really know about them, at this point, gen pop knows none of it. So all these people in the reviews saying ""they'd be kind loving aliens"" or touting ""aliens saved Russia by blowing up a meteor was that was gonna destroy it"" conspiracy theories, are talking out of their behinds and frankly exactly the kind of people this show is made for. I mean, they clearly watched it if they're leaving a review. I don't see how or why any of them would know better than the experts on the show and they don't provide any proof of their expertise.I too like to think intelligent aliens would be peaceful but that doesn't mean these people's stories and experiences aren't valid and frankly I'd rather be as prepared as we can be for any eventuality than not.",False
14,8,The witnesses were right,kellyhankins-94471,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some people have said this new show overall is a groundbreaking report that reveals what the government had denied for decades, that UFOs are real. What I found most interesting are the witnesses who have serious stories to tell. There are even witnesses with extensive military backgrounds. A must-see documentary. Can't wait for Part 2.",False
15,9,Really fun and interesting take on the UFO topic,jessel94,n/a,16/08/2025,"They had a lot of really interesting witnesses, especially those with a military background. It is really important that people and the government start taking this topic a whole lot more seriously.",False
16,8,All the best UFO experts in one show!,TheWayneAgency,n/a,16/08/2025,"Michio Kaku, Melissa Title and this new guy, Roderick Martin, (where'd HE come from?) is amazing in this new documentary. I have seen all the new UFO shows that are coming out these days and this one, takes the CAKE! I was sucked in right from the beginning. Can't wait to see more of shows like this from Discovery+. LOVE MY SUBSCRIPTION!",False
17,9,Interesting Perspective with Great Interviews,dpvssj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched a lot of these types of shows, but I think Alien Endgame does a good job at bringing in a lot of experts and stories in order to get their point across. Whether you believe the aliens are going to invade us or not, I think it's good to consider the possibilities, and this show presents strong argument with new evidence. The host was great, and I was kept on the edge of my seat the whole time. At the end of the day, I enjoyed the program and it was definitely something we were able to talk about around the dinner table!",False
18,8,Powerful Testimony Given,itsmenimi,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary allowed first hand military to tell their stories, which I found to be powerful. The only part I did not like was the spin that UFOs are a threat. I would have liked if they had remained more objective while exploring the testimony.",True
19,9,Got My Attention,goddessgoals,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI must say that I'm a sucker for most alien, ufo and paranormal docs. So, I took the liberty of getting a 7-day trail for Discovery +. I really enjoyed this documentary and it seemed rather believable. I do not necessarily subscribe to he notion of hostile UFO/alien agenda. In my opinion, there is a balance of benevolence and malevolence. Otherwise, it was great. And, brava Discovery for creating a platform for POC. I rarely if ever see representation in this genre from our black and brown brothers and sisters! Great good!",True
20,9,GOOD WATCH WITH LOTS OF FRESH INSIGHT INTO UFO'S,sarahtopdavies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Typically these show's interview witnesses and then move on to new stories, this one weaves a compelling argument for here a. Being a point to these lists, b. And a reason for them come here. I did not know hat we had fired nukes into space and I shocked me that we did it without thinking of he consequences. It make total sense that potentially life on other planets might no look too favorably on this and I was drawn into he argument the team were remaking.Good show, very thoughtful and nice to see Roderick Martin, so rarely do we have non white experts it was a joy to see him and he added a calm and distinguished edge. I for one believe he has made a strong case for the UFO's no being here for fun. And while I wasn't;' scared, what can I DO? , I did feel more informed afterwards.Beautifully shot too.",False
21,8,Didn't know what to expect,mrhoisten,n/a,16/08/2025,Didn't know what to expect from this show. Boy was I in for a ride. Great insight. Great interviews. I hope there is a part II on the way. Also the black host was probably the most relatable person I have ever seen talking about UFOs. LOL.,False
22,n/a,No up to par expectations,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I regretfully agree... that as I am utterly interested in all the UFO, alien, time travel films and documentaries. I felt there was something missing in that it really disappointed me. Some things did not add up. And the person crying and shaking upon seeing a UFO... REALLY... would NEVER have scared little bitty me... where's the rationale in all this. AND likewise... they have been around for multiple millennia - if they were to take over Earth... they would certainly have done so by now!Also ""they"" may even have had their home on good old Earth eons ago. They might even have been here way before us - and us - the trespassers or the univited.Or... They have a need for this planet and it's people on it... otherwise... we would have been gotten rid of a long, long time ago. They need us for something.Because ""they"" are becoming bolder and bolder, even taunting us... it's just a question of time ... before we will find out what their agenda is once and for all. Trust me. Will we be ready for it?",False

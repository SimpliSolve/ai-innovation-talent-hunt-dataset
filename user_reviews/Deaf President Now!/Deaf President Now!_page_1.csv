1,9,"If you're anti-DEI, please just watch & learn",dfloro,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAward-winning Documentary Filmmaker Davis Guggenheim didn't make the mistake that the university board of trustees made in 1988: He enlisted the aid of a deaf man, named Nyle DiMarco, to help him make this fabulous movie about the eight days that ultimate led to the world's only deaf college, Gallaudet University in Washington, D. C., getting its first deaf person as its president. If the students' visceral, emotional reaction to having its two qualified deaf candidates passed over in favor of an able-hearing N. C. nurse doesn't move you, then you must be truly inhuman. I rate this a strong 9 of 10.",True
2,8,Deaf Power!,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. It was 1988, and when this group of students proclaimed, ""We will be heard!"", it took on additional importance. The anger of these students represented 124 years of repression. Student protestors were from Gallaudet University in Washington, D. C. It's the only university for deaf students, and its history dates back to the time of Abraham Lincoln.Oscar winner Davis Guggenheim (AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH, 2006) collaborates with deaf actor-turned-filmmaker Nyle DiMarco to bring us the story of how the commitment to cause led the students, the University, and the nation towards real change. Although the film covers just one week, it effectively uses input and recollections from five key players. In other words, we get the 'then' (via archival footage) and the 'now' (modern day interviews).Jerry was clearly the emotional leader ... the guy who fired up the crowd through his passion. His passion shows even today as his memories come flooding back. Greg was the Student Body President, and his more reserved personality likely made him a more acceptable spokesperson. Bridgetta, a former high school cheerleader, used her energy to generate the rhythm of the crowd, while Tim did not hold back in addressing Ms. Spillman, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees ... she doesn't even bother to learn American Sign Language (ASL). Her clueless and obstinate approach to defending the board's decision to bypass two qualified deaf candidates in order to name yet another hearing person as University President comes across as absurd and even a bit cruel.The structure of the film is exceptional, blending the past with the present. Surprisingly, enough archival footage exists (even 37 years later) that we get a real feel for the commitment of the students and the manner in which the protests were carried out. It's especially telling to hear the four demands made by the students: name a deaf President, resignation from the Board by Spillman, transitioning half the Board to half deaf members, and no reprisals for the students. All quite reasonable. With Spillman having stated something along the lines of 'Deaf people are not ready to function in a hearing world"", we are provided a blunt testimony to her beliefs and possibly, the general sense of society at that time.I King Jordan, a school professor, is interviewed and explains his unusual trek during the week ... one that ended with his becoming President of the University (a position he held for many years). The film provides us with clips of Greg's key appearance on ""Nightline"" with Ted Koppel, and a heartbreaking story about ""broken ears"". Two years after this event, Congress passed the Americans with Disability Act - a stunningly short number of years ago. An odd segment is included with a quick overview of Alexander Graham Bell's desire to ""fix the deaf"", but we realize it's not the deaf that need fixing. The film leaves us feeling a great deal of respect for these leaders, and might leave you chanting, ""Deaf Power!""The film will premiere globally on Apple TV+ on Friday, May 16, 2025.",False
3,8,Wonderful important moment of history that is long forgotten,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.The Deaf President Now! Movement has been forgotten and with this new documentary, it is an ambitious and well-intended story that explores the historic moment of the Deaf President Now! Movement with great insightful explorations and some of the best editing and sound designs of recent times for documentaries.Many of the participants and discussions are directly used well, blended with the archival footage, sound designs and inspiring moments that allows the viewers to be drawn into the political dynamics. Getting into the time period and getting into their shoes. You feel for those who are going through that event and observing the politic tension and moments in that time era, you feel a sense of anger, purpose, and the disfunction that the deaf community was going through and how they fought for themselves. Despite having some moments that does feel repetitive with it's length, Directors Nyle DiMarco and Davis Guggenheim have successfully discussed a subject that shouldn't be forgotten.",False
4,10,I Remember This,eurotrashgirl_2000,n/a,15/08/2025,"It was revealing to get behind the scenes of the week-long protest to change the ingrained practice of appointing people capable of hearing yet not capable of understanding or communicating with the deaf student body and teachers they were supposed to be serving. I moved to the DC Metro in February of 1988, and this reminded of all of the talk about Gallaudet University. I hadn't heard of a school for the deaf before I moved here. I recall all of the changes that occurred to make communities more accessible when the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed, largely due to this event and the relentless passion of the students. I didn't know that that Gallaudet was a major catalyst that enabled the actualization of that law. An inspirational documentary. I will be watching it again and recommending it to loved ones and friends.",False
5,10,Fascinating documentary,LSouthernlady,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is incredible !!! There were no iPhones back then, and yet they still found other ways to communicate. Even tho, I am deaf, I heard about this protest. I was not there and I was in my college in different state at the same time. This documentary showed much more activities than I thought. I was like ""Wow"". I wish I could be there at Gally to support them wholeheartedly. Good for them !!! So brave and I'm glad they stayed with the demands. They refused to give up. They made it without any violence. Congratulations to everyone involved. Very impressive !!! Truly !!! Also, I was impressed with all the videos and pictures they kept over the years. I'm sure there are more. I wish this documentary showed a bit more of those activities and interviews. I'm very satisfied with this documentary. It's the best documentary I ever watched. Maybe Part two in the future ?",False
6,10,"""I have never been so proud to be Deaf""",zachmadge,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is of the greatest documentaries I have ever seen and I believe it's going to go down as a modern classic! This is why I love documentary! It inspires you, educates you, makes you mad, makes you laugh, it makes you cry. It brings you on this intimate journey with people you wouldn't otherwise know existed in historical events (past or present) you wouldn't otherwise have heard of.This film tells a story of a deaf university that elects a hearing president and the students fight to be heard and respected in a hearing world not designed with them in mind. It is such a roller coaster of ups and downs. The audience in my theatre was so immersed and invested, with quiet cheers, boos and awws. Zinser and Spilman truly come across as heartless people in this film making you root for the students of Gallaudet even more!I hope to see this film win this years best documentary at the Oscars!",False
7,10,Always Something New To Learn About,zvxcpt,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a truly great documentary - riveting, heartbreaking, inspirational, emotional, empowering, etc. There truly are not enough adjectives to describe the powerful story that the creators of this film have created.One of the most impressive aspects of Deaf President Now! Is how much archival footage was available and how it was woven so perfectly with the present-day interviews of the five featured characters, along with some heart-wrenching film clips from the childhoods of the four students. The editing of all these elements helps create a movie that works on so many levels and delivers a powerful message about deafness that most hearing people like me need to know about.I recommend this film 100%. Thanks again to Apple TV+ for bringing yet another great documentary to its streaming service. It's one more reason why it is, by far, my favourite of all the services I subscribe to.",False
8,6,"A powerful message, but the turning point could have looked different",jonatansaari,n/a,15/08/2025,"Deaf President Now tells the story of a historic moment in the Deaf community's struggle for representation - and it does so in a powerful way. The protests depicted were real, organized and effective. The film clearly shows why so many Deaf students were frustrated and how they had tried, for many years, to make change through traditional methods - letters, meetings and respectful dialogue. It's easy to understand that their patience had run out.However, I felt that parts of the film showed reactions that seemed overly angry. Visually, it borders on chaotic at times. While the anger is real and justified, I missed the quiet dignity that also exists deeply in Deaf culture. There are other ways to show strength - such as continuing to work, lead and build without shouting. I was reminded of the moment the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time in 1991 - a transition that happened without violence, with symbolism and gravity.It's important to remember that the DPN protests came after many failed attempts to create change through respectful means. I respect that decision, but personally, I believe a more dignified strategy might have made an even deeper impact. The film is worth watching, but it also raises questions about how change happens - and which expressions build lasting respect.",False
9,10,Deaf President Now!,edvardaxm,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNow I saw a new movie about a deaf president now. I'm glad that a movie about the deaf came out a week ago. We're watching a deaf president. Now I saw 1 hour and 40 minutes, I want it longer, but it ends very beautifully and very beautifully and powerfully deaf about the deaf. I'm proud that the deaf have a university in the world. The deaf can't do without sign language, the first deaf president is I. King Jordan, why when I heard that the deaf can't, but the deaf really can, I say you need to hearing people to watch the movie, I started crying. Wow, I love it. 10/10 CAN THE DEAF CAN EVERYTHING.",True
10,10,"""Its not a protest, its a Revolution!""",SrishtiJ-41,n/a,15/08/2025,"A must-watch for everyone in the hearing and non-hearing world. It reminds us again that there is no such thing as a disability unless we treat it like one. In a world designed for birds, walking will be a disability if everything else is strictly expected to fly!! A moving documentary that has succeeded in putting together cinematography, meaning, direction, and emotions perfectly. As they rightly said, what's the point of education if they think the deaf are not capable of leading and running their university? More power to the real-life heroes! Hoping we hear and see more such real-life stories till it's an equal world for everyone.Thanks to Apple TV for churning out great content, once again.",False
11,9,"An outstanding documentary about triumph, unity, and the power of being heard, even without speaking",kevin_robbins,n/a,15/08/2025,"My wife and I recently watched Deaf President Now (2025) on Apple TV. The documentary tells the powerful story of Gallaudet University-the only deaf college in the world-located in northeast Washington, DC (just down the street from our house). In 1988, the school was at a crossroads when it announced a new president. Despite having two qualified deaf candidates, the board chose a hearing individual who couldn't sign and had no real understanding of deaf culture. Founded 124 years earlier by Abraham Lincoln, Gallaudet had never had a deaf president-and the students decided it was time for that to change. What followed was a peaceful yet powerful protest that shut down the campus and gained national attention.The film is co-created by Nyle DiMarco and Davis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth), and it's a beautifully crafted, deeply moving documentary. It felt especially personal and unique to me, given how close the college is to home. The DC backdrop is subtle, but for local residents, it resonates.The heart of the story lies in its student leaders-how each one brought their unique skills and perspectives to organize and unify their community. As the film dives into their individual backgrounds, you get a real sense of their family histories, struggles, and determination to break barriers that others like them never had the chance to. You could feel the years of dismissal, marginalization, and silence finally boiling over. When a president with no connection to the deaf community was appointed, it was the final spark-and they weren't going to stand for it.One moment in particular brought tears to my eyes: a televised interview where one of the students, initially overwhelmed and outnumbered, found the courage to speak out and reclaim his voice. It was a clear turning point, and you could feel the shift in confidence and power.Another standout was the story of a cheerleader who used her organizational skills and energy to unify the protestors and give them one cohesive voice. The creativity and ingenuity on display-from strategy to execution-was as impressive as the outcome.In conclusion, Deaf President Now is an outstanding documentary about triumph, unity, and the power of being heard, even without speaking. I would score it a 9/10 and strongly recommend it.",False

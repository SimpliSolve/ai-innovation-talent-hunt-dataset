1,n/a,lack of courage,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie would really be a perfect one if director show everything without censored. Most of the scenes were dark in which almost nothing could be seen. I was trying to understand what happened in those dark scenes bu it was impossible.The topic of the movie about a woman who runs pet shop in the daytime and swinging at night. There is nothing wrong with the first part. I can not say the same thing for the swinging scenes.This movie would be more watchable If nudity and sex scenes were realistic and explicit,Dark scenes and censorship were kllled the movie. I hope director of the movie.take seriously this case and do not make same mistakes next time:",False
2,5,Swingers and real life,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPet shop owners by day and swingers by night, Italian couple Hermes and Betta are still regular people. Director and cinematographer Mauro Russo Rouge was invited into their lives with no moment off-limits, which gives this documentary an honest, sex-positive look at the swinger lifestyle without the normal judgment or exploitation that you would expect.Rouge said of the filming, ""I hope that the audience watches the film with objectivity and without prejudice towards this couple who, despite being unscrupulous and transgressive, also have amazing heart and honesty. Hermes and Betta live an uninhibited but serene sexuality. ""We are just like you."" Betta has been repeating this phrase to me for over a year. I can now confirm it is absolutely true!""The thing I learned about this movie is that setting up all of these encounters with other couples is a lot of work, all to keep emotions out of the way and the right people coming together. Often the single people are simply sex toys for couples to use and move on; yet through all of this, Hermes and Betta share all things, even working together at their pet shop. It's a level of sharing that many relationships would feel strained by; they seem to have a supportive and loving marriage and this film shines a welcome light on other lifestyles without any need for moralizing.",True
3,10,"Wonderful, intimate portrait",ben-1117,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film offers an honest and brave glimpse into a specific couple's swinger experiences. With full and absolutely respectful access to the couple's sexuality, the film's gaze is largely subjective, its cinematography and music outstanding. Yet it also tells the couple's story with delicacy, presenting their most intimate and sincere thoughts and emotions about the swinger world they inhabit. This is a wonderful film.",False
4,9,Swing low ... I mean high,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are offended by anything sexual, this documentary is not for you. While I don't think there is anything too vivid or explicit in the movie (I did not take a microscope to check of course), there is a lot of nudity and the moaning alone might be enough to get some going I reckon.Remember this is depicting swinger lifestyle and it also lets those who do it (no pun intended) talk and tell us what they think and how they feel. I don't know if I could do something like that - if I could be so ""free"", but I do know that there are a lot of people who have issues with that kind of freedom. They even judge people like the ones we see here. I am all for live and let ... well live or have fun. If you don't agree with their moral compass - ok. Don't judge or shame them though - they are more than ok with it. They are having fun, they don't hurt anyone (well unless I guess it that type of roleplay), but that is all done with acceptance and consent.An intriguing look - that does not shy away when it gets intimate, but never gets in the way either.",False

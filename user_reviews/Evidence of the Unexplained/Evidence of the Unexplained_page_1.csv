1,7,"Thought-provoking documentary series on unexplained mysteries, extendable for some balance",animetedscience,n/a,15/08/2025,"The documentary series explores mysteries and phenomena that defy explanation. I found the show to be entertaining and thought-provoking, even if I still see the stories exaggerated in certain aspects.On the positive side, the series features fascinating stories and interviews with eyewitnesses and experts, providing a wealth of information and perspectives on the unexplained. The show does an excellent job of presenting different theories and hypotheses without necessarily endorsing one over the other, leaving it up to the viewer to draw their own conclusions.However, I found that the series tended to sensationalize the subject matter at times, relying on dramatic reenactments and ominous music to create a sense of mystery and intrigue. Additionally, while the show does provide a range of perspectives, I felt that it could have done more to critically evaluate the evidence presented and provide a more balanced approach to the subject matter.While the series is certainly entertaining and provides plenty of food for thought, it could benefit from a more critical and objective approach to the subject matter.",False
2,10,Scientific Approach to Phenomena,peterstiftx,n/a,15/08/2025,"A good mixture in it to take up conspiracy theories and then to cancel these out in a certain way, and/or to examine the actually existing scientific evidences. Often there is simply too little evidence, even if it is exciting to rack one's brains over what these observed phenomena are and what it would theoretically mean/what technology extraterrestrial life would have to master for them to be real.Overall, the series captures a target audience to get excited about the topic and does so with big fat headlines and then uses this opportunity to seriously investigate these phenomena with evidence-based methods. In doing so, the series also does a good job of trying to balance the stories of the observers/advocates with the scientific treatments.",False
3,8,very interesting show,maxx-81699,n/a,15/08/2025,"Show goes into encounters of UFO's the show has some good evidence, and has a lot of encounters I've not seen before with some of the best photos and videos I've seen of UFO's, its not like the same old roswell ufo which frankly has been done to death and sick off, once I started watching it kept me there watching every episode. If you want to see ufo's this is your show, if your skeptical you should watch some of the evidence is compelling. It goes Into ufo's sighting from all over the world I don't want to give you any spoilers if you watch you will come to challenge everything you thought about UFO's and some encounters are not friendly and people who have all their organs removed and drained of all 4here blood.",False
4,2,Terrible,Cinephile_eye,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who studied within the field of Ufology (no, I do not claim to know it all, in fact the beauty/frustration of the subject is that there are no answers to what is a very real phenomena), I have seen hundreds of documentaries on the subject, some much better than others, and most of them are much better than this.Sensationalist claims, vaguely trying to connect historical elements as some sort of reinforcement to footage shown, and using journalists as narrators are not the sign of a good documentary.Additionally, this documentary series has no scientific approach involved whatsoever, it is essentially a bunch of the aforementioned and historians speculating sensationally.By all means watch it if you know nothing about the subject, you might find it interesting enough to delve deeper, which goes way beyond what is badly presented here.Don't watch it if you already have some knowledge of the subject, as there's nothing new presented here, and you may find the non-scientific approach and ludicrous speculation annoying.Final point; not all the 'genuine' footage being presented in this documentary is unidentifiable, even though it is being presented as such.",True
5,2,and are they a threat?,talis-briedis-79-541083,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Authorities all over the world say UFOs are real, but what are they, and are they a threat?""
Are they a threat? Why make such a suggestion? Oh, because they have made so many attacks, abductions, chemtrails, etc.etc....
When a show describes itself in such a negative manner, I am left in despair because it is such speculative feces that has made people in the world so ridiculously ignorant and stupid. Sure, many are gullible, but whir throw gasoline on the fire. We already have too many orange faced hate mongers fanning the flames of fear and hatred. UFO's may be real. If they are intelligent (which they MUST be to build such crafts), do you really think they are here to stir the pot of our petty little problems?I can not see this show being of any educational value. It will probably just feed into the fear of the stupid.",False

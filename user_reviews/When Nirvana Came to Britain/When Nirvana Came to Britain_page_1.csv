1,10,Brilliant,mikeiskorn,n/a,17/08/2025,This is an absolutely brilliant documentary with lots of great behind-the-scenes footage that really makes you feel nostalgic for the time that Nirvana were around.,False
2,6,You don't need to love Nirvana to like this Doc.,humbie-45286,n/a,17/08/2025,The documentary shows the real life of being in a band. Starting being in a band is not a glamorous life but you just love your music and want to give it to others.Nirvana became one of the greatest bands in the nineties.This documentary gives a more truthful life of being in a band.Others just cover gloss of a bands music.This documentary doesn't.This covers Nirvana first reaching UK virtually unknown.It barely touches their famous life as this had already been covered in previous docs.This gives factual details no other doc has put together.It might be a slightly dry documentary but it is entertaining.You are given recollections and honest information. The contributions are given by the known and unknown.You are given a good documentary well informed on Nirvana but it is best that it tells you more what it is about being in a band and this documentary shows how some become famous.,False
3,4,Clichéd and reverential,pauldbevan,n/a,17/08/2025,"It would be difficult to make an uninteresting documentary on this subject, but this really could have been much better than it is. Part of the problem is that a lot of the contributors seem to have been 'directed' in what to say and how to say it - or if they haven't, then they've all seen too many rockumentaries and seem keen to play (or overplay) their part. This all gives it a rather clichéd and reverential feel, which, given the oft-stated observations about Nirvana being rebellious and iconoclastic seems ironic and ultimately counter-productive. If the film makers wanted to give a sense of the fresh air and iconoclasm that the band allegedly brought, then using stale tropes and clichéd techniques wasn't the way to do it.",False

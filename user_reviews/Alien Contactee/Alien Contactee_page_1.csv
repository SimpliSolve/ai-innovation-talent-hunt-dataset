1,1,Rubbish -  Reviews,dkqdvx,n/a,17/08/2025,"We started watching this because of the high reviews on IMDB. Unfortunately, many of the reviews seem to be bad. If you click on each account, you'll see that they have only left one review for this documentary.The documentary follows ""Dr Turi"" telling a really detailed, boring, long account of his encounters with aliens. The cheesy background stock music doesn't help with his storytelling. It's almost like he's trying to promote himself and sell some sort of life coaching course.The documentary lakes substance, has very low production value and was inaccurate. For example, at the beginning of the documentary, ""Dr Turi"" mentions ""The Grand Hotel"" in Eastbourne. This hotel is in fact in Brighton (as shown in the footage). The lack of research here made us question the authenticity of the documentary.Utter rubbish, don't waste your time.",False
2,1,How can someone believe this guy?,MdS_75,n/a,17/08/2025,"This guy has the same level of credibility of a...wait, I don't even know how to scale it.
But he hits the bottom.
So bad, so full of BS.
Leave this ""documentary"" alone, waiting for it to disapear.",False
3,1,90 Minutes with a Lunatic,jake_fantom,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you enjoy spending weekends visiting relatives in the local mental hospital, this marvel of cinematic inanity is your new favorite movie. You get to spend virtually the entire length of the film in the presence of one Dr. Louis Turi, who bills himself, variously, as a 5th Kind UFO Contactee, Clinical Hypnotherapist, Motivational Speaker, Cosmic Consciousness Teacher, Author, Speaker, Astropsychologist, and Celebrity Astrologer, as he spews a psychotic load of babble about his many contacts with aliens from every corner of the galaxy, with plentiful asides about spiritual and metaphysical matters. The entire 90-minute interview is shot in closeup, so after a few minutes you begin to feel like you can smell Dr. Turi's rancid breath.It turns out, as another reviewer here as already noted, that Dr. Turi's only legitimate credential is a bonafide certificate in welding. Frankly, after watching the first few minutes of this flaming train wreck, it occurred to me that Dr. Turi himself is about as alien as any creature I hope to ever encounter. Maybe that's why so many aliens are intent on contacting him. At any rate, if you are determined to suffer through this idiocy, I suggest starting with a bottle of Jack Daniels, and watching in increments of no more than five or ten minutes at a time. (NOTE: I was going to give this 3 stars for its vague entertainment value, but the high proportion of bogus 10-star reviews convinced me otherwise.)",True
4,6,"Non-believer, still found it fascinating",sallproductionspdx,n/a,17/08/2025,"As a pronounced skeptic I still found this a fascinating portrait of a character one does not often get to spend this much time with. Portraits like this are an interesting window into thought processes beyond the stated ""norm."" Worth experiencing no matter where you fall on the alien question.",False
5,1,Amazing How Gullible People Are,sakulin,n/a,17/08/2025,"What nonsense. Sorta like listening to a TV preacher interpreting the Book of Revelations. This Turi character is a total phony, an astrology nut and a (marginal) motivational speaker. He calls himself a doctor but his only legitimate piece of paper is a certificate in welding. WELDING! He claims a doctorate in metaphysics which he bought from a diploma mill in Sacramento.He has had alien encounters? Consider that the only people who claim such encounters are yokels who always relate that the aliens primary interest is in their private parts. It's similar to medieval claims of seeing the Virgin Mary with the claims always made by ignorant young country girls. Do we ever hear of aliens making contacts with professors at universities? .Turi claims his first encounter is with some ""big"" aliens in a bar late at night. Any society capable of space travel would be, intellectually, far superior to those of us on Earth. Why would they be in a bar late at night waiting for teenage Turi and asking him if he wanted to play cards?Reading other reviews on here it appears that this guy has a cult following. How naive can you all be? In my local newspaper the astrology forecasts are appropriately on the same page as the comics.",False
6,1,Laughable at best.,jmatthewphipps,n/a,17/08/2025,"""Doctor"" Turi has been a longtime fixture of late night radio for the past 30 years. His ""Doctorate"" is from the ULC (online) and his predictions have always been made in the most vague terms with his self provided interpretations of his own words made after the event. As a film, there is no depth here. The content is like looking at the image of a lake painted a theatrical backdrop, there is no life or reality in it.",False
7,8,"worth a watch, even for the skeptic",williamgway,n/a,17/08/2025,"I am a bit of a skeptic on ET encounters but enjoyed the tales of Dr. Turi. If nothing else, he is a great storyteller. The doc is nicely laid out and filmed. It will cause you to think about what is around (or inside) of you! Worth a watch!",False
8,1,Ruined my impressions from other alien documentaries,petrvirt,n/a,17/08/2025,This guy is just full of sh_t and he ruind me my impression from other documentaries where he was interviewed.,False
9,1,Terrible,cosmophagist,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIt really is that bad. When watching a documentary about alien contact, there is a certain level of open-mindedness and suspension of disbelief needed. However, this starts out with some fairly benign, yet mundane, stories from Turi's younger days with alien contact and lost time, and then starts to devolve into a spiral of nonsense.Spoiler tag because there's just nothing of substance here, and the rest of the film plays out as follows: By about the halfway mark, he's talking about curing his cancer holistically with ""various roots he'd never heard of"" (and never bothers to elaborate), a recipe he got from aliens. And by about two-thirds of the way through, he's fancying himself a modern day Nostradamus, talking about making predictions that come true, and giving a spiel about astrology-good and religion-bad.Basically, by the time you realize this is a promotion for Turi's site, it's too late, and you're pretty deep into the film. Avoid if you're actually looking for an alien abduction, contact, or UFO documentary.",True
10,1,I am truly shocked at the high scores from people...,Sean_Biggins,n/a,17/08/2025,This guy has no 'proof' of anything. The cases I want to hear about are the ones where an entire B-29 crew all see a ufo or a group of cops or airline pilots. But he has high scores so just shows how gullible people can be.,False
11,1,Diagnosis pending,LexieSnobunny,n/a,17/08/2025,"Watching your crazy uncle ranting is entertaining for the first ten minutes. His episodes of psychosis throughout his life has inspired him into believing and/or understanding lots of things. Bipolar mania, perhaps..? Or something more complex? Curious to know if he has experimented with any mind-altering drugs that may have enhanced or even triggered some of the extraordinary episodes his mind has facilitated. I'm glad he is doing well and has made a career of his beliefs.I was surprised that he tied in God to it all in the end, especially after the bits on ""astrology led to astronomy"" parts. It's like when a pizza place also claims to make good kebabs and fried chicken...why would we trust that you've somehow figured out all of this? At least focus on your already far-fetched alleged field of expertise.",False
12,10,Applaud,jerrilynncoteharper,n/a,17/08/2025,"Incredibly important to hear and see a first person account of this extraordinary life story that is ongoing.
Thank you Doctor Louis Turi, the director and team bringing this together.
Health, well-being, and blessing to all of your families.",False
13,10,Great documentary on the human experience and E.T.'s,mvoisin-07616,n/a,17/08/2025,I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone searching for a real experience that impacts many aspects of life as a whole. I definitely got a lot from it and know that everyone will be able to take something from it to learn from going forward.,False
14,9,You think you know Dr. Turi?,usafveteranjd,n/a,17/08/2025,"I had wondered about Louis Turi. I was originally skeptical but still curious about him. His forecasts are surprisingly accurate - well not so surprising once you begin to understand how things work.Alien Contactee is like that friend that opens up about their past and trusts you with their story. When you make a new friend you get to know them based upon the now. As the friendship grows you begin to wonder about their past. If you're fortunate enough to be a good friend you'll begin to learn more about your friend as their past becomes familiar to you. Over time, Louis Turi has become to feel like a friend to me and this documentary has helped me have a deeper understanding of him. It's taken me from being critically skeptical to remaining curious & from wondering to exploring wonder.For anyone that's feeling like there's still a lot left to learn about their self, the world, and the cosmos but feeling like they shouldn't really explore beyond their comfort zone then this documentary may be for you. There is a whole realm to explore and Dr. Turi can be that friend that helps encourage you to explore it. For those not already familiar with Louis this documentary is a good introduction. For those of us that already know him this only deepens your understanding of him.",False
15,10,Amazing movie to watch,georgiagiannini,n/a,17/08/2025,"I can't even begin to say what a detailed yet flowing movie about alien visits and how one deals with it. I for a fact was hanging on every word of what Dr Turi was talking about with each visit thus far throughout his lifetime. It made me realize how would I react to what was unfolding before my eyes. Fear at first because its not everyday you encounter an ET, two - what do you say or think in the presence of one. Three you hope its the benevolent type so you can create a relationship with. Just many thought processes to think of.Because Dr Turi has stated that they have been visiting forever, he has been on-point with ETs before the admittance from the powers that be of their existence. You are for REAL. Just now has this awareness been divulged through media. Hats off to you Dr Turi. Thank you for this candid conveyance of outstanding information.",False
16,10,"Take the blue or red pill, the choice is yours...",sageseno,n/a,17/08/2025,Doctor Louis Turi shares his incredible UFO experiences in which he encountered extraterrestrial beings on four different occasions throughout his life. Through these experiences he has obtained the knowledge and wisdom of the divine and how we relate to the cosmic force which we call God. Keep an open mind and marvel at the experiences Doctor Turi shares which will leave you wanting more.,False
17,10,A must see!!,maestroes,n/a,17/08/2025,"Wow Dr turi is an amazing human being. I have been searching for the truth of what it means to be human, and none can compare to what he teaches. His life journey is extraordinary. Was good film about cosmic consciousness and the age of Aquarius. He is the real deal, trust me.",False
18,10,Amazing,mattspence-23814,n/a,17/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this movie and ""I want to believe"", Dr Turi is a incredible speaker and a passionate human being that I have learned a lot from watching his youtube videos. Its crazy the types of UFO encounters that he's had. This is a must see movie for anyone wanting to learn about crazy experiences, Well done!!",False
19,10,Just Watch It!,janmarieann,n/a,17/08/2025,"It was really fascinating to hear firsthand of the extraordinary encounters Dr. Turi experienced throughout his life. Where you go and what you do after watching this movie is up to you. To me, what he is offering to mankind as a result of these encounters, is the real gem of a gift I am so very grateful for. Check him out and see for yourself. He's the real deal. Dr. Turi has rediscovered the Cosmic Code and is willing to share it with us.
Thank you, Dr. Turi! We are truly blessed!",False
20,10,Educational,aujinxd,n/a,17/08/2025,"Thank you for this wonderful video, a must see. Important to be informed .. makes you think.",False
21,10,Fantastic,lucnn,n/a,17/08/2025,I would also recommend to get Dr. Turi books which go into details of his life and his power full predictions.,False
22,10,Alien Contactee,gjcvikel,n/a,17/08/2025,I find Dr. Turi to be a honest and truthful man. I enjoyed this movie very much. Everyone that is seeking the truth should watch it.,False
23,8,A world that I was very unfamiliar with,Carlinientertainment,n/a,17/08/2025,"The film takes on a look from a in depth interview. I'm not too familiar with this topic and if its something that you follow, the filmmaker covers a lot!",False
24,9,"Fascinating, insightful and inspiring",JCanni68,n/a,17/08/2025,"Dr. Turi's testimony and wisdom on alien contact provides a great overview on the subject and also adds a philosophical interpretation that will challenge conventional biases. His personal stories are exceptional and fascinating, told with great passion and personality, and give something for the skeptics to think about. But the real takeaway here is how he compels us to see our place in the universe. Aliens not only affect human history on a grand scale, but affect us on an individual level. Our rational mindset is preventing us from being in tune with the cosmos, and extraterrestrial contact reminds us that we are connected to something greater, and we are called to aim for the light.",False
25,8,An engaging personality,lindapalmer,n/a,17/08/2025,"I found this very interesting. It reminds me of astrology...some people really get something out of it if they are perceptive and those who aren't, don't. Dr Touri is an engaging personality for sure.",False

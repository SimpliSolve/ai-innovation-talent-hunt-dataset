1,8,Great nature - but where was Costner's mind?,haakern,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great shots of Yellowstone's amazing nature and wildlife.Especially enjoyed the winter season coming from an artic country myself.But like others have mentioned, what was going on with Costner's narration?I was under the impression that this show came about because of his interest in the park, but this definitely doesn't come across in his comments during the episodes. It is flat, uninspired and most of all sounds like a 6th grader reading his oligatory summer report in front of the class. No intonation, no excitement, no involvement in the action. Only when he's at the cabin table with his cup of coffee is there any semblance of interest in the history of the park. But still, the show is worth watching, as long as you have more of an interest in Yellowstone than Kevin apparently has.",False
2,8,"Great documentary, just three wishes.",FrankMize,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really an excellant documentary, and very well written. I would have appreciated more Geology, but that is just being selfish as I am a geologist. But they totally passed over the significance of what would happen if the volcano errupted (very significant). The consequences for the United States would be devastating. My other comment I never would have expected, but Kevin Costner's narration was flat, monotone, and lacked any feeling. He would have been much better off had he hired someone else. Lastly, the way the script is worded is not quite correct in terms of the earthquake. The geologic shift caused the quake. The quake did not cause the shift. And obsidian is volcanic glass .",False
3,6,"Visually excellent, but ...",jkernkamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Too bad Kevin decided to do the narration. Flat and wooden, it does not live up to the rest of presentation, and ends up being so distracting that interest in the show diminishes to the point where most of it is lost. And his political undertones are also not welcome. I guess that, like lots of other public figures, he thinks his opinions are important enough to inject them into a presentation that should not have them. Again, too bad. I ended up watching with the sound muted, because I have been to Yellowstone, and recognized most of the iconic images. As the headline says, it is visually excellent, but they really should have gotten someone of the quality of Richard Attenborough.",False
4,6,I was expecting more from Kevin if I'm honest.,naturell,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have just started watching this show today.And I'm well into the first season and hooked.Beautiful place.The History there, seems magnetic to the fact, I want to visit there. And I'm from the UK.This documentary is good, however, it lacks proper information. It's skimming over things for It's own narrative.The mention of history is minimal and even when it's mentioned, there is not a lot about the true history of how it was taken by Americans.Only the people who ""claimed"" the land is ever really mentioned as if they were heros, which isn't right at all.Especially, since the show tries to portray the native people's feelings about the land taken.And Kevin, was just a little bit too mono tone, I kept drifting off and not paying attention.A little bit of affliction in describing, and explaining certain situations, would engage people more in my opinion.But! Still a place I would be honored to visit.",False
5,4,Broken record with beautiful views,ElluJohanna,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wanted to love this document.Amazing scenery and equally handsome Kevin Costner, but... Like other reviews said; he is not as present as you'd think and he keeps telling the same stories about this Hayden guy in every episode. I bet there would have been even more history been told about the history of the park or about the people who take care of it these daysAlso you don't feel the narrator's enthusiasm towards the national park that made him resurface to fame. Or does he even have it? Was this document series made just for the money? All in all it is a story well told concidering the animals living there and about how the lands have formed over time.Don't regret watching! Just expected more.",False

1,8,The Scam: Risks/ Rewards,investmentsew,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Highest of Stakes is a new look at the world of crypto & the fast pace of its growth and hard to believe claims of wealth & independence. Richard Heart & his creation HEX, which he portrays as the better Bitcoin, is the focus of this documentary. Brought to life by the Emmy Award winning team of Patrick Moreau & Grant Peelle.The stories of investors & unique personalities are woven in with the investigation of HEX & it's founder by professors from DePaul University.It would be easy to say that Richard Heart is the leader of a cult, and that his ""Hexicans"" hang on his every word. However, the origins of leading characters in this documentary show that they became believers after first being involved with Bitcoin & other investments, and had deliberately approached HEX based on their past experiences.Pacing at times felt uncomfortable, especially when the implications of betting ""the house"" vs small incremental investing was unfolding. The prospect of getting this right excited me, and I only wished more of the actualization of success was explored.The investigation & face to face with Richard Heart revealed a flamboyantly confident man who appeared at times as the world's best salesman, as well as the world's most driven person who wants to change the world. Challenges from Heart to consider traditional financial investments in contrast to Crypto caused me to question which is the real scam?The question is left up to the viewer to determine, but with an obvious hook to expect & want a sequel to explore more.Very enjoyable documentary, a solid 8/10 that some edits could improve.",True
2,8,HEX is not a cult,DavidIPH,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell produced documentary with a compelling story.As a holder of HEX and other Richard Heart cryptocurrencies, however, I didn't like how Heart was portrayed in this docu as being regarded as a 'God' figure by those who hold the cryptocurrencies that he has invented, and that HEX is some kind of 'cult'. I respect him and am grateful for HEX and Pulsechain but absolutely DO NOT worship him as a 'God', and do not care for the cringe-worthy and obnoxious flaunting of material wealth marketing gimmick that he persisted with to try and garner attention to his products. This was all an act which he mercifully has since decided to ditch in favor of being ""more humble"". The economics professor in the documentary mentions that some of the professionals that he has talked to have looked at HEX and regard it to be a legit product, but that they simply 'dont like the optics' of Heart behaving like a clown. Neither do I.I also DO NOT feel that HEX is merely a cryptocurrency token belonging to some wacky cult. A community has built up around Heart's products and folk are entitled to be enthusiastic and passionate about them. Calling HEX a cult (as multiple folk do in this docu) is a major stretch of the imagination. To my mind, and in the minds of many others who hold these products it is all about the design of HEX, the quality of the code, and how HEX is simply a superior cryptocurrency to Bitcoin, and Pulsechain is a more cost efficient and faster blockchain to run HEX on compared to the Ethereum blockchain. I, like many others, believe that there is genuinely still huge potential for outsized profits to be made relative to the those of Bitcoin or Ethereum as both HEX and Pulsechain are still so young. Where else am I gonna better protect myself against the effects of inflation? FIAT cash? A bank savings account? Bonds? Precious Metals? The stock market? None of these will outperform HEX, PLS or PLSX over the next few years in my opinion.One final thing regarding the subject of 'value', which was brought up by the economics prof in the documentary. There are different ways to measure value but to my mind the most important is the 'perceived value', and at the current HEX, PLSX and PLS prices I personally perceive them all to be significantly undervalued.Looking forward to a sequel documentary a few years from now.",True
3,10,Wild ride!!,elburrosabe,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary does a great job of showing the roller-coaster of ups and downs in crypto! Very entertaining while exposing the truth of the good and the bad!Seeing the euphoria of believers when things are up, and almost unreal success followed by the reality of the downside that follows was intense. There was something for everyone, believers and skeptics alike.They did a great job of telling the whole story of just how wild crypto can be, but also how powerful it can be. It seems like cryptocurrency is something worth taking the time to research and get right. There are definitely some colorful characters out there. Lol.",False
4,10,The Best Crypto Movie Ever Made !,brodawielki,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic movie! Really well made! Showed two different sides of crypto! Great movie for people who might not know much about crypto but want to get into it! Highly recommend as I was entertained from beginning to end! This documentary about the Founder of HEX (crypto) & PulseChain (blockchain), Richard Heart, had a bit of everything. The cinematography was wonderful, the music was great, and the film looked at Richard/HEX from all sides. The skeptics asked great questions, most of which were addressed in the film, leaving the viewer with enough information to make his/her decision about the cryptocurrencies. Richard himself is the perfect ""character"" for such a film, as his fortune, personality and intelligence are on full display for the audience.",False
5,n/a,Scammers will scam,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fact that Hex followers have often been described as a cult and that almost every review of this film has rated it a ten, should tell you everything you need to know about the reviewers. There is currently only one review out of over fifty that rates this film as less than a ten and that's at an eight. There are very few films that really deserve a ten rating. Any film that has anything to say will have some people who love it and some who hate it. So it's pretty obvious the ratings are being manipulated and that it's really just a ninety minute infomercial for Hex.The film consists mostly of talking heads hype people for Hex who call themselves Hexicans including the scam leader himself Richard Heart bragging about not only Hex, but his big dick, cars, high IQ, ability to predict the future, and world's largest diamond. You'll see other reviews claim the film is balanced because they interview one couple who lost money in comparison to all the others, some of whom are hyping Hex and PulseChain even though they lost money as well. That's not what any normal person would consider balanced.In addition, there's several scenes about midway through that look completely staged. One where Heart is supposedly at a meetup in Denmark at which people in the audience asking questions and they cut back and forth to Heart in front of a red curtain answering questions. The lighting and sound give the impression these weren't even filmed at the same time in the same room, as if the questions were filmed and then Heart was filmed later after he thought up cute funny answers. Cue the canned laughter. Then there's another scene with Heart at what appears to be an estate surrounded by blonde debutante investors drinking wine and dancing with hula girls while making his pitch. No explanation of who these rich blond potential investors are is ever made.Without any spoilers to how the film itself ends, it's pretty easy to look up on the internet how Hex and PulseChain are doing now. Hex reached its height in Sept 2021 at .478 and is currently, at time of this review, at .0005 and Pulsechain has been at zero since May. Richard Heart is currently being sued by the SEC.I truly hope no one reading the reviews here or watching the film gets taken in by the hype.",False
6,10,Presents both sides of the coin,yatest-33844,n/a,16/08/2025,"To those who say this is a propaganda piece, they're proven wrong by the documentary following skeptical voices and showing someone who invested around $100,000 and it went down to around $30,000 by the end and his wife was furious and believes they will lose all their money. Richard Heart is entertaining to watch and he presents really good points. One being that you should look at the number of people who are invested now and compare that to how many will likely be invested in the future. Cryptocurrency is a speculation game and this documentary captures both the highs and the lows of that. Hight risk, high reward. If you believe that this is just pro-HEX than you weren't paying attention. A hype bubble that inflates and pops over and over again doesn't make something a scam. It just means you need to exercise caution.",False

Heart believes that HEX is the future of money, and he argues that it has the potential to make financial transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure.* The film is ultimately a cautionary tale.

I personally find this to be very educational as well with Pulsechain being a big help to Ethereum like a second layer but much independent and much better, it's pretty astonishing how all this blockchain tech works..",False

16,10,Must watch,jamos_nz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Polarising documentary about the influencer and HEX founder Richard Heart. Absolutely captivating from start to finish. I wish I knew about Richard Heart earlier now. I didn't like the character he played online but after seeing this I realised why he did it. Richard explains hidden crypto wisdom, and tells the real truth about the crypto world while living a lavish lifestyle. The cars, the watches, the women, the twerking, if you saw snippets or sound bytes without context, I could see why you would have a negative view about Richard Heart, but make sure you check out the real story here.

17,10,A Movie I Didn't Want To Like,GenslerGary,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was not really a big fan of crypto to begin with, and I'm certainly not a fan of people investing in crypto. I think people should stick with traditional finance despite it's control and corruption. You could even say my job depends on it.After watching the film, I must admit the directors did a good job covering both sides. This Richard fellow is quite unlikable though... he wears ugly clothing and does ridiculous stuff. But mainly because his ideas and creations emulate traditional banking in ways I don't like... remember, governments and banks ARE your friend!A lot has happened since this documentary was filmed. There should definitely be a part two. It would be incredible if I could have a part in that one. I'm also doing ridiculous things in the cryptosphere and certainly trying my best to get noticed!",False

19,10,Leaving with more questions than answers.,namsucker,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought I had a pretty good grasp on my money and finances but after watching this movie, I'm uncertain. Is it safer to keep a portfolio of traditional assets like stocks bonds and real estate? Or is the only way to safeguard everything I've worked for stored digitally where government and banks can't tax it all away from me. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the movie yet so I'll just say that this documentary will make you question your money and finances.

Having said that I believe the documentary did a great job to stay neutral and try to allow the audience to learn about who Richard is and what problems crypto currencies, tokens, and the block chain are supposed to fix. Block chain technology will play a large role in the future of money and finance. Since our lives are impacted in such a powerful way by money and finance, it is critically important for people to educate themselves about how money works and what real crypto currencies can offer to people and communities.

Modern day Robin Hood. His products are the best on the market. And they have saved me financially. I'm thrilled to see this movie come out and hope it will become available on Amazon, Netflix, or HBO.Richard Heart has been lambasted for his lavish ways. (Which were actually all done with a specific intent to grow the community) He has now returned to his humble old self. Many people called Hex and Ponzi scheme. 3 years later, he has proven them all wrong. I highly recommend this movie AND looking into these financial tools. (Not financial advice) These new tools are our ONLY way to get out from under the thumb of our corrupted government.

Is Richard Heart (main subject character) a villain? Or is he an anti-hero.? Is cryptocurrency dead? Can cryptocurrency be a valid form of money? Can you fight inflation with these type of investments? Is it all a scam? Why are large financial institutions, governments and banks buzzing about cryptocurrency. Why do hundreds of thousands of people believe in Richard Heart?Question everything during this eye opening film shot with seemingly no limit budget, with a great soundtrack and high quality shots.",False

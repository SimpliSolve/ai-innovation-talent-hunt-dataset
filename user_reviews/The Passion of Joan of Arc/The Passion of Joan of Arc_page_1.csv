1,8,The Good & Bad Of 'The Passion Of Joan Of Arc',ccthemovieman-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you'll pardon the rambling, here are my thoughts immediately after watching this on DVD an hour ago.......THE STORY - Many of the times, while watching this for the first time, I thought this was almost the re-enactment of Jesus' last day, seeing the phony trial, the trumped-up charges He endured by legalistic, power-hungry religious leaders of the day who had no clue who God is, and then the tragic end to the central character. Apparently, there were a lot of similarities to Joan of Arc's last day and of Christ's day. However, here it's the Catholic leaders who are the 'bad guys' while in Jesus' time it was the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin. Also, with Joan's story here, she is portrayed far differently in her ordeal than Christ did, the latter taking everything in stride stoically while Joan, without any physical beating, still cried constantly and signed some paper in a moment of weakness (although she later recants that, which costs the woman her life.)Anyway, about this film:THE GOOD - Wow, what incredible direction and photography. Scene after scene is pretty amazing and especially so when you consider this was made about 80 years ago! I would like to see the same director and photographer doing work with today's technology.The expressions on Maria Falconetti's face throughout the film are memorable. A sadder, more pained look on Joan of Arc - or anyone else's - I have not seen in a motion picture. She also must have set a record that still stands for the most tears shed by one person in a movie! The woman's eyes were like faucets.All of the faces in here - and the film is mostly a series of facial closeups - are amazing and kudos to Criterion for making a DVD that showed these faces with a clear picture and amazing detail. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer's camera angles still look innovative today. He and Orson Welles seem to share the same love of this kind of photography. I found myself numerous times just shaking my head in admiration for how these characters were photographed.Another big plus for this film was the addition of ""The Voices of Light."" They made the music score in here fantastic. I can't recall too many films in which I have been so impressed with a soundtrack. The DVD gives you the option of watching this film with or without that audio. I strongly recommend viewers to take the audio.Finally, the story itself is memorable, with a powerful ending.THE BAD - I have to make these comments to be fair and honest. It's not hard to understand why many people will find this film almost impossible to sit through, especially those with no emotional or spiritual involvement with the story. That is because it is extremely slow and repetitive. Shot-after-shot of just Falconetti agonizing or crying and weird-looking men staring at her. If you aren't a devotee of cinematography, this movie could be extremely boring after about 10 minutes.As powerful as the story is, it isn't a movie I would recommend for most people. I think most folks - of any age, frankly - would be turned off after 20 minutes. I understand that. As mentioned, this is not an easy film to view. This might be the longest 80-minute movie you'll ever see, if you aren't into it.OVERALL - Visually and audibly: an astounding movie and one I am glad to have finally watched. If I was wishing to get into the movie business and wanted to learn how to shoot films, this would be a film I would study numerous times. Otherwise, one viewing is plenty. I can only recommend this film to a very select audience.",False
2,9,One of the Most Formally Striking Movies I've Ever Seen,evanston_dad,n/a,15/08/2025,"Carl Dreyer's ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is a film that feels light years ahead of its time. Lean and mean, focusing its entire narrative on the interrogation of Joan that inevitably lead to her execution by burning at the stake, the film is kinetic in ways that most films even now aren't. Composed almost completely of tight close ups, Dreyer and crew cut rapidly between disconcerting, asymmetrical shots, giving the film a breathless, anxious, nearly frenzied pace.Maria Falconetti gives an almost unbelievably intense performance as the title heroine. Her performance, and the film in general, does get a bit monotonous -- it exists primarily of impassioned gazes into the middle distance, giant, tearing eyes opened wide, an expression of passionate, nearly demented religious fervor on her face. It's not a film that concerns itself with characters and plot, so we don't get to know Joan as a person. It's difficult to care for her particular plight and we instead feel compassion for her as one human being feeling compassion for another. For that reason, the film left me remembering its striking images and formal style more than any emotions I might have felt while watching it. But it's no less of a remarkable cinematic achievement for that.Grade: A",False
3,9,A brief description of the beautiful,danielgonjacob,n/a,15/08/2025,"Speechless. What about the angular planes of the camera, the backgrounds, the takes that complement the true dialogues, the painful features, the pleasant combination of fact and art, and liturgical music?
Watching this open leaves aside the simple fact of absorbing historical content, but it becomes, at the same time, an act of understanding the soul Carl T. Dreyer and especially Jeanne D'arc.",False
4,10,"an incredible directorial vision, and a devastating lead in Falconetti, make this one of the greatest achievements in all celluloid",Quinoa1984,n/a,15/08/2025,"Carl Th. Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc was made, perhaps, years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn't burned after its initial release, it would've had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as Citizen Kane did. Though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film, it felt like Dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema, one where reality, however cold and pitiful, was displayed with complete sincerity. There is also the editing (by Dreyer and Marguerite Beague), which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of Eisenstein, only in a totally different historical context), and those moves with the camera by Rudolph Mate (who would go on to photograph Foreign Correspondent and Lady from Shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.And it was crucial for Dreyer to use the close-ups and tilted angles and shots where you only see the eyes in the bottom of the frame, and so forth- he's developing the perfect atmosphere in regards to a trial set in 15th century France. It's all those eyes, all those faces, holding all those stolid mindsets that send Joan to her fate. Pretty soon a viewer feels these presences from all these people, so strong and uncompromising, and Dreyer does a miraculous thing- he makes it so that we forget about the time and place, and all of our attention is thrown onto those eyes of Joan, loaded to brim with a sorrow for where she is, but an un-questionable faith in what she feels about God. I wondered at one point whether Dreyer was making as much a point on people's faiths and prejudices in the almighty, or just one on basic humanity.There have been many before me who have praised Falconetti's performance to the heavens (Kael called it the finest performance in film), but in a way it almost can't be praised enough. What she achieves here is what Ebert must've felt watching Theron in the recent 'Monster'. I didn't even see her in a performance as Joan of Arc- I saw her as being the embodiment of it, as if Falconetti (with Dreyer's guidance) took Joan out of the pages of the trial transcript and her entire soul took over. There is something in an actor that has to be so compelling, so startling, and indeed so recognizable, that a person can feel empathy and/or sympathy for the person the actor's playing. All a viewer has to do is stare into Falconetti's eyes in any shot, close-up or not, and that viewer may get stirred to boiled-down emotion.For me, it was almost TOO over-whelming an emotional experience- when Joan is about to get tortured, for example, I found myself completely lost from where I was watching the film, everything in my soul and being was with Joan in that chamber, and for a minute I broke out in tears. That's the kind of effect that Dreyer's craft and all the acting work (including Eugene Sylvain as the Bishop Cauchon, and of course Artaud as Jean) can have on a viewer. I'm not saying it has to, yet The Passion of Joan of Arc could- and should- be considered a milestone in cinematic tragedy, where the images that come streaming forth never leave a viewer, and the detail for time and place becomes just that, a detail for the main stage. Love Joan or hate her, this is for keeps.",False
5,10,When Film Becomes Transcendental Art.,nycritic,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt so often happens that some films take the long way to achieve their status of classics and worthy of being studied, frame by frame, by movie lovers who believe in the power of raw performance and skilled direction of cameras to depict a powerful visual set of images. When one sees films like VERTIGO which barely registered with movie-going audiences at the time of their release but after restoration went on to become one of the best films of the last century, it only shows that film, as an art, doesn't need a golden statuette to have merit, and when it's done exceptionally well, it can be seen in any context and any time period beyond its release date and will still hold its audience in awe.Carl Theodore Dryer, to me, created what I believe is, alongside Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE, the most powerful black and white film in cinema history. It would be difficult indeed to say which one is better since both films are landmark in their own cinematic styles and have been dissected frame by frame. Dryer's film has been criticized for either being a pretty collection of still images or being pure visual power: I choose the latter, because in watching THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, I felt not only the extremely uncomfortable intimacy between Joan and her tormentors, but her sublime emotions as they pass through her face as she is mocked, cross-examined, humiliated, and burned at the cross. There is an unearthly beauty in Falconetti's face as she goes through the ringer of emotions not in the overacting style typical of the Twenties but in a completely modern way, as if she were living a reality so far removed from the corrupted priests who bash and condemn her, and her reality would therefore be dangerous to their own beliefs.And what a stroke of genius, I think, to have the lighting on her face be soft, gentle, in contrast to her detractors who are always lit in harsh light which exacerbates their ugliness and betrays their ""devotion"" to God as mere politics. Dryer's style of cutting from one actor to the other is also different, and makes this film a surrealist experience, an unsettling, abstract tour through transcendental suffering. There are no defining shots which tell us where exactly is the story taking place (although we don't need to know after reading the transcripts), but we never are allowed as viewers a moment of rest from this suffocating intimacy between Joan and her inquisitors. Some bizarre shots and camera angles give the ending an even more disturbing and horrifying element of what we perceive as a gross injustice to what was a person who held her own beliefs and did not need the Church to sustain it.Falconetti never did a film before this one and never returned to film acting after this. I have not read much about her, except that she lived in Argentina until her death in 1946. I sometimes wonder why she didn't act again (although she was known to be an accomplished theatre actress more known for comedies than drama) but those are the mysteries of actors who don't have the star ego and only make a few films. She came, only did this masterful performance, and left just as suddenly, and those who re-discovered this film and restored it to its full quality have to be commended for allowing us, who have come almost 80 years later, to experience the power of subtle acting.",True
6,10,When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror.,GulyJimson,n/a,15/08/2025,"What can one say about this work of art that has not been said many times before by those far better qualified to explain both it's importance and place as cinema and art? I shall not comment on the greatness of the film's technical achievements; the stunning cinematography, the production design, the brilliance of the screenplay based on actual transcripts from the trial, or the perfection of Mr. Dreyer's direction. The performance of Falconetti as Jeanne d' Arc has a profundity and depth far beyond my ability to illuminate. I suppose the best I can hope to do is to share my feelings, however inadequately expressed, of the effect it had on me. To say that it may be the greatest film ever made is to sound both obvious and trite. That a work of such beauty and simplicity, made seventy-six years ago can still have the power to move audiences in an era of multi-million dollar, hi-tech, bombastic over-wrought cinematic drivel is in itself a testament to the vision and genius of Carl Theodor Dreyer, Maria Falconetti and their collaborators. It is nourishment for those that hunger for something more in cinema, a feast for the soul. It is a reminder that film can indeed be art, and this film like all great works of art, lifts and transports us from the routine of our work-a-day lives to enable us, if only for a moment to experience the sublime. When viewing it we look at it as looking in a mirror. That is to say we look into ourselves. We question ourselves as to our own beliefs, or the lack thereof and the strength of spirit that enables an individual to endure the unendurable. Viewing it is a profound experience the nature of which for myself is transcendent rather than religious, because I am not in the least a religious person. Transcendent because it evokes emotions and thoughts that I cannot wholly account for, or adequately explain.""La Passion of Jeanne d'Arc"" is stark, radiant, exalted, simple, (but never simplistic), and ultimately sublime. The rest is silence.",False
7,10,Devastating but brilliant masterpiece,looneyfarm,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's easy to overlook this movie. For modern audience and especially my generation (I'm 21), this movie is just close-ups of a crying woman and grumpy old men. But of course that's like saying Mona Lisa is just a picture of a woman, or The Last Supper is dudes eating. If you experience it with open mind, The Passion of Joan of Arc will give you one of the most profound visions of devotion, faith and martyrdom.I must confess, even I thought the praise of The Passion was too good to be true when I began to watch it. But when the film ended, I wasn't just impressed, I was completely devastated. The Passion of Joan of Arc is a downright amazing realization of Joan's last moments. There's not a hint of sentimentality, and still I was in tears. Yep. Call me a pansy, but this is one of the very few movies that had that impact on me.I don't know what else to say about this movie, sorry. The Passion of Joan of Arc counts as the most upsetting movie experience I've ever had, but it's definitely a positive one. On the contrary to what the other commentators have said, you don't have to be religious to be receptive in front of this movie. Believe me, I'm a hardcore atheist. If you're going to see this film -- I sure hope you do -- make sure it's accompanied with the Voices of Light soundtrack, which doesn't just fit the film well, but is amazing as a standalone composition, too. I can guarantee you won't look cinema the same way again.",False
8,10,Falconetti is amazing!,edantes2000,n/a,15/08/2025,"A certain amount of credit must surely be paid to the director for the genius of 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc.' The daring camera angles, use of incessant close-ups and peculiar authenticity all may be attributed to Carl Th. Dryer. However, Renee Maria Falconetti is the reason this film indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching the Platonic form of brilliance. Her performance is breathtaking by all accounts. One can not help but remain mesmerized by her expressions. Yes Dryer's gift to us of so many wonderful close shots of Falconetti should be acknowledged. He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenes to produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in this timeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have been considered) is to envision a less than perfect film. Unimpeded by the silent medium in which she worked, Falconetti's mere tilt of the head or gentle glance pierce the soul of the viewer. We see her speak in Jeanne's native tongue. We see her compelling portrayal of the anguish which the saint most certainly endured. It is almost as if we are watching what the director said he had found; the martyr's reincarnation! This actress presents to us her raw beauty unmarred by powders or makeup - thanks to a decision of Dryer. How bitter-sweet the fact that we have this once thought to be lost silent film and yet can not help now but to long for more Falconetti. And so we return to 'La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc' and with each of many tears and inaudible sighs marvel at the staggering accomplishment which is Renee Maria Falconetti's Jeanne.",False
9,10,timeless in every sense,judokid,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw this a few months ago on the big screen, just after Nosferatu, another silent classic. Both showings were supported by a live organ play, which has been composed directly for the movie, and which suited perfectly. I had seen Nosferatu before, but i didn´t know anything about `Jeanne`, and so i was in no way prepared for this overwhelming, soul-rapturing experience.My eyes were immediately glued to the screen. Unfortunately i had missed the first minutes, so it started for me with the first (?) court scene. The camera wandered through the faces of the court members, circled and focussed on Jeanne´s face. So beautiful, naked, strong and defenseless! I could rave on the technical perfection of this film, it´s clever editing, innovative and gorgeous cinematography, proper historical settings and pure storytelling. Carl Theodor Dreyer created a masterpiece. But the most outstanding feature of this silent are the performances; Maria Falconetti delivers simply the best performance of all times, and i can´t remember of any ´corny` overacting, which distracts most silent movies from the modern viewer, even the accepted classics. `La passion de Jeanne d´Arc´ is purest cinematic art, timeless in every sense.",False
10,n/a,Sensory Shift,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film almost leads one to believe that sound betrays the emotion the eyes capture. Just as the blind develop hearing far better than the average, the deaf develop a keen sense of sight. I am convinced that a lack of dialogue forces us to read the language of the face and body, a verbage unmatched in beauty and nuance. Though the accompanying musical piece (be careful not to identify it as a score), so deliciously inspired by the film, enhances the visual playground; it is the actors' faces that comprise this tour de force. Ms. Falconetti shifts from worry and doubt to unabashed conviction in a single shot, giving the viewer the luck of seeing one's thoughts in progress. She needs no response to the interrogation, it's all in her face. Renee is not superficially beautiful and the lack of make-up only reinforces how bare Joan is, but it is the uncanny ability of an incomparable stage actor to be a window into the soul that makes her so stunning, for the soul we see is one we only wish to attain for ourselves. The Church sees what we see, and they respond just as clearly to her unspoken protest with vehement pomp. The cinematography is so astounding for its time no comment could ever do it justice. Though many comments can be made, and are, surrounding the inspiration and detail for the set, it is at its core an incredible gift from Dreyer to the actors meant to inspire. It plays little part in the film, but to pull an inconceivable last drop of reality from the actors. A testament I can imagine will never be matched to the incredible power of silence.",False
11,7,A milestone in film history,Wistfull,n/a,15/08/2025,"Technically interesting, but lacking in storyline - they could have built the tension much better, I think. Maybe it would work better if I cared about religion. Also the recently invented close-ups were taken a bit too far, as it was difficult to tell who was who with all the monk men looking so similar.Still, some neat images in this one, and definitely an important work in the history of cinema. Recommended as a study of advances in early filmmaking.",False
12,10,Falconetti's face is sublimely human,zeph-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw this film for the very first time last week and was so tremendously captivated by it that I needed to share this rapture. The innovative camera-angles, the close-ups revealing pain and spirituality. It elevates the human condition and the Art of film. I would love to be able to go on into the whys or hows or technicalities. But my words couldn't do the film justice for the imagery still overwhelms me.",False
13,7,Neither tedious nor a masterpiece,Igenlode Wordsmith,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've heard that this film is notoriously unwatchable; I've heard that it is one of the greatest moving pictures of all time. Given my negative experience of other 'great experimental' classics -- ""Napoleon"", ""Metropolis"", ""Greed"" -- I had a suspicion that my own reaction might lie on the former end of the scale: but when the chance to see it presented itself, I felt I ought to take the opportunity. To further my cinematic education, if nothing else.Oddly enough, while it seems to be a film that normally evokes a violent response in one direction or the other, I found myself left floating mildly in the middle. I didn't think it was the greatest film ever made, but I didn't find it unwatchable either.On the most basic level, I can't help feeling that Dreyer picked one of the most unsuitable subjects for a silent film possible: a dramatization of a verbal transcript! I can see the trial of Joan of Arc being presented as an effective radio drama, along the lines of Dorothy L. Sayers' Christ-play, ""The Man Born to be King"", but trying to make a silent movie out of it produces a horribly forced format: the courtroom scenes consist entirely of mouthed dialogue shown on transcribed title cards, followed by incredibly prolonged reaction shots. The (no doubt unintended) impression given was that the reaction shots were only there to break up what would otherwise be an unbroken series of intertitles, rather than being an active artistic choice: certainly Joan must have been an incredibly uncooperative witness if it really took her that long to answer each question. The format just doesn't seem to fit the content: 'talky' silent films are generally a mistake, and this section was nothing *but* talk.And tears. I've never encountered a Joan who cried so much -- I was left wondering if that was why Falconetti was cast, since she seems to have a decided talent for it. The endless weeping didn't actually seem in character for a girl who produces the sort of smart comebacks quoted in the script, and the director seemed to be wallowing in tormenting both star and audience. I was aware of my neighbours fidgeting.But it picks up, unsurprisingly, when it shifts into more natural silent territory and actually allows the characters to move. The sets appear to be cardboard in the most literal sense of the term (the painted-on arrow-slits are particularly obvious), but I couldn't tell if that was a deliberate gesture at modernism or simply the result of budgetary limitations; it gave the whole thing a certain stage play air, but when we actually see the soldiers tormenting Joan rather than watching characters mouth words for the camera, the style becomes more fluid.One technical device I found irritating was the repeated choice to film faces in three-quarter-length, with their foreheads cut off at the eyebrows. This is a mannerism I associate with the misuse of widescreen (which seems to have inherent problems with the fact that humans, unlike landscapes, aren't actually constructed in a letter-box shape), and the 'low-brow' result annoys me just as much coming from 1927 as it does in 2004. But that's just a personal quirk...More audience reaction as we got to the blood-letting: there were audible groans and ughs, and I couldn't help wondering how this was done! Presumably they didn't *really* stick a scalpel into someone's artery, let alone Miss Falconetti's? I noticed that the whole thing was shot in tight close-up with no glimpse of Joan's face.The finale, on the other hand, was more than gruesome enough for anybody, and the contrast to the unmoving opening scenes is stark: Dreyer seems to have gone into Mel-Gibson mode with full gore, writhing flames, etc. Perhaps the only common factor with the courtroom sequence is that it goes on and on: there was certainly no fidgeting at this point, or if there was I myself was too horrified and riveted to be aware of it.But even here there were some consciously arty moments to break the spell: the repeated cut-aways from the bound Joan to free-flying birds were less than subtle, and I can see why the use of the 'pendulum shot' didn't catch on... However, it is certainly convincing, probably too much so to pass for a PG certificate in the modern world: the shots of the charred body slumping into the rising flames are particularly explicit. One is left with the impression of having seen someone burned to death.I don't think I was impressed by the bits that I was probably intended to be impressed by, and I spent a lot of the trial being haunted by echoes of Bernard Shaw's play ""St Joan"", written a few years before this film came out: presumably both authors were quoting from the same sources, although it was distracting to recognise the retorts of Shaw's combative peasant girl while simultaneously presented with a visual of Dreyer's tortured saint. On the other hand, I wasn't nearly as bored as I might have expected to be. The experimental features either passed me by or were actively off-putting, but the film didn't lose my interest.",True
14,3,Raiders of the Lost Arc!,ldavis-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter years of hearing this film praised to the skies, I finally got to see this last night, thanks to our buddies at TCM.For the benefit of you budding actors, the following is a blow-by-blow account of Maria Falconetti's portrayal of Joan of Arc, considered by many critics to be the greatest performance in the history of film:Goes into Pop-My-Eyes-Out-of-My-Sockets Mode. Then cries.Goes into I'm-Feeling-Sorry-for-Myself Mode. Then cries.Goes into Lomotomized Zombie Mode. Then cries.Goes into Bobbing Head Doll Mode. Then cries.Repeats modes like a broken record. Then cries. A lot.Joan of Arc was a female George Patton, someone who knew how to kick ass and take names. Falconetti's Joan is a blubbering wack job no one would follow into a pillow fight! Oddly, the only time Falconetti stops the blubbering wack job bit is when Joan is about to be burnt to a crisp.The ending is a stupefying orgy of violence and bizarre camera angles.

15,n/a,Dreyer's masterpiece one of cinema's greatest artistic triumphs,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of the last great silent films made during the advent of sound, Carl-Theodor Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc is a haunting, riveting portrait of the historical martyr based on documentation from the original trial.  Focusing primarily on the series of courtroom examinations that doomed the young warrior, the film gloriously employs vivid close-ups to accentuate the ordinariness (while at the same time exaggerating the most grotesque qualities) of Joan's inquisitors.  Maria Falconetti is unforgettable as Joan, perfectly distilling the pain, terror, and saintliness required by what is probably one of the most demanding roles an actor could attempt.  The consequence of Joan's conviction -- her burning at the stake -- allows Dreyer to hammer home his exquisite visual motif balancing erotic corporeality with transcendent spirituality.",False

I think that was such a profound scene, showing that, though not exactly one of the good guys, he didn't really want her to die, he respected her strength and faith, it showed he was human - I thought that was an amazing, great touch.Also I'd like to mention Richard Einhorn's inspirational soundtrack that matches the film so incredibly well that I can't imagine one without the other.

It is a film that captures the imagination not so much with what it shows as what it doesn't show.This film is truly a ""passion."" Maria Falconetti expresses the pain and the anguish of a person who truly is being persecuted. Most of her shots are simply face or head-and-shoulder shots. Perhaps it is a reality of silent films that makes the images all the more compelling. Still, one can't help but wonder whether movies wouldn't be better today if the example set by this film and others like it were not followed.Maria Falconetti is stunning.

20,10,The most powerful movie I've ever seen,sdl-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is really nothing I can say about this movie other than to tell you to get a hold of a copy as soon as you can, and keep a few boxes of tissues nearby.  I've never seen any film, let alone another silent film, that sustains this level of emotional intensity for its entire duration.  The first ten seconds of this movie will show you why some directors chose to end their careers when talking-pictures became popular.  The expressions on the face of the incredible Maria Falconetti carry the drama in a way that no dialogue ever could hope to do.  My only warning is that this film is not entertainment; it is an overpowering work of artistic genius that could make a stone weep.  So make sure you are in the right frame of mind before watching it.",False
21,9,Falconetti's breathtaking performance is undoubtedly one of the greatest the silver screen has ever seen,pere-25366,n/a,15/08/2025,"Maria Falconettiis simply outstanding in this film; playing the eponymous character who claims she has seen and been sent by God, she delivers a transcendental performance that is overwhelmingly raw and visceral. Shot predominantly in close-ups, the tight framing restricts us to narrowly focus in on her state of fear and immerse us right into the emotional turmoil through which she is suffering. POV shots of the French clergyman ingeniously add to this effect as we experience the fear of the dire circumstances through Joan's eyes. And the fact that Falconetti never acted again only adds to the eeriness of her performance. With cinematography that was way ahead of its time and an incredible score to boot, this is simply a masterpiece of cinema. Far and away one of the greatest silent films ever conceived.",False

It also gives off the vibe of mystique and wisdom well beyond her years, a girl ground in her conviction, always cornered by dark forces in the room, yet remains a light.It is rather confusing with no back-story,as not everyone grantedly knows the story of Joan of Arc. But like any passion play, the purpose is not so much the circumstances to the setting, but the actions and reactions of the people in the moment.I found the film very ahead of its time in many aspects. Then dark tone in soon time became the staple of this director. The imagery of death and torture, though not graphic, seems graphic, and gives an illusion of terror in a way that may have seemed taboo in the more conservative 30's,40's, and 50's film making.The age old battle of clericalism vs. authentic faith and the centuries old account of Joan of Arc, are told through this near-90 year old movie that has a very modern feel. It has a timeless quality rare for an old movie.I do not think it ranks as high as the historians and students of film proclaim it. But is a must-must-see for any appreciator of film and arts.",False
23,10,The passion of Joan of Arc - The face of Renee Maria Falconetti,Galina_movie_fan,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" (1928) by Carl Theodor Dreyer is simply one of the greatest films ever - silent or no silent and what considered by many critics, the greatest performance by any actress on the screen. Renee Maria Falconetti, a French stage performer, was persuaded by Dreyer to play the Maid of Orleans even though she had no film experience. From her very first shot, we can understand what a visionary Dreyer was. The director asked the actress to crop her hair and to strip her face of any makeup. Filmed mostly in close-up, the agonized face of Falconetti's Jean, free of all cosmetic artifice, appears more moving and human, and expresses so many emotions that it literally stays in a viewer's soul.A German designer Herman Warm (""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" and ""The Tree Lights"") constructed the austere sets for the film; the photography of Rudolph Mater also contributed to the films universal power. The composer Richard Einhorn wrote in 1989 the composition ""Voices of Light"" which is included in VHS that I saw and effectively enhances Dreyer's impressive images. With all that said, I couldn't help quoting Ingmar Bergman who said once, ""The human face is the great subject of the cinema. Everything is there"". Faces tell the tale of the Maid of Orleans in this movie, and above all, one unforgettable face - that of Renee Falconetti in her only film appearance.",False
24,6,A Hideously Bleak Freakshow,strong-122-478885,n/a,15/08/2025,"With Danish director, Carl Dreyer clearly going against the grain here in direct defiance of glamour and beauty - I'd say that as a perceptive film-maker - He was also something of a sadist to deliberately drag his audience through such an unpleasant religious-based hell as this.I mean - What an absolutely damning statement about the hypocrisy of Christianity this film's story inevitably made.Now 90 years old - This hideously bleak freakshow of stark, barren sets and unflattering close-ups sort of reminded me (in an odd way) of David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"".For me - The undeniably best moment in this truly unpleasant, yet strangely compelling, cinematic experience was, of course, Joan's tear-filled head-shaving scene.I think it's interesting to note that actress, Renee Falconetti (who played the Joan character) said that she never understood all of the positive reaction to her performance.",False

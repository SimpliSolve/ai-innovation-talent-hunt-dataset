1,7,The Hermit of Treig,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the fascinating story of Ken Smith, a positively sprightly old gent who lives in isolation on the shores of a remote Scottish loch. Devoid of electricity or plumbing, he survives the harshest of winters and the delights of the summer months in his hand-built log cabin. Director Lizzie MacKenzie has befriended him and using her hand-held camera, we get a real sense of just how basic his lifestyle is. Technology allows him to connect with the outside world and latterly he has become entitled to a modest state pension that enables him have his shopping delivered by one of the park rangers. After a bit of an health scare he now has people who keep an eye on him. He has a radio transmitter that he must use to check in with ""civilisation"" now and again; but for the most part he lives what appears to be an idyllic life catching fish from the loch; making booze from distilled tree sap; picking and eating his own fruit, berries and vegetables and although I can't say it offers anything like enough creature comforts for me; I did find there something quite intriguingly tantalising about his chosen way of life. Mr. Smith is a clever and charming eccentric, a man with whom it is easy to engage and by the end I did feel myself genuinely concerned that his health and wellbeing may ultimately force him into urban living for which he is ill-suited. Well worth a watch - but be snug when you do.",False
2,8,Solitude,billcr12,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ken Smith grew tired of modern civilization and dropped out forty years ago. He trekked thousands of miles before finally settling in a log cabin near Lake Treig in Scotland.As a young man he was beaten by a mob and in a coma for almost two months. He made a miraculous recovery and his beautiful nature photgraphs are interspersed throughout the documentary.With no running water or electricity, Mr. Smith writes daily in his journal by either sunlight or candlelight. He does cheat a bit by having food delivered and he also uses a battery operated radio.His wooded surroundings are spectacular and I wonder how he is doing after suffering a stroke during the time period of the making of this film. Lizzie MacKenzie has made an excellent movie.",False

1,7,Good doc with annoying background sounds,atank81,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed the bulk of the documentary. I had never heard of this event, and this was very informative. Great insight into the impact this had on everyone.However, in the critical points of the story, the background music/sounds were so overwhelming I had to fast forward or turn down so low I couldn't really hear the speaker. Especially the high pitched sounds that are used over and over. Very distracting. Fine line of using sounds to increase the drama and making it so unbearable it has the opposite effect. For a large part of this documentary, the background sounds are simply unbearable. Just let the story stand on its own.",False
2,7,Overall worth seeing,kendallevans-23892,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe a bit long? My big issue was the overly loud music in the first 15 minutes, I understand they were trying to describe that many of the employees were ex-hippies but I keep thinking/hoping they would turn it down during the conversation, they don't! Really annoying. I do like the style of no third party ""interviewing"" just letting the people talk and tell their story. 3-4 of the main characters are not very likeable. That's always a problem when the story line is built to to provide a ""sympathetic avenue"" and it doesn't work. Overall, a good doc. I'm sure skiers will get more out of it than non-skiers.",False
3,6,Music,eranweber,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish documentarians wouldn't use music underneath entire films. I was looking forward to watching this movie and learning about what took place, but I couldn't get through it because the music played the entire time and took away from the dialogue and content. At times the music was almost as loud as the person being interviewed. I've noticed this happening a lot with more recent documentaries. You want people to watch a film, not become distracted by it. I was a freshman in high school when the avalanche took place and remember hearing about it. The film is highly rated, but I couldn't get through it. Hopefully, I'll find another documentary on the same subject without the overbearing music.",False
4,7,A lot of regular heroes,MickyG333,n/a,16/08/2025,"7.0 stars.This is a semi-memorable documentary about a really bad avalanche in one of the most avalanche prone resorts in the world. What's the big surprise here? It's obvious that something like this was going to happen in such a hazardous location, and yet, the local ""experts"" figured they had it under control. It's a sad story of the needless loss innocent lives. These things happened a lot in those days, not so much now 40 years later. We don't see nearly as much of these dangerous occurrences in the United States these days. For some reason our safety awareness has skyrocketed ten-fold since the 80's, yet life expectancy hasn't changed. I find that interesting. This film is very well done. I don't watch a whole lot of documentaries, but got through this one just fine.",False
5,9,Wow,tmcnurse3-606-23821,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary had me riveted to my seat. I have always had an interest in this story, mainly because of how it affected our family. My brother-in-law was a professional skier at the time and his girlfriend was at the resort working that day. She became so worried about the weather conditions, so she called my brother-in-law to come pick her up. The avalanche happened about an hour after they left. It was a miracle she avoided the catastrophe that followed. I've heard this story so many times, and I'm glad someone finally did a documentary about it. Thank you to all those who worked so hard in the rescue efforts.",False
6,7,Very Good,bt698nhj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love humility and find it inspirational. There are boatloads of humility in this documentary. Very touching, very poignant, made me cry.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",False
7,10,"Really, really well done.",firemanbob,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who isn't a skier, but is active in outdoor recreation (I'd rather snowshoe), and lives in the mountains of Colorado, I was keenly interested in this movie when I saw the description. I was hoping for something great, and it is indeed great.Told from the perspective of the people involved, and with no third person narration, this story unfolds with the events leading up to, and after, the avalanche.You get an idea of what the people were like at the time, how much they've grown since then, and how much this affected them. They are at times very emotional, but always with a sense of honesty. They were mostly people (around my age, as far as I can tell) who were having a good time being ski bums, when tragedy struck. How they dealt with the tragedy is the main thrust of the story, and it is told with brutal forthrightness.Even if skiing or winter recreation isn't your thing, this is still a movie to watch.",False
8,10,Heartfelt and inspiring. A masterpiece.,dfj-16,n/a,16/08/2025,"The necessary elements for an outstanding movie are the same whether for a documentary or feature film.:1] Compelling story and script.2]. Performance quality that is genuine with unmistakable emotional
content that resonates with and enlivens the emotional experience
of viewers.3]. Cinematography that effectively supports as well as enhances the
visual story-telling process.It is my opinion that ""Buried"" embodies the highest qualities of each of these elements and clearly demonstrates that it's creators possess a mastery of the visual story-telling art. It would be impossible to produce a documentary of this quality without a remarkable commitment of time and compassion. Interviewees rarely share their hearts as openly as those in this film without a substantial level of trust and comfort. Although based on the consequences of a natural disaster there is a consistently uplifting theme of heartfelt humanity throughout. The film also successfully highlights the necessity for avalanche awareness as well as the need for improved prediction and snow management practices.Bravo to director/producers Steven Siig and Jared Drake for this monumental achievement.",False
9,9,Watch this movie when I work for Palisades and Alpine,gingerduanl,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's kind of wired felling that watching this documentary when I am working for this resort. And the day I watched this is also the day they close the both resort due to high risk of avalanche. So I stay at home and review this said history. It's not as said as I thought, but it remind me should respect our mother nature more next time when I go to Alpine. Ski or working... The whole documantary has many many interview with the person who experience this accident and many valuable materials. It really helps me understand more about avalanche control and many other knowledge about snow and mountains.",False
10,5,Tears For Fears...in 1982?,CatRufus5591,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're going to make a documentary about 1982, why not keep the viewer in the year 1982? Why include a song from 1985 -'Everybody Wants To Rule The World'? Because you like the song? It certainly has no connection to 1982!That being said, this is otherwise a well-done documentary. Good interviews with people who were there, the ski patrollers who work hard to try and prevent catastrophes(there was a comment about how the cannons that are used to kill people in wartime are used to protect lives on the slopes. So true).It's obvious through the interviews that the trauma of that day is still fresh in the minds of the former ski patrollers. Their words are the strength of this worthwhile documentary.",False
11,10,This is a must see documentary!,louraso,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary tells the story of the 1982 Alpine Meadows avalanche and the rescue effort that followed. The series of storms that led up to the event and continued to dump snow after the avalanche was epic. Most day skiers are not aware of the danger and the huge effort ski area employees make to lessen the danger. Ski patrollers go out in insane conditions with explosives that they toss to trigger the snow packed slopes and produce slides.The film has won multiple awards on the festival circuit including best documentary at Bend and Austin film festivals. Directors Drake and Siig have done a great job sharing this story.,False
12,10,What an amazing documentary! SEE IT NOW!,tripster1_2000,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is one of the best that I have ever watched. I remember this event well as I was learning to ski at Heavenly Valley Ski Resort during this terrible storm. Such a perfect storm was created from the weather, the snow conditions, etc. While watching this moving doc, I chuckled, I had tears in my eyes, and I learned a lot about snow and weather and what can create these types of conditions that led to this tragic event. I also really enjoyed the interviews with the surviving people that were in charge at Alpine Meadows that terrible day. Well filmed, well documented, and the subject matter was handled beautifully with grace, homage, and dignity given where deserved. This needs to be nominated for the Best Documentary category!",False
13,9,Well done retrospect of personal accounts,OneAnjel,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was at a few ski lodges in the 70s & 80s. Those are fond memories, so this film was a bit nostalgic for me in some ways. I found all the participants to be clear and relatable, which is a nod to a great director and producer. There was actual footage when available. This film is not really entertainment so much as story telling and it's very informative and emotional. There's a definite level of intimacy between the survivors and the audience.I wasn't very familiar with the story so I was on the edge of my sest to see if Bridget was correct ❤When they brought up the law suit, I knew right away this was an act of God and the attorney that took the case knew he was just stealing that family's money. Such a sad reality but you're on a mountain in the middle of a fierce storm and you decide to take a walk? Yes, I am in the legal field and the fact is, the ski lodge did not have a duty to inform anyone that snow can be dangerous any more than a beach front carnival has a duty to post warnings about rip tides or sharks. It was a tragedy, to be sure, but no ones fault.One review claims the film is maudlin and pathetic. I'm not sure if their platform called Buried an Action film or why they weren't expecting emotions and personal accounts. So I'll just say: Tell me your a sociopath without telling me your a sociopath.",False
14,8,VIEWS ON FILM review of Buried: The 1982 Alpine Meadows Avalanche,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""It was snowing sideways"". I can only imagine what that entails. The heavy stuff falls rapidly and devastates a ski resort via northeast California in 2021's Buried: The 1982 Alpine Meadows Avalanche. Seven people passed, one survivor emerged, PTSD eventually kicks in, the base area destroyed. In the end natural forces as a house always wins.With honest interviews and a shrewdness from those interviewees that were there (center employees, lift operators, local denizens, local media), ""Buried"" is a wounding documentary that just gets more wounding as it goes along. I mean you watch the body language of the people that witnessed what went down in March of 1982 and well, the events of that famous avalanche really stick in their craws. For reals. Almost forty years later and a nudge and that throb just never goes away. ""The grim work went on"". Uh-huh.Arduous accounts, unconscious gesturing, and unwounded time aside, Buried: The 1982 Alpine Meadows Avalanche cuts its time between present day stuff to emulsion-like archives to reenactments to sequences of loud music pouncing in at weird moments (rock ditties, standard and/or otherwise). Despite an opening thirty minutes that carries a certain smugness, a ""young and free"" turn of mind, and an overload of bed surface technobabble, ""Buried"" does eventually win you over. Yup, the flick's 96 minutes finally come to a close and you feel cinematically bone-weary.I mean the docu has a certain edge to it, a certain numbing severity if you will, with the parables of death and suffering by rocks and ice being almost too intense for a younger viewer to handle (the film is not rated but I'd go with a hard ""R""). Heck, in the spring Lake Tahoe wasn't all roses and sunshine. Talk about the snow squall to end all snow squalls. ""Buried"" is alive!",True
15,5,Maudlin and shallow ...,kerryharrismail,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no idea if I was watching the same film as the rest of the reviewers here because my comments are so different from everyone else. I note that other comments come from those with personal connections to either the area or people who worked on the mountain so maybe that's the difference. This doc was boring, overdrawn and very shallow - kind of a one note diatribe on how great (read talented) the survivors were. I actually fast forwarded through most of it.Larry Heywood comes across as an appalling human being whose excuse for being wretched is that he was married????Ego centric Jim clearly needs therapy as everything is about him and his narrative is painful to watch.Yes, three people died and it was your fault - why wasn't the parking lot closed and condo owners sent home? That's irresponsible AF - no one should have been at the ski hill that day at all.This could have gone so much deeper and explored the aftermath and effect that this disaster had on everyone involved, instead it's a linear start to finish, chronology of events. How boring is that?Well pretty darn boring - that's 2 hours I won't get back ...",False
16,3,Music too loud,jenniejones-75346,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love a survival / rescue documentary but had to give up on this one, sadly.The background music was way too loud. Put on the subtitles but the music was still to distracting. So ended up turning it off. Annoying, looked like it could have been an interesting documentary, just ruined by the sound department.",False

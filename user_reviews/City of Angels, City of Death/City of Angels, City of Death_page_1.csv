1,9,A Chilling DocuSeries on LA Serial Killers in the 1970s,blpkst,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first homicide detectives working on the mind boggling serial killer cases that manifested in the 1970s in LA should get the Congressional Medal of Honor. These men are true heroes. They solved the cases and caught the bad guys with a note pad and a pencil, teamwork and sheer determination. The 1970s LA was a perfect storm for serial killers. Women finally had freedom in society and a lot of sick men didn't like that fact and set out to punish them in the most brutal and sadistic way possible. Their deficiencies became the mechanism. Society was not sick, they were.It is fascinating seeing and hearing how the detectives worked, gathered evidence and left no stone unturned. Quick thinking saved the lucky few from being victims. One reviewer said this was a ""fun"" series to watch which is horrifying. What I especially appreciated in the series was that we were given the information on the cases but not in a sensational way. Victims were blurred and nothing was gratuitously graphic. The recreation of scenes was also well done.I think women especially are drawn to true crime documentary as a way to gain knowledge to protect ourselves from danger. The contestant on the dating game that got terrible vibes when she met the bachelor she picked on ""The Dating Game"" who turned out to be a notorious serial killer was so lucky and unbelievably insightful. She listened to her instincts and possibly saved her life. That was chilling.I grew up in the 1960s and remember well how terrified everyone was during the Boston Strangler's reign of terror. It is reputed that the ""hillside strangler"" lived for a time in the Boston area during those years. I recommend this series.",False
2,9,A different serial killers perspective,portal1790,n/a,16/08/2025,You choose a time and a place. Then you conduct an investigation of all the major serial killers that choose that time and that place to do all of their crimes. This is an amazing chronological investigation of L. A. most notorious serial killers.,False
3,9,Excellent series,noreendougherty,n/a,16/08/2025,"I avoided watching this initially because I was already so familiar with the different serial killers & crimes that this series covers. I'm happy that I finally took the time to watch because it was a truly intriguing & different take than anything I had ever watched before about the era of the 70's & 80's LA serial killers. They give examples of how a lot of these crimes crossed paths due to the fact that the same police were investigating all of these infamous criminals at the same time. The firsthand accounts from the police are emotional & raw, really giving you a feel for what it was like to investigate all of those coinciding crimes & live through that insanity. Overall it was a great series & I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys true crime.",False
4,10,Excellent documentary series!,boomer-kris,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up in the 60's and 70's in Los Angeles county, I remember vividly these serial murder cases. Seeing the actual detectives now, I'm impressed by what they did to bring these killers to justice, and the nightmares they endured. This series is a must for true crime buffs, and for anyone who grew up in Southern California.",False
5,10,A must watch,carliesfox,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge true crime viewer and although I knew a lot about this time period, the city, and the serial killers it was still so fun to watch. It was also nice to see the same detectives who helped solve these crimes talk about it. Highly recommend.",False
6,7,Very Interesting,UrbanElysium,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really liked this show but it was a bit maddening that EVERY episode the interviewees were repeated multiple times! We are not stupid and twice is enough to say something!The audience treated as imbecilic and ""needed to hear same quotes/comments multiple times!"" ðŸ˜•Would have been great if they had actually included ALL of the 20 serial killers and not just a handful.But, I give kudos to law enforcement who resolved to crack the cases!Makes me wonder how many other cities delt with multiple serial killers in the 80s!?The '70s-80s were awash with them- what the hell was going on!?",False
7,10,Well done,brianprattwooo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMy favorite part was when Robert Souza let the freeway killer take another victim in his van and torture him almost to death. Then called it good policing. I've never heard of the ""sit back and watch the crime unfold in front of your eyes just to be extra extra sure"" technique.",True
8,10,Great Series,lynn-m-kohn,n/a,16/08/2025,Wow! What a great series. Hearing from the detectives who solved the cases gave an amazing insight into the beginnings of modern techniques used to catch serial killers as well as the challenges they faced. I hope this series continues.,False
9,10,Well done crime documentary,mrocco-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are in to true crime this is a fantastically produced documentary. They don't repeat the same stuff over and over like the cable crime shows. The actual detectives who investigated the crime are in this production. And some well known faces to the true crime community are here (Paul Holes and Matt Murphy). It's so nice to see Matt since I live in Orange County where Matt was a prosecutor and the recent host at Crime Com awards.As usual, I'm reminded about how much I absolutely hate the media, this series does not provide any exception to that sentiment. They are a bunch of vultures that care more about a story than respecting an investigation. If they are exceptions it just proves the rule.",False
10,3,FALSE PUFF/PR PIECE FROM STRUGGLING LAPD. Shameful.,fanofmovies124,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe LAPD is not the crime-fighting juggernaut they would like you to believe. Released during an era of calls to defund police, the historically corrupt and violent LAPD is not immune from those messages, nor should they be. That being said, the LAPD (and ABC news) has produced schlock that is also historically inaccurate. Bottom line, the LAPD wants to take credit for solving crimes they either lucked into solving, someone else solved, and/or the crimes were solved well after (again, because of luck...like DNA).Murders are committed by the people who know you, and police do not have the slightest idea how to handle serial crimes because they fail to understand a rather basic psyche. When trying to understand and find a serial killer (""SK""), three things MUST be remembered: a serial killer has a COMPULSION to kill, they do not want to kill, they often don't enjoy killing, and even hate themselves for it; a serial killer is a PSYCHOPATH, and a psychopath is someone who does not know the difference between right or wrong; and serial killers rarely have high IQs and only succeed in killing so many undetected because the murders are random. These are not premeditated murders in the legal sense and these people usually lack competency to be tried for their crimes.Of the serial killers operating in LA County from 1977-1987, the LAPD's responsibility for finding them between 1975 and 1990 is minor, if any: 1. Golden State Killer (Joseph DeAngelo)-caught via DNA in 2018; 2. Tool Box killers (Lawrence Bittaker & Roy Norris)-caught due to jailhouse confession by Norris (and by Hermosa PD in Orange County, CA); 3. Louis Crane-caught only because he was lingering in closed section of the crime scene during police investigation;4. Grim Sleeper (Lonnie Franklin)-caught in 2010; 5. Michael Hughes-caught in 1993; 6. Chester Turner-caught in 2003; 7. Ivan Hill-entirely undetected during his period, he was caught via DNA in 2003 after already serving 10 years for unrelated crimes; 8. Samuel Little-repeatedly jailed for killing sex workers with short terms, he continued killing until he was caught in 2012; 9. Mauricio Silva-went to police and confessed;
10. Hillside Strangler (Kennith Bianchi & allegedly Angelo Buono)-Bianchi was caught in Washington State while committing the same crimes, after multiple people reported him to LAPD during his crime spree; Buono was Bianchi's cousin, convicted entirely based on testimony from Bianchi, which was 100% self-serving and should've been discounted; 11. William Bonin-was a habitual criminal in and out of prison for committing incredibly violent acts with increasing intensity; 12. Randy Kraft-caught by CHP during stop for suspected DUI and was found with a dead man in the passenger seat.This is a documentary that should be viewed with Wikipedia next to you.",True
11,8,City of Angels ???,JoeKulik,n/a,16/08/2025,"There was supposedly 20 serial killers active in LA between 1975 & 1985, yet this series wants us to believe that LA was a 100% GREAT Place To Live back then were it not for all these serial killers ??? What an insult to my intelligence !!! There is definitely something wrong with a city itself that has such a concentration of serial killers. These serial killings didn't happen in spite of Los Angeles but because of LA. A truly honest consideration of this topic would've asked : ""What is wrong with a city for so much serial killing to happen there in just one decade ???? Sick People are a product of a Sick Society, and LA was apparently a VERY Sick Society back then. THAT was the REAL Story that this series neglected.",False
12,10,Gold,tsougkos84,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is maybe the best crime - docu i have ever seen. And i have seen a lot. Presentation, directing, suspense, stories, interviews, everything was top. Bravo.",False
13,10,Frightening & Horrifying,tamralea,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's unbelievable how many of these monsters were active in the 70s-80s. It's amazing how the police tracked them down.What the victims and their survivors went through is truly so sad.In the end, you cannot help but realize that these monsters clearly murdered more than were found but at least they're off the streets.",False
14,10,Amazing series ! Great story telling,richardjerome,n/a,16/08/2025,"A chilling incite into history.Just proves how bad the world is and was.Told in an amazing way with the real
Investigators, truly eye opening and a gripping watch.Series 2 is a must please please please.",False
15,10,Amazing Detective Work,deborahzzzzz,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Detectives & police work is incredible especially the start of criminal profiling that led to seeking out serial killers insight. The documentary was so insightful & also respectful of the victims & families.The police work involved was incredible & the determination of the guys that were working these cases was incredible & these guys, the detectives, need to be recognised for their bravery & valour & determinationSo many thanks to all the detectives & police featured in this documentary determined to catch that sick killer .Many Thanks to the dedication of these fine detectives & police men & women of the USA.",False
16,3,So long it devalues it,carolrmag,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came to watch this documentary series almost by accident. The subject is very interesting. In my opinion, it could have taken this long (maybe...) if the profile of the killers had been analised by a profiler, which doesn't happen.They barely scratch the surface.But maybe the objective would be to focus on the heroes in the police department that perhaps gave birth to profiling. It isn't well done in that perspective either.Lots of information is repeated from episode to episode (I think even in the same episode) turning this series into a seemingly cheap one.Wich is s shame. A lost opportunity.",False
17,10,One of the best docu series ever!,marioticak,n/a,16/08/2025,"In some moments hard to watch. Wonder myself what must be in people head to do such a terrible crimes. Unexplaineable! Thanks to the people like mr. Bob Grogan is I think world is more safe place to live. Emotional and good man, dedicated police officer.",False
18,10,Easily the best crime documentary I've seen in years,Curt-Rowlett,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is easily one of the best crime documentaries that I've seen in recent years.Not only does this documentary feature many serial killer cases that you likely know about, but there are several cases that I had never heard of before and I've been following true crime since the 70s.Best of all, whenever possible the actual detectives who worked on the various cases appear on camera to discuss what they were up against trying to solve these horrific murders. And this was during a time prior to DNA and other modern police tools that we take for granted these days, such as cell phones, Internet, and combined police databases.Some of these serial killer cases were even more horrific than I had initially read about and the few victims who survived told stories that just chilled me to the bone.I really hope that shows like this will become the standard in the future. Very well done and thank you to the cops who never gave up.",False
19,8,Such an interesting history of crime investigations...,anne0,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBut.... In Episode 4 I just cannot get over the showing of that little girl's remains, especially the face/skull in a full lighted closeup. Did the production have permission to do this? Even if they did, why did they?So far in all other similar shots there has been shadowing and blurring.",True
20,n/a,Dori Haines,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I hope you have done an episode on my friend Dori Haines. She was murdered with a friend up by box canyon after the sharon tate murder. Maybe a copycat.,False

1,8,One of Warner Brother's triumphs of the forties,Nazi_Fighter_David,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having had his day as an idolized star and romantic leading man, it was now time for Bogart to get down to the serious business of acting For eighteen years it had usually been Bogart playing Bogart in various shadings Now that Bogart was gone and in his place was an older and far less romantic figure, one who found new challenges and was able to meet most of them successfully This new phase of his continued growth began with a story of three men in search of goldAlthough ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is indisputably one of Bogart's best films, it was co-star Walter Huston who won an Academy Award as did the movie's director and scenarist, John HustonBased on a novel by the mysterious B. Traven, the film told a riveting tale which explored the degenerative effects of encroaching greed, distrust, and hatred on three prospectors who team up to search for gold in MexicoBogart's Fred C. Dobbs was an amazingly complex creation whose slow disintegration into paranoia was brilliant1y managed on camera He is a born loser with no potential for change in sight Suspicious, unfeeling, savage, and easily corruptible, he seems clearly destined for a tragic fate almost from our first meeting with himTim Holt was also excellent as Bob Curtin, a man who, like Bogart, is tempted but whose conscience will not permit him to exercise his baser desires. (He could have let Bogart die in a cave-in, but saved him instead.) Young, impressionable, and unprepared, he has never seen the likes of a Fred C. Dobbs and he finds himself overwhelmed and uncertain as to how he will cope with Dobbs's rage and greedHowever, it is the director's father, Walter Huston, who literally stole the picture from both Bogart and Holt as he played Howard, a wise old toothless codger who knew all along what would happen and took it all in stride, kicking up his heels and having a marvelous time Life can't surprise him any more He's already had successes and failures enough for one lifetime Like a faithful dog, he's along for the thrill of the hunt, and should there be another pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, well, that's just a bonusIt is mainly the interaction of these three men from their first meeting and uneasy partnership through their final confrontation that made ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" one of Warner Brothers' triumphs of the forties",False
2,9,"Just a great movie all around, but a very dark tale",AlsExGal,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is a sharp-edged study of the effects of greed on otherwise normal men, and one man in particular: Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs. Dobbs and Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) are down and out and meet up with prospector Howard (Walter Huston). When Dobbs wins a lottery, he uses the proceeds to finance a trip for the three to central Mexico to search for gold.The three have to deal with the lawlessness of central Mexico at the time - bandits were actually on the loose in that country killing anybody with stuff, and taking that stuff. The Federales were a violent solution to a violent problem - killing the bandits after a summary judgement and the bandits having dug their own graves. So our trio not only have to worry about bandits once they strike gold, they have to worry about the darkness of their own souls.In the beginning, Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs is a decent guy who does not take advantage of others. Dobbs only takes his money from the guy that wouldn't pay and he does share his lottery ticket and is generous with his fellow miners, but as greed begins to take root in him, little by little we see his goodness eaten away. It's a great credit to the writing and Bogart's skills that this is done gradually and played out over time. Incidentally, that's director John Huston ""staking him to a meal"". One of the best director cameos ever (although Polanski in Chinatown is equally great)!Dobbs overestimates himself and the fallibility of human nature. Walter Hustons character freely admits what gold could do to any of them including himself. Dobbs is sure it will never happen to him, but he's never had anything, so he's never faced temptation, and when he falls it's a long way down.This may be Tim Holt's finest performance - it was probably his finest opportunity given he had spent years laboring as a B western star on the RKO lot. Walter Huston as the prospector, minus his dentures and plus a bunch of pounds and with holes in his clothes is not the debonair fellow you are used to seeing in film . If Mary Astor's character in Dodsworth could have thought this was the future appearance of the man she loved, would she have taken her gondola in the other direction? I guess we'll never know.Highly recommended as one of the great character studies in which several characters get studied in detail.",False
3,9,A treasure presented to the viewer,yenlo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some movies have certain scenes in them that hold the viewers interest more than others. However every single scene in this film holds the viewers interest. There is never a dull or lagging moment. Three down and outers who at one time in their lives were maybe up and comers strike out in search of a fortune or at least enough to live better than they have been.While Humphrey Bogart gives a superb performance it is Walter Huston who turns in the greatest performance as the old prospector Howard. The scene in the Indian village where he helps to restore a comatose child is one of the most touching in all of film history and is done virtually without any dialog. Mexican character actor Alfonso Bedoya of course steals all the scenes he appears in and delivers his classic ""Stinking Badges"" line. (what person would dress up as a Bandito for a costume party and not want to look exactly like Bedoya's Gold Hat character?) This film probably should have been a little higher on AFI's top 100. A must see!",False
4,8,"""If you want somebody NOT to find it, . . .  Put it  in front of them""",thinker1691,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the 1920's, labor was hard to find. If you happened to be a laborer, work was almost non existent. Indeed, if you were unemployed and in Mexico, your chances were dismal. Yet, these were the times, which attracted many South of the border. The place was barren, yet many a fortune could spring up directly before you, . . .if you were luckily enough to see it. That is the story behind this incredible film. The legend of El Dorado was only one of the many myths which lured the adventurous to Mexico, another was ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre."" The gold of the Mother of Mountains was passed from father to son for generations. Thus when the film adaption was made, it was sure to be sculpted by men of vision. One such man is legendary John Huston who directed this film. Three common men are lured by the promise of discovering a lost treasure. The first is Fred C. Dobbs (Humphrey Bogart) a nice enough guy who wants only to be fair, but is hungry to 'strike it rich.' The second is Howard, (Walter Huston) as honest as you expect him to be and a man of considerable experience. The last is Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) who if given a chance, will use it. The trio make a PAC to share and share alike all the treasure they find. However, only Howard is aware of what the possession of Gold can do to a man. To find the treasure, they need the mountain, some hard work, a little luck. To bring it home, will require something only one of them possesses. The film is a Classic and is due to the combined talents of all the stars and the director. If you look closely, you'll see Robert Blake (Barreta) and John Huston in brief roles. ****",False
5,10,God Has a Sense of Humor,bkoganbing,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI think the great lesson of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is the effect civilization has on the behavior of man. Some people are only as good as they ought to be and the case in point is the guys that go out into the Sierra Madre gold prospecting and how their behavior changes.Dobbs and Curtin a couple of down on their luck Americans stranded in Tampico, Mexico. They meet up with old Howard at a flop house and his tales inspire them to try gold prospecting. The plot of the film is what happens to them when they find the gold they seek.The Treaure of the Sierra Madre is a film years ahead of its time for the stark realism it portrays. These are not classic movie heroes. I could see this film easily being remade today by some of our contemporary stars like Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Russell Crowe.It also has probably the most brutal bar fight ever put on film. Before going prospecting, Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs and Tim Holt as Curtin go out on a construction job for Barton MacLane who stiffs them when it comes time to pay up. They catch up with him at a Tampico dive and administer a terrible beating to MacLane. This is not some western saloon fight, this is probably one of the most realistic bar brawls ever filmed.I like to compare this film to The Oxbow Incident. In both cases, stress and a crisis bring out the true characters in people. Tim Holt is a lot like Henry Fonda's character and Bogart would have definitely been found in the ranks of the lynchers.Bogart as Dobbs is probably someone who in civilized society is no better than what he can get away with. His descent into uncontrollable paranoia is frightening on the screen, one of his best performances.Tim Holt who most of the time was content to star in B westerns for RKO shows what a capable player he is. In the flophouse scene look for an unbilled appearance by his father Jack Holt.Walter Huston capped a long career on the screen with the Best Supporting Actor Award for this film which also was the Best Picture of 1948. And son John Huston won his only Oscar for Best Director, making Oscar night a banner occasion for the Huston family. Huston's character of Howard you can see playing sidekick in many a Hollywood western. That would be a superficial impression. Howard turns out to be a wise old man.The ending of what happens to the men and their acquired treasure in the Sierra Made mountains is something else. In a location far from civilization and far from law it's shown that the Almighty does have a wicked sense of humor.",True
6,10,"""The Treasure"" of American Cinema ...",ElMaruecan82,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA brutal and uncompromising portrayal of greed's effects on the human spirit and an exhilarating quest of the Mexican El Dorado, the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. You'll be thrilled by John Huston's masterpiece, a genuine monument that would catch by surprise, even the most skeptical viewers when it comes to 'old' movies.The ""Sierra Madre"" was the first major studios films set outside Hollywood, in Mexico, when even the most acclaimed masterpieces didn't raise such a level of authenticity in their exotic setting, like in ""Casablanca"" when Captain Renault refers to the titular town as the middle of the desert. The geography in Huston's film is crucial as it provides the obligatory escapism for any adventure film, with a unique flavor. In ""Sierra Madre"" we get the same authentic feeling that probably inspired Clouzot's ""Wages of Fear"", with the proverbial financial struggle of the white men in South America. There's almost the same criticism of capitalism that prevailed in B. Travel's novel, as these men have been purely and totally exploited by the capitalistic majors that literally raped Mexico from its precious resources.Huston's movie is less politically loaded, but it portrayed capitalism in a negative light through the downfall and total disintegration of its main character, Humphrey Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs. Bogie, after having been a gangster, a private eye, a cynical, detached, and sometimes romantic lead, probably gives one of his best performances as a big s.o.b. And how he didn't get a nomination is unbelievable. His evolution from a decent man who wants a job and some money to the cold-blooded paranoid lunatic who tries to keep the gold for himself is not only fascinating but also mirrors the evolution of the film from a light-hearted mood, made of some comedic running gags like the encounters with Huston as the rich man in a white suit, to a heart-pounding thriller.And on that very level, the differences between the characters set the perfect circumstances for tension, despite the many signs of camaraderie displayed in the beginning. Curtin, Tim Holt in a remarkable performance, is younger and exudes a certain idealistic naiveté that counterbalances Dobbs' growing cynicism. Howard, the old-time prospector, an unforgettable Walter Huston, knows everything about prospecting, with enough experience to foresee the psychological changes on people when gold is at stakes. Of course, the movie is also remembered for the famous 'Gold Hat', Alfonso Bedoya with his unforgettable ""stinking badges"" line but more than an exotic villain, Bedoya foreshadows with a sort of charming charisma the evolution of Dobbs as a similar bastard.Indeed, one never knows how gold would transform us, and one must have the guts to work alone without falling into madness. During their journey guided by Howard, Dobbs and Curtin discover the true meaning of the word 'value' as measurable through the efforts you spend, days and nights, to find the treasure. Walter Huston deservedly won the Oscar for best supporting character, but he's as central as Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather"". Whatever Howard says, we know it's the truth, when he's reluctant, we understand it's a bad premonition. And when Howard esteems that the best would be to split the share when it becomes money, Dobbs, already showing signs of suspicion, recommends that each one takes care of his own share. Howard is experimented enough to resign, with all the wisdom of a man who doesn't want trouble.Dobbs' gradual descent into paranoid madness is highlighted in the episode when a gila monster gets stuck under the rock that covered his share while he suspects Curtin to have come for another reason. The paranoia grows and contaminates the whole team when another American named Cody, joins them and proposes his help. He's obviously smarter than them and doesn't deny that murdering him is an option they would consider. The way the team handled his proposal says a lot about the conservative instinct that could govern so called 'civilized' hearts, and again, doesn't speak in favor of the monopolistic systems regulated by capitalism. The alienation that grows within the team erodes all the camaraderie built during these months of labor, to a point even the word 'partner' loses its humanistic meaning.Bogart perfectly embodied the metamorphosis of a man alienated by his own greed, where the value of his share of gold, exceeded, every kind of principle that made him a decent man. As it's almost impossible to break free from a gila's bite, Dobbs became that gila with paranoia as a venomous poison, too mistrustful to go, to let go or to be reasoned. When Curtin says he protected Howard's money as he would have done for Dobbs, Dobbs uses the same reasoning in a reverse way, pushing cynicism to its paroxysm : betraying before being betrayed. And in an ironic anticlimactic twist, Dobbs is killed by bandits, 15 minutes before the end of the film as to highlight the pointlessness of this entire struggle. After all, what's the point of earning money if you lose principles?Failure is a recurrent theme in Huston's films with this double dimension of cynical denunciation, generally driven by an impeccable script, and this entertaining dimension that pleases the crowds as much as the more sophisticated audience, both who, matured enough by World War II, accepted a story about greed and deception, but maybe not Bogie so far from his usual character, playing such an unsavory bastard. I don't know, if like some said, this is why the film's flopped. One thing for sure, after 60 years, it remains as one of the most enduring classics ever, that beautifully earned a father and a son three deserved Oscars.And any other consideration is as pointless as crying over the loss of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and the only reaction it deserves is the unique loud and hysterical, jig-driven, maniacal laugh of Walter Huston",True
7,10,What acting is all about.,directortom,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although John Huston's directing is absolutely equal to the screenplay, winning Oscars for both, it is the performance level of the actors that makes ""Treasure of The Sierra Madre"" the classic film that it is. Beginning and ending with Walter Huston's award winning role of the worn-out old miner who is looking for one last big score, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt are equal to the task and draw us in to this tale of need and greed. So convincing is Walter's portrayal of the seasoned old prospector, we come to believe that he is a gold digger by trade who only acts in movies so that he can dig and pan for gold again and again. His knowledge of mining and the lifestyle it demands and forces upon those who partake, is so thorough that Bogart and Holt seem like school kids in awe of a new hero. Of course, we know that his son John, did much research in preparation for writing the screenplay; but we are nevertheless plunged into a sure belief that this old miner must surely have been there age upon age, mine upon mine, and has therefore, a thousand tales to tell.When, in the course of the story, Walter is taken away, somewhat without choice, to work the magic of a healer for a Mexican village, we are again convinced that he is a medical doctor hiding out as a prospector. This is the acting craft in full bloom. Walter becomes whatever is called for in the story. However, if one views his other films, the effect is the same. He is one of Hollywood's most under rated actors of all time. Those who have not seen this film have a joyous experience awaiting them. Great story, great screenplay, great acting. This is why we love movies the way we do.",False
8,n/a,Truly something special,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film made a huge impression on me when I first saw it at the age of 15 or 16. A recent rewatching on DVD really served to bring home for me what makes this film so special.The whole thing is quite good, but it really hits you when Howard goes off to celebrate with the Indians, leaving Dobbs and Curtin to care for his gold and burros. The ensuing scenes of their spiraling mistrust and tension are absolutely spellbinding--the kind of thing that makes you lean forward in your seat just to get your eyes a little closer to the raw humanity unfolding in front of you. Their paranoia, the way you can SEE scenarios of betrayal dancing in their eyes, Dobbs' burgeoning madness--these are the moments that make this film one for the ages.At its best, film noir (which this most certainly is--Western surroundings or no) makes the viewer complicit in the evil depicted on screen. We find ourselves scheming and plotting in our heads along with the unsavory characters we are watching--we start to feel the same temptations and desires that they do. ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" accomplishes this bond with the audience as well as any film you are likely to see.A magnificent film--one of the few great screen tragedies.",False
9,10,"All that glitters is ""gone with the wind....""",jotix100,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJohn Huston's genius as a director is undeniable. From his beginning he showed an uncanny knack for getting not only excellent acting from his actors, but his movies always had a social conscience as well.Mr. Huston loved Mexico and it shows in this film. It must have been a difficult task for him directing his own father in the movie. After all, Walter Huston was a major star on his own right. Both father and son made a great contribution, John behind the camera, Walter in front of it.Basically the story is about men that have drifted into Mexico to escape jail, or in search of riches, as it was the case of the men that fate brings together in a Tampico shelter. Dobbs, Howard and Curtin start out as partners searching for gold in the Sierra Madre. They find it, but as luck will have it, none of them will live to be rich from what they find in that remote place.In the most ironic of film endings, this one will be a classic. After the trio finds gold, greed sets in. Friendship turns sour and the three friends become enemies. When the bandits finally catch up with an exhausted Dobbs, trying to go north, they beat him up and discover some sacks full of sand....Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs is excellent. Of course, Walter Huston made the best out of Howard, the clever old man who has seen a lot in his life. He is the only one that discovers a happiness living the simple life among the friendly Mexicans that welcome him into their community. Finally, Tim Holt, as Curtin is perfectly cast as an honest man who has gone into the adventure without any expectations.The final sequence of Howard and the peasants riding their horses into the 'yellow dust' is amazing, as it it incredible. In retrospect, it seems to be telling us that sometimes dreams of becoming rich the easy way will not be sustained, but honest work will be more rewarding.",True
10,10,Artistic Gold!!!,TheAnimalMother,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLet me start by saying that this is easily one of the top 5 pre-1950 films in existence. No doubt about that in my mind. Not only that, but it is easily one of the greatest films ever made after 1950 as well.To me, this film in the end plays as a dark comedy. A dark comedy that pokes its fun at the greedy devil within the minds of men.The thing that stands out to me the most about this film is the writing. The Oscar winning screenplay is in my view still under-appreciated. This film's writing is totally devoid of any prejudice at all, and has a depth that almost every other film can only dream to have. A truly amazing work.I could go on and on about this film, but I will just end by saying that as a story, and as a film, The Treasure Of Sierra Madre will stand as an artistic landmark for all of human history.10/10.",True
11,7,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) ***,Cinemayo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Okay, I've finally watched THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE, and I found it to be one of those tough films to comment on, perhaps due to its very excellent reputation.I found Bogart to be very good in the movie, and I also enjoyed Walter Huston's performance and could see how he earned his award. The earlier scenes of the movie - before the men ventured out on their search for gold - actually impressed me more than the main parts of the film did. The classic moments where Dobbs is asking John Huston for a hand out again and again; bitching at the pesty little kid (Robert Blake!); beating the hell out of his ""boss"" when he tries to pull a fast one. These were my favorite scenes.Once the trio of buddies is out in the heat, prospecting for their gold, I have to say that while the tension and acting was very good, I just guess I had a hard time both accepting and believing that Bogart could actually go THAT nuts, and wind up turning against his friends like that. Paranoia and greed is one thing, but it just didn't sit right with me for this character of Dobbs - especially after we'd seen what a fair guy he is back when he only took his share of the salary instead of grabbing the whole wad of bills from his beaten ""employer"" (then again, I'm sure the turnabout was supposed to be the idea). It just didn't ring true for me that he could do what he did to his pal. I understand that it was the desert heat getting the best of him, and especially the gold working its ugly spell as the ""root of all evil,"" but it just hit me as improbable and excessive that things would or could go to THAT much of an extreme. Dobbs became a man possessed, and the effect was often more farcial than it was intense.I think director John Huston turned in a fine piece of cinematic work, and for technicality and acting (more than content) I did like this film enough to give it *** out of ****. I thought Bogart gave a very good performance, albeit one that I didn't really want to see happen to his character and one which I had a hard time swallowing actually could. I wouldn't be against seeing it again and re-evaluating it further, somewhere down the line.",False
12,9,"Still vivid, compact, colorful, and intense, with some acting to, uh, die for.",secondtake,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)This is a weirdly contemporary film. I mean, it's certainly set in the past, and it's made in the heyday of Hollywood genius top to bottom which is long gone. But because it's about this old time and about raw black and white issues (often), the film and the filming are really appropriate. The whole thing just fits, and beautifully.And I mean beautiful. As rugged as it all is--the landscape as well as the beards, all very real--the movie is lyrically filmed. The story is told with visual clarity. And the script, speaking of story, is sophisticated and believable. In all, under the direction of legend John Huston, this is a spot on terrific movie.Of course, there are two actors who are just amazing in their roles (and a third, Tim Holt, who is just fine, if not stellar). I mean of course Walter Huston, who nearly steals the show in every scene. He's a character, but not a caricature. His wisdom--real wisdom, based on smart observation over decades of experience--is sterling. Great stuff, well put. And of course he's the father of the director, which is a fun, and slightly Freudian twist. He gives one of the great performances of the decade.Humphrey Bogart is not far behind, actually. If you like him in Maltese Falcon or Casablanca, you'll be surprised at first by the scruffy, raw character played here. But it's clear-headed, brilliantly delivered Bogart all the way, and a joy to watch him really act. See it for him, too.Then there is the story itself, which is as important now as ever. That is, what matters in life? And what is the price to pay to get it? It's all rather bold and emotional even though it's delivered by some rough guys out of money prospecting in the wilderness of Mexico.Are there downsides here? I suppose. You certainly can wonder about the way the Mexicans--good ones and banditos both--are portrayed. I think it's not bad, tinged with clichés, of course, but in Spanish without translation or stilted half-English, so it's the real thing. And no subtitles. Nicely done for an early Hollywood affair. Huston, the son, the director, if you don't know, is famous for doing things raw and right and slightly off the charts. He is making a commercial film, to be sure, but it has many small aspects that are just not pandering to anyone. This makes it work.I'm sure to some this is a masterpiece. I'm giving that some thought. See it.",False
13,7,Good old movie,sycul,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie won some prizes in 1948 but I'm surprised Humphrey Bogart hasn't got even a nomination. I'd take the risk of saying that this was Humphrey Bogard's best performance in his life (okay, maybe the best one was in Casablanca). The movie is about how gold can change a poor but winsome man into a thorough-paced rascal. Three homeless guys decide to make money by digging for gold in Sierra Madre. In the beginning they are like brothers, help each-other, they work together hard, fight against the ruthless nature and Mexican bandits. But as the weight of gold is rising they start to suspect each-other stealing the other's share of gold... Recommendation: don't bother that this is a black and white, old movie, watch it!",False

For the acting alone - and for Walter Huston - I would give it five stars but no stars for anything else.Maybe it's just me, but watching a paranoid, greedy, whiny person act nasty for an hour toward two innocent good guys is is not my idea of entertainment, whether it's Humphrey Bogart (here, as ""Fred C. Dobbs"") or Elmer Fudd playing the lead.The only actor I enjoyed watching was Huston, which is no surprise. I always found him fascinating in whoever he played on film.Then again, I might have put up with this story better had it been a little shorter, but 120 minutes of this was too much. I really believe this is one of those movies that critics have made it far more than it really is, meaning vastly overrated. I like Bogart in many films, but not here.",True

16,8,"""It's a great joke played on us by the lord, fate, nature or whatever""",Steffi_P,n/a,15/08/2025,"Film noir takes a Mexican holiday in this gritty adventure from John Huston. Pessimistic and full of irony, yet with a sense of adventure and a moralist edge to it, this is typical Huston material.Huston insisted on shooting on location in Mexico, which riled up studio executives no end, but it paid off in the quality of the picture. Treasure of the Sierra Madre would have really suffered in the canned air of a studio. By using the real thing, he perfectly achieves the stark and dusty atmosphere of the poverty riddled Mexican city in the earliest scenes. The sense of scale and grandeur of the mountains in the main part of the film is also very important in achieving the right effect.Huston's background was in fine art, and it's at this point in his career as a director that it really starts to show. The use of lighting is painterly in a way that is almost impossible to achieve in black and white  particularly in the scene in the peasant village which looks almost biblical. Huston also has this unique style of framing, whereby he uses figures in the foreground and background to give the effect of a close-up and a mid-shot simultaneously. It's a look that is totally at odds with anything else produced in Hollywood at that time.Actor wise, Treasure of the Sierra Madre turns the clock back to the 1930s, putting the director's father Walter Huston in a starring role, and casting Humphrey Bogart as a seedy villain. The cast is rounded off by the too-little-seen Tim Holt. All three of them are spot on. The spry old prospector is a role Huston senior seems to have been waiting to play all his life. Bogart is also great playing the sort of character he made his name with a decade earlier. Also worth a mention is Mexican actor Alfonso Bedoya who gives what is for this era an incredibly naturalistic performance as the bandit leader.Huston's forte was in his cinematography, his shot composition and the rhythm of his films, not so much in his handling of action or actors, which is why his pictures tend to be a bit hit and miss. This one is a hit though, thanks to the strength of its story and the quality of the cast, not to mention Huston's persistence for authenticity. Not my absolute favourite of his work, but certainly one of the best.",False
17,8,Bogart and the Stinking Badges,gavin6942,n/a,15/08/2025,"Two penniless Americans (Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt) during the 1920s in Mexico join with an old-timer (Walter Huston, the director's father) to prospect for gold. The old-timer accurately predicts trouble, but is willing to go anyway. The film is fictional, but presents a very realistic scenario: By the 1920s the violence of the Mexican Revolution had largely subsided, although scattered gangs of bandits continued to terrorize the countryside. The newly established post-revolution government relied on the effective, but ruthless, Federal Police, commonly known as the Federales, to patrol remote areas and dispose of the bandits. Foreigners, like the three American prospectors, were at very real risk of being killed by the bandits if their paths crossed. The bandits, likewise, were given little more than a ""last cigarette"" by the army units after capture, even having to dig their own graves first.The film shows the Americans doing just about anything for money: drilling oil, digging for gold, begging and more. And once gold comes into the picture, the men who once claimed they were not greedy see things differently. Bogart actually goes mad, after he gets greedy and paranoid... during which he encounters a gila monster! The most memorable scene of this film involves the bandits, who don't need any ""stinking badges"". While the line is much more quotable in ""Blazing Saddles"", we couldn't have ""Blazing Saddles"" (or ""UHF"") without this film... just about everyone, even those who never saw or heard of ""Sierra Madre"", knows the badges line.Humphrey Bogart's best film is probably ""Casablanca"", but this one features him in a nice, rough exterior. Yes, sometimes leading men have beards and are covered in dirt. Pretty boys do not stay pretty boys after digging in the hills, or at least that wouldn't be realistic. This film does a fine job trying to ""keep it real"", so we have to commend Huston not only on his directing, but his wonderful location scouting.",False
18,10,An excellent film,AppleBlossom,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Treasure Of The Sierra MadreCertainly a consuming piece of cinematic achievement. I was delighted in viewing this film, especially when you have the talents of Bogart, Holt and Huston..oh what abilities or should I say gifts'.My eyes never strayed from the screen, I couldn't take the risk of missing one second of this  tremendous adventure/drama film. Bogart played the character Fred C. Dobbs' so convincingly, it doesn't surprise me though he was at his career peak. It was  like his portrayal of Lt. Comdr. Philip Francis Queeg'  in `The Caine Mutiny'  surely no one would disagree he carried the part to it's limit.The B & W format gave an added depth and the direction by John Huston (as usual) was nothing more then what I would expect from an accredited director like him. I was amused to see a very young Robert Blake in the role of the boy selling lottery tickets and the brief appearance of Bruce Bennett as James Cody'. whom starred with Bogie in `Sahara' several years prior. Another reliable support actor was  Alfonso Bedoya as Gold Hat' my fondest memory of any of his acting roles must be `The Big Country' in 1958.Walter Huston stood out with his performance, this was the first time I've had the privilege to watch him in a film role. His portrayal was astounding..and the script he had to work with was a treat to hear.Another funny point I want to point out, I don't know why I kept comparing Tim Holt to John Derek. In some of the scenes his appearance and voice were so similar to Derek's it was uncanny. I'm probably the only one who thinks this, but I can't dismiss the similarities (to me anyway).The plot was an interesting one, one that slowly draws you in until you can't stop watching. I really enjoyed `The Treasure Of Sierra Madre' certainly a must see' filmhighly recommended.",False
19,10,Unbeatable.,rmax304823,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI wish I knew who B. Traven was. He wrote the novel this film is based on, and it's a good read. There are stories that he was a German. Maybe he was. The dialogue has little German touches in it. Traven surely lived in modest circumstances in Mexico, the details and dynamics of run-down hotels being far too accurate to have been made up in a comfortable armchair.But it's not really important. Huston and his cast and crew have turned the novel into a movie that is as good as anything likely to show up on the screen. It's an astounding achievement. I can't even begin to list the moments that stamp themselves indelibly into one's memory, but I will mention one, just en passant, so to speak. After killing his partner and friend, Bogart lies down next to a fire and tries to go to sleep. He talks to himself dismissively about ""conscience"" and how it only bothers you if you let it, and the fake, sulfurous fire blazes up higher and higher between the actor and the camera until he seems to be consumed by the flame.Alfonso Bedoya. He made a few other movies but nothing resembling this one. What lines he is given!""Aww, come on. Throw that old iron over here.""""There's a good business for Jew.""And the unforgettable ""batches,""which doesn't need repeating.It is surely one of Huston's best films. A lesser director could have ruined the novel's plot. But Huston adds his own touches. Cody is killed, shot through the neck, and the old man reads a letter from his wife, retrieved from Cody's pocket. But -- he doesn't know how to read big words!So Curtin takes the letter and reads it. It's not just a directorial flash in the pan, because the scene resonates at the end of the movie when Curtin rides off to meet Cody's wife in the blossom-blooming peach orchard. What I mean is that the letter-reading scene is there for a larger purpose than simply adding to our appreciation of the characters at that particular moment.The fight with Pat in the cantina. Absolutely nothing happens the way it had always happened in previous movies. Huston stages it in a way that an artist would think of. In all movies before this one, fights involved (1) a general melee in which no one wins or loses, or (2) one clip on the jaw and the guy is unconscious.Here, MacCormack, the heavy, done very nicely by Barton Maclaine, abruptly bashes one guy over the head with a bottle of booze and socks the other one. Both victims crumple. But somebody grabs Pat's legs as he walks towards the door. More blows. Bodies slump to the floor and they have a hell of a time getting back up on their feet. More blows. Pat is finally beaten to the floor and he's not unconscious. ""Okay. Enough, fellas. I'm beat. I can't see."" Bogart and Tim Holt take only the money that is owing to them, and Curtin (Holt) comes up with, ""Let's beat it before the law arrives."" Before the law arrives. That's straight out of Traven's novel and is one of the reasons people believe he wasn't that familiar with the English language. Not that it doesn't fit -- but the use of ""arrives"" is just a tad formal.I could go on listing one scene after another that is simply outstanding. I watched this repeatedly with my ten year old kid, Josh, who finally memorized almost every word of the script. I showed it in classes in psychology at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina as an almost flawless depiction of an ego defense mechanism called ""projection."" The Marines loved it. I loved it. My kid loved it. John Simon loved it. Rush Limbaugh loved it. Martha Stewart loved it. Rachel Maddow loved it. Napoleon Bonaparte loved it. Moses loved it. Lenin loved it. St. Peter, when not attending the pearly gates, watches it on cable TV. (No commercials.) Everybody loves it -- and for good reasons.",True
20,8,There's Gold in Them There Hills...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tampico sets the scene for the start of speculation, Fred C. Dobbs is out of cash and his luck is in cessation, but an encounter in flophouse, and big dreams emerge and arouse, as a plan is born with Howard, and a fellow who's called Curtin. Into hills laden with gold, our companions then embark, finding seams that come alive with golden riches to impart, building up substantial fortune, thinking soon they will be tycoons, but there's one who's trust is waning and has sores that start to smart. The journey back becomes a challenge to them all, as one by one the group is scattered, battered, stalled, will their work be well rewarded, will endeavours all be thwarted, either way, you will be engaged, and quite possibly enthralled.Bogarts best performance.",False
21,n/a,All that glitters is not gold,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is one of those great old movies that is worth a repeat viewing every now and again in a person's life. Sure, much of the acting and dialog have gotten corny and dated over the years, and I agree with one of the previous commenters who said that Bogart's acting seems very forced - like he's obviously just reading lines from script. Be that as it may, the story that is told here is every bit as important and thought provoking as something from the Bible. Throughout the film there is a spot-on wisdom about man and his endless quest for wealth (in this case, gold). I always come away from this movie feeling secure in my belief that in life you just can't have it all, and all that glitters is not gold (i.e. there are things in life more important than money).Since this movie was largely about lost fortunes (literally ""dust in the wind"" if you think about the end sequence), it must have made quite an impression on audiences back in the forties when it was released. I'm sure more than a few viewers back then still had painful memories of catastrophic losses caused by the 1929 stock market crash and the ensuing Depression of the 1930's. Also, many people lost a lot in the war years that followed, and which predated this movie by just a few years.That's why I think this movie qualifies for repeat viewings, because just think how appropriate this wisdom is for our current generation of people: just consider the losses from, say, the stock market crash of 2000, the events of September 11th, and of course we just witnessed the horrific losses caused by the Asian tsunami... the cycle repeats. Fortunes come and go, gold is often times nothing but dust in the wind, but life goes on and so man must go on. That's what this movie says to me whenever I see it.",True
22,7,Great performance in an average movie,Groverdox,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" is an overrated and overlong Hollywood classic given real juice by its star performance.Bogart is Fred C. Dobbs, a flea-bitten American scavenger in Mexico, who gets the idea of digging for gold in the mountains. Right from the beginning, we see where it's heading: a morality tale about the destructive power of greed. But Bogart, with his generally impassive face but wild, shining eyes, starts going crazy with paranoia, and his descent into madness is captivating.Too bad the movie keeps getting in his way. A subplot about bandits, who utter the famous misquote about ""steenkin' badges"", just feels like a distraction, and the movie goes on far too long.",True
23,10,A great tale about the darker side of human nature...,planktonrules,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are already a lot of reviews for this film and it's in the Top 250 list on IMDb, so I don't feel quite as much need to talk about his film in great depth--after all, it's all been pretty much said. This is an exceptional film for many reasons--most notably because it looks into the darker side of human nature--something you don't often see in films during this era.The film begins in Mexico. Two Americans (Tim Holt and Humphrey Bogart) are stranded there and haven't a peso between them. Their needs are few--they just want to get enough to buy a meal and find a place to flop. Through this first portion of the film, both men seem like decent enough sorts and the audience tends to empathize with them--even when they are involved in a vicious brawl with Barton MacLane--you feel the guy has it coming when the two give him a beating.Later, however, their prospects change when they hit on the idea of hooking up with an old coot (Walter Huston) who seems to know a lot about gold mining. The three take off for the Mexican wilderness--and much like the story ""Heart of Darkness"", the good and bad within them is slowly revealed--all brought about by greed.What I particularly liked about this film is what a great professional Humphrey Bogart was. His character was extremely flawed and later in the film he was very easy to hate. Many stars of the day probably wouldn't have accepted this less role of a less than honorable man. Nor, I think, they would have been so willing to play a guy who wasn't all that macho.Apart from Bogart, the acting all around was very good, the script exciting and insightful and the direction just dandy. One of the best films of the era.",True
24,6,Shows the evil in the heart of man,HotToastyRag,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is John Huston's baby. He adapted the novel for the screen, directed it, enjoyed a cameo, and cast his father in the leading role. For his hard work, he was rewarded with a darling photo opportunity the following Oscars ceremony when he and his father received matching statuettes. It really was impossible not to give Walter Huston the Oscar that year, since he was the sentimental favorite, his leading role had been relegated to the supporting category so as to not compete with Hamlet, and he was acting under his son's direction. Still, if you're at all familiar with Walter's breadth of work, you'll be saddened that he got his Oscar for this movie.Walter stars as an old-timer who tells two down-and-out bums, Humphrey Bogart and Tim Holt, about his experience with gold digging. Although the two declare they'd never get greedy if they struck gold, Walter says he's seen how riches changes a man. As the three shake hands and agree to hunt the mountains for gold, Walter's eye twinkles, as if he knows something the others don't. Humphrey proves his twinkle right when he shows his true colors and turns into a greedy, violent, paranoid villain. When you watch this movie, get ready to hate Humphrey Bogart; it might be a good idea to have The African Queen ready to restore your good feelings. He plays such a terrible person in this movie, with a combination of stupidity and selfishness that makes him painfully real.John Huston's careful eye shines as he frames his shots with clever use of lighting and depth, and as he keeps up a sense of suspense during a film with a running time of over two hours. I don't really know why the two famous clips from this film are Walter's shuffling dance and ""We don't need to show you any stinkin' badges!"" when there were plenty of other good scenes to immortalize, like the unexpected and exhaustive fistfight in the beginning of the film.Huston fans, either one, will probably feel the need to watch this classic, and while it is entertaining, it's not for everyone. It shows the evil in the heart of man, and besides Walter's twinkling eye and boisterous laugh, the rest of the movie is very dark.",False
25,3,not everything that's old has aged well,chuck-526,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI realize I'm swimming against the tide, big-time, and so am somewhat reluctant to even say anything. But the truth is this film did not speak to me. Perhaps it's my age (about 60) or the film's age (about 65); I'm in the habit of expecting a little more subtlety. I approached this film in a straightforward way expecting a visceral experience, and I was disappointed. Perhaps instead I should have approached this film intellectually as a bit of film history. Why didn't I like it? -- 1) it seemed ""corny"", 2) the stereotyping seemed ridiculous, and 3) portrayal of a foreign culture was markedly uneven.One of the supposed features often touted is how well Humphrey Bogart portrays the stages of a character slowly going mad. But what struck me was what we'd call nowadays ""overacting"" or maybe even ""being melodramatic"". Much of this is due to the scripted dialog rather than to Bogart: the character's sudden ruminations about ""guilt"" and ""conscience"" with no earlier referents felt obligatory and stagy ...sort of like walking into the last act of Shakespeare's Macbeth. The mise-en-scene didn't help either: his character disappearing into -and appearing to be consumed by- the flames of a fire was a little too obvious.I groaned when the first Mexican bandits appeared with two bandoleers of bullets crossed over their chest, effectively screaming ""bandit uniform"". Some later bandits avoided that stereotype; instead they had an awful lot of of holes in their clothes and even multiple holes in their hat. Portraying _all_ bandits as overly macho, not valuing life very much, and not very smart felt too simplistic.There are many good points of sensitivity to a foreign culture: long stretches of the actors speaking Spanish without much translation, knowledge of the value of different foreign coins, slightly different barbershop rituals, intimate familiarity with the ways of the local Indians, and even some plot points hinging on detailed knowledge of the ways of others. But at the same time there were several glaring exceptions. Indigenous people are stumped by a simple medical issue, and their automatic reaction is to seek help form a ""white man"". (Dr. Livingston anyone?) The medical help the white man offers is extremely simplistic, yet it's enough to get the job done and to thoroughly bamboozle folks. The proceedings are observed by a large tight circle of people, so large it's clearly everyone in the whole Indian village. The white man is rewarded not in any realistic Indian way, but rather with our own silly image of almost-heaven: being placed in a hammock and hand fed fruits by reverent attendants. (What, no harp?) And the bandits don't realize the ""sand"" is actually gold ...which of course is nonsense.",True

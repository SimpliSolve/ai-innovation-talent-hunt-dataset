1,5,"Rambling, YouTube Quality",heyleigh921,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm reviewing this film, not making any commentary on the state of the country/world, which is NOT a review on any film. That being said, I didn't hate this ""documentary"" but it didn't do what I thought it would. It fell short of basic quality expectations and seemed more like a long YouTube video at best and a rushed, poorly researched history paper at worst. There was a lot of information given that has been told elsewhere but here, it was jumbled together with no real cohesion. Yes, I'm Black and actually had high hopes for this film but I can't get behind the low quality of its narration and presentation. I get that the budget may not have been there, but you don't need any budget to make a decent, coherent film. This was not it, sadly.",False
2,1,Laughably false,fambizzsales,n/a,16/08/2025,"The filmmaker and anyone taking this so-called ""documentary"" seriously needs to see how Black people in other nations live. Take your pick, it doesn't matter, Black Americans have it the easiest. I served in the Army, am Black myself, and have seen the horrors that leaders in African nations have inflicted on their people. I honestly feel that the youth of all colors is spoiled rotten these days and needs a reality check. They really have no clue how good they have it.",False

4,10,Great watch real people real stories,dewilliams30,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary. One of the best I've seen because of the real voices from real people. These moments in this documentary has strengthened our race of people. Sad, angered, frustrated yes but we are stronger because of all of the humanly emotions it has dragged us through. These are our truths and theirs... some rather cringe, cry, feel guilty vs acknowledging we are all still here dealing with the white supremacy ideologies of this society . These moments in time aren't that long ago... we are still going through this today. We know our histories and if they can celebrate the ones they're proud of they should be man and woman enough to be educated on the ones they're ashamed of.",False
5,10,Unflinching Facts about America,desjours,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a superbly made and thoroughly informative documentary which many white occupiers of this country want to look away from, deny, react in anger or blame their victims.In 2022 we see parallels of 1962 white violence, racism and aggression toward Black Americans. From police terrorism, negative media portrayals and concerted white effort to maintain white european dominance in America.By 2045 this nation will be once again, as it was in the beginning, a Brown majority country and too many are kicking and screaming to avoid it's inevitability.. Instead of taking their own advice: Learn to assimilate. And evolve.",False

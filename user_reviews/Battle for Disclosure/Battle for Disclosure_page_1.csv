1,5,Same old story,cammic,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am truly over all these documentaries about the government cover ups of UAP's.They all have the same story with generally the same ""experts"" or ""retired personnel "" who have all the evidence.....but they don't! If just one of them could provide any truly verifiable evidence about any government ""conspiracy"" to cover up UAP's....they would be a start.This documentary is just one person after another telling stories without any proof and it's nothing we have not heard a thousand times before.Surely after all these years and with modern technologies available someone could produce any evidence of cover ups or reasons why any government would keep this from the public....then show it snd prove it.After 30mins I was entitely bored and not one person said anything I had not heard before.",False
2,2,Amateur Hour,xmzptsx,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was super disappointing that I actually spent the money on renting this documentary. I had a hunch But decided to give it a try as the subject matter is very important right now, and I have a lot of respect for several speakers in this documentary if you can call it that.Talking heads with terrible B Roll and awful sound design. The subject is important but this was stitched together with minimal effort for maximum return.Felt like a I was watching a school project.It's a shame to watch such important information get washed down with such a high cheese factor.Oh well, can't win them all.",False
3,1,Greer is his own worst enemy,pjgilcrest,n/a,15/08/2025,"When he started calling out Grusch for wanting to sell books I turned it off.Look, I don't know who is right, if anyone, butnthebfact Greer called grusch a grifter is just too much projection for me. He's jealous he's not the center of attention.It sucks because Greer does do a lot of good for the discussion, but he's hamstrings by his own need for attention. Shameful.If he really cared he'd be supportive of others going after the same goal, but nah, he needs it to be him in the center of it all. Doesn't help that he charges thousands of dollars for his ""retreats."" Greer, you let me down sir.",False
4,1,"Shame On You, Dr. Greer",grimmfilment,n/a,15/08/2025,"The only takeaway from this documentary is the disgraceful statements from Dr. Greer.Here is a man who has spent thirty years of his life studying the UFO phenomena. A physician who has no formal education in any field relevant to the study of these vehicles, he is no different than any other guy on the internet fascinated by the subject.And yet he has the audacity to stand in front of the camera and belittle a vetted ""beyond reproach"" decorated veteran who has held positions that granted him insight and access to information Greer can only dream of. Painting Grusch like some little kid who stumbled upon something he wasn't supposed to see and is now chasing book deals and profit over disclosure, I mean, what? Why? What possible reason could a man who has obsessed about UFO's most of his adult life have to do that?The only reason that makes sense is sheer and unadulterated jealousy that there are far more qualified people with genuine insider knowledge taking the spotlight over a subject he has been chasing his whole life.You should be ashamed of yourself. You should be ashamed for doing the very thing the people have been doing to individuals who have been exposed to unexplained phenomena since the 40's, trying to smear them in the eyes of your audience to take away their credibility all the while purporting that you're chasing the truth.The irony is, Grusch and his ilk did more to bring this subject to the spotlight of the general public, mainstream media and the politicians than you ever have nor ever will.Shame on you, Dr. Greer. Shame on you.",False
5,9,Very informative. Dr Greer doesn't Disappointed.,tylerdonoghue33,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was good, very informative and intriguing but we don't learn anything new. His last film The Lost Century is great! Overall, until there is information that hasn't been regurgitated multiple ways over different films, I no longer get excited about these releases. It was interesting to watch the Congress get involved and really cool to know my home state Representative (R) Tim Burchett has taken such a keen interest in this subject. His insights in this film are really the only things I haven't necessarily heard yet, and I am glad to have Congressman Burchett (R TN)so involved.",False
6,1,Nothing New,dytdnrvb,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having Billy Carson hurt your credibility. He tells tall tales without anything to back up his claims. We need great video and pictures. Come on and if you wanted to get the information out due to life and death then I did I pay??? I expected more from Greer and something new. I was hopeful with Shawn Ryan, he is a great guy. We just need the truth to get out there. Release the information. At this point if you do have stuff you sure are making every dollar off of this I formation that you say have been hurt or even gone missing. I think you owe it to the American people and the victims to get the information out. I am calling on you if you have anything to convince us then release it.",False
7,10,Wake up everyone. Especially the American people.,spencers-56702,n/a,15/08/2025,"The 4 reviewers on here right now go back to the books. Wake up and investigate/study more. To the brain reviewer talking about relativity, Einstein etc. Watch military videos please of the orbs, plasma orbs etc etc etc. SO much is out there regarding pics and videos that we dont know ANYTHING about gravity etc. BUT select few - black sites containing reversed engineered technology have it figured out. To the rest of the reviewers, proof is already out there. Again, pictures, military videos etc etc etc. Wakeup. Its the TECHNOLOGY thats hidden. Goodbye American energy sector. Goodbye America being a superpower. Free energy. Look it up folks. This is why its all classified as NATIONAL SECURITY. Its not the aliens. Its the TECHNOLOGY they dont want out. Because we ALL become the SAME. NO superpower country. America wont allow that to happen. As we all know.....power and money RULE the world. PERIOD. So yes.....its the 'same ol' story. But more whistleblowers. I guess ALL these whistleblowers are making up one BIG lie !!! Lol.Wakeup everyone. We need to PHYSICALLY start a civil war inside America. And go into these black sites FULL automatics firing. THATS the only way of getting proof we need. Im in. Sign me up.Watch out everyone. All the drones happening now. Here it comes. Another FALSE FLAG OPERATION. An alien invasion. Ohhhhh scary. Wakeup people. Its only going to get worse in the skies. Remember all this that you just read. Good luck.",False
8,3,Isaac Newtons principles of universal gravitation..,patrikperssonp,n/a,15/08/2025,"..in which he postulated that gravity was an.outside force travelling by means that was hitherto.unknown, would have allowed for, atleast theoretically, anti-gravity.However, Albert Einsteins theory of general relativity makes no such absurd allowances, because space and time is no longer distinguishable from.eachother.SpaceTimeâ„¢ is the four-dimensional, all encompassing, invisible fabric that matter and energy warpes not unlike how a bowling ball warps a trampolin mat and therefore there can be no anti, in front of matter.Since Einstein did predict gravitational waves exactly 100 years before scientists finally measured them and proved him right, aswell as him being an outspoken atheist, Ill go with him on this one.I gave this movie three stars, it was hilarious, albeit it was full of contradictions neither Einstein or Newton, if somehow raised from the dead, wouldnt.wrinkle their nose at.",False

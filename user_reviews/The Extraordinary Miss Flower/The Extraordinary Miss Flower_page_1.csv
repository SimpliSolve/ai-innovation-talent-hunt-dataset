1,7,"Interesting, if not extraordinary",Lincsobserver,n/a,16/08/2025,"Geraldine Flower was an Australian woman, born in 1947, who emigrated to England, where she worked as a secretary, then a journalist. In the course of her working life she had the opportunity to travel widely, and accumulated a number of lovers and admirers, (we're probably talking about the late 60s, early 70s, so a fairly permissive era). Her letters were found stored in a suitcase, following her death. The film illustrates her story by reading out some of these letters, and setting others in the form of songs. She clearly had an interesting life, if not a particularly extraordinary one, and the passion expressed in the prose suggests she must have been both very beautiful, and had an engaging personality. One or two of the songs capture an emotional episode very well, but a number of them seem rather bland. It's an interesting way to tell the story of someone's life, even if the film may not linger in the memory too long.",False

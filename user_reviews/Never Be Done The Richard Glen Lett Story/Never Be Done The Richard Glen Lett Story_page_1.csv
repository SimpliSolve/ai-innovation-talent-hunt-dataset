1,10,Raw. Intimate. Untouched. Train Crash Survivor Story,ncorsocvc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Richard walks the tightrope of insanity in an attempt to keep from falling into the pits of alcoholic despair and homelessness. His daughter and his comedy seem to be the last thread of hope in an otherwise grave and hopeless situation. But even those cannot save him from fate. With the writing literally on the wall for Richard he still cannot see the problem (himself) let alone any solution. In an attempt to cling to the last rung of society, he feels he is unqualified to even participate in Alcoholics Anonymous. Banished from comedy clubs, kicked out of his apartment, we actually get to watch Richard bottom out. It is a rare glimpse of the train actually coming off the tracks. This rock bottom however becomes the solid foundation which Richard begins to rebuild his life. This humble redemption story is raw, heart felt, and is a fascinating look at the life of Richard Lett. Spectacular journey!",False
2,10,"An unflinching look at depths of addiction, with redemption.",thepurplepick,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of those documentaries, like Hoop Dreams, where I found myself marveling that the filmmaker was there as extraordinary events played out. It's pretty rare to get to witness someone sink to the depths of alcoholism, much less to come out the other side, changed. As a culture, we have a long way to go to understand what addiction is, where it comes from, and how it plays out, and what any of us can do to support addicts. This doc provides a window into a story that's played out by millions of people every day. Whether you're an addict or not, we all benefit from the compassion this story elicits.",False
3,10,Real. Raw. Redeeming. Difficult. Epic.,ChelseaMee,n/a,16/08/2025,"This story is powerful, honest, real, raw, and painful to watch at times (in the best way possible). Watching this man's fall, and then see him stand back up is a refreshing look at redemption, and a step towards changing the stigma of addiction and alcoholism. I respect that Roy Tighe remained strong in filming Richard without stealing his bottom from him; Roy kept a boundary there which helped Richard in the long run. Seeing who Richard is now gives hope to those who are still sick and suffering from this disease, showing that there IS a way out.",False

5,10,A timely film with a timeless theme,burtbrooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a time when ""cancel culture"" is at its peak, this film serves as a welcome reminder that we still have room for redemption and forgiveness in our society. I didn't know who Richard Lett was before this film, but don't let that stop you from checking out this prolific documentary.You learn that Richard is a Canadian comedian who built a career on both his sharp wit and infamous irreverence. We are introduced to him at a time when both his professional and personal life are spiraling out of his control. The documentary pulls no punches and never hides from the problematic nature of its main subject. Instead it puts all his flaws on display and lets you decide on how to feel about this complicated man.The filmmakers do an exceptional job of navigating the mix of archival footage and the in-person raw follow-along they did with Richard. This sets up such a wonderful counterweight to the footage they present at the end. We even watch as the director, Roy Tighe, is sucked into the story himself and must navigate some tense moments while continuing to remain impartial. This only serves to elevate the film as we see him become increasingly invested in Richard's story.I don't want to say much more for fear of spoiling the film for you, but (just as the title implies) the journey doesn't end there. We get to see what happens when you never give up on hope and work towards changing yourself for the better. Kudos to all those involved.",False

8,8,A sobering Documentary,valleyjohn,n/a,16/08/2025,"""it's easier to get forgiveness than permission ""These are the words of Richard Lett back in 2009 . That's was his excuse to be a horrible man and boy was he horrible .
He lost his friend's , who got barred from virtually all the comedy clubs so he couldn't work and and he fell out with not only the audiences but his fellow comedians. Why was he so nasty?Drink .Richard Lett is a lucky man . My dad died from being an alcoholic at the age of 48 but Richard got a second chance and he took it with both hands .This is the Story of his self destruction to his redemption and it's a fascinating watch .It's amazing the transformation from a drunk Richard to a Sober one and it probably answered a few questions about my old man and why he acted like he did under the influence.Recommended",False
9,10,Must See!,ylsalto,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary exceeded my expectations! Most people have no idea what it's like to live with an addiction and this film gives us a raw, honest glimpse into Richard Glen Lett's journey. This is an important film because there are so many people battling addiction and/or mental health issues; those who've never lived through it easily judge or even worse, don't give them a second thought. Roy Tigue did an amazing job showing us Richard's journey and did not let him be forgotten.",False
10,10,Very inspiring!,jeromy-wensley,n/a,16/08/2025,"The director did a wonderful job introducing the main character. I very much felt as though I knew Richard Let. I, like Richard, can very much identify with having a bit of success, followed by struggling with the demon's brought forth by alcoholism. The trials and tribulations that alcohol can prompt are mind-boggling: Homelessness, chaos, and recklessness are three words that come to mind.In my opinion, if you know of anyone or are a person who has dealt with these same circumstances, this documentary is a must-see.",False
11,10,A raw journey,dynastybrothers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Never Be Done is a roller-coaster ride of emotions that I cannot find all the words to explain. From heartbreaking moments to heartfelt, the raw journey is captured with every moment within the film which strikes the heart. A definite must watch.",False
12,10,True North Talent!,martybcox,n/a,16/08/2025,"A unique venture into the heart of mental health and addiction, all told through the lens and talent of first time Canadian documentary film Director, Roy Tighe. I loved that it wasn't narrated but that the story told itself...the ugly truth and all.",False
13,8,"The journey of a man from addiction to sobriety, and all that comes with that",jonnydawson,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary depicts well how a man can be caught up in the turmoil that comes with addiction and completely unaware of how to escape from it, but with a lot of perseverance and the help and love of others can come out the other side. I had never heard of Richard Lett's comedy before watching this documentary and haven't had a chance to check out any of his stuff yet. The beginning of the documentary shows us a comedian who's comedy is nasty in nature, angry at its core. Whilst personally I do often find this comedy entertaining, Richard Lett pushed it to its boundaries and often slightly beyond them. A comedian is always funniest when the audience is laughing along with them, and that is tough to do when the comedian is as angry as Lett is at the beginning of the documentary. Because of this, and due to not having researched the documentary much before watching, I thought that I wasn't going to enjoy the rest of the film. However, before long the documentary shows how tumultuous Lett's life is due to his alcoholism. He draws all over the walls in his apartment, is vile to friends and audience members. This is clearly all trying to escape the fact that he hates himself, something that the documentary depicts very well. After seeing Lett's life fall completely apart, getting kicked out of his apartment and becoming homeless, we then see him addressing his alcoholism, which leads him to fix relationships with people, and to learn to care for himself. The end of the documentary we see the film makers return to visit Lett after 7 years of sobriety, and see him much happier and healthier than before, having a much more positive impact on those around him. The documentary perfectly captures all three sections of Lett's recovery, in the depths of addiction, seeking and taking part in recovery and then down the line rebuilding his life. The documentary ends with a piece from one of Lett's post-adiction comedy shows and shows us that he can be just as funny as he was in the beginning of the documentary, without hating on the world. More fascinatingly though it shows Lett as more of an artist than a stand-up comedian. Throughout the documentary we see Lett transition from textbook stand-up (man with mic pacing the stage), to singing a song when he finishes at the reovery centre, to finally building an artistic show. The boy that Lett described himself as, loving theatre and performing, is allowed to blossom by escaping his addiction and learning to love himself.",True
14,10,"Gripping, raw, incredibly done",karenmercure,n/a,16/08/2025,"A powerful story that is simultaneously heartbreaking and uplifting; the humour and humility balance the rawness and dark, painful moments. It's an honest look at a man's highs and lows - the journey is gripping and sincere. I particularly enjoyed the quick glimpse of Richard & Graeme's smooth handshake near the end (relatable). Incredible documentary!",False

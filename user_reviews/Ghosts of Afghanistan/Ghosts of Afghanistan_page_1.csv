1,9,A Thoroughly Evenhanded Documentary,ijiwaru_sensei,n/a,16/08/2025,Julian Sher and Graeme Smith present a documentary that is at once personal and fair in its portrayal of the continuing turmoil in Afghanistan. The filmmakers manage to report objectively without taking sides or relying on talking points.The film presents interviews with a wide swath of Afghans from government leaders to people providing health services for the poor to college students to Taliban leaders to women living in Taliban controlled areas. No punches are pulled. No agenda is force fed. Worth a watch.,False

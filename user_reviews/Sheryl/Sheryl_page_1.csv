1,7,Interesting but could have been better.,richy-782-441259,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Sheryl's music, but I felt this was whitewashed and didn't give us a realistic look at her life. It felt completely controlled by Sheryl, doing most of the talking herself. There were tidbits of insight into the industry and I respect her for standing up for herself. But there were no real personal revelations at all. I wouldn't call this a documentary. More of a pat on the back by Sheryl and her friends.",False
2,7,If it make you happy...,ThatMonkey,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a story I honestly have wanted to hear for years. From the first time I heard Leaving Las Vegas more than 25 years ago, I knew I was going to enjoy her catalog. I've read up, watched interviews, but this give a great picture of how her career came to be. Ironically, they didn't talk much about Michael Jackson, but they talked enough. No mention of her many backing vocals for the likes of Don Henley.I think what I found most fascinating was the Lance Armstrong relationship. Again, it didn't take much conversation, she was just straight forward and to the point. No mention of Kid Rock, but again, it was her story to tell.I like Sheryl, but have long left the bandwagon, once she went more country and honkytonk, it just wasn't for me. Her first two albums are classics in my catalog and most like the reason she still draws a crowd today. I think she is far more complicated than she wants anyone to know, but I respect her privacy.",False
3,6,VIEWS ON FILM review of Sheryl,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler2022's Sheryl had its first screening in March of this year. It's a documentary about Sheryl Crow, a musician out of a small Missouri town who managed to sell over 50 million albums worldwide. If your a Sheryl Crow fan (I dug her 90s stuff), then this is a harmless docu clocking in at 94 minutes. ""If It Makes You Happy"" well you might as well see it. Natch.Sheryl portrays Sheryl Crow as self-made, persevered, and female empowered. I also like that she was a huge music fan at a very early age (like myself). Heck, it's not everyday that a background singer for Michael Jackson goes on to make such a huge dent in the world of folk and country rock. Man during that Bad tour Crow had some really spritz-y hair.Sheryl is a standard documentary but to its credit, it's pretty speedy and unhesitating in its approach. There's the usual archive footage, interviews from colleagues, friends, and family (I never knew Crow was buds with Laura Dern), and the voice of Sheryl Crow herself. My only question is why wasn't Kid Rock and Eric Clapton mentioned? I mean she was close acquaintances with those guys too.Distributed by Showtime Networks and chronicling Crow's bouts with depression and/or breast cancer, Sheryl has good intentions but at the same time, is a little self-indulgent. Yes Sheryl Crow can sing and play but she hasn't had a bonafide hit in over twenty years (her last LP sold a little over 49,000 copies). Could Sheryl be a ploy to jump-start Sheryl Crow's already recluse career that seems anachronistic with today's musical world? Possibly. Is Sheryl perhaps a postmark to the end of one's metier that has seen at least 7 Top twenty Hits and five platinum albums? Maybe. Sheryl isn't a bad documentary but you have to wonder, was ""the first cut the deepest?"" Sigh.",True
4,6,"Well produced, but could be much better",bbewnylorac,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis doco has a lot going for it. It is beautifully edited and filmed, and obviously Sheryl Crow opened her life up for it. Her parents in Missouri are adorably normal. She has some amazing friends - musicians, engineers, agents. She is incredibly musically talented - accomplished in guitar, bass, piano, singing and performing. And song writing. She left a simpler life in the Midwest and toiled for years as a musician in Los Angeles before she was famous. Keith Richards, who respects her, points out that she's both sensitive and tough. The celebrity duets are mind-blowing - Mick Jagger, Prince, Michael Jackson, and a fantastic song with Stevie Nicks, who obviously admires her.It's just that the doco leaves me a bit flat. It's a bit too fawning and slick. It has too much of Sheryl! It's like she approved everything. And so the doco comes across a bit like a promotional piece.Complete with a montage sequence with her kids.I still like Sheryl and she seems to be a lovely person. Unfortunately, I don't think this is quite the documentary she deserves.",True
5,5,Straight-forward Sheryl-approved documentary,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Sheryl"" (2022 release; 95 min) opens, we are at the Gorge Amphitheater, and Sheryl addresses the camera about her life. We then go to ""Bennett, Missouri"" where Sheryl grew up and simply loved music. After doing the vocals for a McDonald's commercial, Sheryl decides to move to Los Angeles... At this [point we are less than 10 min into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is directed by Amy Scott (2018's ""Hal""). More importantly, this documentary is utterly and completely approved and controlled by Sheryl Crow herself. She does most of the talking and it's all very straight-forward. Yes, th ere is the unwanted sexual harassment by Michael Jackson's manager and the ""controversy"" around the ""Leaving Las Vegas"" song title (""borrowed from John O'Brien's book of the same name). And of course there is the background behind some of her greatest and most beloved songs. I> am a big Sheryl Crown fan, who is pretty much the same age as me, and had all of her first decade's albums. So I really wanted to like this documentary. But I found it too bland, too straight-forward. Do I know Sheryl Crow any better now that I've seen this documentary? Not really. Is this documentary outright 'bad'? No, but it does feel like a missed opportunity. I think the definitive Sheryl Crow will be made some other time.""Sheryl"" premiered this weekend on Showtime, and being the big Crow fan that I am, I didn't hesitate to check it out. I can't help but feel a little let down by the film. But of course don't take my word for it, so I encourage you to check it out and draw your own conclusion.",False
6,3,I Had High Hopes for This Documentary and the Let Down Was Substantial,bysterbusch,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been of college age when Sheryl Crow came on the scene, I've always appreciated and been aware of her music but did not know much of the backstory that his documentary provides. Much of it was interesting but the content was entirely too sexist and being presented by bloviating self-righteous celebrities quickly became a turn-off. After watching it for what felt like two hours, I realized I wasn't even one hour in with another forty minutes to go. Not for me but might be for you.",False
7,n/a,Sheryl the Whiner,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whine whine whine - that is all she does. Ha ha ha, The industry execs were so tough on her - as if they are not jerks to everyone - especially men. It is getting tiresome hearing these super successful rich women whining about how difficult life and work are. Quit your whining.",False
8,3,Very boring coming from a fan,AkirkoKimotoz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can say this did not shed any new light on her career, its very boring self centered and not at all interesting. I was expecting so much more honestly 3/10.",False
9,n/a,Nothing Special about Someone Special,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"How can you make such a boring film about such a particularly talented artist? The plot follows the usual documentary pattern with a few pathetic emotional moments here and there.Actually just an endless interview in which everyone talks about how great Sheryl Crow is. We all know that, come on! Let us discover something new about this person!Let us seel more about the music, the way it grows, the way how she works in the studio for example.Let us know how she handled her relationships with the beloved people during all this time ...
I could list so much more things that would have made the film more interesting.Honestly I don't know what you're trying to achieve with this film. A pity!",False

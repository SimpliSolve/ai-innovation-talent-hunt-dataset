1,9,Beautiful documentary and AMAZING Human Being!!!,li0904426,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie ""Sex with Sue"" is a beautiful documentary about the famous Canadian sex educator Sue Johanson. It explores the impact and legacy of the sex educator, featuring interviews with Johanson herself, as well as her supporters in media, other sex educators, comedy, and the adult entertainment industry. The documentary celebrates the life of a woman who provided simple and explicit answers to many questions about sex, teaching, and educating people. A devoted nurse who faced opposition from political and religious groups for her open and honest approach to informing young people about sex and sexuality, particularly during the AIDS crisis.The documentary primarily focuses on the statements made by others about Sue, rather than her own life. However, writer-director Lisa Rideout brilliantly summarizes Sue's life, from her birth and youth as a nurse in a nun's hospital to her marriage, children, and career in radio and television.The documentary serves as a beautiful tribute to a wonderful human being who has undoubtedly left many of her viewers more educated and with a more enjoyable sex life. Sue Johanson passed away on June 28, 2023.",False
2,10,No words will do this amazing documentary justice!,MaMojoTOR,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sue Johanson was amazing in my youth, and opened my young eyes to a world which was exceedingly closed at the time (long before the internet and tons of information at the click of the mouse).This documentary isn't so much of a biography of Sue Johanson, but more of her immense impact she had on so many of us growing up. I remember laughing at her silliness while listening (and later watching) her shows, and it's well-captured in this lovely documentary.I encourage everyone to watch this, young or old, familiar with her or not. She was profoundly needed - and appreciated - by so many of us and I can honestly say that I believe she fundamentally changed so many lives for the better.Great documentary, and worth watching.RIP Sue.",False

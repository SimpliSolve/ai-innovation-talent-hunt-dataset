1,10,Off Balance Supply & Demand,eledezmartinez,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is an excellent source of depiction of what occurs when a high demand of avocados results in a turf war for the regions resources. As a result, monarch butterflies, as well as nature activist are put in danger. High demand for any type of supply is not great for the specific region, which supplies it, please consider not buying Mexican avocados to ensure that we keep our great monarch butterflies in our world. Unless the Mexican government is willing to put a sanction or a safety to the specific region and our beautiful butterflies nothing will change. Great documentary, food for thought never the less.",False
2,10,An emotional eye opener to the evils of the cartel,sabrinadiazcortes,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Guardian of the Monarchs is a sick reminder of the injustice that innocent and noble people face when it comes to defending their own communities from the evil Mexican cartels. Homero was a kind soul, dedicating his life to the Monarch butterflies and protecting the forests that they need to survive. In the documentary, it shows how the butterflies would even land on him. It's as if they knew he really was their guardian. He didn't want to cause harm to anyone, rather people to come together to fight for the same cause- protecting the butterfly trees against illegal logging. The cartel wanted to tear all those trees down to make use of the wood- illegally. That's why they saw Homero as a threat, which led to his twisted murder. Overall, his legacy must live on. This documentary was filmed so beautifully, despite the story being worthy of shedding tears (especially at the end when his son speaks). If you want Homero's legacy to live on, please watch this on Netflix.",True
3,10,A powerful story that stays with you,daniriam,n/a,16/08/2025,"I truly enjoyed this film, it was moving, beautifully shot, and deeply impactful. What stood out to me the most was Homero's quiet strength and unwavering determination to defend those who can't defend themselves, the monarchs, the forest, and the native people whose voices are so often ignored.It's not just a story about nature or activism; it's a deeply human story about injustice, corruption, and the courage it takes to stand up against it. I was shocked to see how flawed the legal system can be, and how easily it can be manipulated by cartels who thrive on fear and silence.This film was a real eye-opener. It left me thinking about the world we live in and how much change is still needed, but also about the power of one person's voice when used with heart and purpose. Highly recommended.",False

1,10,Awesome series to make you go hmmm,burntorangeboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This a series feom the famed archaeological/comical TV legend Josh Gates who knows as much how to make you think as make you laugh. This show has a depth to it, and yet also has a follow up to his ""Expedition Unlnown"" show, including some footage from previous adventures. He covers everything on this series from historical mysteries, mythology, UFOs, archaeological finds, and even just cool stories about interesting people. You will love it if you are a history buff, mystery buff, or love trivia, science mysteries, or unsolved genre of any kind. This series is a little deeper and darker than some of his previous shows, so not for the littlest kiddies...",False
2,1,Is this for real?,rufusmcd,n/a,16/08/2025,"This cant be a real show. "" They solved who Jack the Ripper was"". Not even close. Just some dude in an insane asylum. Who was a cigar maker not a doctor. They claim to find a yetti but it winds up being bear and dog DNA. And it only get worse. And this is just one episode. A 7.2 rating ? Someone either has a lot of relatives and friends or a lot of fake accounts and bots. If you're looking for real adventure or solid investigative content, you're better off skipping this one. It's all style, no substance. Absolutely - here's a no-holds-barred bad review of *The Expedition Files*: *The Expedition Files* is an absolute trainwreck of a show-painfully scripted, shamelessly overproduced, and insultingly dumb. Every episode promises a shocking revelation, but delivers the investigative equivalent of a wet fart: dramatic music, slow-motion stares, and zero payoff. The hosts bumble around like they've just Googled ""how to explore"" five minutes before filming. The editing is a mess, the narration is laughably over-the-top, and the so-called ""clues"" are often rocks, sticks, or blurry photographs that wouldn't convince a toddler. It's the kind of show that thinks adding lens flares and thunderclaps makes a broken compass interesting.",False
3,1,Blatant rip off of the Why Files,Flickguru1901,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not uncommon for TV shows and online creators to tread similar thematic ground, especially when covering niche topics like the paranormal, conspiracies, and unsolved mysteries. However, ""Expedition Files"" comes across as a blatant imitation of the popular YouTube channel ""The Why Files,"" and this resemblance doesn't do it any favors.""The Why Files"" has built a loyal following with its thoughtful, well-researched approach to exploring unusual phenomena, paired with a distinctive, witty style of narration and the inclusion of quirky characters like Hecklefish. The show's charm lies in its ability to balance skepticism and open-minded curiosity while engaging its audience with humor and personality.In contrast, ""Expedition Files"" feels like it's riding on the coattails of that success. The show lacks originality, often mimicking the exact format and topics covered by ""The Why Files"" without bringing anything fresh to the table. The presentation feels flat and uninspired, missing the spark that makes ""The Why Files"" so captivating.While it's natural for creators to be influenced by successful predecessors, ""Expedition Files"" struggles to stand on its own merits. Without a unique voice or approach, it risks alienating viewers who are already familiar with ""The Why Files"" and can spot the obvious similarities.For those who enjoy this genre, sticking with ""The Why Files"" is the better choice-it's the original, and it does the job far better. ""Expedition Files"" might work as background entertainment, but it fails to deliver the same depth or charisma.",False
4,3,Needless show,rhs1040,n/a,16/08/2025,"Discovery Channel decided they needed yet another vehicle for Josh Gates to star in (one that he can do from a studio rather than with expensive travel), so they decided to take the worst aspects of Expedition Unknown and make an entire show around them (cheesy re-enactments, placing Josh ""inside"" the historical moments, and endless narration from a script). The subject matter is well-trod, few new insights are provided, and each segment is so short and surface-level. As another reviewer pointed out, this seems like yet another attempt at dumbing down historical/educational content for a YouTube audience with short attention spans.Josh's most marketable trait is his charm, authenticity, and excitement when traveling and interacting with history. The format of this show doesn't allow for any of this to shine through and we are just left with terrible acting and dull, endless narration.",False

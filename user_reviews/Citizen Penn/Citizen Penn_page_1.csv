1,5,Sean Penn follows the Jane Fonda Playbook,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"One always wonders if a celebrity's motivation is good works or publicity. I give Penn credit. I don't think it is all ego. He is a parent and concerned about the world and its future. Regardless of his true motivations, he has helped bring attention to important issues. Sometimes that takes a millionaire.No mention of his Buick Grand National, with one of the last big American V8s that was stolen along with his two guns inside. I guess environmentally friendly cars and gun control are limited to us common folk.",False
2,5,Wasn't blown away,VanBooter,n/a,16/08/2025,As far as documentaries go it was okish not good not bad but watchable. To be honest I did feel the filming was just a vehicle to show Penn being anything other than just a successful Hollywood star who was simply content with being just that.Although he rolled up his sleeves and got stuck in I couldn't help but wonder why did he request the guy filming to keep the camera pointed at the matter in hand and not at him Sean Penn.Yet this documentary is basically 50% Sean Penn complete with the obligatory cigarette to which several packets must of been emptied.So its a middling 5/10 and do I want to watch it again errm.. no thankyou!,False
3,8,Penn is not acting,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreetings again from the darkness. As a two-time Oscar winner for MILK (2008) and MYSTIC RIVER (2003), Sean Penn is unquestionably one of the finest actors of his generation. He's also an accomplished writer, director, and producer, and has been in two high-profile marriages/divorces: once to pop superstar Madonna, and then to actress Robin Wright. Over the years, Penn has been labeled Hollywood's bad boy, anti-American, an opportunist, an activist, a philanthropist, and a humanitarian. Documentarian Don Hardy sets the stage by acknowledging all of that, and then focuses on Sean Penn's work with his relief organization J/P HRO (now CORE).Director Hardy interviews Penn in what appears to be his living room. Penn rarely stops smoking and does an admirable job of taking us through how he became more than just a celebrity seeking a photo op. It was 2010 when Haiti was hit by a massive 7.0 earthquake that killed 250,000, injured 300,000, and displaced 1.5 million from their home. Penn's personal life was at a fork, and he viewed this as a way to do the right thing and help those in need. So he made some calls and along with other volunteers, headed to Haiti. Penn describes this as ""building the airplane after takeoff"". Stunned by the devastation, Penn used his connections to garner medical supplies and other items.Despite facing cynicism from many, Penn mostly avoided cameras, except when he granted interviews to Anderson Cooper on CNN in hopes of raising awareness and funds for relief efforts. Penn spent several months in Haiti and his team evolved from emergency relief (medical support, food, clean water) to temporary housing, to the removal of tons of debris and rubble, and finally to new development. One of the camps that housed 60,000 people began as a tent city and is today a new city of its own.Director Hardy weaves in some terrific video footage that corresponds to Penn's recollections, and there are especially tension-filled moments involving diphtheria, cholera, and an emergency birth. To Penn's credit, he doesn't harp on the political unrest within Haiti, and spends his time and energy on helping the citizens and his JP/HRO team as best he can. We also see clips of the organization's annual gala and witness Penn's growing frustration at the number of wealthy individuals who partake in the food, party, and music, yet don't crack open a checkbook. He shows gratitude to those who are generous, but can't hide his distaste for the others - proving that his passion goes much deeper than good PR.Penn recruited Ann Lee from her work at the U. N. to head the newly named CORE (Community Organized Relief Effort), and the relief work from this organization has carried on through Hurricane Matthew in 2016, as well as the COVID-19 Pandemic, as they distributed tests to underserved areas. You may be the kind that volunteers for everything. Or you may be the kind that critiques others while lounging on your sofa. But even if your political views don't align with Penn's, the film will surely have you respecting his sacrifices for those in needs. His are real actions ... nothing for ""show"".Premiering on Discovery+ on May 6, 2021.",True
4,10,CITIZEN PENN explores Actor Sean Penn as a Humanitarian,lkgleeson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Actor Sean Penn was often characterized and stereotyped by early-career exploits of consistently making news headlines for punching cameramen, his political viewpoints, and marrying the world's most recognizable pop star of the time, Madonna. As Director Don Hardy, sometimes eloquently and sometimes pragmatically, reveals in CITIZEN PENN Sean Penn has diligently changed his image through extensive efforts to aid assistance to his fellow 'man' in war-torn, disaster laden, disaffected countries beginning in 2002 with the war in Iraq right up to the current COVID-19-infected United States",False
5,9,"Talking the Talk, Walking the Walk",DrD3,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a fine documentary showing what it takes to be committed to a cause. Sean Penn discarded his celebrity status; unless it was to fund raise; which is totally acceptable; and did a great degree of the heavy lifting in applying much needed assistance to the impoverished and disaster ridden people of Haiti. Bravo Mr. Penn.,False

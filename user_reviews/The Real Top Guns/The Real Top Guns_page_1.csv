1,3,Could've been really good,edkmetz-45708,n/a,15/08/2025,"... but wasn't. Mind you, this wasn't as bad as something like Plan 9 from Outer Space but I was expecting so much more. Could have discussed the actual curriculum at Top Gun instead of using stock footage and computer voices... and repeats at that. Could have interviewed some actual early pilots who went through the program. Could have interviewed some Commanders of the Vietnam War era who experienced life before and after the Top Gun graduates arrived in their squadrons. Would have been great, and probably reasonably easy, to get some more recent Top Gun graduates to tell stories about their experiences during training and how Top Gun made them better pilots. But we got none of that, just computer generated dreck. A broken Sidewinder missile that launched and missed its target by many miles.",False
2,3,Couldn't finish it,jcrb-94045,n/a,15/08/2025,"Could have been really good, but the production was phoned in. How you can make a documentary about dogfighting boring I don't know, but this lot managed it. The narration is flat and disengaging, made worse by the mediocre music that all but drowns it out, the voices of the pilots who provided quotes are not actors, they're AI and a poor version at that. I found myself zoning out after only a few minutes, having to work to take in what was being said. In the time I did last trying to watch this, all the footage was archive material, none of the contributors did so in person, no interviews or interactions... it had the feel of a made-for-school syllabus video. Dismal effort that took an exciting and interesting subject and made it dull as dishwater.",False
3,n/a,your computer-generated voice tracks,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,Do NOT use artificial voices for your productions.

4,1,"Director, Producer and Distributor Please Read",arrearslintyf,n/a,15/08/2025,So this documentary could have been much more if someone with a right mind and maybe some experience really stepped in and gave some needed advice. The timing for a documentary like this was PERFECT. How could you drop the ball so bad?Someone came up with the horrible idea of doing voice over (digitally sounding) instead of actually interviewing or at least getting an actual voice over actor. Great footage but the whole documentary seems dated and amateur. I was COMPLETELY disappointed. This is a fail to the extreme from the director all the way to the distributor for not saying anything.sad.,False
5,1,Are you kidding me?,mwyykstd,n/a,15/08/2025,"So, we're now classifying something put together using stock footage and computer generated voice overs as a film?? Myself, I prefer to spend my time, watching it, the work of real filmmakers, who employ real humans in the production of their work. This has much more of the flavor of a cheaply done, YouTube channel, or even a cheaply done YouTube advertisement. I do like to watch these, occasionally to get a good laugh out of all the mispronunciations that are made by a computer generated voice - they are constantly putting the emphasis on the wrong syl-LA-ble, as the joke goes. Well, I suppose the joke here is on the viewer.",False
6,1,An AI generated failure. I weep for the future,luc-69069,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the first AI generated film I have seen. And it's not looking good!They clearly tasked the computer with sourcing freely available open source stock video clips on the relevant topics. It then stitched these together and added some generic backing music. Next, the AI read a script that it had written describing the history of US air power. This is probably the worst offence of all - it ruins the stock fottage and is just awful.The end result is a really poor product and a clear example of why humans need to be involved in film making not just AI systems or else this kind of poor quality rubbish is what will result.",False
7,1,AI Voiceovers and no knowledge of aircraft!,ssmiffy-48806,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the history is pretty accurate, the film is so poor and no research has gone into this at all. Most of it I think they learned from the opening credits of Top Gun, the rest from ""Viper's"" first class!! At one point it talks about Mig-23's but shows SU-24's! Th Artificial intelligence voice over (which is apparently an actor!) is very grating and gets so bad you just want to turn it off. With all the hype of the new Top Gun Maverick film coming out at the time they could have really capitalised and made some thing really good to go along but it seems it was a very low budget attempt to jump on the band wagon. Disappointing! 1*",False
8,1,Voices are computer generated,vxgymtb,n/a,15/08/2025,There's no way the voice overs supposedly read by actors were humans. If you're too poorly funded to afford actors then don't claim the lines are read by actors. And if they are actors they should find other jobs. I actually would not have minded if the producers and directors were honest about using computer generated voice overs The best parts were the lines that were obviously humans speaking.The irony of being dishonest about something like how the voiceovers were done when you're producing a documentary which is supposed to be covering true events is striking. After about half of the video I could no longer watch.,False
9,7,Narration takes away from substance,lovegreyhounds,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film was educational and interesting but the narration supposedly by actors using the words of actual top gun pilots was EXTREMELY wooden and stilted. Sounded like computer generated voices with no inflection. Also, the flying sequences were very limited and you saw the same video clip multiple times throughout.",False

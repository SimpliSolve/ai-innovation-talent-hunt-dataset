1,7,"Life, in an Hour and a Half",tylerkom,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLots of good things to say about this doc. The one sentence synopsis is that a couple with 4 kids will have 3 of them go blind in a few years time. In response, the family decides to pack their bags and see that world and all its beauty. The direction leaves us with a story of adventure, fear, love, despair, and all the other human emotions we will experience throughout life, embodied between each of these kids. There is not a true plot so to speak, but a brief window into maturing and all the wonders that the world has for us. You can't help but be mirrored in the heartbreak when one of the kids has to leave their friend behind that they met in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, or be mirrored in the exciting fear of being stuck in a gondola for close to a day. In theme, it closely reminds me of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. And it's not just the wanderlust, but the small achievements like ""making friends in a new place"".The photography is very clean, as to be expected from National Geographic. Some shots looked like a huge pain to set up (whether by having to trek up opposite mountain peaks or crossing heavy traffic before the family arrives at the shot), so kudos to the camera team. Another rare compliment: the sound mixing and editing is absolutely outstanding. Many times I got annoyed because I thought the theatre staff were making noise, but it turned out to be the soundscape of the film!The doc slightly falters in storytelling by attempting to show a transformation of the kids, but it's not obvious what exactly that transformation was. Without more context, only the camera guys and parents know.Seize the day is the message I take from this. Really good and work your time for an easy, short watch.",True
2,7,Blink,CinemaSerf,n/a,15/08/2025,"With three of their young family on a declining spiral of sight loss, the Pelletier's decide to try to take something positive from the time they have left together when they can all see and visit some of the most impressive, interesting, colourful and exciting places on Earth. For the next eighty minutes or so, we follow their adventure as they take to the water and to the skies, appreciate some of the greatest natural phenomena, and probably most importantly - they have fun as a family who all know that things will soon be much less enjoyable and care-free. The parents - Édith Lemay and Sébastian Pelletier carry out quite a juggling act as they strive to create an ordinary, unexceptional environment for their youngsters whilst always conscious of what travails are yet to come. Clearly, money doesn't seem to be an issue here, and so Mia, Léo, Colin and Laurent can embark on their travelogue enthusiastically - and at times that zeal for life and for each other proves a powerful fillip for all, including us. The photography is artfully delivered showcasing some of the astonishing features that grace this world, and the conversation is restricted to snippets of chat rather than any more formal narration, and I thought that worked well - even if, at times, I felt a little like an eavesdropper. Obviously not everyone has the resources to react to an upcoming trauma as these people did, but it's not really the scale of their Phileas Fogg-ness that stands out, it's the fact that as a family, and a largely aware one at that, they manage to navigate their trip - tantrums and all - in a fashion that provides hope for a future that will be different, but will also be peppered with memories they will never forget and that will be built on pretty solid familial foundations.",False
3,9,"Wonder, Awe and Acceptance",christian94,n/a,15/08/2025,"I travelled the world for a year with my son when he was 3 months old. I travelled the world with him since then and met a few other families that travel with their children and sometimes home school them. I think it is the best gift and education to give them. When we see the beauty and diversity of the world we learn to be happy with less. We learn to see less differences and divisions. We also remember our role, our mortality and the smallness of our local thinking.This film explores these themes including the fear of losing our sight from illness. 3 out of 4 kids are already losing their sight and cannot see stars or well at all at night. This National Geographic doc explores the world with stunning footage from Egypt, Ecuador and Nepal among others. More importantly, it exposes the family dilemmas and joys. Their quest to live a bucket list now and not wait until it is too late. A reminder we should all have.The editing and storytelling are superb and many intimate scenes bring these profound questions to light with lightheartedness. How to accept the difficult. How to accept illness (and even death) with courage, kindness and love.A beautiful scene in a dessert sunset has the mom and daughter on a sand dune try to imagine traveling with no sight. Can we still connect with our other senses and with different people and cultures? Surely, yes. There is this constant hope and beauty in face of despair.A tribe in the amazon gives advice to accept life as it. Easier said than done. The dad reflects on how to let go of fear. Children play together and make new friends. No one wants to go home from this wondrous voyage. But will the awe transcend and stay after the tumultuous travel time?Back in my native Montreal, Canada, they reconnect with family and start school again. One kid mentions that being home is simply another voyage. The journey continues and the growth is constant. As adults we have to stay playful and open to possibilities. This film reminds us of so many reasons to be grateful to be simply alive. Awesome!More films like this should be made. It reminded me both why I travel and why I live with awe, wonder and gratitude in any circumstance. Very courageous and enlightening project to share with the world.Bravo!",False
4,10,A Heartfelt Masterpiece: A Must-Watch Documentary,cansarica-34870,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is undeniably one of the most poignant and heart-touching documentaries of the year. It confronts a deeply emotional and universal truth: one day, parents may discover something unexpected in their children-a diagnosis that feels more devastating than facing their own mortality. The thought of your most precious loved one enduring a debilitating condition is one of life's most challenging tests.For those who are not parents, it may be difficult to fully grasp the emotional depth of such a situation, and their inability to empathize might explain why some may underrate this documentary. But as someone who recognizes the profound courage it takes to navigate such trials, I see this film as a beacon of resilience and hope.The Pelletier family, faced with an unimaginable reality and no available treatment, chose to channel their energy into creating this documentary. It's their way of doing the only thing they can-raising awareness and inspiring others in similar circumstances. Such films are more than just stories; they serve as a source of hope, a testament to human strength, and a guide for standing tall in the face of adversity.Thank you, Pelletier family, for your bravery in sharing your journey with the world. This documentary will undoubtedly light the way for others who find themselves in similar situations. To those leaving harsh or dismissive comments: your negativity reflects more about your own struggles than the value of this incredible work. Let's focus on the strength, hope, and compassion this documentary represents.",False
5,9,Heartwarming and heartbreaking,stayinflyte,n/a,15/08/2025,"Powerful stuff! If a film presentation can be heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time (and why couldn't one be, now that I reconsider?) this fascinating 83 minutes on Hulu is it.The brilliantly titled ""Blink"" (do it too often in life and you'll miss it), this French Canadian true-story documents the agonizing yet amazingly-generous gift from two parents to their four children, three of whom are quickly losing their sense of sight. As they travel to various locations on our planet (while we tag along), they attempt to give those kids visual memories to carry with them after their eyes can no longer do that job.As painfully-sad as that sounds, there is a undeniable sense of positivity and fortitude here. Amongst the gorgeous scenery, brilliant and emotional scoring, and insightful-without-being-invasive cinematography we see a growth of strength and acceptance develop in the children. As a father, it was the strength of the parents that especially impressed me. I would've been a blubbering pile of goo in a corner somewhere, but these two stayed the course, always worked as a cohesive team, gave every ounce of determination they had, and loved their children at a level not many could achieve during an ordeal like this.PS - Bring Kleenex.",False
6,9,A family's fight against the dying of the light,whheee,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like all parents, Edith Lemay and Sebastien Pelletier want to give their kids Mia, age eleven, nine-year-old Leo, Colin, age six and four-year-old Laurent the entire world. Leo is the imaginative one. Mia acts like a second mother. Colin is, they say 'a little weird'. And Laurent is their 'little philosopher'.But unlike most kids, the world of three of the four will eventually be reduced to a small visual field, if not total darkness. Mia, Colin and Laurent have all be diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa. There is no cure. The cells in their retinas are slowly dying so only the center will remain, should they have any vision at all.The family, who call Montreal home, are learning to cope with what will certainly be a challenging future. They have been preparing the kids to deal with their fates. Now, you may think that Blink, the documentary feature about the Pelletier family, sounds bleak. But it is nothing of the sort, because instead of letting grief overwhelm them, Edith and Sebastien have chosen to fill their children's visual memory banks with images of the world. In that way, they hope they'll recollect what things look like when their world goes dark.They begin the process by having their kids make a bucket list of wishes, which becomes the backbone of an adventure that takes them around the globe. And, in Blink, we join them on their beautiful journey. Obviously, almost no one would be able to afford an extended trip like this. Sebastian was fortunate in that his company was sold, enabling the family to begin their year of being nomads.First up on the bucket list: a safari. Then, travel on a sleeper train, eat ice cream, ride horses in Mongolia. Learn how to surf. All the while, banking memories they will be able to smell, hear and see with their mind's eye, when their eyesight fails. Already, two of the kids are unable to see in the dark - they cannot even see the stars.On a $200/day budget, they and the filmmakers lived among locals in hostels, homestays and campgrounds. They traveled by public bus and train. They hiked the Himalayas with guides, swam in roiling rivers, got lost, got stuck in cable cars. It wasn't perfect, but that's not what the family wanted. The film is told, not from a Fodor's guide to travel, but matter-of-factly from a child's guide to our big blue marble.Rather than high-end cuisine, we're exploring ant hills and street food. A bite of a frozen candy bar sometimes is all that's needed to put a smile on a tear-streaked face. Edith, all the while prepping her kids for what a future without sight will be like, while encouraging them to continue living, and fight against the dying of the light.An official selection of numerous worldwide film festivals, Blink is currently available for streaming on NatGeo, Hulu and Disney+.",False
7,4,"Okay, but not for a Wide Audience",peeedeee-94281,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not sure if it was way the family was portrayed, or the lack of actual scenic footage, this movie did not appeal to me.We learn about a family and that 3 of 4 children has a degenerative vision disease that will eventually rob them of their eyesight, so the parents decide to go on a journey around the world so the kids can enjoy everything in person, rather than looking at it in a book.While the concept of this movie is appealing, the execution wasn't so great. The trailer made you expect spectacular scenery throughout, but instead we are mainly watching the kids and parents talking and playing. It essentially comes across as a home movie rather than a National Geographic production. A lot of the places they apparently visited, are glossed over, not even shown in photos.I want to wish the family well, and I hope the proceeds of this film go towards the research for a cure, but definitely this was more suited to the small screen like on the TLC channel, than in a movie theatre.",False
8,10,"A Tale Too Real, Yet So Full of Hope",piyushpadwale,n/a,15/08/2025,"Approached this with a slightly heavy heart the moment I realized it's a documentary based on a real family and their lives.Talking about fictional stories inspired by reality is one thing - but this right here is a lot tougher. Because you're witnessing something you'd never want to imagine for yourself, yet real people out there have actually experienced it and have strived through it with unimaginable strength.It's a tale of parental love and family bonding - a happy family whose world comes crashing down when they find out that three of their kids are diagnosed with a serious illness.But the parents make it their mission to give them an experience of a lifetime, fulfilling even the smallest of their dreams.It beautifully highlights just how far our parents can go to see us happy - even in the most challenging times - while also living parts of their own dreams through us.It's emotional, gut-wrenchingly painful, yet incredibly inspiring. And somehow, it also carries a warm, feel-good vibe - especially when you look at the kids, always excited, always smiling. It fills your heart with so much joy.Even when they're on the verge of losing something so precious, they carry a brave spirit. And the way they hold on to their childlike innocence while developing their own kind of maturity - it's truly heartwarming to see.A huge testament to their strength, and to the importance of having each other's back no matter what.Left me teary-eyed, but with a smile on my face.Definitely urge as many people as possible to watch this heartfelt, memorable tale of love, family, and adventure.Now streaming on JioHotstar.",False
9,9,"Great, except...",jamestakisblain,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI was riveted by this film and felt for the parents and children. However, they skipped the Acropolis in Athens with its Parthenon, which can't be appreciated in photos but in person. Athens is the cradle of Western Civilization, but the city is a world-class European capital and the family had a budget, so it was probably not within their means. They could have stayed in a hostel or Airbnb, but other than the omission of Athens, the film was as good as such a film could be, capturing both the wider scenery and the intimate moments in a balanced manner. I don't remember if they saw the pyramids but they better have.",True
10,10,Amazing real documentary!,lalalou40,n/a,15/08/2025,Wonderful family movie of wonders of traveling highs ans lows with family of young children real warm and courageous family. It brought back memories from my childhood of traveling with my family of eight. The different views of the different ages of children. Amazing parents and such love and compassion and understanding of parents. Truly a film worth watching. Having the love in this family and the preparedness of what's to come even when no one can ever really be prepared of such hardship of having four children and having three of them fall to the hereditary disorder of a genetic disorder. Missing to say if parents have the disorder only that no one in the family has this just these three children. Worth the time.,False
11,10,Heart pounding journey 💖,janicejh-17983,n/a,15/08/2025,"I feel privileged to have traveled through the adventures, with this incredibly brave family!I found the film to be awe inspiring and an emotional roaler coaster of terrifying travels to dlightful simple joys to watch, as they fulfilled each of their childens dreams.As a parent and grandparent my heart aches for the children, as the must navigate the unknown, yet their parents have set them up in the most extraordinary way possible for their life challenges as they age and grow.I highly recommend viewing it with your children aged 8 or above to open conversation on the complexities of life.",False

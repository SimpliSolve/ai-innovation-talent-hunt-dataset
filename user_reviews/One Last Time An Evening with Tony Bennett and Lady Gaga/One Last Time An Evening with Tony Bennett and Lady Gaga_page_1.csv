1,9,Love the tribute ...,Yoola62,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love Tony Bennett. One of the greats of all time. Lady Gaga has a great voice, first I've seen her like this. Wish her ""moves"" were a little more refined like Liza & some of the beautiful truly classy ladies of the sale era as Tony Bennett.Miss the class of the past.",False
2,10,A beautiful tribute,haydenhathcock,n/a,16/08/2025,No other concert taping has moved me to tears like this one. An absolutely beautiful tribute that a legend like Tony Bennett deserves from a friend as dear to him as Lady Gaga.,False
3,10,Beautiful,irishpeter64,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wonderful way to sent a legend off into retirement. Tony May not have been completely himself conversationally, but he was there when he sung. Those of you who complained about Tony's condition during the concert. Look past it and enjoy his vocal talents.",False
4,10,"What a great send-off for Mr. Bennett in ""One Last Time: An Evening with Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga""",tavm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I finally got to watch this: the final performance of the legendary Tony Bennett as he suffers Alzheimer's. Lady Gaga begins the show with her versions of the standards Tony and others of his time made popular. When the man himself comes on, we find out it's his 95th birthday as Lady and the audience sings ""Happy Birthday"" to him. Then Tony does his standards before he and Gaga do a couple of duets. The show ends with Tony doing his perhaps his most famous song, ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"" to great applause. The only flaw I found in the program was when Lady Gaga pointed her microphone to the audience during the ""New York, New York"" number, you couldn't hear the audience sing the word they probably sang. Other than that, this was a great send-off for Mr. Bennett, that's for sure!",False
5,10,An Amazing Final Concert With. Silver Voice at 95,sinnott-72736,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a privilege to hear Tony Bennett again on his 95th Birthday! No one is left from that era and to still have a voice that cuts through with the clarity he has, it's amazing. Thanks to whoever organised this and whoever thought to film and distribute it. Sure Lady Gaga may not be in the best voice, and Tony isn't really engaging with the audience but he's 95 and when he sings YOU LISTEN.",False
6,5,Disappointing,zorro-789-229893,n/a,16/08/2025,"All in all, disappointing. And Gaga's dance movements were stiff and clumsy. Honestly, I couldn't help thinking of Elaine Benes. I actually like both Bennett and Gaga i other shows, but this one was just flat and disappointing.",False
7,5,Why?,cockezville,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was all kind of sad, Lady Gaga so full of herself and not in best voice and a vacant Tony Bennett who seemed present in his songs but empty otherwise. For a 95 year old, he was amazing. I just felt the whole thing felt very exploitative and a chance for Gaga to make a buck. Her stage presence was annoying.",False

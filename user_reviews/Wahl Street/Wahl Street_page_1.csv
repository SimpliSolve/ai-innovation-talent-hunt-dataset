1,6,Vanity project,economywater,n/a,16/08/2025,"I mean I guess it's watchable if you're bored enough (I obviously was), but this is nothing more than a self-promotional vanity project. Watching dude try and convince himself (and us) that the world needs yet another company selling $45 plain t-shirts is both comical and sad. I also liked the way he's raising his kids in a 30,000sqft Beverly Hills mansion whilst talking about instilling strong work ethic in them. Good luck with that?",False
2,6,"Abbott and Costello, Two Tens for a Five...",cmccombe-67456,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this series compelling but not for the reasons Mark intended. This is an intimate look at how not to be a great leader. He doesn't understand the businesses he is in, his team is comprised of people he feels comfortable with rather than leaders who can actually drive success.I almost wish I did not watch this, I liked Mark in movies and seeing him in this shed a different ""dark"" light that I can't erase.If you are looking to learn about business or startups, give this one a pass. The only reason he has success outside of acting is because of his ""brand"", most of us would not get away with his shenanigans.Entertaining in the usual, train wreck reality TV way...",False
3,6,Big entertaining comercial,quake-ruled,n/a,16/08/2025,"It feels like a big comercial for his companies, but I enjoyed watching it. Its interesting to see, how pain- & stressful life can be, even if you dont need to think about money. Now I want to buy a municipal shirt...are they available in Germany? ;)",False
4,n/a,Let no one forget.....,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mark Wahlberg attacked an Asian-American with a vicious attack and blinded him. I've never seen any repentance for this.Let no one forget, please....",False
5,7,Smart,nickdinicola,n/a,16/08/2025,This show just highlights how talented mark wahlberg is. And how a man with no education can rise up to be the best.,False
6,3,Auto Celebration to Mark's Ego reveals his incompetence in pretty much everything but acting,l-garulli,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's about Mark trying to get into several businesses he has zero experience with or idea about how to run them. He's surrounded by his old friends and partners trying to accomplish something out of their league and at the same time you see them treating Mark as the Super-Star-Alpha-Male of the group. I couldn't watch after the 2nd episode. I haven't checked but I do believe this ""documentary"" has been produced by Mark itself trying to make his brand even stronger. Don't get me wrong: I admire people that try to do something else, really. That's the only reason why I started watching this. But such a small commitment to many businesses at the same time? There is no way you can win this game. Also, I can't find one innovative idea in all his businesses. His entire value proposition for all his businesses is entering into a highly competitive market (apparel, burger restaurant, gym) hoping that can work just because there is his face on them.",True
7,8,Mark is weeping all the way to the bank....,jonidawson77,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would love to hear the ""success stories"" of all the nay-sayers offering their low critiques here. Mark has not only proven that he does have a head for business but he has helped provide jobs and dreams for many others. No one could have predicted a pandemic but Mark and his business partners offer an example of what happens when you're able to rise above it. Any American business success story gets my attention and this series offers the highs and lows in an entertaining fashion.",False
8,1,wow such a waste of time,plargreg,n/a,16/08/2025,The answers to questions NO ONE ASKED! No one cares about marky marks finances and showing us how rich he is is just a slap in the face to all us not multimillionaires. But really people who the heck asked for this piece of boring garbage.,False
9,10,DRIP KING,ClarenceElmore893,n/a,16/08/2025,"A deep dive into the Aristotle of the 21st century, what can't this guy do, fast food king, clothing mogul, actor by day/rapper by night???.... I bet he could even take over a hijacked airplane and land it without any proper flight training. Even while being such a powerful figure mark maintains a very humble approach throughout the series. He lives in a quaint LA home and he doesn't even fly first class, well that's also due to his private jet only having one cabin so therefore their is no first class. If you want to be successful in life I highly suggest you watch this masterpiece. Since watching this series I now have not only one lazy boy recliner but 3....keep hustling.",False
10,1,What a bag,mmmaduros,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought maybe this would be interesting but he's so self absorbed it's insane. Example from the first 10 min of episode 1: he turns all his hotel rooms into a gym evidently, and then shows himself working out in a London hotel room at 2:30AM on a Saturday, screaming and jumping up and down. Do you have any self awareness? What an a-hole.",False
11,1,"""Learn powerful business lessons.."" from who?!",carnagecarney,n/a,16/08/2025,"This guy poses in his underwear, works out, makes a few movies and now we're supposed to ""learn powerful business lessons"" from him? I mean good for him but...Having watched the show, I'd garner better business lessons from a chimp. ""I'm learning everything as I go..."" How insightful Mark...powerful indeed.The fact that the only business we even know (or have ever even heard of) from Mark Wahlberg is ""Wahlburgers"" is a testament to his celebrity - not his business talent.He lets us know early in the first episode he has about a gazillion other business ventures. You've never heard of them. I'm sure he's hoping this excuse for a show changes that.If not, they will soon be a gazillion failed business ventures.This show is a love letter to Mark Wahlberg's ego. From Mark Wahlberg's ego.",False
12,8,Interesting,katbdaly,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was interesting to see someone with money and multiple businesses that you think couldn't be affected, suffer and struggle as the rest of the world due to the pandemic. For the days we feel it's just the lower middle income families having the hardest time, we are so wrong. It was truthful, sweet and sad. Can't wait for season 2.",False
13,3,Very dull,Malloy873,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not really into the Kardashians style shows but I really like Wahlberg and he's always seemed like a nice guy who really does not take himself too seriously. So I assumed this would have something more to offer, it did not. It was actually even more dull than the shows I hate.It didnt give any interesting insights into that world and yet it carried on that same trope that all these shows philospohise: 'hes a rich multimillionaire because he's so talented and works so hard.' When we all know the truth is that these people are all just very lucky and shock when you're already loaded its quite easy to get even more loaded (especially when your country is printing trillions, but lets not get into that).I couldn't even get through the first episode, once i saw the 'hotel room gym scene', I'd seen enough. He's staying in a hotel that will already have a huge gym that barely anyone uses yet he bothers to get one put into his huge suite. He probably has anxiety issues like most celebrities, so doesn't want to workout with the gen pop, well fine, thats not his fault and its obviously sad but dont try to make it look like its great that he forces everyone to fit in around this.I would of rather seen a show about a hollywood A-lister who stays in a hotel and then actually enjoys things in the real world like having a beer and has fun.",False
14,9,Jealous Much?,carinamo88,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love how all negative reviews of this series are from men - try to see past your EGO and acknowledge a family man SUCCEEDING at the hustle. Crawl out from your parents' basement's sofa bed and be happy for others putting in hard work (seriously his drive is insane)! Thoroughly enjoyed the doc series, I thought it was clever to insert clips from Mark's movies to emphasize what he was feeling in the moment. Loved the bits where established entrepreneurs gave their two cents (give me more!) - it's informative and entertaining! I'd recommend to anyone who's a fan of his, to people wondering what's going on in Hollywood during the pandemic and for an insight into entrepreneurship in general - the good and the bad of it.",False
15,2,Love Mark Wahlberg as an actor...,stl-01238,n/a,16/08/2025,"I want to love this. I can't. A $45 t shirt doesn't make you a better father. Dressing better doesn't make you a good father. Yet this was where I turned off the series.We don't/can't all solve problems with money. I am sure it wasn't meant to come off this way but I found myself frustrated watching this.Super disappointed. To be fair, I dislike reality tv. I thought Mark W. May have maintained his connection with real people but I fail to see the connection through this show.",False
16,2,Ugh,robertjruttenberg,n/a,16/08/2025,So self serving--enough crap.. I could not watch more than 3 episodes.,False
17,10,Inspiring and Easy to Watch,ninasmithremax,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed seeing his many business adventures and I disagree about the negative criticism saying it offered no real insight into Mark's life. I feel like it was very personal at times and how far he does stretch himself to make a difference in people's lives. He has money from acting...he chooses to be an entrepreneur and offer so many other people jobs, healthier lifestyles, and alternative products. The Wahlbergs all around are just stand up people and Alma is an angel and I'm sure is sooo proud of her family!",False
18,1,Self gratifying,llaskiee,n/a,16/08/2025,"This shows Mark Wahlberg is obviously a workaholic narcissist, the type who can't survive without the limelight and without people surrounding him to stroke his ego 24/7, who'd be lost and miserable if he wasn't able to flap his gums to someone at all times. I'm glad this show revealed that. It means I can support less of his work. Hollyweird is full of these types, and CEOs have high rates of narcissism too - well Mark is a combination of both, so there you ago. We already knew that about actors, but sometimes you just need a glimpse behind the curtain to knock some sense into you. Thanks for that Mark & team. I would pity his wife but she seems like the same type of character.",False
19,10,Motivational and Intelligent,friederich-13692,n/a,16/08/2025,"To address the negative reviewers: of course it is going to come across like he is promoting his business's...your are watching a documentary titled Wahl Street. What did you think you were watching. I chose to watch it because I want to see how this man operates. What I found is he operates on another level than most people taking the time to write on here. This is the first time I have ever taken the time to write a review. I am doing so because if he can sign autographs at breakfast, film a movie during the day; meet his partners at night... I'm willing to take a minute out of my schedule to say thank you for putting some productive media in my families streaming feed.",False
20,1,Letter from a Marky Mark fan,armand-mihaies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting take in Marks private life and side businesses , you could also translate this to 1st world problems.Who really asked for this series ? The fans surely didn't , these movie stars are so rich they own land on Mars yet they are still promoting themselves in everything we see on a daily baisis : food , clothes , shoes , podcasts.When is it enough ? This show is just another manifestation of pure greed , narcisism and I don't respect the hustle , i'm tired of it entirely and pretty much done with Bollywood.I wouldn't recommend this show to anyone , let alone a Mark fan , shameful.",False
21,3,"Watchable, unintentionally hilarious",rabbitmoon,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is something compellingly watchable about this show - its like a bizarre satire on American capitalism. Wahlberg is charismatic and clrely disciplined - he's also incredibly egotistical, suffering delusions of grandeur about his business skills and leadership, and conveniently oblivious to his hard-working underlings running around making all this happen for him. I get no sense of genuine empathy or moral contemplation from him - had he not found miraculously fortunate fame and wealth early on in hip-hop, I'm sure he would have ended up something like a successful, charistmatic drug or arms dealer. His leadership skills basically entail having everyone around him saying what he wants to hear, looking for his approval and tending to his ego. Which isn't leadership at all. As a result he gets this inflated, overly optimistic vibe about everything. He justifies his plain, $45 T-shirt with ""it won't fall apart after three washes like other t-shirts"". What a relief! While also saying how he's bringing so much value etc to people. What he's really doing is selling his face and fame, lending it to any business he things he can get a ROI on by showing up and saying ""hey its me guys! I'll pretend to be all down to earth but really I crave this attention and worship, keeping bringing it please"". It's hilarious in that respect. Maisie Williams shows up to his new gym and he doesn't seem to know who the hell she is, but heck, she's clearly intimidated by him so all is well.People say things like ""I'm really excited about this opportunity"" with zero emotional expressiveness. His white, wealthy investors pop up with glib, trite business advice like ""the key to success is just to never give up, if you have an idea then just do it and don't stop, never let anyone give you no for an answer!"" No thought for ""hey, research your idea, test the market, listen to the feedback of others"" before wasting your time and investment (as millions do on this kind of glib, trash advice).",False
22,10,Hard Work Never Goes Unseen,cnoles-59478,n/a,16/08/2025,"This HBO Max Original is a show/documentary on the life of actor Mark Wahlberg. You get to see the inside scoop of his daily life while filming and outside of filming. It shows his many businesses he is a part of and shows his dedication to his work. Mark's work ethic is unbelievable to the sense he owns Performance Inspired Nutrition, Municipal, Municipal Pictures, Aquahydrate, Mark Wahlberg Auto, F45 ect... You get to see Mark navigate his work life on set, business life, being away from family, and most of all friendships he has made along the way. It is a heartfelt show with great comedy. I binge watched season 1 in one sitting and just finished season 2 recently. Recommend for everyone and if you love Mark and our into starting a business. Hard work is how you become successful. This is displayed through Mark Wahlberg's life.",False
23,9,"TAKE AWAY THE ACTOR, WATCH THE SHOW",xxtynkerbellxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no expectations. I'll be honest, I did not seek this out. His work ethic as an actor is what kept me watching. I also knew the back up story of how he got his acting career. And to see him still thriving is interesting in itself. Entourage was fun in theory, but doesn't seem far fetched for him.His work ethic is insane. And I think this shows if you are an entrepreneur...you do just that. Interesting to watch it during Covid. But his realism for investing, not just doing what you're good at, AND family kept me more interested. Living in 2022, it's more realistic than maybe starting it shortly after the shut down and how different states reacted.",False
24,10,Super educational and inspirational,michelmutsaers,n/a,16/08/2025,"A life of a very succesfull man who came from nothing. Very inspirational and fun to watch. Mark seems for me a man without a big ego and just living it. So if you are a entrepreneur or someone who lives for getting succes in live then this is a must watch. All the material things in his live are exponantial, but it truly doesnt matter, he is a really fun and nice man without any on material based ego guy. He just loves the good stuff in live, arent we all! For me personally very learningfull, he is in a place where every entrepreneur would like to be. It boosts my ambition to another level, thanks Mark!!",False
25,9,Probably the most honest financial education series I've seen,seandarcy-93548,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm giving this 10/10 for this very personal account of a guy who is investing in his financial education with the school of the street. Instead of reading books he is learning by interacting with others he relies upon as experts in their fields. The stories told at least in season one is someone who makes significant time and money investments, but keeps going further in when the pandemic and money dries up. He is definitely not penny pinching and looking at where he can make cuts. Im looking forward to how his experiment turns out as it's a different approach than I have taken as a businessman.",False

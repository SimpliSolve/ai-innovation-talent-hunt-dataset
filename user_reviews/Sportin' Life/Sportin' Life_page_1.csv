1,4,Abel Ferrara's documentary about absolutely nothing during the pandemic,elgaucho91,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw this documentary in Venice with the director in the same theater after receiving a prize. Well, this documentary is terrible. Doesn't tell a story, it's just pieces of junk from Ferrara's mind. Ooohhh, he can play the guitar and sing. Oooohhh, he wanders through Rome. Wow. All this confusing content seems justified by a red line of low-quality pandemic videos.
Sorry, Abel, but this is truly awful.",True

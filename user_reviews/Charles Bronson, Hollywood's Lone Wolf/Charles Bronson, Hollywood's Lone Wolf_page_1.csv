1,6,At Least the Movie Clips Are Good...,joe_538,n/a,15/08/2025,"A general summary of his life and career, details a lot of his fans are already familiar with. It gets strange at Chato's Land when opinions start being thrown in, the narrator calling Charles Bronson a hypocrite for not wanting to appear onscreen with a nude woman when he wore a loincloth for most of the movie. They're not the same thing. Lamenting that some of the muggers in Death Wish were black (some muggers are), calling Bronson a poster boy for ""the gun lobby"" and immediately cutting to a clip of Donald Trump. It becomes unfocused for a few minutes and is undeniably a product of the time it was produced; false equivalencies, identity politics, and ""orange man bad.""
It would have been nice if they could have included clips from Raid on Entebbe, Act of Vengeance, and Yes Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus to highlight some of the departures from his action vehicles.",False
2,7,It scratched this Bronson fan's itch,pmtelefon,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a big fan of the films of Charles Bronson. He was a very underrated actor. ""Charles Bronson, Hollywood's Lone Wolf"" is a nice little documentary about his career. I've always been disappointed by the lack of books and/or documentaries about Bronson's career. This movie could have been a little longer and cover more of his films but I don't want to nitpick. I enjoyed this movie and have been telling people to watch it.",False
3,10,Thanks for the personal info,Incinera-9-939048,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like everything about Bronson, it's hard to get private info about him nowadays. America hates him. Myself and the world loves him. He chiseled many children to be good throughout his movies. Personally he's the top 3 legends from the movie industry. I cherish Charles Bronson, Sean Connery and Bruce Lee. He had a brilliant career. While actors nowadays have a shelf life of 10 years, Charles became a legend after 45-50's. He's unique. That's why all the nobodies hate him. Charles, you will live forever in our hearts. See you someday in heaven.",False
4,5,Brief but with lots of clips,jellopuke,n/a,15/08/2025,"You'll get a short overview of his life and career and lots of clips, but no real commentary on anything other than some dismissive and pithy statements about how he only made trash. Where were the fans to celebrate his image or his friends to talk about him? This was a disappointment.",False
5,1,I feel sick,sbtuxb,n/a,15/08/2025,"I revel at the age and travels of a journalist who thinks a .30 calibre machine gun is an automatic rifle.There are sporadic insults throughout this documentary and I reject the notion that the writer of this diatribe has a drip, a drop or even a sniff of the actor and performer Charles Bronson was, is and always shall be.I also take note that Bronson suffered premature dementia up to his demise so why quote him when he talks negatively about himself.I consider this article insulting, juvenile, judgemental, ageist, politically woke, politically incorrect, slanderous and rather gross.Charles Bronson and a few great characters made the success of The Great Escape and it wasn't simply down to Steve McQueen, all the cast were brilliant.Who makes documentaries these days?Anyone?It sounds like it.Even though Charles Bronson turned down or was rejected for the Sergio Leone fims which made Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood and so many more actors famous, Charles was still qick to say he fitted the bill perfectly.He was never a jaded or faded actor, he lost his wife.God bless them both X‚ù§",False

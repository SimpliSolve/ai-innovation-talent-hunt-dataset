1,10,Move ya Body The Birth Of House music,dbuford-15341,n/a,16/08/2025,"*Move Ya Body: The Birth of House* is a compelling documentary that explores the rise of house music in Chicago after Disco Demolition Night, whose sole purpose was to destroy black music. Directed by Elegance Bratton, it blends archival footage, dramatizations, and interviews with pioneers like Jesse Saunders, Vince Lawrence, and Duane Buford to highlight the genre's deep roots in Black, brown, and LGBTQ+ communities.The film excels in historical depth and an electrifying soundtrack but leans more into the social movement than the technical evolution of house music. While engaging and informative, it may leave some music purists wanting more. Hats Off to Elegance Bratton and vince lawrence!**Rating: 4/5**",False
2,10,As factual as it is fantastic.,charleslittle2,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who loves films, loves house music and was actually there during the period that this film takes place, I got all that I could have ever wanted from experiencing this film. The title suggests that the film is a music doc which I guess that it is. But the journey traverses so much more than just the music but the heart and soul that birthed the music. The unexpected entry point into the film's world, the illustrative archival material that take me back to that time and that place and the carefully orchestrated chorus of voices that act as solemn protectors of the film's truthful and almost magical tale and the indelible significance of this music and it's creators on a global scale. I am so happy to see a film do such a brilliant job of connecting a lightening bolt time from the past right up to it's relevance in the present day and beyond. House ain't givin' up. House ain't gonna stop.",False

This move will literally move ya body and educate you on the birth of the house music and beyond. Highly recommend.It tells the story from the perspective of the people who actually took the house music for a dance since its first steps to huge gatherings of millions of people around the world that filled clubs, small and big venues to well known festivals at a international level around the globe. A well produced and charming movie with interesting testimonials.10/10. Big shout out to Vince and everyone involved.",False
4,5,"House, House, House Music Away",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Elegance Bratton's exploration of the Disco Demolition Night and how House music was involved is an solid, yet, familiar and basic tale that offers some good insights about it's historical context. Bratton's passionate direction and approach of the topics are well-developed as his direction on approaching the tone and topics explored are straight forward and clear. Using good discussions, it offers a good insight for the historical context of that period and why it shaped the music and United States, especially amongst the 1970s.Admittedly, the documentary isn't something grand as some of the structure is basic, and certain aspects felt as if they are repetitive or pulled straight from the Wikipedia site. But overall, it's a decent documentary that highlights the period.",False

1,10,Much More than a Puppet Movie,SusannahN-5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even if Shari Lewis wasn't ""of your generation,"" you will leave blown away by this Force of entertainment nature. You'll laugh, you'll shake your head, you will nod in respect. You will also find yourself thinking: ""Dear God. What an amazingly talented woman - she could have been right up there with Debbie Reynolds or Doris Day! ---but then there is this puppet.""What this film does brilliantly is explore the complex relationship she had with her puppets as intimate extensions (or perhaps ""mouth pieces"") for aspects of her own psyche. Fascinating stuff.What I think makes this doc exceptional is that it is not the usual hagiography of praise without perspective. D'Apolito does not shy away from exploring how complex a woman she was. How her fierce determination often had a price tag.This is a balanced and thoughtful examination of a female entertainer who broke numerous barriers and is very worth knowing. You will after watching ""Shari and Lamb Chop.""",False
2,10,Lovely Walk Down Memory Lane,stevenschwartzdmd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lovely story about an incredible performer - and her sidekick! I remembered the show well from my chidhood but can only now appreciate the skill she brought to it. Amazing performer and touching story.Clearly Shari was also obsessed. It had to be challenging to be her daughter or her husband - not enough oxygen for everyone. But it might often be like that with true stars and path breakers. And with all of her success, it was amazing to discover than back then, she could not get a credit card on her own without her husband's signature!It would be great to see this on Netflix or Amazon. It deserves wider distribution.",False
3,10,"a joyful, nostalgic, and deeply inspiring documentary that honors a true pioneer of children's entertainment.",rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shari & Lamb Chop is a joyful, nostalgic, and deeply inspiring documentary that honors a true pioneer of children's entertainment. Director Lisa D'Apolito captures not only Shari Lewis' incredible talent and groundbreaking contributions to television, but also her resilience, creativity, and the heartfelt connection she maintained with generations of children.This documentary isn't just a tribute, it's a celebration of imagination, perseverance, and the enduring magic of storytelling.What I love most about Shari & Lamb Chop is how it dives beyond the surface of fame to explore the personal journey of a multi-talented performer. Through interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, and rare home movies, the film shows how Shari Lewis redefined what it meant to connect with young audiences, on her own terms and in a male-dominated industry. The documentary balances entertainment and emotion in a way that feels honest and unforgettable.This documentary is a must-see for anyone who believes in the power of storytelling and the legacy of pioneers who paved the way for joy and imagination. The film tells the story of Shari Lewis, a Bronx-born performer who overcame a career-ending dance injury by channeling her creativity into ventriloquism. With her iconic sock puppet Lamb Chop, and other characters like Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy, she rose to national fame as one of the earliest stars in children's television. The film follows her journey through the highs of early success, the disappointment of cancellation, and her incredible resurgence in the 1990s when she once again captured the hearts of a new generation.The interviews are a major highlight. Ventriloquists and performers who were inspired by Lewis, as well as her daughter Mallory Lewis, offer touching insights and personal stories. The archival clips of Shari's performances are charming and delightful, full of wit, warmth, and timeless energy. One of my favorite parts is seeing Shari backstage, meticulously working on her characters and pushing herself to be better, not for fame, but because she believed in children and what they deserved from entertainment.The message of this documentary is powerful: women can lead, innovate, and inspire, even in industries that underestimate them. It also reminds us of the value in treating children as intelligent and imaginative individuals, something Shari Lewis always believed in. There is no inappropriate content, and it promotes creativity, curiosity, and perseverance, making it perfect for families and classrooms.I give Shari & Lamb Chop 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults who grew up with Lamb Chop or are discovering her magic for the first time. It opens in theaters on July 18, 2025 and will also be available digitally and on home video.By Ashleigh C., KIDS FIRST!",False

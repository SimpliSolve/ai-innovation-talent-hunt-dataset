1,10,Simply Magnificent,shenry-25500,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI positively enjoy this documentary due to revealing the aspects of the grind it takes to work with children to put on a large production that is the key fundraiser for a non profit organization. The viewer is also treated to snapshots of the obstacles students and parents encounter. It is a bonus is hearing Ms. Allen share part of her story regarding key points at the start of her training and career. The balance between the students and the adults is delightful. I could not help but applaud the energy, drive, and grit Ms. Allen instills into her students to understand that ""everyday is a rehearsal for (their) life.",True

4,10,A heartbreak around every turn,HMB007,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'll be honest. I was a professional dancer many decades ago so I am all to aware of how brutal and heartbreaking nature of the business.But this thing knocked the wind out of me repeatedly.A heart warming meeting? Kick to the soul. A child in a nationally regarded dance company?Sigh.I've always loved Debbie Allen and admired her work.After this I want go have her canonized, NOW.And I doubt she'd agree, which makes this all the more reasonable.If you missed this, you either watched an entirely different movie than I did, or you didn't actually watch the movie at all and made your evaluation based on hearsay or you rubber stamped an analysis/rating so you fit into your group.I dare you to watch the movie with the sound on. And listen. And grieve that we still live in this United(?) States.",True
5,10,Wonderful Inspiring,vyxenyte,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI absolutely enjoyed watching this documentary. It's so many talented hopeful dancers and I love to see it. It was unfortunate that some of the girls couldn't pursue their dreams because of financial difficulties, but the reality and rawness of this documentary is inspiring. My daughter and I can't get enough of it. We wish it was a reality show. The stories aren't messy it's real life and that's so interesting. All the harsh experiences Debbie Allen went through just shaped her into a passionate, loving, strong beautiful woman that pours her gifts back into the community.",True
6,10,Perfect inspirational movie for my child.,beccagitel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seriously my 4 year old daughter has watched this movie about 20 times already. She has a dream now. To be in the hot chocolate nutcracker and let me tell you after her being subjected to the constant exposure to the all white nutcracker books, movies, performances every Christmas everywhere we turn...... this movie made her sooooooooo happy. We need more forerunners like Debbie Allen in the world. I'm so grateful my serious 4 year old beautiful brown ballet dancer now has all these role models. We may have to move to California now! Lol thank you again Debbie Allen for making this happen. All the teachers in the film are amazing.",False

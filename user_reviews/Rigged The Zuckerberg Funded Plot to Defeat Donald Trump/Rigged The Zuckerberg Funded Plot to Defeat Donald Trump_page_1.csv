1,6,"Thought provoking, but expected more",sjwestbrooks,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rigged is a very intriguing documentary, giving loads of facts that will make you question everything you thought you knew about both Mark Zuckerberg and the 2020 U. S. presidential election. It is very well made and features many interviews from concerned conservatives, such as Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.I did, however, expect it to be a bit longer. The documentary is only 40 minutes long, probably due to its fast pace. My guess is that the filmmakers didn't want to ""waste time"" with explanations of every fact, but I also think that an issue as important as the 2020 election deserves at least a full length discussion.If you're asking questions about the 2020 election, this is a good documentary to watch if you don't have much time on your hands. If you want more, however, please watch both The Deep Rig and Selection Code.",False
2,1,Pure trash fiction posing as a documentary,WonkaWilde,n/a,15/08/2025,"There is nothing real or factual about the insane conclusions this film jumps to, as it's completely based on discredited theories. As such, it doesn't fit the concept of a documentary in terms of presentation of facts. If you want to consider it a documentation of anything, it only could be a documentation of the insane, trash, ramblings of its delusional makers. I'd like to give it less than a 1, but that's not possible on here.",False
3,10,Anyone calling this fiction is a liar,bentram,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you watch it you don't even need to wonder if it was stolen or not plenty of proof and facts, video, testimonials etc people who say this is fiction are pure 100% liars.",False
4,1,Disinformation at it's best.,RealLeblanc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Look up who wrote the scenario for this piece of trash. It says a lot about the tendency of this short film full of lies and disinformation. Don't waste your time with that film unless you want to believe the big lie,",False
5,10,Short and to the point,pegwht,n/a,15/08/2025,"This short film (40 mins) explains how Zuckerberg influenced the 2020 election. Period. If you want to learn more about Mark Zuckerberg and his role in Biden winning the election, this enlightening and factual documentary is for you. It addresses one piece of the 2020 election fraud puzzle. If you want more pieces, watch ""2000 Mules"".",False
6,1,Fiction,silvercat-73313,n/a,15/08/2025,"If the election was rigged, how are all of these people in power positions?One would assume if someone is rigging an election, they'd do it across the board.Is there something wrong with putting up ballot boxes so EVERYONE can vote? Or is that too fair?Who's really rigging an election? Hmm?I like how these people keep claiming the ballots were miscounted, IF THEY LOSE. But they're counted correctly, as long as they win.Does it make sense that the same machines that counted wrong for Trump counted correctly for them? Shouldn't ALL the votes for EVERYONE be recounted?Does anyone really think any of these people would allow that?",False
7,10,"There is a 'Big Lie', but not the one you're thinking",cbhawkfan,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie along with 2000 Mules provides the facts that prove the 2020 election was fraudulent to the extent where the wrong President was elected. To deny the obvious means you're either not too bright, or corrupt. Yes there was a 'big lie', the lie by the Democrats and their media that Biden was fairly elected.",False
8,10,Romantic comedy: men in love,zhivago97,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wonderful romantic comedy that finally reveals the truth about an illicit romance, complete with hookers and BDSM role play. Who knew the protagonists can have such a strong bond with each other, when both are married! But I guess the world is changing and open relationships are no longer hidden. And this love affaire has been going on for over a decade!Anyone who seeks the truth can read between the lines to see what is really going on: brotherly love!I found this documentary to be more like a romantic comedy and also very insightful. I never knew these facts before. Now the truth is revealed, what goes on in their bedrooms is now open knowledge.",False
9,1,This Aged More Poorly Than When It Came Out,Revolt-Monkey,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some documentaries are wrong from the start, and others manage to become even more laughable with time. Rigged falls into the latter category-a paranoid, self-serious attempt to paint Mark Zuckerberg as the mastermind behind Trump's 2020 loss, a claim that was absurd when it was made and is downright humiliating in retrospect. Watching it now is like reading an ancient prophecy that not only failed to come true but backfired so badly that its authors should be hiding in shame.The film builds its entire case on the idea that Zuckerberg's funding of election infrastructure was part of a grand Democratic conspiracy to ""rig"" the election against Trump. It strings together ominous music, cherry-picked statistics, and dramatic talking heads who say ""follow the money"" as if they've cracked the Da Vinci Code. But there's just one problem: time has obliterated its entire premise.Since the film's release, Zuckerberg has gone from alleged anti-Trump villain to one of his most eager enablers. He reinstated Trump's social media accounts, relaxed Facebook's moderation policies to benefit conservatives, and has made it abundantly clear that his real priority is staying on the good side of power-whoever holds it. The idea that he was ever some leftist puppet master working to bring Trump down is now so ridiculous that even the most diehard MAGA loyalists should feel a deep, existential embarrassment for ever believing it.If Rigged was already weak when it came out, it is now a full-blown joke. What was intended as an expos√© has instead become a time capsule of delusion, a testament to how quickly political narratives can collapse under the weight of reality. If you enjoy watching once-confident conspiracy theories crumble before your eyes, this film might actually be worth your time. Otherwise, it's best left in the scrapheap of failed propaganda.",False
10,9,I get it,scrantonbrett,n/a,15/08/2025,"Depending on where you live, elections are often rigged especially, for me personally, in Chicago and the suburbs. The dead vote, and they vote democrat. My father passed on 1975, but after hearing about the fraud, in 2002 I got the proper paperwork done to see his voting record, as I am his only child so that made it easier. I found my dad, who was an independent, had been voting and voting straight ticket Democrat through the 2000 elections. So, I went through some steps to make sure he is listed as deceased, by election officials and check on it every 4 years.so watching this and knowing in Illinois this is how they get illegals or felons to be able to vote as long as it's democrat, really it has zero shock factor for me. I'm simply glad I live in a state now that holds to verifying IDs. Sure, they tried to pull it off in Indianapolis, and silently people went to jail, but it wasn't over the 2020 presidential vote, everyone knows Indiana goes Republican on that, to many votes to even attempt over coming. So, in the end, l was not surprised by this, at all. Is it all true, maybe, maybe not but I recommend you check on your deceased parents voting record since they passed. I repeat, this is how they get people who do not have the right to vote, to vote.",False

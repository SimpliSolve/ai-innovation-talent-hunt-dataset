1,9,Biniam Girmay,jmcvandijk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great story about a very nice and very modest Eritrean cyclist. I never realized what perseverance and sacrifices it means to be able to participate in Tour de France, Vuelta and Giro.....
That there are cyclist even in a remote and very unsure country as Eritrea - that, don't forget, is an independent state since 1993 only - is due to the fact that that part of Africa was longtime (1880-1940) occupied by Italy. And Fascist Military Forces sent by Mussolini ruled in Ethiopia from 1935 tout 1941. African cyclisme was started by Italians!But I have quite some admiration too for his really sympahic wife that isn't always able to follow her husband during his European and Asiatic journeys.Flemish cineast Lieven Corthouts was able to follow Biniam Girmay during more than six years. That for sure was a guarantee for this successful and fascinating documentary.",False

1,10,Engaging and emotional,felicityktownsend,n/a,15/08/2025,"As someone who didn't really know of The Angels before the film, I found the story to be an engaging insight into the life of the band. The excitement of the rockstar lifestyle is carefully interwoven with moments of vulnerability that provides a strong emotional core to the story. The tensions between the band members are explored sensitively, and the animations enhance the humorous moments.There is a distinct tonal transition between the first half of the film which captures the fun and anticipation of the band's rise to fame, and the second half, which delves into the interpersonal tensions and personal tragedies, however the film ends on an uplifting note that emphasises reconnection.",False
2,10,Am I ever going to see your face again,brian-97943,n/a,15/08/2025,"Loved The Angels from day one. I thought that this would be your standard rock documentary... So Wrong. Great theatre and very engaging. Laughed, smiled, tears and all other emotions in 90 mins. The way that the stories are weaved throughout the movie is pure magic.Sometimes a bit heavy on the Brothers relationship, however it creates a powerful vision of the dynamics in every successful rock band.Great respect is shown for the genius of Doc Neesum and Chris Bailey and the Impact of The Angels in the world of Music.This should be a standard formula for all Rock Docos. Far better than anything that has been created before.",False
3,10,Everyone should see this film,jennifer-nielsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Angels: Kickin' Down the Door, is one of those films that lives with you for days after you see it - hanging around and playing into your emotions as different parts of the story replay on that little cinema screen in your minds eye.Before the film, I knew a bit about The Angels - their songs and their ground breaking OS tour that laid the tracks for so many other Aussie bands who followed.Of course I loved the music in this film, but it was the story-telling that was completely captivating for me. The way the interviews were shot, the chosen archival images and videos were constructed in a way that got you up close to the band and left you feeling like you knew and loved them all by the end of the film.This is way more than a music fan film as it tells their band and personal story, and it's also a film about ordinary knock about Aussies who did extraordinary things for Australian music. (And incredibly are still at it, just like they are still 20 something!) Loved It!",False
4,10,Kick Down The Door To Grab A Ticket NOW,hanaard-02591,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a riveting, funny, sad, entertaining, brilliant roller-coaster of a film! The often-chaotic personal relationships involving the band members , their families and their entourage were fascinating and compelling to watch. The interviews, archival footage, photos and animations, interspersed with their signature music clips, combined into a really emotional, engaging narrative. (Yes, I cried!....but laughed and learned a lot too!).Being a privileged observer of the Angels' private lives and being immersed in their addictive music was an unforgettable movie experience.Whether you're an Angels fan or not, just go out and grab a ticket. Seriously: it's well worth it!",False
5,10,Bloody Brilliant,harryhammett,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fantastic documentary from start to finish! Great storytelling that encapsulated so many of the highs and lows of the angels. As someone who only really knew of them from their songs, learning about the crazy journey The Angels went through was fantastic.The pacing of the documentary highlighted all the highs and lows of the band and pushed the storytelling to another level.The unique approach to the way Doc Neeson was included in the storytelling process (almost like a ghost reminiscing) was fantastic.A must see, even if you are not an Angels fan. If you already are a fan, I promise you'll enjoy their music even more!",False

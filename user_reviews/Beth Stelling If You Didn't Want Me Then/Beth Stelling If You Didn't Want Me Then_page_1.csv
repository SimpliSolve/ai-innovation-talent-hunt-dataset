1,6,one hour of beth,ksf-2,n/a,17/08/2025,"Standup comedy of thirty seven year old beth stelling. She does an hour of standup in dayton, ohio. She jokes about aging, her childhood, her babysitters, visiting her dad in florida. And all his pet raccoons. On his christmas card. Camping alone. Bad experiences with birth control. She asked the audience for input, but didn't spend much time on that. Some funny stuff, but also some pretty awkward material. It's mostly good. Currently on netflix. Directed by fellow comedian mo welch. Actual photos of raccoons included. Hot off the press! Just released, october of 2023. Stelling was nominated for the writers guild award for I love you america.",False

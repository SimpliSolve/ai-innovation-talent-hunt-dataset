1,7,Finally!,asc85,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although this received excellent critical reviews and was only 69 minutes long, I wasn't sure how much I would like this one for two reasons. The first one was that the three prior reviews before me on IMDb were not very positive. The second reason is that over the years, Holocaust movies no longer break any new ground, and I find them to be mostly derivative. If you see my IMDb review for ""Final Account,"" you will see that most people don't like that I didn't fall all over myself saying how great that documentary is. That's because I've seen that kind of Holocaust film (documentary or dramatic movie) so many times that I don't learn anything new, and it's an absolute bore.So why did I l like ""Three Minutes: A Lengthening"" more? I liked it more because it was a fresher take on the genre, and explored the Holocaust off of a recently discovered home movie taken pre-Holocaust in Poland, and the search to learn more about the town of Nasielsk, and if anyone could recognize any of the people in the home movie, and if anyone who was seen in those three minutes was still alive. I found this all to be very interesting. I also found the eyewitness accounts of what happened in Nasielsk a few years later when the Germans came in to round up all the Jews to be especially sad and powerful.",False
2,8,Memory on Film,ricardojorgeramalho,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an unusual documentary that attests to the strength of the cinematographic image in recording the collective memory, not only of a people, but of humanity itself.On a tourist trip to Europe, in the summer of 1938, an American businessman of Polish and Jewish origin, films three and a half minutes of the life of a small town, North of Warsaw, Naselsk, where his wife was originally from.Popular curiosity causes around 150 people, mostly children, to appear in this small, partially colored, film.Just one year later, almost the entirety of this Jewish population was taken to ghettos in various parts of Poland by the Nazis, and will end up exterminated in Treblinka or on the way to this infamous camp.The few survivors recognize some faces, names and buildings from the film, thus contributing to the preservation of the memory of those people, abandoned by their own God.An impressive experience.",False
3,6,A Fair Snippet's of Life,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Originally Premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival in the Spotlight Selection.""Three Minutes: A Lengthening"" is about a snippet of 16mm film offers an emotionally charged, meditative glimpse into the lives of the unsuspecting Jewish citizens of a small Polish village at the precipice of World War II. Director Bianca Stigter uses an entire 16mm film to offer a nostalgic experience about the topics of WWII and the Jewish people and it was an interesting take on researching and covering the topic from a cinematic lens. The presentation is well presented with really good uses of archival footage used throughout the entire film. The footage helps to add a feel of the past, the old days and what it must have felt like during the WWII years.Helena Boham Carter's narration does provide the information nicely and her voice fits the scenario pretty well. However, the documentary does feel like it's a bit stale since the entire film is using footages, which does get a bit old at the end of the film. The pacing really really does drag and because of that, it made some parts unsatisfying and not as engaging as I was hoping for. Certain sound designs were noticeable that had some poor structures and some editing could be improved. In my opinion, this would have worked as a short film rather then being a feature limit film.Overall, It's interesting to see a documentary about the Jewish people's lives in Poland from old archival footages but I feel like it was a little underwhelming by the end of the day. But I still recommend for those who are interested.Rating: B-",False
4,n/a,"A commendable examination on film, using film",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bianca Stigter's fascinating semi-experimental Documentary literally takes three minutes of 16mm home movie footage and examines it in extraordinary detail. Save for one very very brief shot, we see nothing else but that film during the course of the suitably brief 69 minutes.Taken on a European vacation in 1938 by David Kurtz the precious (and, at the time, expensive) footage has quick bits in Paris and Geneva, but the prime focus here is the film he shot in Nasielsk Poland. It was predominantly Jewish, and as fate would have it, be largely wiped out by the Nazis the very next year. In a way, THREE MINUTES is like a tragic ghost story - the viewer haunted by the notion that most of the faces we see would be gone so soon thereafter. Remarkably, through research and interviews, Stigter and her team were not only able to name some of the people we see, but even track down a survivor.THREE MINUTES is a laudable effort in film examination. No footage so brief has probably been so thoroughly gone over since the Zapruder film. Stigter has done a remarkable job of not only exploring the celluloid for its historical value, but, also giving an afterlife of sorts to the men, women and children of Nasielsk.",False
5,7,Revealing look into Poland's dying pre-WW II era,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Three Minutes: A Lengthening"" (2022 release; 69 min) opens, we immediately get the entire 3+ min. Footage that was filmed in 1938 in a small village north of Warsaw, Poland. The footage is law quality at times, and high quality at times, and goes back and forth between B&W and color. The voice over (by Helen Bonham Carter) informs us that the footage was discovered in 2009 in Florida, by the grandson of the guy who filmed it. But what are we actually seeing in those 3+ minutes?Couple of comments: this is directed by Dutch film maker Bianca Stigter. Here she assesses what we actually see in this historic footage. Glenn Kurtz, grandson of David Kurtz who filmed this while on a tourist trip across Europe, is intrigued and wants to know more: where was this filmed? Who is being filmed? Etc. So this is not unlike putting together a puzzle, albeit hampered by a 70 years delay, during which most (but not all) of these people have perished and much (but not all) if the small village has been torn down and/or rebuilt. Like revealing an onion's layer after layer, more information is revealed to us. The film makers do an excellent job putting it all together in a way that combines history and mystery, paying tribute to the erstwhile population of a small Polish village whose Jewish population was decimated by the Holocaust.I readily admit I had not heard of this film, that is until I read NPR's list of the ""50 Best Movies and TV of 2022"" earlier this week, and I immediately knew I just had to see this. The fact that it is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes certainly didn't hurt either. ""Three Minutes: A Lengthening"" is currently streaming on Hulu, where I caught it last night. If you have any interest in the Holocaust or Europe's pre-WWII era, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
6,9,Breaking Down the Documentary Rules,rbernst-48300,n/a,16/08/2025,"Avoided the talking head regime of most documentaries and the flashbacks to coverage that is not relevant. Completely authentic and therefore powerful. Town of Nasielsk, Poland comes alive in this three minute documentary. I had a strong feeling for it because I have just written a new novel, The Girl Who Counted Numbers, Amsterdam Publishers, Out on October 12th on Amazon. Much of the book reflects to characters who lived in Rozvadow, Poland, a shtetl about the same size as Nasielsk, destroyed when the Nazis arrived. I visited Rozvadow and there is a resemblance to Nasielsk. Buildings around a town square. Farmers, Storekeepers. Children playing. A sense of the neighborhood is very keen and most of all life seems to be normal. In this documentary things appear and reappear, come back and leave, emphasizing the patterns of life in the village. This is true in Rozvadow, Poland, too. I wish that I could have seen a three minute film of Rozvadow,Poland.",False
7,7,Time is the defining factor,michaelhamhigh,n/a,16/08/2025,"The three minutes (and 53 seconds) are a home movie of the Jewish inhabitants of Nasielsk, a Polish village near the Ukrainian border, shot in 1938 by visiting American businessman, David Kurtz, who was making a tour of Europe with his wife and three friends. On Thurs 4th August, they visited the place his family had emigrated from and shot Kodachrome footage, some in black and white, some colour, of around 150 of its population. Less than a hundred of Nasielsk's 4,000 Jewish inhabitants would survive the Holocaust.The Lengthening is the hour (just over) Stigter's film spends exploring the images, trying to identify the people, draw out meaning and recount their fates. The poignancy of this footage is a given, but you may wonder whether some of Stiger's strategies - running the film in reverse, isolating individual faces - really add much to our understanding. I would, very respectfully, take issue with the assertion that the Holocaust is what makes Kurtz's film poignant. Any footage of people from the past has a desperate sadness. Time is the defining factor and its passing is the obscenity that gives it meaning.",False
8,10,Captivating. Brings this village to life,mschrock,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are certainly plenty of holocaust documentaries and movies available. Frankly we should watch all the footage there is. Every one I watch, I come away knowing or feeling a little bit more empathy for the people of the time, and most especially it's victims.This one takes fullest advantage of 3 little minutes, innocently shot in a small village in Poland. By the time the film ended you had to be impressed with the volume of confirmed information gleaned from the footage. The fact they were able to put names on so many faces, AND were able to document what happened to most everyone in the village only a few years later, was impressive. Hearing one survivor, that was recognized, describe what he recalled brought the village to life.This film, more than many, personifies individuals of the time, and helps the viewer feel (at least a tiny bit) what it must have been like to have lived in Poland in late 1938. It certainly made an impression on me.",True
9,8,An important film,LW-08854,n/a,16/08/2025,"An important film with good narration which I learnt quite a lot from. The most powerful part for me was the section on the community being beaten and rounded up to be taken away during December 1939. The film is short, about an hour or so, it pulls as much as it possibly can from 3 minutes of archive footage. It lacks context or explanations though about why this was happening, what was the situation in Germany and Poland during the 1930s. It never matches the film Shoah in it's scope and filmmaking art, in fact there is something quite uncinematic about this, possibly to do with the fact it was made during various Covid lockdowns in different countries. It is quite informative though and deals with a very important subject matter.",False
10,n/a,Not engaging,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unless you have a personal connection to the Holocaust or unless you have professional interest in it, boredom is likely to wash over you as you watch this documentary. I won't recommend Three Minutes: A Lengthening to others. There is an obvious peril in taking three minutes of film and trying to stretch it into an hour-long documentary.This documentary appeals to a fairly small number of people. I'm surprised by the generally positive reviews it has received if I'm being honest. Folks should be brave enough to characterize work like this as the underwhelming production that it is. You can take a pass on watching Three Minutes: A Lengthening without missing out on much.",False

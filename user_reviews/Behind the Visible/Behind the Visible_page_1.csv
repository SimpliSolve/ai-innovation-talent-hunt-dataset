1,10,"Intimate, Informative, Educational, Emotional",jacquelyngillaspie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Behind the Visible tells an important story that has never been told: that of the millions of people who suffer from POTS (Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome). Ashley Rippentrop takes you along on her own journey of being diagnosed with POTS and the way it affects her day to day life. Along her journey, other POTSies invite the viewer into their lives and experiences too, giving you the unique picture that not every POTS case is the same. Through the testimony of patients and doctors, Ashley Rippentrop brings awareness to a condition that is invisible, which acts as a reminder that you never really know what a person is going through behind the visible. This intimate documentary is beautifully made, well edited, and is sure to make you feel curious, uncomfortable, happy and sad, laugh and cry, and ultimately more aware of the people around you.",False
2,10,"Amazing, Inspiring & Emotional",supergrl00,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not only have I suffered from POTS since 2012 but I connected with the many people interviewed and followed in their own story. This will help bring awareness to something that is slowly coming into the spotlight with how many people are developing it because of so many different things. I feel like the experiences of all are so similar but different in many ways. One day isn't going to look the same as the next. Amazing! Made me laugh, cry and just... I felt heard.",False
3,10,Absolutely Incredible,heatgoat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Behind the Visible is an amazing film that shows what it's like living with POTS. It's educational and accurate and all around amazing. To have a film that depicts a chronic illness that is accurate is few and far between but this film goes above and beyond. It is a must watch. As someone who lives with POTS it is amazing to feel seen and understood and for my friends and family this is so helpful. While it does focus on POTS, I believe this is an important for anyone living with a chronic illness. I cannot wait until this is available to the public so that all my friends and family can watch it and so that I can rewatch it. I cannot say enough good things about this film.",False
4,10,"Amazing, raw, genuine",mkeane-29681,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary encompasses a host of emotions from laughter to tears, to stories of hope, creditable and scholarly doctors such as Dr. Grubb. It showcases many individuals in which lead all different lifestyles and experience a host of different symptoms on a daily basis. It's a ""full circle"" film as to what Dysautonomia patient may experience from the beginning of their diagnosis to finding their ""hope in the unknown"" after having sole knowledge in to what the future may look for them. A must watch for both a Dysautonomia patient and any loved ones alike, as it is very informative for both audiences.Ashley and Cort did an wonderful job piecing this amazing documentary together to shine light in hopes of raising more awareness for us with POTS.A must watch!",False
5,10,Educational,rwr-22907,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a much needed film that unveils the reality of invisible illness while raising awareness on an under recognized syndrome: POTS. Thank you for such a informative film.,False
6,10,I'm finally validated. Beautifully made.,olivia-40920,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't praise this film enough for the exposure it's bringing and validating me when I needed it most. I was battling one of my lowest points mentally during my almost decade long battle with POTS. After receiving the same diagnosis again here in Tokyo, Japan (the first time being in Philadelphia) and being told yet again ""there is no cure"" , I felt crushed.I had reached a breaking point of not being able to work for weeks on end due to COVID and getting continuous viral infections, surprisingly showing up negative for PCR testing (they think due to the POTS and some suspected underlying conditions making me catch other viruses in the meantime) and then this came out. The timing was impeccable. I was honestly thinking there was no point to keep fighting and I'd be better off ending it. I hope the film-makers know they are saving lives with this. It definitely saved mine and reminded me I'm not alone in this battle. None of us are. My plans for life may need to change and may be a little different but that doesn't mean it has to end.This film is educational, yet very real and showed what I've been trying to explain to others for years but never had the words to.It honestly means the world to me that this came out and that I can share it with others. I was crying my heart out cause I knew exactly how it all felt. I hope this helps those who come after me receive a little more acceptance then I did.",False
7,10,We are not alone !,wdtwygk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this was amazing, inspirational , emotional, and overall great. Everyone who watched this knows they aren't alone. We are not alone. I sobbed while watching this because it's crazy how so many people are going through the same struggles.",False
8,7,Eye Opening,hardbutitsfair,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hi. I would like to say that my wife and I watched the movie and it had us in tears. I am an Army Veteran that has seen more than 10 specialist at the VA hospital where I live, but NONE of them have been able to diagnose me, give me any clue about what I'm going through and refuse to do the extra research on the information that I've provided them. What I do get from them is crazy looks and I'm being told that I'm making these symptoms up. I wish there was a way to email them a copy of this film, so they could see someone that goes through a piece of what I go through on a daily basis. You guys have something special here. Congrats and Thank you so much.I would like to be featured in your next film, being a Black Man with POTS, Dysautonomia and MCAS. After speaking with another doctor, I might have EDS also, so I think I would be an excellent choice to be interviewed. I would like to help raise awareness of these illnesses, like you, anyway possible. You have my support, if you want it. Please make this video available to recorded and passed on when possible, I would love to give a copy to my multiple providers, so they can have for knowledge.Keep spreading the word!!Junius.",False
9,10,ðŸ™Œ,AnnieHartman10,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a very well-produced, and intriguing film about an illness most people do not talk about. There had not been a documentary about POTS before this, and this will serve as an insightful and original source to understand the chronic illness. Everyone in this film had an interesting piece to add to the overall film. The scenes were real, raw, and authentic. This film will provoke conversions about invisible illnesses, and amplify the voices of those who have been struggling.",False
10,10,"Powerful, Authentic Depiction of Chronic Illness",leviremi,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie means so much to me. My partner has been living with POTS for over 6 years now, and no piece of media has ever resonated with our experience more than Behind the Visible. I love how this film captures so many different sides of the illness through varying kinds of people and circumstances.The experiences caught on film are incredibly raw and honest. They are compiled together in a very impactful manner with thoughtful interviews and narration tying it all together to tell a cohesive and intimate story about the chronically ill human experience.I'm grateful for all of the participants who exposed their vulnerabilities for the sake of such an important documentary. It's clear how much love went into the making of this movie, and everyone who worked on it should be very proud of what they accomplished.I hope this film can get distributed to VOD services and reach a wider audience, as the information and stories it conveys are so important to share. Especially now that we're in a post-COVID world where many long-haulers are developing POTS or other similar conditions.",False
11,10,Blessed that this documentary was made!,lkmccandless,n/a,16/08/2025,"What great stories and showing the true struggles us Potsies go thru on a daily basis. It was great to sit there with my husband and feel you are not alone. I look forward to other family members to watch this and see POTS is real. And it is different for everyone. When she pulled out all her medicine I said ""oh my lord that looks like what I have"". I can't thank everyone enough for participating and spreading the word!",False
12,10,Amazing,hvxwcwvk,n/a,16/08/2025,Words cannot describe how groundbreaking this film was for the potsie community.,False
13,10,"What a gift, this film!",brookgauthier,n/a,16/08/2025,"Crossing fingers for greater distribution. Especially with so many people newly encountering this post-covid, this film needs a broad exposure on platforms to get out there and touch people's lives. The stories move, inspire, inform and give voice to a compelling group of people who are doing everything they can to thrive amidst adversity.",False
14,10,I would give it more than 10 stars if I could!,jordancone,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was fantastic. I appreciated that they showed people with dysautonomia functioning at all different levels. The documentary did a great job of letting you get to know each person's personality while seeing their struggles and triumphs. There were several moments where I could personally relate and that was comforting to see.,False
15,10,A must see doc shining light on invisible illness.,kariboss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Chronic illness can feel so isolating and is so often misunderstood. This documentary shines light on the realities of POTS & made me, as someone with it, feel so much more understood in my battle with the illness. It is always so encouraging to know other people are going through the same things & understand what it's like. The film also gives me great hope for POTS awareness & understanding being spread to the world!",False
16,10,Not just for POTS or Dysautonomia,CN-301406,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found Behind the Visible to be an honest, transparent, and ultimately deeply encouraging look at what it means to have your life disrupted by chronic illness. I loved that the documentary included the stories of multiple individuals with such different histories, dreams, life situations, and voices, but all with similar themes. I cried as I listened to their stories, but ultimately I was so encouraged by their strength, their persistence, and the reality that those of us who struggle with chronic illness of any kind are not alone.",False
17,10,"A ""must see"" film",linda-23716,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the moment the documentary began, I was drawn in. The filming was extremely compelling, showing the narrator as a happy go lucky child and contrasting those scenes with scenes from a hospital bed and agonizing pain. Anyone suffering from an ""invisible illness"" one that the sufferer feels but can often cover up, and hence those around them not being able to understand and support them needs to be acknowledged. I would highly recommend this film not only to those who do suffer with an invisible illness, but to those who have no idea that perhaps, even our closest friends, are affected without our knowledge.",False
18,10,"Powerful, Moving and Validating!",robin-87646,n/a,16/08/2025,"Behind the Visible is a powerful and moving film. Thank you to everyone involved who worked on this production to help bring awareness to POTS.

A must see!",False
19,10,Out of the darkness into the light,whaldolphin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you so much for putting a voice and a vision behind what we have all been experiencing for so many years. Although our story's may be different to some degree we all share so many similarities and watching this documentary made me feel less alone in this battle. Knowing this documentary will be made public gives us the hope that the general public and healthcare agencies will pay more attention to those suffering for so long undiagnosed.Thank you, great work!",False
20,10,Make this mandatory for medical school students!,staceylara-83692,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was so well done. I felt so inspired. The open and raw way the interviewees shared thier story allowed me to get a glimpse into their lives and I am sure it just barely scratches the surfaces of their reality. As the parent of two children with POTS I feel like this was a gift to this community to show just how hard patients fight to get a diagnosis and treatment.; not to mention their daily struggles.I hope it becomes mandatory for medical school students to watch!,False
21,10,"AMAZING, educational, & comforting",klarkin-57465,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was by far one of the best documentaries I have watched. It was informational (without being overwhelming with facts), gave me peace & strength as a fellow POTSIE, and showed others vulnerably sharing their truth. Chronic illness is tough, but having one that is invisible is even more difficult. My husband and I cried throughout the whole film, but for different reasons. This was therapy for us both. I hope this film will be offered on a streaming channel like Netflix or Amazon so it can reach even more people. It will really help push POTS on another platform for awareness. Thank you Ashley for this film.",False

Beautiful experiences and incredible stories of strength and perseverance!,False
23,9,Finally seen. Connections are everything,aprille-byam,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone recently diagnosed w POTS, this was in part my story. I felt seen. I cried. It is so immensely valuable to show what so many go through. I cannot wait to share this w friends and coworkers.",False

25,10,"Powerful, moving, and honest!",eacact,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are few movies that I think about and want to rewatch again. This is that kind of movie. As someone who has been diagnosed with POTS, this movie is extremely personal. Watch it with your friends, and your family so they can see deeper into this invisible illness. Behind the Visible has real life stories, talented doctors and a captivating story line. Watch this. You will not be disappointed. I truly hope this film will get POTS out there and increase research and awareness.",False

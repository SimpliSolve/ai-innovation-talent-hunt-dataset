1,8,Really well done!,christinemcclellan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was worried that this would be a promotional, highly curated view into Blackpink's career - but it really felt honest and genuine. The girls show a lot of emotion and don't hide the fact that their job really takes a toll on their health and personal lives. I've never been a Blackpink super fan, just listened to some of their music, but I gained a ton of respect for them after watching this.",False
2,6,A brief look at the world of K-Pop from the perspective of the girls that 'won'.,QuickTion,n/a,15/08/2025,"First of all, I wasn't a fan of Blackpink or K-pop in general when I watched this. There are a few things about this doc I really liked, but there were also some significant cons.First of all, I really fancied the way they made the members look way less 'perfect' than they are portrayed in other media. You get footage of studio sessions, live concerts as well as footage from their time in training. This made the doc feel much more genuine than I initially expected, and makes it a must-watch for any hardcore Blackpink-fan.Another pro of this film is that they definitely don't glorify the k-pop industry. These very charismatic girls tell many a tale of the insane work-hours and other struggles that they experienced in their training and their touring schedule. I found it quite interesting to hear about the insane training facility these girls were in, fighting against very difficult competition and working 28 days a month for 14 hours a day; for YEARS on end.I missed a bit more of this critical view though. The industry itself is extremely commercialized and competitive, and instead of exploring these very serious downsides of the industry, these are only briefly mentioned. I would have liked the doc to have explored these negatives much more, but i guess that wasn't possible (don't want the production company to get a bad rep). The harsh reality of the K-pop industry shines through the cracks of this documentary on occasion: The girls sitting around after a recording session, them crying on stage because of their homesickness and of course their stories about missing out on so much of their childhood and adolescence.The biggest flaw i had with this doc is that it doesn't really go in-depth on any part of the story, and generally lacked a storyline or purpose. I don't feel like i learned a lot about the K-pop industry, nor do i feel like i really got to know this group that much. This film would have benefited from a much longer runtime. The 80 minutes don't give enough time to explore the many interesting facets of this group and the industry as a whole. We get an introduction to each of the girls, get some recording and touring footage, then, before you know it, the credits are already rolling.Overall, i would 100% recommend this movie to fans of Blackpink or K-pop in general. There is a lot of interesting footage of recording, touring and the chemistry between the girls in general.I believe this movie is much less interesting for people that have no knowledge on the subject. I still enjoyed my time watching it, but there for sure are better music-documentaries out there.Overall i'd score it 6.5/10.",False
3,7,A peak behind the curtain...,tccandler,n/a,15/08/2025,"A peak behind the curtain of the biggest musical act of this generation... This documentary feels a little bit like an introduction to new fans, rather than an in-depth exploration for actual fans. It is fascinating to see these extraordinarily talented girls, behind the scenes, from discovery to debut to worldwide success. I just wish it had dug deeper. Perhaps that will come in a film a decade from now.",False
4,n/a,Inspirational and Beautiful,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm going to note my own favourite parts or anything that stood out:-At the beginning each member has their own interview. We get to see more of each of them.-I love Rosie's Australian accent so much.-Jisoo gets her makeup done at a shop and asks if she lost her baby fat. The makeup artist says she did and Jisoo says she should eat ramen tonight. She wants to keep that youthful baby look.-Their predebut videos...I've seen them on YouTube and it gives us a glimpse of them before BLACKPINK, when they were children.-Their outfits, particularly the ones in the YG predebut dance practice videos and Coachella looks TOO PERFECT - their bodies look so sexy-Jennie working out and explaining she gets sick easily was insightful.-Jisoo's hair in this one clip where they had a rehearsal looked perfect - so much volume.-Teddy Park looks so cool. He is this cute guy who was a K-pop member. He now produces every song of BLACKPINK's. So talented. He wears a mask in the film.-Lisa speaking Thai sounds just so cool.-Jisoo says it is hard because when they aren't working she feels she should be. When she is her body needs to rest.-It feels like they are being chased - what should we do now after finishing something.-Coachella was perfection. Lisa tells the audience she thinks she will remember this moment for the rest of her life.The girls talk about the reality of being idols. At their last stop on their tour Rosie says she knows they only see what is on stage and not so much of behind the scenes. She tears up and Jisoo dabs all their tears away.These four girls are such good role models. Lisa talks about her concerns about being a good enough role model - she reminisces the first time she went back to Thailand and everyone wants to be her. All the members are so kind...you can see it in their eyes and facial expressions.Another thing I can take away as well is to HAVE FUN with what you are doing. I want to try this with everything I do.One of the members says even if they grow old and get replaced by a younger generation, if ppl remember them and how brightly they shone, that is all that matters. They sit at a restaurant together at the end and talk about what life in their forties will be like. Married definitely, kids maybe. Or Rosie says they can marry later in life.",True
5,6,"Charming, YG Entertainment-approved doc of K-Pop's biggest girl group",Sir_AmirSyarif,n/a,15/08/2025,"Caroline Suh's 'BLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky' is charming and well-produced (YG Entertainment-approved, of course) but skin-deep documentary confirms what most people already know about BLACKPINK and/or the K-Pop industry. There's no real insight beyond snippets of backstage footage during the group's world tour a year ago and some pre-debut videos. Still a treat for any fan of BLACKPINK though.",False
6,10,A MUST WATCH,sooyaaaevah,n/a,15/08/2025,I loved Blackpink's documentary so much. It brought me a whole new level of respect and admiration for the girls. Thank you for doing this Netflix . Thank you YG. Thank you BLACKPINK,False
7,6,Interesting to watch. A good watch for those who don't understand Kpop or are just getting into it!!,ellagordon-54475,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not a BlackPink fan but I enjoyed this documentary. If you don't know about the Kpop industry or you are just starting to get into Kpop then you should definitely watch this. It's very informative with what you have to do to get into the Kpop industry and how hard it is on Kpop idols, the Kpop industry is very different and isn't anything like what you have to do to become a singer in the west. Each Kpop company is different too so it's interesting to see what YG is like. Since I'm not a fan I actually surprisingly liked seeing the journey the girls went though from being kids to debuting!!Good starter if you are only just becoming interested in Kpop since BlackPink are such a popular group, have very different and interesting music and can also speak multiple languages, they are a very watchable group.
For any BlackPink fans obviously you're gonna wanna watch this documentary!!Netflix definitely need more Kpop releases!!! Enjoyed this documentary, it's very well made. I do wish they could have put more performances in though but at the same time it's not a concert movie (Netflix get on with releasing Kpop concert DVD's please!!!!) :)",False
8,10,Wonderful Doc,magee-42745,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just got into BLACKPINK this summer. This doc does a great job showing who they are, where they came come from, and what they are all about.",False
9,7,Getting to know the highest-charting female kpop group,magnoliacream,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great introduction to the members of this highly successful kpop group, showing how Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa and Rose started as early teens being groomed to be part of a girl group up to their tremendous popularity all over the world.This shows how the girls were chosen from applicants from Korea, Thailand, New Zealand, Australia, etc., as well as their auditions, training for 4 to 6 years, rigorous exercise regimen and other challenges on their road to stardom.It's interesting to see members of a very successful girl band retain their sweet and friendly nature. It's probably the reason this band went to the top and why they are remaining there.",False
10,10,good intro to non kpop fans,mcalisterquentin,n/a,15/08/2025,"Kpop really isn't my thing but this docu has given me insight to what all the fuss is about. The struggles like the genres may be similar across the board but BLACKPINK has such a unique vibe about them and it tickled my fancy. Was it enough to turn me into a solid fan? For now no, but I'm definitely not changing stations if their songs come on the radio and if they have a show I wouldn't mind tuning in either. All the hype by netflix for this docu is justified, enjoyed watching it more than I thought I would.",False
11,10,Made for Blink,wanzizbakar,n/a,15/08/2025,A great documentary that show their journey from trainee days to today. Good for new blinks who that want to know them better. A lot of surprise clip that we never see. Overall its a good documentary that makes you want more of it.,False
12,4,not the best for non kpop fans to watch,actuallymonster,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not really a good delve into the kpop world for non kpop fans, plus i really learned nothing new from this documentary but whatever",False
13,10,A proud fan,sundushameed-46801,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a must watch documentary. Its happy, its sad, its emotional. I dont know what else to say. But im very happy to see them all together like sisters. Bringing stuff for us. This is really inspiring.",False
14,10,Good job Caroline!,merrillyu,n/a,15/08/2025,"Caroline really did a good job in giving us a different point of view of the girls. It showed how Blackpink is not just a band but also a family. It still amazes me how meticulous the process of forming Blackpink and their songs are. No wonder they're huge and global. I can see that they'll be in it in the long run. Also, I liked how they just clicked together as a group. It wasn't forced. Their synergy on screen and off screen are great and I think that's how they work so well together and put off an amazing show everytime. Seeing them work so hard to get what they want makes want to conquer the world myself. They just give you that kind of power after watching them. This was a great documentary for anyone who is really into music. And I mean like real music. And the journey you have to go through is amazing yet very challenging. I would recommend this to aspiring musicians. It gives you that determination to be successful like they are. Good job Caroline!",False
15,10,"The biggest global girlgroup, but they never had it easy",mdbodrulalombappy-61291,n/a,15/08/2025,"Getting to know about the entire process like from where the girls started out, their training, monthly evaluations, how they came together as a group and how they debuted was quite amazing actually.We get to see how each one of them started and mastered the skills of singing, rapping and dancing and how they make amazing music and engaging music videos for the viewers along with how they dominate the stage with their stage presence and how they enjoy themselves while performing for us.Then after a little sneak peak into their lives as global stars and how they go on with their daily lives and what they aim for future, shows a side of them that tells us that they are just as normal people as we are but with a little more of that determination and a bit more of that drive with which they were able to achieve what they have and are today.Even though I would have wanted to see a bit more about their world tour and how they dealt with the situations they faced while touring, overall I loved the movie.",False
16,10,A True story that moves and touched me!,etikapuripuri,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you Caroline to shown us the true side of the girls. I am amazed with their journey. Can you imagine 14-15 years old teenager work for 12-14 hours a day and just got 1 day off in 2 weeks? Oh god. I give all my respect to blackpink for their work hard, their amazing Music. I never like KPOP in my life. I am 40 years old and I feel I am too old for KPOP things. But blackpink! Their vibe, their unique, their attitudes, something I can't deny. Good job blackpink 👏💅. God blessed you kids 😘",False
17,n/a,Blackpink Light Up the Sky,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,I hope more Documentary like this. It was so good.,False
18,5,Taught me about K Pop but was boring,hayleedarling,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think if you're a fan of this group or music genre you will rate this documentary highly but I didn't find the story line all that interesting nor the back stories of each member. It was interesting learning how manufactured these groups are and I respect the hard work that the girls put in. Would I watch this if I wasn't a fan? Nah don't waste 1 hour and 19 minutes of your spare time, surely you can find something better.",False
19,10,Must Watch Must Stan BLACKPINK,neronagelo,n/a,15/08/2025,The ending makes me cry when they talk about getting married and having babies. Im not disappointed. STAN BLACKPINK,False

21,10,awesome film !!!!,nhatanhxitin,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the second time i have seen this awesome music title like this after Sky Tour Movie. their visual are so beautiful, 4 members all live very simply and emotionally. I like the way they guide viewers through each level of emotion. Hopefully BLACKPINK will gain more and more success on their career.",False
22,10,Inspiring!,priyapran-07076,n/a,15/08/2025,"They all went through a lot and after watching this I'm much motivated than before, inspired to do well in everything. They are great and worthy to stan i'll never regret supporting them",False
23,n/a,An Average Documentary,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,Well I liked it. It was nothing special but not bad. We get the idea about BLACKPINK and their rise towarda fame and all. I'm a huge blackpink fan and I was awaiting for this documentary the moment it was announced. Well it wasn't disappointing but it could definitely could have been better. The individual stories of the 4 stars were well explained but I think that Jisoo had a bit less role in the entire documentary. Rosè seemed like the main highlight here. The documentary does gets a bit boring in the middle but it has its parts. Overall it was an average documentary we learn some new things about the group.,False
24,2,Boring,utshakgverma,n/a,15/08/2025,It wasn't that much fun as we expected that black pink is a great musical group but still it's OK.,False
25,10,Blackpink in your netflix,iceerabanillo,n/a,15/08/2025,This docubis awesome everything is on point. Love it!,False

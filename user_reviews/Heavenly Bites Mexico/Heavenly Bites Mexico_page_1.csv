1,7,"Celebrate creativity; in any shape, form or flavor",linkogecko,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's easy to watch this series and only see the food, the calories, how unnecessary it all is. To be fair, that is most of what the series itself shows. While there are small talking head bits with science and humanities specialists explaining the biological and psychological concepts behind these creations, the sociocultural context specific to Mexico is practically not talked about.Regardless, the context IS there, if you know where to look. Many of these culinary behemoths originated in working class neighborhoods of the country and represent the inventiveness that is often needed to succeed in these communities. Repairing tools and machines with parts that don't belong to them is often seen as resourceful, and so is the unexpected substitution of ingredients in traditional recipes during periods of scarcity (like the infamous canned tomato soup cake).Then why not celebrate the resourcefulness of adding the snacks to your drink in the same glass (peanuts in Coke, micheladas)? Or putting messy foods inside a dry bread that allows more convenient eating with your hands while on the go?That being said, in celebrating these overwhelming antojitos, one also celebrates the negatives they represent. With food waste, obesity, malnutrition and their related issues all running rampant, it makes perfect sense to question the celebration of plates that are not realistically going to be eaten in their entirety. And, if they are, they won't be particularly good for their ""victims"". Considering we live in a time where every act of consumption should probably be viewed as environmental, this questioning is extremely relevant.The series takes a mostly positive approach to these concoctions, but it does leave lingering questions, with their answers not always being comfortable or clean-cut. In that sense, I think it succeeds as a documentary, where the whole story can't always be told, but the themes remain. Unquestionably, there is room for improvement in its rather superficial treatment of the subject, however.It should also be pointed out that ""Heavenly Bites"" are far from a Mexico-only phenomenon. Future seasons could easily show the most outrageous of Scotland's munchie boxes, Australia's halal snack packs, Chile's chorrillanas and so much more (the U. S. already being fairly well-represented with ""Man V. Food"" and ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"").",False
2,1,Poisonous Slop not Fit for Human Consumption,leftbanker-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Someone nails it on the head at the beginning of episode 3""Siempre estamos tratando de encontrar la forma de seguir comiendo cada vez m√°s.""
We are always looking for ways to continue eating more.Mexico had amazing food, but you don't see it in this food porn video, although food poison would be a better term. There is nothing ingested in this series that any healthy person would put into their body. All the food you see in this series seems to have been prepared by nine-year-old children with not a single thought to nutrition.Far from looking like good food, most of the slop shown in this series made me physically ill just to look at; eating it would be seriously hazardous to your health.",False
3,8,"Totally interesting, totally disgusting",joeovip,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hahaha wow, what a show of crazy stuff we mexicans eat. Great stories, great production and great photography but no for the faint heart. Watch with a warning, not necessary will you find something for you. Its just a crazy and amazing food trip towards a diabetic coma.",False
4,1,If you like tremendous amount disgusting overdone jumbled food combination,sukrancetik5,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really hoped to see everything about delicious Mexican food. But instead boring tremendous amount disgusting overdone jumbled food combinations was all over the place. If they made this series for pigs I am sure they would like it.No taste, no creativity, no quality. Obviously these nonsense TV series prepared for nothing to improve but encouraging only for mindlessly overeating.Classic Netflix case they want human age will be over soon for them just earning more money from mindless creatures.",False
5,9,The low raters missed the point of this movie,eligal-75036,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just sit back and have fun watching these crazy Mexicans, listen to their Mexican Spanish (love it) and don't expect tp learn neat recipes que vale la pena.",False
6,1,Netflix has gone full woke and we cancelled our subscriptions.,pleaseuninstallnow,n/a,15/08/2025,"Drag queens in a cooking show? Poor taste Netflix, pun intended. We stopped watching as soon as the drag queens were introduced in episode 2 and I was really looking forward to the episode that focuses on burritos. You lost 3 subscriptions because of this. My entire family cancelled Netflix in one evening and we're never looking back. Netflix has gone full woke since all they care about is pushing their agenda on everyone. And you wonder why their stock prices and subscribers have been on a steady decline. You reap what you sow. And even if you take out the drag queens, the food they covered in episodes 1 and 2 were not interesting at all.",False

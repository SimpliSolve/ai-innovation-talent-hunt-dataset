1,8,subject matter: 10; documentary: 6,nerrdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"MoviePass continues to be an object of fascination. Even though I was never a customer or investor, I found this doc engrossing.It adds some new info to the saga I never realized, namely that the two founders were black and the problem started when they had to find investors to keep their business going. White investors and white guys to run the company (and claim they founded it). Turns out they were incompetent and/or stock manipulators, oops.However, there's more to the story than this. What was the business model of the original founders? Was that ever viable? They racked up a mere 20,000 subscribers in 10 years because they were charging a reasonable price for an unlimited movie pass: $50. That's not viable, and dropping it off a cliff to $10 sure wasn't but was there ever a price point where this would have worked?I also recall that MoviePass did have some dealings with the theater chains to get them on board with MoviePass as marketing or data collection. The upshot was, the theater chains stole the idea and made their own passes. This is never mentioned at all. If the theater chains could have stolen the idea at any time and cut MoviePass out, then there was never a viable business in the first place, so this is a huge omission.Now that MoviePass is back in the hands of the original founder (not a spoiler; that was reported in the business press), he has the chance to show this idea can work. The site shows some reasonably priced plans like $10 for 3 movies (as long as you're not in NYC or SoCal, where the price is double!!!) so it does offer some discount over regular pricing but hardly enough to get anyone's pulse up.The irony is that now theaters are in serious trouble, with too few big hit movies coming out and theaters going empty. Maybe now the theater chains won't snub MoviePass, if it became a way to discount tickets in theaters that are going to sit empty anyway.Subject matter: 10; documentary: 6, averages out to an 8.",False
2,8,Interesting and well-made.,jimfinger-47793,n/a,16/08/2025,"A crisply edited, easy to follow documentary tracing the inception, initial years, popular explosion and subsequent implosion of an innovative business model within the film industry ecosystem. Candid interviews with almost all of the key personalities make for a very interesting story that tells the all-too-familiar saga of how a single business proposition can evolve in all manner of unexpected directions based on the individual goals and ideas of whoever is at the helm of a business at any given point in its evolution. Those interested in general business practices and/or movies in general are likely to be highly engaged.",False
3,7,Much more than the rise and fall of MoviePass,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""MoviePass MovieCrash"" (2024 release; 91 min.) opens, we are introduced to various key players of the original MoviePass project. It is 2016, 5 years after the start of MoviePass, and the company is making a bold move in order to grow its subscriber bas: unlimited movies, anytime, anywhere, for $9.95/mth. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Muta'Ali (""Cassius X: Becoming Ali""). Here he brings two stories in one: the rise and fall of MoviePass, a story known by many; and then there is this: did you know that MoviePass was in fact founded by two African-American guys? I didn't. And what happened to these guys? We get the full picture in this revealing documentary. This documentary reminds us of two correlating points: if something sounds too god to be true, it probably is; and corporate greed is alive and well. Mark Walhberg is credited as a co-producer.""MoviePass, MovieCrash"" premiered at this year's SXSW festival, to immediate critical acclaim. The documentary is now airing on HBO and its streaming platform Max, where I saw it the other day. It is currently rated 88% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. If you are in the mood for a documentary that goes well beyond the rise and fall of MoviePass, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,n/a,Decent yet Lacking,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is probably one of the most infamous company downfalls in recent history, and it's a great story to tell; yet I wanted more.There are a lot of talking heads with different perspectives, including most of the former board members; yet I feel I didn't see the whole picture.We are told how the original team came to be and the rise of what would've been considered the standard for movie going experiences. A proper subscription service where you can see any film, any theater anytime. Ideal and I think it would've been a good thing to continue. ESP with cinemas becoming less valued these days.We saw the back and forth between AMC, investors.We then switch once the newer CEO's come in
Remove the founders and begin a campaign that would eventually crush themselves under their own weight.While I was engaged and enjoyed the breezy feel of this doc
I felt like there was things left unsaid. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what
Maybe they had NDA's they couldn't break at the moment.Mitch Lowe comes across as a man who simply made mistakes, far from it. Pure slime along with Ted Farnsworth.The ultimate revelation comes in when it's revealed that this was a fraud scheme from the get go.And how they let the system go down while embezzling funds from the venture capital group.But by the time we get to the meat of what went wrong, it's over.Maybe it really was a, what you see is what you get.I don't know. I feel that they stretched it out more than what was needed. And more could've been said on what the core of movie pass was. How the software worked and why they didn't hire more staff.Worth a watch, but don't expect a huge revelation from it. More of a cliff notes of history.",False
5,7,Question unanswered,thomas-19009,n/a,16/08/2025,I was an original MoviePass subscriber and from day one I always wondered how can this business model be sustainable. Unfortunately this doc confirms what I knew. It wasn't. The whole story is fascinating because it was such a great idea. But the view the doc takes tries to make it seem like the two founders of the business (who were removed before it all blew up) were visionaries whose grand business model was ruined by others. They definitely were screwed but the notion that the business would have succeeded if they stayed on is preposterous. It was never going to work. Good intentions I guess but utterly unrealistic dreams. And as an OG subscriber I don't feel ripped off. It was great while it lasted but as they say nothing that good lasts forever. Worth a watch but probably only if you were a subscriber or knew something about it.,False
6,7,Good For Business School Class...,ChrisMoore-2315,n/a,16/08/2025,"...in how outsiders can wreck a company.Interesting documentary of how MoviePass came about, was taken over, and then driven into bankruptcy.Synopsis: a major investor in the start-up created by two African-American entrepreneurs brings in two outsiders, one a liar who falsely claims to have invented Netflix, another a shady financier from Wall Street. Soon these creeps oust the black founders and go down a path of wild spending and self promotion with the business news outlets and Hollywood partying and conning new investors and bankrupt the company. Laws were broken.Though the particulars are different and usually it is done legally this is a great example of hedge funds or private equity firms or mega corporations buying companies, then looting and or mismanaging them. These then end in bankruptcy or selling the dimished concerns at a great loss.Don't believe me? Google any of the following: Friendly's restaurants, DirectTV, Time Warner, GeoCities, ManorCare nursing homes, Great Western wines, or Samsonite. This is just a tiny fraction of all the examples out there.So as I said, business school students should be made aware of this dark side of American Capitalism. Not to battle this uniquely American economic system, but perhaps to improve it.",False
7,7,Long and biased but interesting,Edge49,n/a,16/08/2025,I had a membership to moviepass in 2017? I think. I remember thinking it was the greatest thing. I belonged to it for like 3 months and only saw 1 or 2 movies. They got my money! LolThis ran a little long. It was over an hour and a half and could've been shortened to an hour and still kept the important details in it. Most documentaries are like that though.I had to roll my eyes when they discussed the two founding members being black and that that was a reason for them being fired. I understand having that thrown in because this was made during the early 2020's and that's when race and gender was all anyone talked about. It wasn't necessary for the overall message of the documentary.,False
8,10,Great behind the scenes look,dark41969-818-469810,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was such a great documentary on a story I didn't know much about. I knew about Movie Pass, but had no idea it was invented by two very knowledgeable & business minded African American men. I only saw the two White ceo-s on interviews claiming to be the co-founders. This documentary shined the light on corporate greed & racism in corporate American business dealings. The fact that they stole the company from the two real founders & drove the company into bankruptcy was appalling. I went from anger to sadness to joy & hope. I'm so glad 1 of the real co-founders was able to require his company & fulfill his vision. It's a necessary tale to anyone who wants to get into business & fulfill their dreams. The documentary's pacing is excellent & has candid interviews. It isn't afraid to ask tough questions & get to the truth. Well worth the watch for any documentary lover.",True
9,10,Worth watching! The rise and fall of Moviepass is astonishing,austinbounceback,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary showed why Moviepass failed, how its original founders were rugged. The people behind Moviepass failure repeated it again in another public traded company called Vinco Ventures. Its essentially Moviepass 2.0, acquire public companies, hype it up with sub-par product, hang out with hollywood, neglect the product, spend more money. Similarities of Vinco and Moviepass goes hand and hand. This time around instead of movies subscription business, it's a ""TikTok competitor"" Ted Farnsworth is a sick man, he deserves all the jail time in the world plus more. Can't wait until the sequel to Moviepass 2.0 - Vinco Ventures.",False
10,3,"Unbelievable, all too believable story",greatandimproving,n/a,16/08/2025,"Classic before-and-after tale of a company's glory days under the founders before corporate egos come in and drive it into the ground. MoviePass, MovieCrash concerns the ill-fated MP subscription service that allowed members to attend multiple screenings for a flat monthly fee. Kind of like the Netflix formula, but for actual theatergoers.In this case glory days is relative since the business model was not sustainable to begin with. The founders seem indifferent to having lost 'only' a few $100K per month when compared to the $30Mil burn rate of their hedge fund-backed successors, but to me that almost misses the point. Yes one was embarrassing while the other was downright absurd, but neither was poised for success. After all, the concept of all-you-can-eat should be used as a temporary bridge rather than a long-term plan, and any company whose survival relies on users NOT taking advantage of why they signed up is doomed no matter who's at the helm- be it the charming founders, the greedy businessmen or any of their acolytes. In hindsight the blame game appears even more trivial given that MoviePass went bankrupt in January 2020; would the pandemic not have wiped them out regardless?I would have been ok had the filmmakers left it there, but they do favor one side over the other (you can guess which one) and romanticize their journey as they prepare for a re-launch today. So it could be worth your time to see how persuasively that argument is made. Otherwise I'd just lump MoviePass in with all the other victims of streaming (there've been too many) and this film as one long commercial for what they plan to do next. I do hope they make it because I still treasure going out to the movies, but I doubt I'd go for this one.",False
11,n/a,"Standard doc has some good interviews, if little insight",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was just about to sign up for MoviePass in 2018 when it started to have ""issues"" and started changing its terms and conditions. And, then there were stories about regular users getting 'throttled' so they couldn't access the service.Muta 'Ali's HBO Documentary takes a pretty standard approach with talking heads, clips etc.. What it does have in its favor is access to several of the key players in the saga including the two original founders, Stacy Spikes and Hamet Watt, and the man who aced them out of their own company, Mitch Lowe. Things came all crashing down when Lowe brought in Ted Farnsworth (he did not co-operate in this film).While there is no doubt that having so many principals on the record (including investors, former employees and customers), it does seem as if Ali didn't press them enough. It takes almost 40 minutes for the filmmakers to clearly state the obvious flaw in the MoviePass model - how can you give away more in services (movie tickets) than you take in in subscriptions - and still make a profit? The other big ominous cloud in the story is the mysterious investment firm Hudson Bay. That angle,too, is pressed hard enough.The documentary does the basics here, but little more. Co-founder Spikes bought the company back from bankruptcy and it's still hanging around today, but nowhere never the level it had at it's peak. The issue remains the same - large profits seem nearly impossible to attain unless either: A. A bunch of your subscribers DON'T use your service. Or, B. The movie theater chains give MoviePass discounted tickets (of course, the chains' decided to just start their own subscriber services).",False
12,10,This is the best movie for everybody,chetrydevilangel,n/a,16/08/2025,"""MoviePass, MovieCrash"" is an engaging and thought-provoking documentary that successfully captures the essence of a cultural phenomenon while offering critical insights into systemic issues within entrepreneurship. Muta'Ali's direction shines through as he weaves together personal stories with broader societal critiques, making this film relevant for both casual viewers and those interested in business dynamics.The documentary not only provides a nostalgic trip down memory lane for those who remember MoviePass's heyday but also serves as an important reminder of the lessons learned from its downfall. With its rich storytelling and compelling perspectives, ""MoviePass, MovieCrash"" is undoubtedly a must-watch for anyone interested in understanding the complexities behind one of modern cinema's most fascinating stories.",False
13,1,No Accountability for the victim hero,rossplosive,n/a,16/08/2025,"The entire film is a complaint peice blaming the establishment for their bad decisions.Claiming black people don't get a chance, white people get all the chances, and their chances got taken away by evil whites; like they didn't know any better or received fair compensation. They never once tell how many millions they made. They will only admit, they signed the contracts because the business was about to fail. They sold their voting rights, their company rights many different times but it's never told how much they received in compensation? Why did they sign these contracts? The only answer ever given is they were bamboozled. The viewer needs to know how many millions they got to be bamboozled. How many times was this unprofitable business propped up by people they knew didn't sell legitimate products. They 100% knew this, because at the end of the movie it's shown the white people they sold the business to have been running the same MLM over and over for years.They had an unviable business and took money from MLM scammers and are now complaining for over an hour and a half.The filmmaker tells the same story three different ways so I feel like I could've been done with this after 30 minutes.",False
14,5,Repetitive yet doesn't answer basic questions,Norman_French,n/a,16/08/2025,"So MoviePass was supposed to evolve into something more like a profitable loyalty card -- AFTER enough market share was captured to have ""clout"" with the studios and theater chains. At least this was the initial claim (but eventually the employees knew it would never happen). So I have some questions.1) Why SHOULD everyone pay a flat rate? Shouldn't people who see more movies pay more? You can counter with examples of streaming services, but their business model is more conducive to flat-rate subscriptions (e.g., they don't maintain physical theaters).2) What was the ""secret sauce"" that would prevent a competitor from stealing their idea? What exactly was MoviePass bringing to the table OTHER than an arguably interesting vision?3) Why was losing ANY money considered OK, given pundits kept questioning the business model?4) Why was subsidizing theater ticket purchases considered a success and/or ""disruption""? Wouldn't throwing money at people in other ways cause other ""disruptions""?5) Why didn't employees quit when things got out of hand?There are interesting elements to the story, so I'm giving this five stars despite the poor pacing and lingering questions.",False
15,2,2nd Attempt (Don't waste your time with this),BlueEyes1980,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here's hoping this review will actually post this time. For whatever reason my initial attempt at posting this review didn't go through maybe because it was too long with too many details...Anyway, in short I would not recommend this to anyone. It certainly had promise because I was interested in the story, as this happened recently, however I couldn't even finish watching it because of the victim mentality. I really wish documentaries would at least try to stick to the facts instead of telling a biased narrative, with a crystal clear agenda. It also seemed to become repetitive, so this was the point I just turned it off. Kudos to anyone who actually finished this, unfortunately I couldn't.",False

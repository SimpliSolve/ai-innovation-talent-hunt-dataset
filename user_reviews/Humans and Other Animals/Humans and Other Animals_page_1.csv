1,10,A MUST SEE,xzqdrjk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Humans and other animals is a powerful documentary that explores the idea that we are not so different from our nonhuman animal kin. It reinforces that we have a duty to protect them, respect them, and embrace our similarities. The director takes us on a journey that gives mindblowing evidence that humans and nonhuman animals have more in common than previously explored or even documented. There are many informative interviews with experts in animal behavior and advocates. This documentary is really well done and will appeal to vegans, non vegans and anyone in between. This is definitely a must see!",False
2,10,Thought-Provoking and Entertaining,alysounmahoney,n/a,16/08/2025,"Humans And Other Animals delivers a unique mix of documentary, action thriller, and even comedic elements that make the film both thought-provoking and entertaining. The film interweaves global land and sea expeditions to the habitats of endangered species; conversations with leading scientists, philosophers, and legal experts; undercover investigative footage that is powerful but never graphic; endearing clips of animals at play; amusing person-on-the-street interviews; and more.I'm a longtime animal advocate, and this film is helping some of my friends and family to better understand why. It is also showing them how to take their own steps to save and improve the lives of other species.Disclaimer: I donated to the film's production.",False
3,10,Riveting and Thought-Provoking,alkac,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Humans and Other Animals"" is a thought-provoking exploration of our relationship with other species, set within a larger context of justice and fairness. The filmmaker skillfully weaves together interviews with philosophers, psychologists, scientists, activists, and anthropologists, creating a tour de force of documentary filmmaking. While the scenes depicting our mistreatment of animals are mercifully brief, they are profoundly impactful. Despite the weighty and often harrowing subject matter, the film is infused with moments of humor and intrigue, making it an engaging and enlightening watch.",False
4,10,Informative and Hilarious,jfreedlander,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mark has such an incredible way of teaching and making you think while simultaneously making you LOL. This film was incredibly thought provoking, moving, educational, and had me laughing out loud on multiple occasions. After viewing, I thought about non-human animals in an entirely new way and am so glad I was able to watch this film and learn from Mark. Throughout the film, I enjoyed seeing Mark talk to ordinary people about their perspectives and also sharing his two cents in return. He does so in an amusing way that is endearing while still being educational. I can't wait to see what Mark does next!",False
5,10,Must watch!,hyoung-00515,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is so thoughtfully done approaching the topic of speciesism from multiple angles (science, psychology, philosophy, history etc) that really tells such a thought provoking story. Mark also creatively made this exploration of this serious topic quite an amusing journey at times with moments I laughed which helped especially as there is some content with animals that is upsetting (but essential) to witness. It was exciting to tag along as the viewer as he went around the world and I was really impressed with variety of interviewees including some very acclaimed individuals. I encourage everyone to watch this extremely well thought out and articulate film on such an important topic about the way we see the world, us and animals.",False
6,10,Powerful,jessica-19068,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie had me riveted from start to finish. I saw it at the premiere in NYC and was so glad I chose to go. A fascinating exploration of how much humans underestimate the emotional lives of other species, all the while managing to be entertaining, despite the weighty and serious topic. I also appreciated that the director kept the scenes of human abuse toward animals to the bare minimum required to get the point across. I hope that it takes off and word gets out so that everyone starts waking up to the rich world of nonhuman animals all around us and abandons the human tendency of anthropocentric myopia that hurts everyone around us and us as well! A must see.",False
7,10,One of the most thought provoking films of this decade.,jonrosenberry,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the most thought-provoking films I've ever seen. For those curious philosophy, history, or animal intelligence, I would consider this a must-see. Mark Devries, the protagonist, goes all in on an adventure of discovery. As he travels around the world, he interviews experts in animal sciences, evolution, and philosophy. On top of that, there are some very clever forms of investigation to see inside factory farms.For some more specific, nitty-gritty points:The addition of the 3D and 2D animations are very helpful for visualization.Although there are so many wonderful interview sound bites gracefully woven together, at times I felt like there were too many different interview subjects, and I didn't get a chance to bond with any of them.It is a delicate balance when deciding whether to show more information or more story arc and character development. This film leans a little bit more on information, but overall, delivers on both. However, I personally would have liked to feel a little bit more character development and story arc with Mark as the protagonist.",False
8,10,"Stunning investigative journalism, thought provoking, gripping documentary",gthrvz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Humans and Other Animals is a fascinating, thought provoking examination of the close similarities between humans and so many animal species and a consideration of the way we treat our evolutionary cousins. Who ever knew that prairie dogs have a complex language that they use to communicate with each other?This film mixes philosophy, fearless investigations, and stunning nature footage. Mark Devries is simply one of the most fearless, cunning, and inquisitive investigators in the world. Whether it's exploring Neanderthal caves in Gibraltar, or bonobos in war torn Congo, Mark will go anywhere and do anything to get to the truth. The footage Mark captured is incredible and this alone makes this a must watch.His investigations of the agricultural industry are ingenious and determined, and Mark's combination of fearlessness and aw shucks guile is a wonder to behold. There is gripping tension during the filming of these investigations as Mark takes risk after risk to get inside the barriers Big Ag has erected to shield the public from the gruesome realities inside their facilities. Mark risks serious consequences from serious people and even receives a call from the FBI during filming. Nothing will stop this intrepid investigator from obtaining revelatory footage.There's something for everyone in this film, and it will make you think very deeply about human vs. Animal consciousness and the justifications we make to support a factory system that treats animals brutally from captivity to slaughter. The footage is not so graphic as to make this a difficult watch, it's just fascinating and you'll be stunned by the way Mark obtains the videos he presents. 5 stars, must watch, filled with knowledge, intriguing questions, and the dramatic tension of gritty investigative work. Highly recommended.",False
9,10,Brilliant!,ErnestoGS,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally a documentary that puts on the table philosophical questions, science and historical evidence about the differences between humans and animals. It dissolves the line that separates both as beings. This is done in an entertaining and thought-provoking way (Ã  la Mark Devries).Humans and Other Animals covers some of the topics from his previous film Speciesism and goes far beyond.If you want to deepen your understanding of humans as another species of animal, please watch this film. If you want to shift someone else's mindset about animals and humans in this world, ask them to watch this film. Brilliant!",False
10,10,Animal ethics made simple!,clairer-88379,n/a,16/08/2025,"Are humans more important than animals?Do humans ""own"" animals?Are animals capable of suffering?Mark Devries takes you through a philosophical journey about our connection to animals in 'Humans and Other Animals.'Mark leaves no stone unturned answering the most difficult ethical questions about our relationship with animals through an unbiased and scientific lens.Despite its deep arguments, this is the most easy-to-understand intro to animal rights I've ever seen (and I've heard similar feedback from other viewers).I find it difficult to believe anyone could see this documentary and think about animals the same way they did before watching it.",False
11,10,A movie about speciesism that is actually pretty funny,constance231,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this documentary during the SF premiere. It manages to present a niche philosophical concept, speciesism, in a way that is very relatable and at times even pretty funny. There is an all star case of interviewees including Peter Singer, Jane Goodall, Will MacAskill, and too many others to be able to name. There's also adventure and sneaky investigations with robots involved!It will be my go to movie to recommend to others who are curious about the ethical relationship between human and other animals. It asks some pretty uncomfortable questions about the current status of animals in our society/economy without sounding preachy about veganism.",False
12,10,Hell yes',rhenders-98262,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great film, I loved the premise. So much fun to watch this guy just walk into places and see what happens next. The truck bugging scene was especially great, can't believe he pulled that off.Director breaks down an ethical argument in black and white terms without being closed off to either point of view, which makes this so effective. He puts it all in front of your face and then turns the camera on people on the street and just lets them talk about these ideas. You can tell that some of them had never even considered the question in the slightest.This movie should be required viewing for anyone who cares about the future of our planet. Well done!",False
13,10,Making the case for universal compassion,racheltine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Humans and Other Animals is a thoughtful, funny, and moving film that examines many things humans have in common with other animals, and also many ways in which our species severely harms other animals. Full of non-graphic, often humorous behind the scenes investigations and expert interviews, this film helps to shine a light on how and why humans take advantage of the world around us, and why it is more ethical and advantageous to instead nourish and protect all animals from cruelty and harm. And every time we share this movie with the people we care about, we have an opportunity to help the world become a little more compassionate, to all animals.",False
14,10,Truly Thought-Provoking,trey-trentin-morrow,n/a,16/08/2025,"Humans and Other Animals is one of the most thought-provoking films I have seen in the last several years.The film takes you on an incredible journey that opens new doors to how we think about animals accompanied by compelling footage, academic reasoning, and powerful anecdotes.This is a film that has the potential to forever change how you see the world and its inhabitants.The filmmaker and main character of the documentary, Mark, is incredibly brave, philosophical, and overall entertaining throughout the entirety of the film.Humans and Other Animals as an absolute must-see that I would recommend to everyone.",False
15,10,A Comprehensive Introduction to Animal Issues,mmiddleton-11392,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film follows Mark DeVries as he investigates the often strange and contradictory ways that humans relate to and think of other animals. It approaches the issue in an engaging and funny way, but doesn't shy away from difficult topics. Mark pulls off some amazing and high-tech stunts in order to get undercover footage that animal exploitation industries would rather you didn't see, and he talks to experts and regular people all over the world in order to get to the bottom of why we relate to animals the way they do. You will undoubtedly have a richer appreciation of animals after seeing this film, and for anyone looking for a comprehensive introduction to animal protection issues, this is it. Highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in animals.",False
16,10,MOST COMPELLING DOCUMENTARY OF THE DECADE,vandhanabala,n/a,16/08/2025,"Humans and Other Animals by Mark Devries. Is one hell of a watch. At times hilarious, and at times nerve-wracking, Devries tackles a tough subject with warmth, grace, humor, and kindness. This powerful documentary shines a light on how we, as humans, interact with/treat/view other animals around the world. Its something we should all be forced to examine.I have received a lot of positive feedback from my friends about this movie, who said the film really mforced them to take a hard look at their choices and actions. I encourage everyone to take the time to watch this film--it will change your life!",False
17,10,"Makes you question everything you think you know, in the best way.",polarbear-72190,n/a,16/08/2025,"The director/investigator/interviewer, Mark DeVries, does a great job of questioning the human position in the world relative to nonhuman animals. He asks how we got to where we are now with humans caring so much about certain nonhuman animals yet seeming not to care about animals used for food. He sparks a philosophical and psychological discussion and takes viewers on a journey with him as he interviews experts in various fields and does investigations trying to figure out how humans arrived at this place where we appear to be superior to other species.This film is different from other films of its kind in that there's no gore--nothing that would turn away a potential viewer who is sensitive to animals being harmed--and that's great because that could dissuade people from watching and therefore miss out on the privilege of being exposed to this thought-provoking journey.Mark puts himself out there with these investigations, he is clearly very dedicated to showing viewers the truth. It is absolutely worth the watch, and Mark is actually pretty funny at times, keeping the audience highly engaged throughout the film. I've watched the film twice now and caught things the second time around that I missed the first time. If you haven't watched it yet, this is your sign to do so!",False
18,10,A Journey for All,info-10764-26230,n/a,16/08/2025,"Humans and Other Animals offers universal appeal with something for everyone-whether you're an adventurer, a deep thinker, a science enthusiast, an animal lover or simply someone curious about our world. Mark DeVries' journey spans amazing locations and presents each one with a sense of exploration and discovery. For the deep thinkers and philosophical minds, the film explores ethical questions about animals in a way that's both accessible and thought-provoking.

19,10,An Epic Documentary For Our Age,jamesrackstraw,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary ""Humans and Other Animals"" is another entertaining and compelling film by director Mark Devries. In the same engaging style that he perfected in his previous film ""Speciesism,"" Mark leads the viewer through a journey exploring our evolutionary and biological kinship with other animals. On the way, he provides perspectives on the current state of our relationships with nonhuman animals through philosophical, cultural, theological, legal, economic, and psychological perspectives.This captivating documentary spans content ranging from street interviews, wildlife encounters, scientific footage, and undercover investigations of farmed animals, to interviews with preeminent philosophers, naturalists, anthropologists, zoologists, and psychologists such as Peter Singer, Jane Goodall, Richard Wrangham, James Serpell, Steven Pinker, Melanie Joy and Richard Ryder.""Humans and Other Animals"" complements ""Speciesism"" perfectly, and completes the irrefutable case that we are in dire need of a moral awakening in the way we view and treat other sentient creatures who are, after all, our evolutionary cousins in the phylogenetic tree of life.",False
20,10,I think is just missing a bit (just a sprinkle) of more deep philosophy and diversity,luisalbertoorozcorivero,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always been into documentaries, especially when they challenge what we normally think of the world, and ""Speciesism: The Movie"" by Mark Devries is exactly that type of documentary. I didn't know what to expect when I started watching it. I mean, the title already gives you an idea that it's about how humans treat animals, but it goes way deeper than I thought.So, in simple words, the movie is about how humans think they are superior to other species, and because of that, we treat animals like they don't matter. But here's the thing, what I really liked about the film is that it doesn't throw everything in your face aggressively like some other animal rights movies. Instead, Devries goes on this journey where he interviews different people-from philosophers to farmers-and lets you see both sides. He even goes inside factory farms secretly, and the stuff he shows is really eye-opening.Now, let me break down what I liked and what I think could be improved:The ApproachFirst of all, I liked the way Mark Devries approached the topic. As a director and narrator, he's not preachy, which is something I appreciated a lot. He's curious, asking questions like a normal person would. It's like he's taking us with him on this trip to discover what's really going on with animals, and why we, as humans, think it's okay to treat them the way we do. This approach is effective because instead of making me feel guilty, it made me think. Like, really think about how we're all part of this system that harms animals.The Factory Farm FootageOne of the strongest parts of the documentary is when he goes undercover to investigate factory farms. I have to admit, this part was hard to watch. We've all heard about how bad factory farms are, but seeing it up close is different. It makes you realize how detached we are from the process that brings food to our tables. What shocked me the most is how these animals are treated as if they were just machines. There's no care, no respect, just profit. And this is not just happening in some random place, this is the reality of where most of our food comes from.At the same time, I feel that showing these images without being too emotional makes the point stronger. Devries isn't trying to shock you just for the sake of it; he's showing you the truth and letting you decide what to do with that information.Philosophical InsightsAnother thing I liked about the film is how Devries gets into the philosophical side of speciesism. He talks to big thinkers like Peter Singer, who wrote Animal Liberation, and he really goes into why humans think it's okay to dominate other animals. It made me think a lot about how society is structured. We're so used to thinking that humans are the most important species, but we never question where that idea comes from. Why do we think we have the right to decide which animals matter and which don't?Devries also brings up the fact that we've done this before with other humans. Like with racism and sexism, where certain groups were seen as less important. It's a powerful point because it shows that speciesism is just another form of discrimination, but it's so normalized that we don't even notice it.Interviews and PerspectivesI really liked how the documentary includes a wide range of people. Devries interviews animal rights activists, philosophers, but also regular people and even factory farm workers. This balance is great because it doesn't make you feel like you're only getting one side of the story. When he talks to the workers, you can see that they're not necessarily bad people; they're just part of a system that's messed up. Some of them even admit that what they're doing is wrong, but they do it because they need the money.I think this is important because it shows that the problem isn't just about individual people being cruel; it's about a system that's built on exploiting animals. And unless we change that system, nothing is going to get better.Weak PointsOkay, now onto what I think could have been better. The documentary is good, but it feels like it doesn't go as deep as it could in some areas. For example, while the philosophical discussions are interesting, I think they could have explored them a bit more. Sometimes it felt like the movie was jumping from one topic to another without fully diving into any of them.Also, I would have liked to see more diversity in the interviews. Most of the people Devries talks to are from the U. S. and Europe. It would have been interesting to hear from people in other parts of the world where the relationship with animals is different. For example, in some cultures, animals are seen more as part of the community, and that perspective was missing from the film.The ImpactIn the end, ""Speciesism: The Movie"" does what a good documentary should do: it makes you think. It's not just about changing your diet or feeling bad for animals (although, honestly, after watching it, you might want to think about those things too). It's about questioning the way we see the world. Are humans really that different from other animals? Do we really have the right to treat them like objects? These are questions that stick with you long after the movie ends.Personally, I feel like this documentary opened my eyes to things I hadn't thought about before. I mean, I always knew factory farms were bad, but now I realize that the problem is much bigger than that. It's not just about food; it's about how we view life itself. And once you start thinking about that, it's hard to go back to the way you saw things before.ConclusionIn conclusion, I think ""Speciesism: The Movie"" is a must-watch for anyone who cares about animals, or even for those who just want to challenge their views on life. It's not a perfect documentary, but it's definitely one that sparks important conversations. If you're the kind of person who likes to question the status quo, then this movie is for you. It doesn't give you all the answers, but it definitely makes you think about the questions. And in the end, that's what a good documentary should do.Jesus...luis_veganpower.",False
21,10,Comprehensive and compelling discussion on human's similarity to other animals,georgeeric-36749,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film was a comprehensive and compelling discussion of human's relationship to other animals. It started as an exploration of the evolutionary similarities between humans and the great apes, before realizing how similar even more distant species were - new info for me.Then it looked into how humans interact with other species, through farming and agriculture, and ended up discussing the ethical implications of our inter-species closeness. How should we treat other animals, if we are mostly the same as them? What inter-species differences matter, and which don't?The film was thought-provoking, engaging, and fast-paced. Definitely worth a watch!",True
22,10,Let's Be Better Humans,meganharmon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Providing an easy to follow trail, this documentary, to me, highlights the many long-accepted but arguably ethically wrongful and archaic acts humans have made/currently make towards other animals, especially in the factory farm world. To me, it portrays how arrogantly, shamefully and ethically wrong we are with the way we allow farm animals, and wild animals alike, to be treated at the hands of humans, as if animals are exempt from being treated with respect. The metaphorical red tape that keeps the majority of Americans naive to the less than kind ways that humans treat farm animals & wild animals, is also brought to light. This doc presents thought-provoking information that can help educate people about the ways in which we are complicit to the mistreatment of other animals, and also ways in which we can do better. Docs like these inspire me, and hopefully others, to make positive changes, not only for the betterment of the lives of countless other animals, but also for the intellectual/emotional/ethical growth in our own selves and society.",False

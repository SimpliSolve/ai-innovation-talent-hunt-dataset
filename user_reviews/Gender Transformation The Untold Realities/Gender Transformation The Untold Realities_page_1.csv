1,3,Biased semi-truths,lcky_str,n/a,16/08/2025,"The problem with films such as this is that they come from a far-right view with little truth, and not much responsible research. Most of these films are sponsored by Epoch and have the same actors and people behind it. That makes it suspect to begin with. They impart a lot of pathos and ethos, but very little logos in delivery. Although I disagree with an earlier reviewer that this is a lot of fear-mongering, I will attest that it is true (if you do research) puberty blockers have a decades use on children who were experiencing early puberty. I just wished someone who isn't so biased, but has a personal investment in this, who notices how hormones are readily given to people over 18 without proper health screenings. I know this for a fact because it was done to someone I know. I responsible film documentary would show how ""trans"" does exist and explore the scientific research discovered. Yet, on the other hand, there must be a review upon how a distinct portion of the population (I'm sorry grizzly_bear-67563, but there are classrooms with more than 5% claiming to be trans-so that makes it a more than 2% of the population) claims to be a sex they weren't born with. If you read enough about this topic and claims from those who believe in this whole identity thing, then you will see a substantial amount of contradictions and downright leftist bias (and I'm a progressive). You can't look at something objectively, with an objective-never.",False
2,1,Inentional Fearmongering,grizzly_bear-67563,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film points to the ""trend""; of being trans; however, trans people only make up approx. 2% of the population, a percentage that has remained consistent over time.It says that ""puberty blockers are a lie"". But puberty blockers first saw use in the 1980s to treat cisgender kids going through early puberty. It only became ""a problem"" when it was found to help trans kids too.The film noted in a fearful tone that someone became very pale while on hormones. This is obvious fearmongering.The film suggests we ""follow the money"". So, I followed the money on the film. It's owned by Epoch Times Media Group, tied to the Falun Gong religious organization and New Tang Dynasty TV. They receive money from a hedge fund led by conservative donor Robert Mercer. The VP owns a crypto hedge fund and is the creator of a fake news website. ETMG favorably covered the Trump administration and the French and German's far right movements. ETMG promoted a global conspiracy about Clinton and Obama tearing down Trump, as well as the Great Replacement antisemitic conspiracy theory. ETMG denies climate change science and promotes distrust in science.So who do you trust more? The major medical orgs saying trans healthcare is lifesaving? Or the conspiracy promoting media corp fearmongering about a vulnerable and small population?",False
3,1,"Covering Up, Child Abuse, Echo Chambers, and False Information",winterbornedwolf,n/a,16/08/2025,"The main transgender boy killed himself and they were saying it is because of trans people. On top of the message ""WhY ArE PaReNtS ThE EnEmY??"", the conveniently left out the fact that the main character killed himself because his mom was physically abusing him.It also brings tons of misinformation, specifically with the transgender community. They are exaggerating what they consider ""bad"" about the topic. They paint all these people trying to manipulate kids and parents, but it is not like that in reality at all, it took my gf 3 years of psychiatry as an adult before they even allowed her HRT. Also, parents are NOT the enemy, I love my parents. They only make parents seem like the enemy in the film so parents will think ""I don't wanna be the enemy! I have to do something about this!""This film also only takes things from the parents' perspective and is extremely biased, especially taking it from child-abusing parents' perspectives and covering it up.This film only serves as an echo-chamber of hatred and false information for people to go to when they find someone who doesn't agree with their exact beliefs. People see the world differently than you, deal with it.",False
4,9,"Eye opener, and absolute must watch for teens and parents",Sir Gerry,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is being promoted as the film every parent needs to see. I think this is a film every adolescent needs to see. As a parent, I already know that we go through so much turmoil and phases during adolescence, but it's the young ones, especially in this generation, (unaccustomed to deal with negative feelings, bullying and confusion) that need to see this. When we feel bad, especially as a teen, we want to feel good. Changing genders is being sold by virtually everyone, (from schools, to doctors, to politicians, to billionaires to media and entertainment) as the one dose pill that fixes all your ailments. It's become almost impossible to question this idea, let alone present it in media or movies. Kudos to the producers and everyone involved in this feature, they expose the risks behind this dangerous, and I'd say dehumanizing, enterprise. We have to admit that through human history, some people have suffered from real gender dysphoria, but what is going on now is societal manipulation and modeling, mass brainwashing and indoctrination. As Bill Maher has said, if the trend keeps going, by 2050 the whole earth population will be Gay or Trans. Ridiculous. Watch this and recommend it, then get ready to fight back.",True
5,10,A must see,deanny41,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is one that is a must see. With hearing the personal testimonials from detransitors and families to hearing from professionals brings the hard truth to the subject of ""gender affirming care."" My takeaway from the documentary is that what's being pushed on society is not conducive to society as a whole. While those that work and believe in this ideology think they are providing a true service, seems to not care about the consequences that affect the persons that undergo these treatments. My heart and prayers went out to the persons and families that have been permanently scarred and harmed by this ideology. This is one to share with everyone you know.",False
6,10,WOW must watch,tim-10877,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone wanting to transition needs to watch this first. It's very disturbing to hear that it started out as trying to help people and then became a way to make a massive amount of money which caused it to be promoted even more. This country has freedom of speech so anyone that gives their opinions shouldn't be silenced especially when it's coming from people that have gone through transition and how much suffering they had to go through.Everything in life is not perfect when its new, overtime things evolve based on experiences, data, etc. Transitioning is great for some but not for all and whoever is transitioning should know about all the risks and side affects.",False
7,10,So important!,Johan1982,n/a,16/08/2025,"So great to see the truth behind this whole gender transformation hysteria be told! Thanks for shedding light on the downsides of this horrific ""trend"" that seems to be spreading everywhere, being normalized in society. I'm chocked and amazed by how we treat people that think they need to go through gender transformation treatments and surgeries. Especially our young ones. These ideas destroy lives and we must stand up for what is right. We can't let these modern ideologies replace common sense, jeopardizing the lives and health of our youth. This is a must watch for every parent! And everyone else for that matter! Thanks!",False
8,10,"Incredible, Outstanding, Must-Watch in Today's Times",priyanka-24385,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film so accurately shows the truth about what's happening to our children - it dives into the real life situations of real people and shows exactly how our educational, medical, mental health systems all are contributing to this transgender movement. Its heartbreaking, its gut wrenching and its the truth that every parent every person who cares about our children and youth NEEDS to see. The film takes a complex issue and movement and really breaks it down to be understandable in the most eye-opening way. This film has WON ALL OF THESE AWARDS FOR A REASON! I recommend that every single person watch it and share it over and over again so that the truth can spread.",False
9,10,"Great film, so desperately needed for this time in our lives.",claire-81217,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who is a trainee psychotherapist, it is so demoralising to see how established authorities that we trust, have become so indoctrinated by this ideology, that it is failing our children and young people. This movie is a must see if you are questioning the modalities of this treatment. After this, you will be left in no doubt. It's time for the world to start waking up. If the American Academy of Pediatrics is supporting the 'gender care' you see in this film, young people are in trouble. This film is sensitively produced, with real authority when it comes to the de-transitioners. Please watch and listen and share.",False
10,10,The most important docudrama this year!,tails58,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the most amazing, raw, logical, honest and heartbreaking film I've seen on this subject. Every parent & teacher needs to see this. And every young person too actually. This is the biggest medical scandal of our age. We must fight to save our vulnerable children and young people. And protect women's rights also. 10/10 from me! There are nearly 50,000 detransitioners and desisters currently going public online. The law suits are starting to come. From the top down, this needs eradicating completely if we're going to save our next generations. This needs to be seen by everyone to be honest. The tide is turning, I can feel it in my heart. I managed to help my teenage daughter out of this cult, but I've seen so many who haven't. 15 year olds getting their breasts sliced off, 12 year old boys being chemically castrated. How did we get here and as Jennifer Bilek says - Why are they all doing this?""Well done to all involved.",False
11,10,Must see for parents. Truth being told.,bizwizgo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie really nails what's going on with our kids. It digs into the real struggles of actual people and shows how our schools, hospitals, and mental health systems are all playing a role in the transgender movement. It's heartbreaking, seriously gut-wrenching, but it's the real deal that every parent and anyone who cares about kids needs to watch. The film takes this complicated issue and breaks it down in a way that just clicks. And let me tell you, it's won all of these awards for a reason! I'm telling everyone to watch it and pass it on, so the truth gets out there loud and clear. Must see movie!",False
12,10,Absolutely blown away! Must-watch for parents!,mandiicakez,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a mother of 3, I was absolutely appalled at the bombshells being dropped in this docudrama! Therapists are only allowed to affirm a child's feeling of gender dysphoria instead of recommending therapy, counseling, and other non-invasive care to help these teens work thru what it is they're truly experiencing. Nope. They're immediately affirmed and put on puberty blockers at the very first appointment, no psychiatric note needed. Soon to be followed up with surgery and lifelong hormones that your body may end up rejecting or unable to tolerate? What then? Those finding themselves in this situation are abandoned by the very ones who so enthusiastically encouraged them to transition! The story of the mom and the detransitioners is heartbreaking and infuriating! They're indoctrinating our children with their ""gender identity"" bs! Watch and share with every parent you know! I have shared this with many friends and family and to say they are shocked is an understatement. You can definitely tell by the comments that the pro-gender identity crowd caught wind of this. It's absolute insanity! Leave children and their families ALONE! Definitely recommend and I commend Epoch Times for making this and showing the insane realities. This should be in theaters nationwide!",True
13,10,all the 1 stars are clearly paid for,rivalution,n/a,16/08/2025,"Or come from people who have been brainwashed into oblivion. Maybe transitioned themselves and still trying to tell themselves a story that all that suffering was not for nothing. How can anyone watch this and say it's fear mongering? Telling you the truth qualifies as that nowadays? How can you understand the intricacies of how carelessly and downright negligently this well oiled machine is working, and still think that is the right approach? I'm honestly at a loss for words. It makes one feel like they live in a world full of NPCs. No questioning the authority and critical thought. Just obey or be canceled. Depressing times.*
on a more technical note perhaps, but thr reenactment was quite cheesy and over-dramatic at times. Could have been better executed.",False

1,8,Interesting documentary spoiled by poor voiceover,neil-671-762015,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is quite interesting, but the guy doing the voiceover is unintelligible. Sounds like he's intentionally putting it on. Comes across as a bit drunk and spoiling for a fight in an east end pub. All for a regional accent on British TV, but this was a poor choice.",False

1,9,Delivers a knock-out punch,nicraynaud,n/a,16/08/2025,"When was the last time you saw good, well-argued political cinema?If you thought that there was no young torch bearer for Ken Loach's film-making approach, think again: Sonita Gale is treading in his footsteps with this superb documentary. It will strike a chord with anyone who has known people living away from their mother country.Through real-life stories she shows us what it's like to be at the receiving of the 'hostile environment' created by successive governments, particularly over the past ten years. At times you will feel disbelief, but I must say I saw as an employer team members (from Australia and Sri Lanka) who landed in similar crazy dead-end situations as those shown in the film.This is an urgent movie that should be mandatory viewing to enlighten the general public on the hidden suffering of so many people who live and work in the UK and make our country run.P. S. Nitin Sawhney's music alone is a great reason to watch this film.",False
2,n/a,what are we like?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a film that invades your heart by stealth. It starts like what might seem like a piece of anti Tory agit prop and morphs by turns into a moving exploration of the casual cruelty of a government under lockdown. The title comes from the Hostile Environment immigration policy originally brought in by Teresa May as Home Secretary, the policy at the heart of the Windrush Scandal that sought to expel migrants who had lived, worked and paid taxes in this country for decades and brought shame on the Conservatives and the nation. But, filmed as the pandemic tightened its grip, it becomes a nuanced and deeply moving exploration of the tragedy of unfortunate people caught between an inhuman (and ultimately self defeating, when you see the stats on how migrants help the UK economy) policy and deadly virus that cuts off opportunities to study, work - or even migrate away from Britain. The characters demonstrate patience, wisdom and heroism that stays with you long after viewing. Try and catch this film and do something about the issues and problems it brieflylliantly raises.",False
3,10,"Powerful, thought-provoking and tender.",parax-78715,n/a,16/08/2025,"A powerful yet tender documentary showing the insurmountable odds and barriers faced by migrants to the UK. Asylum seekers, workers, university students, all face a slew of challenges passed down and given greater power by successive governments since the early 1900's. This film offers context, humanity, and compassion, asking that we all understand that our reputation as a country of refuge, with our proud cites of sanctuary, is on the line, and in the end our similarities are greater than our differences, and those in charge need to acknowledge this. A brilliant, thought-provoking piece of cinema that absolutely deserves the awards it has been long listed for.",False
4,10,Brilliant,noukguy,n/a,16/08/2025,The best documentary of the year.Director has filmed it within current environment in mind and has beautifully put together pieces of puzzle together of past and present.A must watch.,False
5,10,"Hard-hitting, moving, informative...life-changing!",fjzsydjgx,n/a,16/08/2025,"A powerful film exploring the real impact on real lives of this government's creation of a 'Hostile Environment' for our migrant population. I'd thought I was familiar with the issues, but there's so much more I know now.No histrionics, no false drama, just clear, brilliant telling of exactly how it is for some of the most vulnerable in society. When they come up against a government set on 'the corporatisation of everything', they determinedly strip the most desperate of people of their most basic human rights: food, heating, shelter, and safety from harm.This film is hard-hitting, moving, informative...life-changing!",False
6,10,This film comprehensively exposes the brutish nature of modern British immigration policy,jennahanmer,n/a,16/08/2025,"How did we get to the point where ministerial departments are permitted to abuse the rights of vulnerable people? Why would we base our immigration policy on the model chosen by Australia (if you haven't seen Stateless yet, please watch it now)? This film demonstrates how our misguided notions and apathy have led to a toxic cycle of self-justified mistreatment of fellow human beings, who's only crime is being born in a war zone.I left this film with clenched fists and a locked jaw. Although it is incredibly difficult to watch, it is necessary. Please take the time to listen to the stories of those we so often chose to ignore.",False
7,6,"Nice done, but not objective",zagreb-boris,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows the problems which immigrants to the UK encounter, but unfortunately only from their point of view . There is no other side's perspective.The film is powerful and nice done, but it's not objective at all - it's only one side of the coin...",False
8,5,Somewhat simplistic analysis of an important topic,Makariy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shows the adverse impact of the hostile environment policy as experienced by real individuals, but with no meaningful context. This documentary is purely a polemic without any depth of analysis.",False

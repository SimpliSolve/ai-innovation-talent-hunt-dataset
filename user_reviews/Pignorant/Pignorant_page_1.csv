1,9,An Important Film,achristopherhoward,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is Pignorant - A documentary film by Joey Carbstrong that seeks to expose the cruelty and abuse in the UK pig farming industry. Joey's message is powerful, as he takes significant risks in order to comment on one of the most pressing civil rights issues of our time.In the documentary, Joey works with undercover activists, ex-slaughterhouse-workers, animal welfare advocates, a pig veterinarian, animal researchers, and academics to demonstrate different perspectives surrounding the pig farming industry. Experienced vegans and animal activists will be familiar with much of the information discussed, as well as the abuse revealed within the pig industry, while others who are unfamiliar stand to learn a significant amount from the documentary.Joey Carbstrong does not hold back in showcasing forms of abuse within the pig industry supply chain. The film educates viewers on the contradictory messaging behind RSPCA certifications and Red Tractor labels in the UK, revealing them to be a form of animal industry propaganda. The film team expose animal abuse at free-range pig farms, factory farms, and of course the slaughterhouses themselves. This film pulls back the curtain to reveal the lie of the food labels we've been taught to trust, in the face of the reality of slaughtering animals. The message is simple and compelling - humane slaughter is a contradiction, and animals deserve justice.My only criticism of the film is the emphasis on the ""making of"" footage, as Joey dedicates significant runtime to showing his infiltration of the local slaughterhouse to plant (and later retrieve) hidden cameras. In these moments, I feel the film loses its vision and focuses too much on Joey. It doesn't matter to the film's final message just how difficult it was for Joey to plant a camera inside the slaughterhouse gas chamber - What matters to the final message is the camera footage itself, and what implications it has for the consumer of pig/pork products.This is not always an easy film to watch - some of the footage is grueling and violent. But this is what makes it so important to watch anyway. This film's release now and on a mainstream platform represents the persistence of the modern animal rights movement. Joey Carbstrong's Pignorant relays a pivotal message that deserves to be heard by all, and especially the people who continue to pay for animal abuse.",False
2,9,Open your eyes to the reality of the pig meat industry,sneachell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please watch this film. If you eat meat (and especially pork), you have a moral obligation to face up to what you are responsible for putting these animals through. What goes on is utterly reprehensible and I believe that future generations will ask how this was allowed to take place. One of the reasons, as documented in the film, is that powerful industry bodies and so-called animal welfare organisations do not want you to know what's really happening. The makers of this film show exceptional bravery in bringing the reality to our living rooms. Please watch this film, and please reconsider your lifestyle choices.",False
3,8,Good but not life changing.,kiliansloan,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a very interesting documentary about pig farming and does pose questions about the pig meat industry but it still begs the question as a meat eater, not a vegan, would I eat bacon? Yes I would, but would prefer it to be more regulated than currently and should be done in a way more regulated way! That being said it raises a serious question of how pigs are killed, and they should be done so in a way more humane way than they are currently (ie non CO2 method). Nonetheless, I wouldn't give up bacon for this, sorry vegans, I just believe of finding an actual humane way of killing the animal is better than transporting advocados from Brazil.",False
4,10,A MUST SEE FOR ALL ANIMAL LOVERS,dave_rammy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Animal lovers can't miss this documentary, it's essential.Joey Carbstrong, an ex-gang member turned animal rights activist puts his life on the line, literally, he risks his life, to show the world what the meat industry has been desperately trying to hide. The documentary has multiple moments that will leave you shocked, appalled, and disgusted in what humans are capable of, and possibly even more shocked by how well humans can lie about it.The documentary is very well made, with a strong story that carries you through from beginning to end, and what an end it is. The big reveal comes with a combination of excitement, apprehension, and deep sorrow. The documentary balances entertainment and tension with the sobering reality of what they are uncovering.Surprisingly, there is some comic relief, especially from Dan when discussing the situations he found himself in while preparing for the actions in this documentary. But the take away from this film is clear to anyone who watches it; we can't go on like this, and the animals certainly can't.We need to come together and make a change for these poor animals, we need to come together and say never again, never again will we let these things happen to innocent, defenceless beings.Thank you Joey, Tarion, Dan and the entire Pignorant team for risking it all to expose the truth. The world thanks you, and so would the animals if they could.",False
5,10,Very eye opening,emilybeech-76492,n/a,16/08/2025,"10/10. Engaging, Enlightening, Exposing.A hugely important film for those to watch, especially if you are still paying for 'humane slaughter' of animals. A real look at 'RSPCA Assured' and 'Red Tractor Approved'. Intense scenes, secret filming and confronting interviews fill this documentary; exposing some of the most horrific and eye opening practices which exist for something as meaningless as taste.Joey and his team risk their lives in order to document the TRUTH of what happens to pigs in the UK. If you claim to be an 'animal lover' please do not hesitate from watching this hugely important film. You do not love animals if you pay for these abhorrent industries. Please watch and tell me otherwise.",False
6,10,A MUST WATCH,oliverrwade,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is absolutely brilliant and a MUST WATCH for anyone who still eats pigs and isn't vegan. It's also perfect for anyone who wants to find out more about how the pork industry works in the UK. Not only does Pignorant expose the UK pork industry, but it also exposes the RSPCA, Red Tractor and free-range pig farming. If you like animals, it will be really interesting as it's packed full of information about pigs that most people won't know. If you decide to skip watching Pignorant, you're definitely missing out.A big, big thank you to Joey Carbstrong, Dan Sheppard, Tarion Partridge and the rest of the team involved in making this incredible documentary.",False
7,10,A documentary anyone with a heart should see.,ptdonnelly,n/a,16/08/2025,"Joey and his team are heroes.This documentary had my emotions in tatters and the suspense was gripping.Factory farmed animals in the UK suffer through people and organisations letting them down.The pig meat industry is barbaric and exposed in this documentary for what it really is behind the slick marketing pushed out behind RSPCA and Red Tractor labels.This documentary blows the lid off factory farming and organisations that are supposed to protect animals that are receiving payments and percentage on sales of meat.Watch and see the meat trade for what it is, which is nothing short of barbaric and disturbing to see how human beings can do this to animals.",False
8,10,A Must See,ronniegeorge,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the best documentaries I've seen, I couldn't recommend it to people enough. Don't miss this exceptional work of journalism, storytelling, suspense, editing, expos√©, and inspirational messaging.Pignorant follows animal activist and former gang member Joey Carbstrong and others as they attempt to capture the first ever publicly available footage of how around 90% of pigs are stunned and killed in the UK. Featuring many different interviews and locations Pignorant was able to keep me gripped for the duration of it's runtime despite some of the footage being tough to watch. It was incredibly informative and eye-opening and it's my hope many people see this film as I feel they deserve to know it's contents.",False
9,n/a,Watch this documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Joey and his team provide a hard hitting look at what happens to one of the most intelligent animals on planet earth!Joeys passion for helping these animals lies within how well he has made this film!Its shocking and sad but if you decide to watch it and take in the information and use it then this movie can be something really beautiful in motive even tho its very hard at times to watch!I applaud all people involved and believe this needed to be made!If no has ever seen joeys content before i also think following his youtube is something to consider if you find this documentary hits you!Follow Joey Carbstrong on youtube and other social media platforms.,False
10,6,Not an easy watch if you are bothered by animals in pain,jfgibson73,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has some upsetting content. The filmmakers explore a farm and a factory where pigs are raised and slaughtered. Not only are there graphic images, but there are some descriptions of what goes on that are hard to hear. The goal was to expose the practice of using a gas chamber to kill pigs, which will then be used for food. With hidden cameras, we are shown some of what goes on in the factory. However, I think some of the worst things that were happening only got spoken about. The documentary has a resolution that will give viewers some sense of closure to this group's first effort; however, they stress that they want to continue to work to bring awareness to practices that they feel are cruel and wrong. I should note that the story takes places in one area of the U. K.; we do not see how animals are processed in other parts of the world, nor do they discuss the food industry beyond their region.",False
11,10,Don't look away,pastillasc,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is your opportunity to be the good person you believe you are. Watch this movie.This is a documentary that many won't find easy to watch. That's exactly the point. It won't be a happy one. But you have the opportunity to make things better. For you, and for everyone else around you. This movie is for everyone.Be strong, be honest to yourself. Be really honest. Watch it.Do not call yourself an animal lover if you disagree. Loving your dog is not analogous to that. This movie is educational, and is about respect. Respect to everyone who wants to live.Watch this movie. Watch it. Watch it today.",False
12,4,Lost it towards the end,jaysmoke,n/a,16/08/2025,"First one, how is it possible that every single comment is a tener?Even though this documentary was well made, big ups to Joey and his team for doing that, I think he derailed towards the end. Like this isn't about pigs, this is about vegans riding on the cruelty in the pig industry. It's not about finding an alternative way to slaughter pigs, it's about not killing pigs and ""sentient beings"" altogether.I don't eat meat, but I wouldn't force anyone to stop eating meat because I love animals. How can you ask a billion dollar company to stop operating because you grew up with pigs and have an affection towards them? That's just ridiculous.Had the documentary stayed with the inhumane slaughter of these pigs and try to argue a better alternative to the gas chamber, I would have given it a ten. But I feel misled and thus am not enthused at all.",False
13,10,Joey risks his life to show us the truth,seankennedy-65373,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've never seen a documentary that is educational, sad, enraging, funny, cute, and suspenseful... all at the same time. Pignorant is all of these things.My girlfriend and I were discussing after we watched it, and one thing that stuck out was how well it protected its scope as well as covered all of the details within. If you're looking to learn pretty much everything you need to know about pigs and how we treat them - this is it.I didn't cry for 15 years before watching this last night. The sound, the images, the story, the absolutely immenseness and pervasiveness of it all was too much for this grown man to handle.Thank you for your sacrifices and work, Joey and team.",False
14,10,Absolutely SHOCKING information in this documentary. Highly recommend!,guiover,n/a,16/08/2025,"What has been revealed in this newly-released documentary has just blown my mind completely!The use of never-before-seen footage and a thrilling narrative only adds to the immense surprise and shock provided for by finding out how thoroughly and consistently we have all been lied to by ostensibly trustworthy government entities. I believe this documentary may cause anyone who watches it to question what they serve their loved ones or put on their own plate while also serving to provide a critical catalytic force for what is much needed change in these industries on which we rely so heavily.This was such a hard-hitting expos√© that I am still recovering from the shock almost an hour after watching. Would highly recommend, this is a certified 10/10!",False
15,10,A MUST WATCH! Lifechanging.,birger-20231,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would recommend this to anyone. Especially those open minded people who want to get a better understanding of the world.Watching this was like a rollercoster of emotions, thoughts and questions. There were so many things I learned and realized from watching this.This made me question a lot of things I've never thought about or naturally just taken for granted as a truth.The title is good as it refers to the word ""ignorant"". That's exactly how I felt I was before watching this.I've seen a lot of Joey's work before. His story, dedication and willpower says a lot.You will not regret watching this, but you might regret something else. Something you will become aware of after watching it.",False
16,10,Outstanding! A film no one should ignore.,hugh_ac,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is an amazing expos√© of the pig industry not only in the UK, but in many other parts of the world as well. All consumers must watch this and learn the truth about what they are funding, instead of staying ""pignorant"" and continuing to be part of the problem.On top of being extremely informative, the stories and interviews in 'Pignorant' are highly engaging and gripping. The passion shown by Joey and his team throughout the documentary is highly tangible and compelling.It's an emotional film but also very inspiring because it shows us how much power we have as individuals to solve this problem.",False
17,10,I resonate!!,aryanmajestic5,n/a,16/08/2025,"The art of effort and resilience is expressed through Joey and his team. I loved watching this.I feel the depth of planning that has gone into creating this. Joey led with love and succeeded. Magic manifests beside the truth, and it is without doubt that our Universe thrives on peace and love.Dan, Joey and Tarion have expressed the power of standing by the truth in a way that I felt inspired. Their brave decisions gave them the platform to show us what happens behind closed doors. To be honest, we all can think for ourselves and feel how wrong it is to mistreat those that we naturally love.I wish Joey and his friends the best of the best in their lives. Thank you for your activism.",False
18,10,Incredibly moving and inspiring,laurenjaaddee,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you're already vegan or still eat meat and are curious about what goes on behind closed doors, this film is a MUST WATCH! I'm truly inspired by the hard work and dedication that has gone into the creation of this masterpiece. I would highly advise anyone and everyone to watch no matter what your stance on the consumption of animals is. Watching somebody as passionate and risk taking as Joey put his life on the line to shine light on the atrocities of animal agriculture has truly inspired me to speak up.

19,10,Amazing film,crazycatbennett,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing, poignant film on an essential topic. Beautifully written and directed. Joey strikes again with this amazing, poignant, moving film. Should be mandatory watching for everyone. Don't call yourself an animal lover and eat meat when the industry is this corrupt. What is done to these poor animals is heartbreaking. These kinds of films are incredibly important for the modern human. Incredibly written, easy to understand. Thank you Joey for creating this amazing and highly educational film. To anyone reading this review, I HIGHLY reccomend watching this film of the year. This is a wonderful, well written, moving film EXPOSING the horrific practices of the meat industry.",False
20,10,A must watch documentary.,kerrythom-07793,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film also highlights the ethical implications of our treatment of pigs, raising important questions about animal welfare and our moral responsibilities towards these sentient creatures. By emphasizing their capacity for suffering and joy, ""Pignorant"" challenges viewers to reconsider their attitudes towards animal agriculture and to reflect on the impact of their dietary choices.Stunning and emotionally impactful, ""Pignorant"" is a thought-provoking documentary that prompts important conversations about animal rights, and our relationship with other species. It serves as a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of empathy and compassion in shaping a more ethical and compassionate society.",False
21,10,THIS SHOULD BE WATCHED BY EVERYONE,Alex_chr90,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is for all the people who care for the animals.Especially for those who are disconnected with what is on their plate.You can't continue to ignore reality.Your everyday selections are responsible for the massive suffering of these animals.If you can't watch the consequences of your actions, then why do you support the industry financially??There is no logic to that.And everything in this documentary happens everywhere in the world.Yes, in your local area too.There is no good way to do the wrong thing.You don't need to do THIS wrong thing.Please, go and watch it! Please!",False
22,10,A must watch for all humans,reemahlynch,n/a,16/08/2025,"Something you cannot know about unless you watch it
A must watch for every person from all walks of life..
In many years this film will be viewed as a horror film, a horrific reminder of what used to happen in our world. In order to understand your role in the future and in the present, you have to see this movie. Incredibly well made, educational and unique. A very rare film and one critically important to the future and the state of our world, the world we all share and live in.It's also important the more you don't want to watch this film, that you do.

23,10,"Superb, inspiring, and terrifying",robingreatbatch-01081,n/a,16/08/2025,"The bravery showcased by animal advocates and researchers, here, is immense. This film is superbly powerful and gives a voice to animals otherwise unheard. Most worrying is the pervasive propoganda and dogma by the RSPCA and other farming unions who continue to lie to their customers, making money from the ignorance they've curated for them.I was on the edge of my seat during some parts of this. It really helps you see how awfully these animals are treated. Joey - the film maker - speaks so clearly and with passion and it's great to see him speaking to all sorts of people from the general public to CEOs.",False

25,10,Exposing Animal Cruelty - Standard Practices in Animal Agriculture Industry,noraegwilliams,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pignorant is a thoughtful and thorough investigation into the use of gas chambers to slaughter pigs in the UK. Everyone should watch this documentary. The footage is painful and abhorrent to see....and necessary to bear witness to pigs' suffering. CO2 gas chambers are inherently cruel. There is nothing ""humane"" about suffocating to death from carbon dioxide, while trapped in a small metal cage with many other terrified pigs. Watch their faces. Look into their eyes. Hear their screams. Animals do not want to suffer and die. They desire the same basic things humans do - companionship, love, happiness, physical and emotional enrichment, and importantly, freedom from harm and unnecessary suffering. Thank you to Joey and his team for their dedicated activism. It's time for others to pick up the fight too.",False

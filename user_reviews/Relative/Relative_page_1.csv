1,8,Haunting story of familial trauma,moviemom23,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo hard to watch this family! The images and film over decades juxtaposed with a story being pieced together is powerful. It does move a bit too slowly and I pined for more details but I guess that was the point- no one wants to talk about the abuse that continued across generations relentlessly in this family.Most striking to me was the reluctance of the mother and grandmother to admit what they had experienced. It was heartbreaking to watch the daughter struggle to communicate with these women! To think they couldn't- or wouldn't- protect their own children over protecting ""the family""- its horrible.There is indeed something sick and dark running through the genes of this family tree. Very difficult to watch the old films showing how grabby and abusive many of the men are- and they seem so proud of it. Chilling.A hard watch but very interesting.",True
2,10,Much needed film,ashleymgambino,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film, while difficult to watch at times because of subject matter, is needed. It depicted the complex layers that truth tellers/change makers face after being honest with their family about their trauma. Seeing the effects of patriarchy and sexual abuse on this Italian-Americans hit close to home. The relationship with the older generations, and hearing them speak their truths for the first time was tremendous. This film was well-done and ended in an unexpected way that will stay with me. This film makes me wish I could sit with the older generations of my family and ask the hard questions. It also inspires me to have open, deep dialogue with my three daughters, my nieces and nephews, my friend's children on sexual safety. Tracy's bravery inspires me to be brave.",False
3,10,Nothing hidden that will not be disclosed (Luke 8:17),peterthree,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was moved deeply by this documentary. Powerful. Necessary. It was vulnerable, tasteful, cutting, stirring. It is important to watch, because we need to be aware, discerning, and look out for children and the vulnerable. Tracey spearheaded disclosure, empowering family to participate also. Amazing work. Thank you for making this! Thank you for your courage!It is amazing to see the abuse by men in situations with a power differential. Where this exists - power differential - there is vulnerability. We need to protect people from themselves (like leaving older kids with younger), and we need to protect people from others.",False
4,10,A first-hand account of generational trauma...,kismity,n/a,16/08/2025,"And what happens when everyone keeps quiet. Avoidance of talking about traumatic events creates a disconnection, leaving the lone person who's willing to speak up feel isolated and disconnected.If everyone around you is saiyng 'it's no big deal', then part of you will begin to question yourself and wonder if YOU'RE the one making it a big deal.I congratulate Tracey for being brave enough to confront her family and get them to talk. Especially her mother who, in this film just wants to move on (complete avoidance). Her grandmother and great aunts share more and other family members support Tracey as she moves through her healing with a therapist and the help of her family.The person who gave this 1 star has cleary never had to deal with this level of trauma. It's hard enough to discuss these things in private but to make a FILM that the whole world can see take a whole other level of fortitude, bravery, and strength. The humiliation you feel when you've been violated can be debilitating. So, please read the 10 star reviews. They are more empathic.",False
5,1,"Not a ""brave look"" at all",karengray-29506,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film could have been amazing if the filmmaker had gone deep into the family structure of the hierarchy of her family of pedophiles. Three generations of the women in her family being sexually abused, including herself, with very little details of the abuse, and even less details of the perpetrators. Left the viewer confused as to who did what to whom. Even more disappointing was the fact that the entire film depicted these women as STILL protecting their abusers! They gave as little detail as possible. With all of the years of film that the matriarch of the family preserved, and all three generations still living, this could have been extraordinary...instead fell way short.",False
6,10,What doesn't kill you apparently just needs to be forgotten,brandib-47535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo much left unsaid in this attempt to bring generations of abuse and trauma into the light. The willingness of the women to accept what has been done to them and move on, as if they themselves are not worth the energy to save. Over and over the mantra ""what can you do? You just move on"" and try to protect your children. The abusers are almost all relatives. This is how they deal with the pain of how do you protect your children from your own family when you can't even protect yourself? What was glaringly obvious and disgusting is the complete lack of accountability that was never discussed, the appropriate behavior that was never expected. Just guilt from not being able to keep your kid from harm. The women were almost never in a position of power, so they survived as best they could. Just be on guard, hope for the best, expect the worst and be happy when your abuser dies. And don't ever rock the boat.",True
7,10,Courageous look at Skeletons in the Closet,qweenstax,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every family has skeletons in their closet. Unfortunately ignoring some of those skeletons cause irreparable damage that can create more, or damage others beyond repair. This courageous and honest look into one family's closet is heartbreaking and yet so healing!The conversations that were had in this film busts those closet doors open, exposes truths long left for dead but are so necessary to help in the healing process.Children are so often isolated, threatened, told no one will ever believe or love them that they carry those comments, believe them and sometimes don't understand why because they disassociate from the world.This heartbreaking film is worth the watch. It's a step forward on a healing path and a peek into past generations reasons for locking those skeletons away. Bust down those doors! Speak Up and Loud if you are or were abused. Seek help.",False
8,10,Exploring Pain brings Connection,denisekrenski,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought Relative was a beautifully nuance representation of the vulnerabilities that are so pervasive within families, specifically amongst children and women. It also speaks to the misogyny that is permitted to exist within families. The documentarian kept some privacy in terms of the family and showed what she felt most comfortable with. For so many families, silence is death. But, her willingness and the willingness of her mother, grandmother and great aunts to share pieces of their traumas was what made me feel so connected to this entire family. Her nuanced film gave voice to so many who don't have one. Thank you!",False
9,9,"Brave, Loving, Needed",fjcutshaw,n/a,16/08/2025,The film Relative is stunning and infused with a sense of intimacy while also being brave and boundaried. I felt such emotions for Tracey's family and appreciation for her work. I do a lot of work with religious trauma and the framework for secrecy feels very similar. People we love and trust and want to honor are often the hardest to confront with health in order to have needed conversations. I was awestruck by the vision and embodiment implied gently through bold and challenging conversations. A sense of honor wells up within the film and dispels secrecy in such a way that anyone can be inspired to move in new patterns with their own family.,False
10,10,Intense quest for answers and healing,Mauilifeforme,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film recounts the filmmakers journey of her own healing process, as she struggles with her experiences and the effects it had on her life after the experiences.She reaches out to generations of her family and asks them if they had similar experiences in their own lives, and how they struggled with their own aftermath of emotions.The film is not prurient or sensationalistic in any manner, yet the discussions are frank and sad to watch and listen to as family members are discussed over generations.Many personal pictures and old home movie clips are interwoven into the film to give historical context to the older women's experiences and contexts.I'm not a filmmaker or cinematographer so I can't rate the techniques and manner of the video as it's been constructed.I can say that the video has a powerful visceral effect on me as a Dad with 4 children, now all grown adults, and my hope that none of the things discussed in this film ever happen to my granddaughters.As Dad, I know what it's like when your child reveals, years after the fact, of experiences discussed in this film that were inflicted by a neighbor's foster child upon my child.Healing is a long process.Memories never go away completely.They're put in a box in our minds so we can live our lives without pain they cause.I hope this filmmaker continues to make films and that they're shown in streaming services.",False
11,10,A families closet of skeletons graciously opened to help others heal theirs,mhpgspmw,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I always find myself lost in immeasurable awe and overwhelming joy after experiencing yet another miracle in my life, sometimes I also find healing and growth. Coming upon ""Relative"" and having such a connection to the story changed how I process my most significant, however my most minor, incident of sexual abuse. Because the abuse wasn't violent, wasn't ongoing and didn't go to the extremes that many, many other little girls have endured, I felt hesitant to claim it. I really almost felt guilt and shame to even speak it out as abuse. But it was at the hand of the greatest man I have ever known, the most wonderful man ever, my hero, my daddy. I've carried this with me ever since and watching this film was therapy for me. Free therapy for a change and I am eternally grateful for the healing and new perspective it has given me, as well as a new friend Once again, I am filled with gratitude for something that just falls into place, like coming across a film that changes shape of something ugly I have been carrying deep inside for 40 years into something I can carry without shame and hopefully be able to share with others. This one thing, I believe, is all that matters in this world. Looks like someone else does also and I thank her for putting herself and her entire family out there to help the rest of us.",False
12,10,Excellent!,modern-30059,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary absolutely moved me in ways I can't even put into words. So grateful for people like Tracey. She is an absolute hero in my eyes. I'm a truth giver, and I had so much in common with her and this documentary. It's a must watch!!!! Watching her tell her story was a true inspiration. In this documentary You find yourself relating your story with hers especially, if you've gone through it, and it helps you heal in ways by listening to others tell their story. I give this documentary a 10/10! I'm so happy I stumbled upon it. It was so meant to be. The next day I reflected back on my story, and what I went through and I can't express this enough. This documentary helped me so much.",False
13,10,Relative,marysetti,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerRelative was a very difficult movie for me to watch. However, it was necessary for me to view.The fear, the guilt, the shame is so raw. Somehow a child feels ashamed to be part of this depraved behavior.It took a lot of courage for a victim to come forward and tell her story. For many of us the time has passed for us to confront our abusers. I would think that confronting them would have been somewhat satisfying and possibly terrifying at the same time. It comforts me that the victim was able to tell her abuser how badly damaged she felt. I was dismayed that the grandmother didn't want to admit the pain it caused her. I saw the pain in the grandmother's face and her movement. There is no denying that sexual abuse causes damage.I have to applaud the videographer for letting the world know that families like this exist. Sexual abuse by people who we should have been able to trust is just so wrong and so hard to imagine. Yet it happens all the time. Just think about how terrifying it is for a young child to live under the same roof as their abuser and be unable to confide in anyone. If they told the truth they would be labeled a liar and punished.The film showed raw emotion and that is exactly what was necessary. This is most definitely an important film and one worth viewing, even if you weren't a victim. However, if you were abused the film is almost a necessity so that healing can start. I was so angry after watching the film that I felt like screaming at the top of my lungs.The damage done is impossible to comprehend. The years don't stop the memories that flood back and the anger and hurt returns.Oddly, I do understand not mentioning the names of the abusers.As hurt as victims are, we are still human beings. Ripping families apart may not be in our makeup, as much as the abusers deserve to be outed.Thank you Tracey for being the courageous woman you are!",True
14,10,Accurate heartbreaking applies to anyone dealing with trauma,missyjune,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is necessary and at the same time heart wrenching. Shame keeps people silent and hurting. The concept is very very difficult to discuss and even harder to put your face and name to the story. Unbelievably brave. Anyone who has publicly laid out their shame and trauma has the right to criticize. No one else deserves that platform. It breaks my heart that Tracey did not get more support by family directly impacted by this. Bravo to those who did support her. People need a soft place to fall and feel like they aren't alone. This movie is a journey of self discovery that anyone brave enough to hear the pain and see the empathy necessary to survive this? Those are the reviews of people who get it.Everyone has a right to their own opinion. No one has a right to behave like a bully.,False
15,10,RELATIVE,kristinwt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Relative is truly a documentary like I've never seen before. And I am a documentary queen. This one hit different. This one was literally like I was with my Chickie Ginnetti ( may she rip 2019) I felt right there. This film/documentary was captured with so much truth, genuineness & done with love & grace. Please consider watching this. It brings healing & hope to many of us that have felt alone for too long. Thank You, Tracey. I truly appreciate your genuine heart & truth. ""Anything bad was under the table."" That hit me hard. Let's stop normalizing harming souls. Let's stop normalizing trump.ok I'll stand by u.",False
16,10,Important and Powerful,melclark-13868,n/a,16/08/2025,"Relative is a powerful documentary that left me feeling seen in a way I never expected. I was struck by the filmmaker's raw honesty as she highlighted the complexities of family dynamics resulting from generations of secrets and normalizing unacceptable, often horrific, behavior. The compelling, compassionate storytelling uncovers such an important, all-too-common narrative. If you've ever felt isolated or confused by your own experiences, this documentary will be a great watch. It's a reminder that our stories are more interconnected than we might think and that we are not alone. Highly recommend!",False
17,10,This film is IMPORTANT,monicaefarren,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary will stick to you. It demonstrates a bravery and commitment to authenticity that you can't turn away from. Tracey has created such an intimate look at pain, trauma, family, guilt, shame and healing. She brought generations of family into the light to have conversations which are often had in the dark. I urge you to watch it. Share it. Celebrate anyone you know who survived it. And be inspired by how much courage Tracey has. This topic is requiring so many more people like her. Ones who are scared and sad and afraid but STILL are willing to peel back the layers to get to the truth. That this is not your fault. And that recovering is only possible with honesty.",True

1,8,A Testament To The Human Spirit,TheAnimalMother,n/a,15/08/2025,"This really is a well done documentary that basically tells the complete story from many people. Especially the families and the girls themselves. It's a fairly intimate portrait. All the people interviewed were all somehow very close to at least part of the crime, and we see the story unfold from many points of view. The girls are all extremely inspiring to say the least. It really is quite amazing that such a dark and sad story, ends up being so inspirational. The pace here is good if you enjoy watching true crime. I found it well worth the watch. I also feel like I don't need to watch anymore shows on this story, because it's that comprehensive. Unless maybe these same people make another film like this years from now. That could also be interesting. Thankfully in this horrific crime story, we get an ending that's far better than most. That's worth celebrating for sure.8.5/10.",False
2,1,Afternoon TV Drama Quality,guset-870-984535,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mega hyped in the UK- 'shocking'- 'disturbing' etc. Not in the way this was portrayed. Im sure that the real experiences of these poor women were truly horrific, but this has not been transferred to the screen, not in the slightest. Is this the woke/snowflake version? A wasted opportunity.",False

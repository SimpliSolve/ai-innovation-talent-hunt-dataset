1,9,An explanation of how vested interest succeeded in defeating science,tim-hanrahan-15-125985,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film shows how the petrochemical industry succeeded in using media/sales people to pursuade the public that the greenhouse effect wasn't happening, wasn't significant, or was even a good thing, in spite of the scientific evidence to the contrary, which they were well aware of (at least some of that research was done by scientists they employed). How well they succeded is exemplified by the fact that Myron Ebell - who, before his successes in climate change denial, had worked for the tobacco industry to deny the ill-effects of tobacco - was made head of the US's Environmental Protection Agency by Donald Trump. His smirk when recalling the fact will live with me a long time.The film did the job well, and for that reason was somewhat depressing. Just one thing bugged me - I wish that someone in the production team had told the narrator how to pronounce ""ExxonMobil"".",False
2,9,"correct but, above all, very instructive",CiprianVS,n/a,16/08/2025,"An excellent example of how information is built and disseminated. Any information.You probably won't find out many things that you didn't already know. But, if you are a regular consumer of information, you will find out how the thing you are consuming is cooked. And how is it that, although we consume without interruption, so many of us die of starvation. Or, at least, we wake up with indigestion.Otherwise, an interesting and correct documentary about a battle that humanity did not know it fought and which is already lost.Definitely worth the time, but it will leave you with a bitter taste.",False
3,10,How do conspiracy theories about the non-existence of anthropogenic climate change originate?,Hayduke555,n/a,16/08/2025,"A thought-provoking documentary, one of the few that approaches the issue of global warming and climate change from the perspective of climate skeptics. Where do tendencies of denial arise in the public? The roots of this issue lie within large corporations that both generate CO2 through their activities and profit from it. The documentary presents evidence of disinformation campaigns conducted by these corporations, including documents like the internal Action Plan against climate change, and more. They undeniably fund climate skeptics with billions of dollars, enabling these conspirators to obscure and hinder the efforts of the climate movement. Rich lobbyists influence pseudo-experts, certain media outlets, and politicians whose demagoguery supports the conspirators, and in turn, they manipulate a portion of the public through their conspiracy websites. These individuals may feel they are above it all and uncovering the truth, but in reality, they are only caught in the vicious circle of the dirtiest conspiracy theories organized by multinational corporations and interest groups profiting from climate change and the destruction of nature. Appalling. Important to watch. (similar documentaries: 'Greedy Lying Bastards' and 'Merchants of Doubt')",False
4,10,"I was thrilled to watch ""The Campaign Against the Climate""",frederikmala123,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall, ""The Campaign Against the Climate"" is a great documentary that is essential viewing for anyone concerned about the future of our planet.Furthermore, it evokes a profound sense of frustration as it unveils the baffling reality of individuals and entities actively working against the best interests of humanity. Through compelling storytelling and meticulously researched evidence, the documentary exposes the alarming phenomenon of climate denial and the vested interests that perpetuate it.In a world grappling with unprecedented environmental challenges, this film serves as a beacon of hope and a rallying cry for change. Don't miss it.",False
5,2,The title gives away the actual goal of the documentary,wp02366,n/a,16/08/2025,"The title of this documentary unwillingly reveals that you better don't expect any unbiased in-depth analysis from watching it. What even is 'The Climate' they're referring to? 'Climate' is just a state of nature. No one can 'campaign against' it, just as no one can campaign against gravity. But if the producers don't even have a useful concept of the terminology their documentary is titled with, what can you expect? Just don't be a 'climate denier' questioning the nature-healing effect of 'carbon taxes'!'Climate change' exists, just whether (and if so, to what extent) it is influenced by humans, or even actually 'dangerous' (however we may define that: for humans only? How about plants etc.?), is highly debatable. The documentary, while feeling carefully researched regarding a few mouthpieces sponsored by oil corporations, is clearly biased towards the axiom of 'man-caused climate change' and depicts skepticism (or even different climate models) as 'sponsored by oil companies' and 'dangerous for our kids'.Awareness is spreading that the idea of 'man-made, highly dangerous climate change' has its very own lobby as well, a strong and powerful one to be exact. Interestingly enough, climate catastrophism is promoted by many of the same shady, extremely well-connected and rich individuals and organizations who were also pulling the strings behind pandemic policies and are rumored to aim at pushing a 'Co2-based' social credit system on the world.Anyone interested in learning about more balanced and optimistic takes on the topic should listen to a few interviews of Alex Epstein, Peter Clack, Patrick Moore, or Saifedan Ammous.",False

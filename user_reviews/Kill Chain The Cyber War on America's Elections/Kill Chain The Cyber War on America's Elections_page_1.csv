1,8,Worthwhile Watch,infoalwaysacritic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even for Non-Americans, the question of election integrity has become extremely relevant to the foundation of a democratic process in the digital age. Is there a cyber war, is not the question, but who is winning it. If the experts in Kill Chain are to be trusted, then America, and other nations, are pretending that the war isn't even happening.As documentaries go, many are made with partisan funding and motivations, and released during election campaigns with uncanny timing. Kill Chain manages to portray a bi-partisan issue with voices from more than one administration and both sides of the aisle, even if it directly attacks key Republicans. The message is clear, but therin lies some of its faults.Harri Hursti is the focal point of the documentary, travelling around the world to speak with experts that unanimously pontificate the vulnerabilities of digital voting that lacks a paper trail of accountability for audit. He is accomplished, knowledgable and believable as an expert in the field of cyberwarfare. Assertions are made that the exploitation is a possibility, but little discussion takes place around if they are being exploited - it is assumed that they are. That sets the bar rather low when all that is required is to cast doubt. This criticism, however, is not without merit and that is where Kill Chain becomes compelling in its message.Numerous examples are provided of how the exploits can happen, and direct comments in defence of the American systems are addressed and effectively disproved with great ease. Election machines, for example, are demonstrated to be easily obtained and brought to a hackers convention that demonstrates some of the most disconcerting patterns of issues. It becomes a lost opportunity in light of the amassed circumstances that none of the official authorities or manufacturers would participate. Their silence, in this case, is deafening.",False
2,8,(Re)examining the weaknesses (in plural) of electronic voting in the US,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America's Elections"" (2020 release; 91 min.) is a documentary that (re)examines how secure electronic voting in the US really is. As the movie opens, we are introduced to Harri Hursti, a cyber security expert from Finland who specializes in elections security: ""Everything is hackable"", he bluntly states (and then later proves it), despite assurances from government officials at all levels that voting in the US is ""secure""... At this point we are 10 min. into the documentary.Couple of comments: Harri Hursti is universally recognized as one the world's top experts in these matters, and in fact this movie can be seen as a sequel of sorts to the 2006 documentary ""Hacking Democracy"", where Hursti was seen how easily he breached a voting machine right there in front of local government officials. Get this: that very same voting machine which Hursti breached back then is still scheduled to be in use in the 2020 elections in no less than 20 US states! It simply blows the mind. The 3 remaining North American manufacturers of voting machines are shown along the way as still being way too vulnerable, and apparently having little interest in fixing the issues. Later on, the documentary looks in detail at what happened in the 2018 elections in Georgia and Alaska. You simply can't make this stuff up. Surreal doesn't even begin to describe it.""Kill Chain: The Cyber Wars on America's Elections"" premiered recently on HBO and is now available on HBO On Demand and other streaming services. I am sure that this documentary will be dismissed by a certain segment of the US population as yet more ""fake news"" but the facts once again are clear and get exposed by the film makers. Let this movie serve as a reminder that there is work to be done to shore up the vulnerabilities of electronic voting in the US.",False
3,8,Not bad. Little partisan but still good,richardrc-18596,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOk. Major conservative here. This documentary is still not bad. Very informative. I'm in tech so I like the tech they talked about and discussed. Interesting to see Russians did ""hack"" the 2016 election as in the national voter rolls but nothing with changing votes. Hmm. So the democrat lie was all fake for 4 years. Typical. The bias starts coming out halfway after the GA 2018 governor election part. Brian kemp and stacie Abrams both corrupt turds. Neither should be in any power, but unfortunately, they both are. The main questions are why is this buried now on hbo and why doesn't anyone talk about it now? Where is Amy klobuchar and dick durbin on election integrity? Oh yeah their candidates and party won. Bunch of crickets now. Yawn. Was this really the most secure election ever and did a guy who can't even walk and chew gum really get elected by more people than ever before? Are we really that dumb now?Based on polls, which are always wrong by 3-5 points and still factored in, it still shows no. We aren't. This was not the most secure election nor did that many legit people vote for this buffoon. Voting rules were changed with mail in ballots that were easily hackable and changed. I'd love to hear old Haris investigation on that. But I highly doubt we'll never know that...",True
4,10,Excellent Documentary,MrBluenote,n/a,16/08/2025,No spoilers at all. Riveting in the sense that it is absolutely enlightening. This would definitely qualify in the must see category.Harri Hursti is extremely qualified on the subject and lays everything out so anyone could understand.Extremely recommended.,False
5,10,A Must See...,WinTheGreen,n/a,16/08/2025,Harri Hursti really does a fabulous job of illustrating how easy it is to hack into the system.Paper ballots with your receipt needs to be the way of the future. Technology had made our lives much easier but this is a case that can distort the will of the people.Perfect score. IMHO.,False
6,10,Why is this documentary not more widely known?,scooterdog2,n/a,16/08/2025,"For those wondering how in the world the 2020 election could simultaneously be heralded ""the most secure in US history"" by election officials, and called ""the greatest theft in the history of America"" well then ""Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America's Elections"" (2020) is for you.Harri Hursti is from Finland, and to establish his credibility we take a look at the Russia / Finland border and see a few of his childhood records establishing his rock-solid security and computer expertise. The highlight of this well-produced documentary was a recent Defcon hacker's conference, where one of the machines revealed a Windows XP login accessed remotely and hacked into.Not unexpectedly a number of parties declined to be interviewed for obvious reasons - the software is proprietary, the hardware had all kinds of ports to connect into, they travel to an eBay reseller in Ohio who has stacks of Dominion Systems machines from 2002 readily for sale, still with voting records from 2012 in them.Is there a Venezuelan connection to Dominion? Servers in Barcelona and Frankfurt? Data on flash drives that get 'lost'? I was told there was an air gap, that these machines are not connected to the Internet. Who knows, it really doesn't matter - these voting machines are hopelessly compromised in their current state.All you have to do is watch this and see for yourself how compromised our voting system in the United States is at present.",False
7,9,A must see,mike-tan-58-412540,n/a,16/08/2025,Hacking democracy was already a good documentary (2005). This doc is even beter by bringing it in WW perspective and not only the USA.,False
8,9,PAPER BALLOTS is a MUST!,The_Boxing_Cat,n/a,16/08/2025,"No ifs ands or buts about it- EVERY voting machine is vulnerable.BOTH Republicans and Democrats politicians should want to get rid of voting machines- those who disagree need to be educated- if they still disagree they should never be able to run for office.EVERYONE knows Kemp is a dirty politician, especially now with the new documentary ""2000 Mules"" (2022)
I say this as a Democrat that voted for Donald Trump.We should make voting day (NOT days) a national holiday. If well organized paper ballots can be used and counted.The film is skewed from a Democrat perspective.",False
9,1,Misleading Program,jenseninterceptor-20114,n/a,16/08/2025,"The voting machines described in the program are basic computers which can be reimaged before each use (election) to mitigate the kind of hack described in the program.If a hacker were able to gain physical or remote access to the machine, which is very unlikely, it doesn't make a lot of difference because the computer will be erased and a fresh, clean image of the operating system and applications will be deployed before each election.Even if the BIOS of the machine is compromised, the BIOS can also be flashed with a factory image, removing any modifications that have been made while the computer was in storage.The clean image of the system software, applications, and BIOS, should be stored in a safe or other secure location.Plus, most elections that I am aware of include a paper ballot which can be hand counted if there is a dispute about the vote count.I've tired of these programs that incite fear in people that don't know any better. Cyber security companies do this all the time. They make you think that the world is going to end and the only way to save yourself is to buy their software.As we saw on January 6th 2021, this kind of misleading information can create serious problems.",False
10,10,Very well produced and totally believable,kim-416-433710,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an electrical engineer, I can see the vulnerabilities and am in shock that our government is ignoring this clear and dangerous threat!!",False
11,9,Watching this ahead of election is funny,mr-altex,n/a,16/08/2025,"This sequel or follow up to Hacking Democracy (documentary from 2006) is not being taken seriously enough. All discussions in American politics repeat every 2 or so year, just changing sides depending who won and who lost.This documentary captures how easy it is to manipulate the votes pretty well. As technology moved forward, so did the security holes. It is inconceivable to have a voting machine that serves as a black box, that is relying on external data input while having data processing inside or even data link for updates that connects to intranet of some sort.I am glad my country is using good old fashion paper thrown into a sealed box and people count it at the end of the voting day.",False
12,10,Personally I find this a very REAL!!,philipmccafferypm-59915,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know it got deplatformed etc. In the wake of being dubbed conspiracy. But then Politico before the mid terms of Joe Bidens presidency were warning about hackers tunnelling into voting infrastructure in their article headlined ""6 election security threats to watch for on Election Day"". And every outlet that reviewed this documentry prior to it being deplatformed found the documentry to be a very real and troubling. I mean people can believe their eyes hackers hacking voting machines, or you can believe senators most of which cannot handle an excel spreadsheet.For me its a must watch because political honesty is a thing of the past. My faith in traditional media is gone even more so after the active Covid origins cover up. But people have to watch for themselves and make their own mind up on it.",False
13,10,Voting machines are easily rigged,ejplumley,n/a,16/08/2025,Watch a documentary on the history and ease of rigging voting machines . This documentary initially made on the heels of russia hoax but is a blueprint for future hacking and rigging elections in the USA.,False
14,10,Everyone should watch this documentary!,majorwebuser,n/a,16/08/2025,"You think you know how our voting system(s) work? You think hacking our vote is a myth or fake news? You think this is a partisan issue? You think the 'experts' and politicians have been honest about this issue? If you answered yes to any of this, you clearly don't know the truth. This documentary reveals some troubling facts that you need to know!",False

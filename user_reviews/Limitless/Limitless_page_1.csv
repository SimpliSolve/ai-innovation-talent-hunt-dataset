1,7,An easy watch that makes you think.,Shaaranya,n/a,16/08/2025,"Limitless starts off pretty slow. The first episode is very basic and feels stretched too long. The science in it is so simple that even the average viewer might find it hard to sit through it. The subsequent episodes are much much better and the challenges are fun to watch.The show speeds up from the second episode and the science becomes deeper and more interesting to watch and follow.The last episode is probably the most important one. It's slow, but in a good way this time. Certain parts even brought tears to my eyes by just thinking about the things shown for my own life. The finale gives the show a very strong ending.The stories about different people and tribes in each episode give the show a different feel which I loved.Some of the acting feels very forced at times and so do the dialogues. I think it's because the team has tried to make it feel like a movie. The close-up face cam with the experts also feel odd.Chris is fun to watch as always. Ross and Peter as experts made the show very interesting. Overall, the show is great and will definitely make you rethink your daily routine, diet, exercise and other habits.Limitless should be used as motivation for all viewers to make changes in our lives to ensure that we grow old healthy.",False
2,9,Simply One of the Best,dlmvegas,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis six episode series is one of the best I have seen in a very long time. It makes you really dig deep into yourself and shows you how to improve your health physically and mentally. The final episode will really get your mind thinking about your past, present, future life and eventual death. Some episodes were a real wake up for me. As I've aged I've slacked off on the physical part of my body. That will be changing for sure beginning now. I have my own little gym at home and intend to use every piece of equipment in there now. I may even start to do Tai Chi as one episode showed. Everybody should watch this series.",True
3,9,"Beautifully shot, informative and entertaining",jarondpront,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some episodes (naturally) interested me more then others, but there all beautifully shot, beautiful landscapes. The information bits inbetween are well done, informative, interesting and bite sized. Chris's voice over and narration is great.Chris in this in general is funny, and brings his friends on these crazy rides. The episodes I've seen even inspired me to think about these aspects of health. Like I said the cinematography is great, and the episodes have this theme where they show a different story of someone else that compliments the main story, this really makes this fresh. One episode kind of made me feel being on a an adventure and wanting to try to embrace the cold aswell a bit more.Would recommend giving this show a watch, even if you end up enjoying some episodes more than others.",False
4,10,Excellent,codamax1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most inspiring series I have watched ever I think. I hope everyone takes the time to watch it on Disney plus. Really makes you think and appreciate life and the memories. And it really motivated me to exercise more, fast longer and live life love life. Thanks Chris you are truly a great human I hope you and Elsa live very long healthy lives with your family. Your heart your strength your endurance your love for family and friends was so genuine and inspiring. I truly believe this experience will definitely make your life and others that watch it lives Much longer much calmer much happier and definitely more appreciative of every moment they have here in this earth. I don't have much family and I hope I find the love you have in your life because with love you can truly endure anything in this life and into the next. Cheers. Kandis in Texas.",False
5,10,Brilliant,mactucker92,n/a,16/08/2025,"We need more shows like this. It was educational, entertaining, used a host I already knew, and the footage was breathtaking. There experiments that feel corny at the moment, but the stunts are a means an to an end. It is absolutely all about the content in between the stunt scenes.Chris shows how taking oneself seriously is far more important than getting initial praise. Time and time again he leads by example while his friends/colleagues drop out of individual challenges. The show also provides tips at the end of each episode to show how you could incorporate the new life hacks into your own routine.",False
6,10,A profound look at the Hemsworth.. and ourselves!,cheninnewson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Life is fragile. Life is confronting. Life is fleeting. And we need to prioritise what we choose to devote our finite time to. Chris has exposed so much of his vulnerabilities in this series. Before this he seemed infallible and a man with everything at his fingertips, but thankfully for us all.. he's just like us. We are treaded to a very raw and beautiful side to Chris that I personally am grateful for seeing. To then find out post production of this series Hemsworth had decided to take some time away from work to devote to his family (I believe this was due to a rare genetic condition relating to alzheimers) it was evident that this show was a big awakening for him too.",False
7,8,Surprisingly good...,TD_Diamond,n/a,16/08/2025,TV is really hit and miss these days but at least this coming out of NatGeo as it does gives you some guarantee of quality.I found this to be really watchable.Because Chris tells us in the beginning he has trouble coping with stress then that really contextualises this series.He goes off and explores ways of dealing with stress in a more positive fashion and succeeds and fails as well from time to time making this a bit more human than you'd probably expect.It's shot in very scenic parts of the world making it nice on the eye.The show also brings in experts from around the world to inform Chris and us as to how different factors make all the difference - and possibly even prolong life - when stress is a factor.I also noticed the soundtrack by Keefus Ciancia was really well done.It's quality.,False
8,6,Superficial but good if it motivates,bobetjo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Chris Hemsworth is very personable and watchable. And that's a good thing because a lot of detail is missed in making this high production series photogenic. The experts are wasted, in my view.Each episode starts with a challenge to illustrate the issue. Such as managing stress, fasting or cold water. That days expert is introduced. A beautiful graphic, in pop-up book style, shows the supposed benefit. Then there is a very superficial ""preparation"" shown. Chris does the challenge to dramatic music. There may also be vignettes of a tribe or religious monks who practice the discipline but no explanation of whether they will benefit.So the program cheats the audience twice. The challenge is exactly that. A challenge. For example the stress of the week was to walk along a high crane. So Chris got some coaching from a psychologist. I wanted to hear more from her. The cheat was that this did not address the real killer stress whichever is the long, grinding lifestyle kind. Work mostly. But also family, finance and environment.The second cheat was the supposed preparation. I believe Chris did the work. But it was not shown. So the cold water swim, another challenge, had a a tiny bit on acclimation. Some surfing in a fjord. There is some evidence of benefits, and it would have been nice to see Chris increasing his exposure gradually. As I'm sure he did.However, if this gets people interested then it will be a good thing.",False
9,10,Love it,michael-561-692892,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great mix of what all these producers put together. Documentary of science combined with big time action actor. Love the cinematography, build up of story and sound combined with the challenges and openness.It's like watching real life training to be invincible. Chris did it all. Very impressed. I couldn't do these tests. Surprised we haven't seen other actors show their training like this. Makes a ton of sense and is quite entertaining. Love that Chris brought his pals along for the ride.I don't want to give much away but I think this was done real well and I still have 35 characters to write...",False
10,7,An entertaining way to show what we know today about trying to slow aging,jon-22643,n/a,16/08/2025,"The series was tailored for Hemsworth measurements, as he is an athlete by nature so he was able to perform the required activities.So it is fun to watch him training and struggling and joking about it, but in terms of quality content, for me there were no revelations, anyone who is interested in the sciense of aging and watches related youtube channels already knows the basics that are presented in the episodes. It's devestatiing still, to see that we have some tools we can use to slow aging and the deterioration of the bodt, and mainly prevent hard deseases such as cancer and brain function in old age but still it's clear, even in Limitness, that nothing really stops aging. All the old peaple shown in these episodes looks old, they may be in better shape and more vital then many others and without deases but they look at there age and not younger meaning that the aging process does not stop, yet the body is still able to function better and the person does not suffer from illness which is common in old age. I think that in 20 years when people will watch this it will still be relevant. Fasting, wordout, stress management, exposure to heat and cold, we know it's healthy and beneficial, but still, non of it will add many years to your life (it may add some, but the chances to pass 100 is very low no matter what you do, the human body geneticlly is programed to last for a limited time which can be extended a bit, but not much more). A reminder is that the oldest people on earth where not athletes, did not fast, did not expose themselfs to very hot or cold temp, and did nothing except being active and not eating too much. The bottom line is that today we can do things that will allow us to live and still be active till our 90s maybe, to avoid dying prematurely from cancer or heart deases, so extending the time we have without the suffereing of illness, and add some quaility years to our lives, but at the end aging can't be stoppes with any of these tools. A new technology and can impact DNA is required and it will take many years to find it.",False
11,10,Entertaining And Educational As Hemsworth Tests The Limits Of The Human Body And Finds What May Lead To A Longer Life,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This six episode docu-series is entertaining to watch, and, at times, educational - in a very fun way. Limitless With Chris Hemsworth tests the limits of the human body and finds what may lead to a longer life.Limitless With Chris Hemsworth follows -- you guessed it -- Chris Hemsworth, occasionally with his friends and family, on a six-episode journey to find ways to boost longevity and quality of life.It's fascinating to see some unexpected ways we could achieve longevity and a better life. Of course, not all of these actions can and/or should be imitated by the average person, but there are ways that you can modify what's in the episodes and apply it to your own life. Examples include fasting for one day a month or turning the shower on cold for the last 30 seconds or spending time in a sauna - these practices can help lead to a longer life. Some of the episodes include Stress-Proof, Memory, and Strength. My favorite episode is Acceptance, where Chris gets to experience firsthand what it's like to be old and how to accept that. I really found it interesting to watch Chris Hemsworth outside of the MCU and be just himself. It adds something more personal and makes the audience feel connected to him in a new way.The message of Limitless With Chris Hemsworth is to accept aging because it's a part of life, and yet there are ways to make life healthier and longer lasting. There are some very risky things done in this show that should not be done without expert supervision.I give Limitless With Chris Hemsworth 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This series comes out on Disney+ November 16, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!",False
12,7,"Where National Geographics meet science, athletics and acting",DM_2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Generally, it is a good show, good content. Definitely highly recommended for middle aged people who find themselves consumed and lost in life. Especially after covid a lot of people are struggling physically and mentally. Thus, congratulations for the team for creating this content and hopefully it will guide some lost or declining souls back on the right path.Some episodes are better (or at least come across more realistic) than other. Surely it is a bit surprising to see that the A list mega start Chris Hemsworth would have any crimpling struggles in life while being surrounded by strong supportive family and a few dozen of people who's sole goal is to make him successful. Some obvious doubts aside it was genuinely good experience until people saw episode about strength and all of the sudden magic was gone! For someone who is among most genetically and athletically gifted people on planet earth to cry about climbing rope was just shocking. Albeit there was no clear timeline it seems that it took over 5 months, a large team of PT's and doctors helping this God like strength and endurance machine to climb a rope. And then there was his tiny wife without any help or training climbing that rope like it's nothing...Needless to say, it takes a few days for this to sink in one's brain. Then, all sorts of interesting thoughts come to life: How much of this show is real and how much is it fiction? To what level of detail is it planned and scripted? What was actually happening behind the scenes? Is Chris Hemsworth on steroids? Is this show just for marketing and appearances?In summary - it is a good show and good content. It appears to be scripted and acted as a fictional movie to some extent. If that is the case - it would be disappointing... It is still 7/10, if it would be genuine - maybe it could even be 10/10! This show has potential for new trends, could really be good, entertaining, and educational content for world's aging population. But only if it is genuine! Not marketing, decorated truth or acting.",False
13,5,Poor timing,jshatka,n/a,16/08/2025,"One major thing that sucks about this is it was all filmed 2 to 3 years before they released it. I also dislike the fact that they dumb things down and leave out a lot of information because they assume the average person wouldn't understand it. It's patronizing and annoying. The side stories that are introduced on each episode are the real gems and highlights, and what make each new episode worth watching. Chris is just a bit annoying in each episode, but I believe it's facetious and the producers are egging him into this kind of forced behavior. That's the vibe that is given off as you make your way through each episode.",False
14,10,Absolutely amazing,m-lekyrova,n/a,16/08/2025,"Inspiring. Intriguing. Lots of new information. Lots of tears and laughter. Lots of joy. I already knew almost every professional in each episode, but with this new approach it was just a joy to watch. Also beautifully made, all the shooting locations and the camera is just fantastic. We need more shows like this one! Well done everybody! I totally recommend it to anyone who likes to think, who is not scared of deep feelings, who wants to better themselves and evolve. Definitely going to recommend it to lots of people and rewatch it myself. Again, well done everyone and a big Olé, Chris Hemsworth!",False
15,10,I have never reviewed anything 10/10,kicsi-ally,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not exaggerating.10-10
Who is going to be at your death bed?Are you as strong as you think?Do you think of old age?Do you have any idea what your brain is capable of?Have you accepted everything ?Do you live in the moment ?Are you an actor in your real life?How have you changed yourself so far? Not life? But you?? Do you challenge yourself enough?I can go on an on with questions, but if you have any of these questions you might find and answer watching these episodes.It is exciting, it is entertaining it is educational but most of all the most thought provoking show I have watched in a while . Don't take my word for it. Watch it.Best acting Chris will ever do just joke .",False
16,10,Top,almarpam,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Limitless with Chris Hemsworth"" offers an exhilarating journey into the realms of wellness and longevity. Hemsworth's charismatic presence, combined with groundbreaking scientific insights, makes this series a compelling watch. Each episode explores unique methods to enhance body and mind, pushing the boundaries of human potential. The blend of personal storytelling and cutting-edge research provides both inspiration and practical advice. A must-watch for anyone interested in transcending their limits and discovering the full spectrum of human capability. I highly recommend the series. Cheers.",False
17,10,Spectacular and life changing,landivanrensburg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've had panic attacks lately from lots of stress. I decided to watch this series today. It also happens to be the 15th wedding anniversary and 29 years together today of my husband and I. Not trying to spoil anything but there is a beautiful moment between Chris and his wife in the final episode that is both staggeringly romantic but also sad.Chris could easily come off as just another big guy from Hollywood. Generic and produced. He makes one feel like he means what he says and truly seems to be a thinker. I highly recommend this as a must watch.The life stories and scenery, ten out of ten!",False
18,7,Great overall but missed huge opertunities.,kristiandalziel-63686,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFor me episode 1 was a great start but the lady expect was a waste of space and chris could have done this without her. Trhe following eppisodes got better and better but the one of fasting could have been so much better.The final episode was awful, I am not against facing my own death but the make believe old people home/village was just rediculous and the aging of Chris's wife was so bad that he recognised her before she even turned around. The guy who was the self proclaimed god of palliative care was just terrible, most of the lessons here are learned by most people buy their early 20s through loss of family and friends. What a terrible way to round of a really good series. Don't let this put you off but I can tell you, you won't miss anything if you do not watch the final episode, but you will get an hour of your life back and I think Chris will be ok with that :)",True
19,10,"Incredibly Well Made Series - Entertaining, Educational, Inspiring",longacre-24299,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching the 6 episodes of Limitless and I was blown away by the incredible performance of Chris Hemsworth. As a huge fan of his work, I was excited to see him push himself to the limits in this new show, and he did not disappoint.Throughout the season, we see Hemsworth undergo rigorous physical and mental tests that push the boundaries of human strength and performance. From climbing towering ropes to taking on complex mental challenges, Hemsworth showcases his incredible talent and dedication to the craft.But what really sets this show apart is the captivating storytelling and production. The camera work is top-notch, giving us an up-close and personal look at Hemsworth's journey as he tests his limits. The editing is seamless, creating a thrilling and immersive viewing experience.Overall, I give Limitless a 10 out of 10. It's a must-see for fans of Hemsworth and anyone looking for an exciting and inspiring new show. Can't wait to see what challenges Hemsworth takes on next!",False
20,7,"Fun, thrilling, room for improvement",dmv_gary,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a brilliant idea. Having one of the most famous and lovable buff guy doing challenges that even pushes him to the limit, and explore a healthier life style through the process, is probably one of the best forms of educational videos. I have a collection of NG VCDs as a kid and this program managed to glue me to the screen once again after all these years.I do have problems with having so many cuts during each one of the challenges, which make the whole thing less believable and less exciting to watch.And to top it off, what the F is a Shaolin black-belt. That really threw me off and made me doubt if any of the information in the previous episodes is made up as well.Overall a fun show to watch, and some of the methods in it can actually be applied to an average Joe & Jane's daily life.",False
21,10,Limitless was limitless,sbowman-50099,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was one of the best documentaries I have seen! It really makes you think and consider what really limits us for pushing our limits! I learned so much from this series and hope Chris can continue to search out new challenges like our limits to how we live our lives in a spiritual sense. Also how about how we need to tap our inner child by using humor and playfulness. Another challenge is finding your purpose in life. As Elenor Roosevelt once said ""the two most important days in your life is the day you were born and the day you figure out why."" I rate this series highest because we can all learn from these discoveries.",False
22,2,"Meh, rich people doing rich people stuff.",spfalk-80154,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing really groundbreaking, simply reiterating what has been known by physicians and scientists for decades. The difference is it's presented by an A-list star and good cinematography. Having a successful, wealthy, well known actor hosting isn't necessarily bad, but it's hard to relate to someone who has the luxury of focusing solely on their health rather than spending that time working to survive. Also, I'm not sure a social psychologist from a business school is very credible, and that is the first ""expert"" in the series . I guess they couldn't be bothered to talk with real experts. A simple read of the literature regarding common characteristics and lifestyles of centenarians would be far more valuable for most people than viewing this show.",False

I need to own a dvd copy so I can watch it every year to be inspired again and again!Bravo to every single person who had a hand in creating this masterpiece!Thank you, thank you, thank you!I'm a science nut to begin with but this series had some new science I've never heard about.

1,10,Beautiful and educational documentary,walshs101-811-970114,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amazing educational documentary. I had no idea that Florida was home of wild panthers. Now, I want to visit this area of Florida to see if I can spot one of these illusive gorgeous animals. Great job depicting the Florida panthers and the challenges these animals face due to the overdevelopment of land. As an animal and nature lover it is an eye-opening documentary with extraordinary views of Florida wildlife. It is exciting to see the filming crew going through so much effort to capture images of the panthers and their kittens. It is simply breathtaking and heart warming adventure into the wild. Loved it!",False

1,7,It was decent,mmarois,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerDecent documentary outlining the predatory student loan industry and a bit of how we got here. Generally some good advice for high school students looking to go to college; applying for scholarships, choosing a school that costs less, working while in school to reduce their debt burden.I think they harp too much on the idea that any amount of debt is bad and everyone should strive to have no student debt at all. That's just currently not feasible for most people and there is still truth to the idea that you won't be able to make as much money in college as you will in your career so delaying paying for your degree can be positive as long as you run the numbers ahead of time. Obviously a teacher doesn't make enough money to pay off $100k in loans but taking $20k to help bridge the gap to making college work can be paid off relatively easily on the career you got from that degree.",True
2,10,Compelling!,samstark-00818,n/a,17/08/2025,"Honestly Shocking. Student Loans have truly become the normal way of life for higher education and before seeing this documentary I didn't give much attention to it. Now I see there is MASSIVE problem that cannot be left untouched, and the government sure ain't gonna fix it.",False
3,10,All high schooler should see this,kgossettcsu,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary is eye opening for high schoolers that don't understand what student loans will do to their future. I would highly recommend watching it to parents and high schoolers.It's essential that people understand the impact of these loans on their future. Too many people don't understand the impact until it's too late to make a different choice. That is why this documentary is so great. There are other options, like cheaper schools that have just as good quality of education but maybe not all the hype, plus scholarships and working through college.I don't know why other commenters are so harsh... my heart broke for some of the people they interviewed. I am definitely showing this to my kids when they get to high school.",False
4,10,Powerful documentary that exposes a societal cancer,betterjedi,n/a,17/08/2025,"The documentary does a great job of providing facts about the student loan crisis. The round table interviews that Anthony did with the students was startling. I teach high school and I see this similar attitude a lot. Most of my students want to go to a big college for the lifestyle or because they think it's expected. They won't even consider getting just as good of an education at a local community college.I do wish the documentary spent more time revealing ideas for how students can get their degrees cheaper. Also, to the people who think you have to have a degree to get a job, you are part of the problem. That's simply not true. Trade schools are a great, cheap alternative to 4 year colleges.",False
5,5,Okay but misses the other side,papocasey,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was an okay documentary. I have a hard time garnering sympathy for a gentleman who put himself 100k in debt, played 3 sports, didn't work through college, and then is singing the blues about being in so much debt they couldn't take a honeymoon because he couldn't afford it on a teachers salary.Where's the responsibility of the borrower to know a sociology degree will more than likely not get you a lucrative job to fulfill your obligations?Even way less sympathy for the orthodontist and his wife who put themselves a million dollars into debt because he more than likely will be able to pay his debt back several times over.I guess what I'm saying is these lenders are predatory but the borrower also bears some responsibility as well.",True
6,3,Half the Story and Unrealistic,john-tyce,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerApparently kids can fill out $500 scholarship applications everyday and end up getting $95K-$500K scholarships to pay for college in full. City colleges are $25K per year if you're living on campus. My son moved back home and drives 90 miles round trip to school to saves the money, but with gas and tolls are we really saving? Even community college tuition has gone through the roof. This documentary does not take the huge rise in cost into consideration. Apparently the whole student loans problem is ""the fact that kids take out loans. One person had the nerve to suggested that you can learn it all online for free and companies are looking more at the person rather then the piece of paper. What companies????!!!! They all demand a degree for jobs that really don't need one and give preference to grads from more expensive colleges.",True
7,1,Skip it,beniotlakos,n/a,17/08/2025,"Not a horrible watch, but nothing you can't get for free just by reading opinion articles in any major publication. The characters weren't believable, and the ending was predictable.",False

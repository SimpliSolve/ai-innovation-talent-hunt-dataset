1,10,The Robertsons are back and funnier than ever,benjaminchubb,n/a,15/08/2025,"5 years after Duck Dynasty, the boys are finally back on TV. It was great to see Si, Jase and Jep hunting for that elusive treasure. Although the cast has aged since, their senses of humour haven't left. 10/10.",False
2,10,Enjoyable family show and educational.,kirklandconsultingtx,n/a,15/08/2025,"I enjoy watching with my husband and teenage daughter. You know a show is good when your teenager watches it. Not only is the show entertaining it's also educational. We've learned a lot about civil war history from this show and about different interesting places in America. We've been looking into buying a metal detector to treasure hunt here in East Texas and around Jefferson, Texas We love Mr. Murray and all the guys so much! I just wish more of the family would be involved in the show. This family is an inspiration to all Christians in America. We Can't wait for season 3!! Hurry up please!!!!!",False
3,10,Finally a good show!,robertswalker-81232,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good clean family fun with so many laughs. It is so good to see this family back on tv especially so close to my home town. The balance of joking around with real treasure hunting that finds items of our history of real patriotism checks all the boxes for me. Genuine authentic people who are living life to the fullest and are naturally entertaining. The show goes to several locations in Louisiana and Mississippi with Uncle Si being the leader of the pack an we meet Murray, the treasure hunting pro, for the first time. I loved Duck Dynasty and was begging for more Robertson family content and boy did Fox Nation deliver.",False
4,10,This show is a Treasure,ChrisToppings,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an amazing show. Love to see The Robertsons back. They bring some extreme comfort to my family. We are always intrigued by their intelligence and their faith driven endeavors. FoxNation please renew this for season 3. I think people are finally catching on. Watch Jase, Jep, Murry, and Si bond is something awesome. I hope the future holds more of this show and interaction with the family. This world needs the Robertsons back in some way or form. And this show is perfect. They are the best with unscripted television. Love love love this show. I'd love to see them do lots of seasons like they did on Duck Dynasty.",False

1,7,Spooky treat for halloween,pdmcfarlane-180-322626,n/a,15/08/2025,"This looks to be a spin of from Help My House is Haunted, which is an entertaining 'ghost hunting' program. Ian is a lot more believable as a the lead than some other programs of this type.Whether you believe in the subject matter or view it as entertainment, it is worth watching.There are criticisms for sure and some highly skeptical viewers will simply point out various flaws to 'debunk' the show as fake (if you don't believe in the sipernator exorcism then you are not going to changed in to a believer).Ian is an Anglican exorcist (Catholicism doesn't have a monopoly on performing exorcisms contrary to other reviews) and in this show, sets out to help a lady who is displaying signs of possession. It is about the right level of spooky to maintain a semblance of belief, it could be far more extreme and over the top, like a number of US based shows of the same topic.It won't challenge your beliefs either way nor will it terrify you to the point you can't sleep. It is entertaining and for those who enjoy the paranormal shows it is worth a watch.",False
2,7,He's NOT a Catholic Priest!,imdbfan-4216739393,n/a,15/08/2025,"People are griping saying he can't do this without the Vatican's approval and that he's mutilated himself with tattoos and therefore can't be a real priest.That stuff doesn't apply. He's Church of England clergy and they are a lot more lenient about stuff like that. Nobody would even blink at it now except for old school Catholics.What's important here is not how he looks. It's the job he's doing. I'm fine with him and I found the show rather interesting coming from a COE clergy perspective.It's not something you see often and it's quite a different take on exorcism I think, It's nice to see something besides a Catholic one.",False
3,1,Felt silly and boring,pegdingle,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't know why they bothered. Felt forced and fake. Lots of contradictions. Ian leading her and telling her how she would feel to which she just agrees. When she was 'crying' there was not any actual tears. Boring footage of her badly acting infront of cameras just wondering around and talking out loud. She just seemed like a peri menopausal woman who was feeling a bit screwy (we've all been there) who has an obvious crush on ian lawman. I'm glad there's only one. Please don't make more it was as boring as watching paint dry. And no I didn't expect head turning, spitting and vomit. I at least expected someone who could act beyond seemingly like it was a poor school stage playIan said 'as soon as I opened door she was running away from me', she spoke to him then stepped back to allow him and crew in when he asked if they could go in.Jane was asking her what she saw in the mirror and continually ked her. What 40 year old doesn't hate what they see sometimes? That's because are self esteem is affected not because we see a demon.He consulted a demonologist but aren't all ordained priests a demonologist?How is he an ordained exorcist when you have to be Catholic to be an exorcist and he's Cof E? Not a Catholic priest? He's married so can't be a Catholic priest.In help my house is haunted he always demands and gets a name from the demon, yet in this they said demons rarely give names. In HMHIH they say they can't banish a demon until they know it's name, yet they banished this one no problems?.Ian would say things like 'tell me if you feel repulsed I can see you feel repulsed' to which of course she woudk agree. He would tell her how he's expecting her to feel then ask if she felt it and of course like a love struck teenager she agreed.Her body language throughout suggested she was lying. Smirking. Hiding mouth with hand, touching face etc. Of course no doubt it will be said these are signs of possession.It didn't seem like there was any proof of any possession or haunting beyond what she said.She contradicted herself, spoke to them and wrote this letter but failed to say she had a ghost in her bed, and her husband failed to tell Ian that when Ian was asking what had happened, surely you wouldn't forget to mention a major thing like that.In the end he said 'I can see makeup' as though this was proof of her miraculous recovery - yet the day previous she's clearly caked in makeup. Only difference is she was wearing brighter warmer tones which of course is no accident.It felt very fake and false. No thank you.",True
4,1,Not real at all.,johnnyt-32630,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show is definitely fake. The acting is just horrendous and the story feels like a toddler wrote it. For people that know anything about exorcists, they know that you have to be a Catholic priest and essentially move up through the Vatican. Catholic priest can not get married. And tattoos are certainly not one of the Church's devotions. Mutilation of one's body is not laudable. In canon law, if a man desires to become a priest or deacon, the fact that he has a tattoo may require him to obtain a written dispensation in order to receive and to then exercise Holy Orders. Don't waste your time watching this garbage.",False
5,10,A Great 'Help! My House Is Haunted' Spin Off.,skyeken-07903,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just love this guy. Been watching him on 'Help My House Is Haunted'. I know everything on that show is real as most of the things I've experienced myself where I currently live. Yes ghosts are real. You may believe it, you may not but all I can say is to experience it is to not just believe but to know. To know is, I can assure you scary and mind boggling.Anyway, it has opened my mind to all sorts of possibilities that I never thought, including possession, demons etc. Some of the voices I have recorded here are certainly sinister/mischievous for sure.It may seem like an act to the sceptical but I honestly believe in spirit attachments. As ghosts exist, who knows what they are capable of? Science has a LOT to learn. Great show and I hope it is successful. The world needs to face the truth about these things just like UFO evidence is becoming undeniable too.",False
6,n/a,The real deal,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think Ian is one of the leading psychics in the world today. He's as good as Amy Allan, who I also believe to be the real deal. Lots of people don't understand how it would be possible to experience these things.... until they experience it themselves. Ian would be the first person I'd contact if something was bothering me! The show is not over the top, it feels authentic. The balance is right in terms of entertainment and genuine evidence. I definitely liked the addition of Jayne in this programme. I keep checking back to see when the 2nd episode will be released. Barry should be involved too as they are all brilliant together. Ian definitely deserves his own show though, he's a great leading presenter. Very charismatic, empathetic, pragmatic and just a very likeable guy who knows his stuff!",False
7,10,Don't judge/ knock what you don't understand.,shane-ryan-sully,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great show with an authentic bloke with genuine vibes and he's an ordained priest. I've watched Ian in a show called Help my house is Haunted.Quoted - Ian Lawman is an ordained CofE exorcist and has been featured on a number of successful television shows including Most Haunted, I'm Famous and Frightened, Living With The Dead, Help My House is Haunted and Celebrity Help My House is Haunted. At 16 Ian become a top Dancer and Fashion model. His modelling won him the accolade of being the Face of 1997. Later, after many years of fighting his natural abilities, Ian succumbed to his role as a psychic. He is now a well-known figure in the world of the unknown and paranormal. In his time, he's been screened holding the world's ever live SÃ©ance, the world's first live Ouija board session and he famously performed the first ever Exorcism shown on UK TV. His latest TV show, The Yorkshire Exorcist.Google search Ian Lawman before writing silly reviews doubting his or shows legitimaticy.Just thought I'd give a nod to this guy and his work as I'm firm believer we live among people steered down wrong path by some other powers from other dimensions affecting us. It's a positive practice he provides. Think the more people helped the better society would be.",False

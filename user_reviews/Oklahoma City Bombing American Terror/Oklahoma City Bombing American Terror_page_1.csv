1,7,Excellent.,atifayazsuleman,n/a,15/08/2025,A great documentary but I would have like to seen this as a more lengthy series with some focus on the interviews Timothy McVeigh gave to understand his reasons in more detail. A ten part series would be much better. This seemed to compressed given the scale of the bombing and how it has been the largest domestic terrorist attack in US history. It would be better to speak to more survivors and how it changed their lives. Also there should have been more background on Timothy McVeigh's childhood including his family. Did the film-makers try and speak to his as family? Are they in they in the witness protection progeamme?,False
2,8,A powerful documentary.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary explores that fateful day in 1995, when a bomb went off in Oklahoma's Federal building and the subsequent investigation that followed.It will never not be a shocking story, without a doubt this is one of America's biggest and most grotesque terrorist attacks.I've seen a few documentaries about the event, but this is arguably the best of the lot, at ninety minutes long it's actually quite concise, they could easily have stretched this out over three hours or so.Even if you know the storyline, there's so much content revealed here that I was unaware of, unbelievable. Once again as a somewhat conservative minded Brit, I just find myself baffled by the gun laws in The US.Very powerful, very moving, hearing about the children who were caught up in the explosion made my heart sink, it's a shocking revelation, that poor mother.Some incredible footage, including interviews with those directly affected and some incredible shots of the building after the explosion.8/10.",False
3,7,Great documentary,urkus,n/a,15/08/2025,"Now 30 years after the Oklahoma City Bombing, we have this great documentary. Netflix is very good making documentaries.There is a lot of footage about what happened. Second by second, minute by minute, hour and hour and day by day.There is new information that I didn't know. But I am not gonna talk about that, because you should watch it. This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen about that tragic day. Lots of video images and a lot of archives and data that is very interesting. You will find answers to a lot of questions about why, who and what happened that 19 of April 30 years ago.I hope you like it. It's worth the time!7 stars out of 10.",False
4,7,A concise & sharp doc with clear-eyed recollections of domestic terrorism...,mdw0526,n/a,15/08/2025,"I clearly remember this incident when it happened in April 1995 (this and the OJ trial verdict are etched into my brain). I'd been living in San Francisco only a few years, still finding my footing in my career, and the recent 101 California Street shooting was fresh in our minds. This film is concise and sharp, delivered with straightforward storytelling and well chosen interviews that offer clear-eyed recollections without a deep dive into pathos. While it leaves many questions unanswered, as we'll never truly grasp the motives behind such savagery, the doc points to the unsettling throughline of the extremist ideology that fueled Timothy McVeigh and the swirling eddy of disinformation in today's America. It's a thoughtful, timely reminder that domestic terrorism's specter persists, even three decades on, and a must-watch for anyone seeking clear-eyed insight into America's darkest impulses.",False
5,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of Oklahoma City Bombing: American Terror,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Oklahoma City bombing occurred on April 19, 1995, carried out by two terrorists named Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. The Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building was the main target of said bombing, as over 150 denizens lost their lives amidst the dust and rubble. That's the blueprint for Oklahoma City Bombing: American Terror, a competent documentary which begs the audience member to dredge up the sadness and utter gloom of something that happened thirty years ago. ""I thought maybe I was dead, but I was buried alive."" Yeesh!So yeah, ""American Terror"" is not a frills docu nor does it try like heck to reinvent the desperado wheel. It does however give you the proverbial creeps as you watch it, loading up with 82 minutes of grainy archives, old school social media platforms, and present-day interviews from the battered people who were there. The Oklahoma City bombing, well it predates 9/11 and COVID and the D. C. sniper attacks and Columbine and all the other despairing crap this country has had to go through. Director Greg Tillman knows this and gives ""American Terror"" the feel of a horror film and/or lingering incubus. It's like taking in the look of The Belko Experiment or 2017's The Snare but without all the aspects of being arcane.Oklahoma City Bombing: American Terror, yup it's lean and mean, a mere thumbnail as opposed to viewing something about the same occurrence via a miniseries or whatnot. A haunting image of the dissected building here, a haunting image of a projectile victim there, the actual explosion caught on vintage camcorder, an overhead shot of an edifice that looks like the inside of a fraying skeleton. ""American Terror"" with its mere, brief snapshot of a running time, almost feels like a cinematic hack job. That's if it weren't so darn soul-stirring. Gravity ""bomb"".",True
6,9,"Thrilling, comprehensive,",budd-39178,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the start, the tragedy of this lost and unloved Iraq war vet's heartless Act of terrorism is portrayed with human stories: a woman rescued from the rubble, first responders and community volunteers acting bravely and competently, victims' families just stunned and grieving. I appreciated learning not only previously unfamiliar details of the bombing and subsequent investigation but have so many Oklahomans selflessly risked their lives in the rescue efforts and offered any help they could provide.I thought there was an appropriate amount of original video, interviews and context. I liked that the score didn't needlessly try to amp up the pathos.",False
7,8,Very good but confronting documentary of the horrific Oklahoma City Bombing that occured 30 years ago.,Cinemaniac1984,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary details the Oklahoma City bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on 19 April 1995. Timothy McVeigh, a former US Army veteran who served in the Gulf War, was responsible for masterminding the bombing in which 168 people were killed. The documentary also interviews survivors, loved ones of the victims, those that were caught up in the bombing, and police officers and FBI agents.There was a lot I didn't really know when I first saw this all over the news when I was 11 years old back in 1995. I just remember the aftermath of the bombing on TV and Timothy McVeigh being escorted outside the courthouse in handcuffs and prison jumpsuit.The documentary was very good. It is confronting going through all the details but it was good to finally see all the details of the events of that fateful day and the investigation and everything that followed.8/10.",False
8,8,"Short, emotional, and impactful.",mmartin64,n/a,15/08/2025,"This might be the only time these words are written about a Netflix documentary, ever: It should've been longer. Normally, Netflix specializes in taking a topic that merits an hour-long documentary, and somehow stretches it into a 4 episode, 3-hour endurance test.The runtime is divided into interviews with the victims of the bombing, the first responders, the investigators of the aftermath, recounting the events that led up to the bombing, and some short audio recordings of Timothy McVeigh.There are longer documentaries out there that speculate about larger conspiracies, but this focuses on the three men charged and sentenced for the crime. Again, I am surprised that Netflix didn't dedicate numerous episodes to chasing those threads.The actual timeline - the renting of the Ryder truck, the explosion, and finally to McVeigh being captured was about 3 days total - so it is a very short, and straightforward, narrative.Timothy McVeigh has always been a bit of an enigma to me, because there was not much known about him. Well, this documentary reveals the reason there isn't much in-depth knowledge of McVeigh...because there isn't much depth there at all.He comes across as a person who is angry at the world but doesn't seem to quite know why. He rails against gun restrictions and government overreach, but it seems more like a convenient outlet to vent his anger than a genuine passion. The audio clips reveal a person who was adrift and decided to lash out at the world. He couldn't fit in with society, couldn't fit in the Army, and couldn't fit in when he came back to civilian life. A lost soul.The interviews with the survivors, and the relatives of those who were lost are poignant. One survivor committed herself to making real changes in her life, so she would not look back with regrets on her second chance. I feel like many of them had allowed the events of that day to scar over and become a painful memory, so I appreciate them opening up again about the worst day of their life.This documentary does a fine job of covering the nuts and bolts of the events that led up to the bombing, the bombing, and the aftermath. The easiest part of any documentary is the ""how"" part of what happened. Because the three main participants (McVeigh, Nichols, and Fortier) are dead, jail for life, and in witness protection respectively, we'll never really know the ""why"" of what they did. Timothy McVeigh speaks about what he did, but it's mostly empty phrases of bravado - no real insight.A warning to viewers, this documentary includes an interview with the mother of an infant who died in the bombing. It is heart-wrenching to watch, but it puts a name and a face to one of the numerous victims who are often reduced to a number when this story is told.Compliments to the film makers for making a compelling and concise doc that will stick with you for at least a few days after you watch it, and perhaps longer.",False
9,10,We all need to see this,gaijin-77282,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a very powerful and moving documentary about the Oklahoma bombing.At times almost unbearable, due to the real people's recollections of the event as they were directly involved, or became involved in dealing with the direct aftermath.It needs to be seen to highlight the terrible consequences of certain peoples actions who, quite cold-bloodily, took the lives of ordinary citizens who, through no fault of their own, happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Innocents, children and babies no less.I'm not American and you don't have to be to be affected by this obscene crime.If there is a hell, these perpetrators will burn in it.",False
10,10,Oklahoma City Bombing: American Terror (2025),kevincerda,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is a impeccable documentary showings the struggles and hardships of Oklahoma City residents after the horrific bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19th, 1995. This documentary is one of the greatest documentaries I have ever watched in my life and I learned a lot about how the residents of Oklahoma City handled the bombing of Federal Building in Downtown Oklahoma City that resulted in 168 Deaths & 684 Injuries. I hope you watch this documentary so you can learn a lesson about community and how to never give up after a devastating event. I rate thus documentary a 9.5 out of 10.",True

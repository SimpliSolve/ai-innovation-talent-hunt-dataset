1,1,Deluded,leest-549-727704,n/a,16/08/2025,"Delusions of grandure and self important tripe. Its a disgrace to all real footballers who went before him. Its a disgrace to humans that work 9 to 5 for a fraction of what this guy earns in a week. Avoid, don't feed his over inflated ego.",False
2,1,Self obsessed sob story,jp300,n/a,16/08/2025,"Worst documentary I've ever watched. Que the sad music, play acting in front of the camera, dabbing, add some family sadness (but I'll get that recorded instead of privacy). Agent compares himself to Jesus, and we all know what a piece of work he was. ""Manchester will always be special to me"" and then slates the club and that ""nothing"" offer of 300k per week.His agent, christ milking it even more what a hard life he lives.Thank god for Manchester United the drama is over. Juventus have that problem now.",False
3,1,This guy is deluded and drinking his own sauce wayyy too much,neilwork,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Wherever he goes, he's shining...like a walking star hahahahhaahahahaha what drugs have these lot been taking, I want some! He's a walking clown who's been overpaid and suffers delusions of grandeur as we see throughout the series. He was let go by Sir Alex Ferguson who knew he was rotten to the core. I used to argue that Mourinho should've tried to inspire him but his arrogance is over inflated what the teams he has played in have achieve (note the words I used, they are not achievements as a result of Paul Pogba being in those teams), so Jose would never have been able to get anything out of him, just like OGS and Rangnick. He's an embarrassment to people of colour, he makes us look lazy, he lack the ability to take his responsibility seriously, as a POC, as a man, as a supposed leader and as a footballer who was paid vast sums of money to walk around. You could argue it is the French in him and he needs to feel the love but Cantona was similar except he earnt the love and adoration every single time he stepped on the pitch. Even when he was sent off, he brought a sense of pride to it but this clown shows how low a human being can go pointing the finger at everyone else...it's always everyone else and never himself.If anyone in normal job trying to survive performed the way he does and has as you see, the way he behaves, the serious lack of focus and dedication to changing his and the teams fortune...you wouldn't last more than 3-6 months but this guy says he deserved a pay rise...
This documentary is the worst case of gaslighting we will experience courtesy of Paul Pogba and the awful Amazon team who already have a shoddy reputation that is worse off by making this.",False
4,1,Hhahahahahahahaha!!!!!!,philjberry,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an awful documentary by a jumped up narcissist Â£300.000 is nothing apparently, if this was a comedy I'd have given it a 10 but unfortunately he genuinely thinks he's world class, the mind boggles!!",False
5,1,If I could give 0 rating I woukd,tonymontana250-600-476846,n/a,16/08/2025,Shocking turned off after 5 mins as constantly chatting ðŸ’© all about himself. Don't care about anyone else. Me !! Me !! Me !! Saying how a hazing he thinks he is. Why don't he get real pundits so they can tell the truth about him ??,False
6,1,Don't understand Amazon's motive,siddharth-ck,n/a,16/08/2025,"How can a documentary be this bad, totally unexpected from a platform like Amazon. Really poorly structured and a total waste of time. Clear avoid for anyone who hasn't watched this .",False
7,1,Utter self-serving drivel,mjpeacock-48163,n/a,16/08/2025,"An egotistical, self-important cry baby- that would be a much better title for this absolute nonsense. Pogba represents the worst excesses of the modern footballer; all style and no substance. He's the only one who believes his own hype. Give this a miss.",False
8,1,I'd give it a zero if I could,markwhelan-13541,n/a,16/08/2025,This guy is one of the biggest self promoting hacks on the planet. Don't waste your time or the electricity by watching this. I'd rather lick my own armpit.,False
9,1,Selfish and obsessed with money,safouenejenhani,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot a professional football player , selfish and disgusting haircuts , need to reevaluate himself , seeking for glory with empty mind , never been a top player , fake history of a dirty player.",True
10,1,Pogone!,robsiregar,n/a,16/08/2025,"The virus and the leaker of the dressing room finally gone, digging his own grave with this documentary. You'd love to see it.You can see that both Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho were right about the player. Most of United fans including myself has been a supporter of him, even against Mourinho but thank to this documentary, we proved wrong.This documentary opened our eyes that, maybe, if not absolutely, after all, the manager is always right about their players.",False
11,9,"Hardworking guy , top professional , an example of how future of football will look like !",kunalchau-79588,n/a,16/08/2025,"The purpose of this documentary was to show that Paul Pogba is different than the others and thats why people hate him. The comments and reviews just certify the same thing.How he was working hard during injuries - 3 training sessions a day is just incredible and shows what a professional he is. Unfortunately people have become moral science merchants and hate if someone rich is partying or also have a life outside football because ""Roy Keane"" said so on TV. The truth is all those players used to smoke and guzzle beers while Pogba who is living life of a saint in comparison with those miserable idiots takes all the hate !",False
12,7,Brilliant player with zero mentality,dsmvf,n/a,16/08/2025,"The thing about Pogba is that he'll never be a leader on/off the field. Once he gets into a problem with the manager/fans, he doesn't show any respect. Nonetheless, he will always be one of the top of his gen, with his major contribution towards France winning the WC, and Juve to a UCL final back in 2015. Overall, I'd give it a 7, its not the best thing I've watched, but it certainly shows the challenges that he has faced before and during his astonishing career.",False
13,1,Me Me Me Me Me Me,mwvickers-00286,n/a,16/08/2025,What a load of dross. Each episode lasts slightly longer than 1 of his ridiculous hairstyles. One of the worst signings United have ever made. I see his documentary ratings are higher than his playing ones?,False
14,1,Absolute legend,mg_legend,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant. How, just how do you possibly average 1.0/10 from (as of writing) 6000 reviews. This is insane.By being Paul Pogba is the answer to that question! How a human can be so out of touch with it's fellow humans is incredible. Madness. He has over 55milion followers, how has he possibly managed to alienate almost literally EVERYONE who watched this mess? How has he made something SO bad, even his millions of followers haven't watched and mustered up even the few not 1.0 reviews to save it from being the worst rated steaming pile of dog turd ever created?I am in awe of this man and this documentary and how bad it is.",False
15,1,Self Obsessed Person,tonythms-63832,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just saying good things about himself. Let people say good things, no he is busy praising himself in the whole documentry ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. This documentary is a joke.",False
16,1,Terrible,richard-62808,n/a,16/08/2025,"Horrific to watch, the delusion is strong with this one. I hope he is getting less than 300k a week at Juve and thank god he didn't accept our stupid offer.",False
17,1,Pogboom to Pogshame,iffatrabbaniovi,n/a,16/08/2025,"He smiles a lot but he was such a bad vibe for the club. No respect whatsoever for the club, supporter. ManUtd paid a lot to get him back - and this is what they've got. Such a shame. Pogboom is such a Pogshame.",False
18,1,Utter scutter,bpzsvscd,n/a,16/08/2025,"No responsibility taken for any bad results, it's everyone else's problem. The man is a virus and this documentary sees him full of his own importance. Â£300k is nothing yet he's going to sign for Juve for half that, let this be the end of him now.",False
19,1,Reflects Pogba's life,moruyapaul,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pogba's very existence has been to paint a picture of himself as being a star when the reality of it is that he was average at best.In this sorry series, which certainly doesn't qualify as a documentary, the same story appears. An attempt at blowing his own trumpet but in reality just blowing smoke up people's backsides.If you listen to Pogba, he won the world cup on his own. Didn't need 10 other blue shirts2022 he played just a fraction of the team's matches, produced one goal, one man of the match display.",False
20,1,U should be ashamed of how u treated man united,azaizaever,n/a,16/08/2025,A true leader is the one that lead his team at there baddest moments not a one that pretend to be a leader with a team full of superstars(french national team) u just made it worse for united with ur childish attitude and ur agent(RIP) comments..at the end I hope all the best for your future paul.,False
21,10,Disgraceful embarrassing fans,beard510,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rated 1/10 by bitter, salty Man Utd fans that I can guarantee haven't watched this well made and informative documentaries about one of the true enigmas in world football. Pogba will once again shine when he is playing in a team that's worthy of his talent.",False
22,6,Hated because it's Pogba really.,tony26_,n/a,16/08/2025,This exact documentary could've been about another player and it would've gotten less hate. People are easily triggered by Paul. Production and storytelling was okay.Not exactly amazing but definitely not a 1/10.,False
23,1,The 'Stinkementary',dmckeown-05226,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, where do I start on this!This is by far the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in my life!Paul Pogba should be jailed for crimes against football and TV, I would rather paint my eyeballs turquoise and watch the paint dry on my eyeballs than watch this trash again, also I hate the colour turquoise.",False
24,1,Moaning of a Narcissistic Idiot. B O R I N G! D I S A S T E R!,shrinivas-deshi,n/a,16/08/2025,"The whole concept of making a documentary about Paul Pogba is a stupid stupid decision. He isn't even a world class footballer. He peaked for a year playing for France. Since then, it's been all downhill. This show has no meat. It's trying to cash in on Manchester United. That's it.If you don't hate Pogba yet, give this a watch. You'll see how disconnected with reality is this idiot.",False
25,1,"Moan, moan, moan",splashback83,n/a,16/08/2025,"If there was a balloon d'or for whining like a b*tch Pogba would be a serial winner. He and his agent epitomise everything that is wrong with football and how the big money in the beautiful game has created a culture of greed, selfishness and entitlement. Do yourself a favour and don't bother wasting your time on this nonsense.",False

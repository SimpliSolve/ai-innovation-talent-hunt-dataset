1,1,A great push for the presenters career,moneebbhatti,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerA fantastic concept and potentially a great topic to explore ruined. Deana focuses the documentary on herself and her feelings, as well as the majority of the shots falling her, the story of the people is truly lost.Extremely naive summed up by when she gave a handful of snacks out to impoverished people to then watch them scramble and fight over them as she swanned away.",True
2,10,A rare spotlight on a proud but overlooked community,apple_kim_uk,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is an insightful documentary which delves into the history and the cycle of poverty that entraps the Gadia Lohars who are named after bullock carts (Gadi) and their traditional occupation as blacksmiths (Lohar). The Gadias are one of the poorest communities in India and they have been excluded from official census records since the 1930s. Their way of life is reminiscent of their nomadic forefathers from centuries ago who were once highly respected craftsmen of fine armoury for Hindu kings but today they barely survive, facing impoverished living conditions despite their strenuous hard work and skills in iron work.The film investigates the reasons behind the shocking living conditions of the Gadias who have no toilets or running water whilst they live in tents and carts. The availability of mass-produced tools, the lack of access to education due to their travelling lifestyle as well as lack of awareness of its importance, the cultural prestige attached to having large families and lots of children, and the lack of priority by the authorities towards the Gadias have made the cycle of deprivation almost impossible to escape from.Despite the negative views of local villagers who warns of the criminal behaviour of the Gadias, throughout the film they are a peaceful and resilient community. This is a fascinating ethnographic film of a group of mostly forgotten people. Despite being less than an hour in length, it crams so much interesting facts whilst the visual scenes are colourful and cheerful, which like the booming economy of the rest of India, is in stark contrast to the poverty-stricken livelihood of this deprived community.",False

4,10,Must watch!! 10/10,glara_y,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerFantastic documentary by Deana Uppal which is very informative and gripping. India's Forgotten People is not like your typical documentary which is what I loved the most about it - Deana had a clear motive to make a change within the Gadia Lohar community when she met with politician. Very good work, educational documentary everyone needs to watch. 10\10 from me!",True
5,1,shameful,lazylew,n/a,17/08/2025,"The actress who made this so-called documentary not only has no idea of how to speak in a way that could capture an audience´s attention, she also made the terrible mistake of using the words ¨I¨ and ¨me"" way too often; this was not a professional documentary at all!Absolutely shameful and not worth watching at all.The actress who made this so-called documentary not only has no idea of how to speak in a way that could capture an audience´s attention, she also made the terrible mistake of using the words ¨I¨ and ¨me"" way too often; this was not a professional documentary at all!Absolutely shameful and not worth watching at all.",False

1,8,Taiwan matters because democracy matters,wix99,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shines a light on the spirit and resilience of Taiwan's democracy in the face of an escalating military threat from China. The central focus is Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen who was elected in 2016. The filmmaker had good access to Tsai and conducted several interviews with her over the period from 2016 to 2022. Tsai admits she was a shy child, but she really is a quiet achiever. She has resolutely upheld Taiwan's sovereignty and helped to strengthen Taiwan's support from the international community while China has simultaneously exerted military and diplomatic pressure to isolate Taiwan.Taiwan is shown as a nation that values democracy, peace and pluralism, a sharp contrast to its bullying neighbour which threatens Taiwan with violence. A number of key figures in Tsai's government were also interviewed including foreign minister, Joseph Wu, and former representative to the USA, Hsiao Bi-khim. They are Taiwan's greatest and most tireless advocates and have been key to the success of Tsai's efforts to raise Taiwan's international support.The documentary would have benefited from including more voices from Taiwan's younger generations. They are, after all, Taiwan's future. Overall, Invisible Nation presents a clear narrative of Taiwan maintaining its democracy in difficult circumstances. At a time when democracy around the world is under pressure Taiwan shows the value of democracy, but that democracy cannot survive without the world's support.",False
2,8,a nation of hope,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Slamdance FF 2024
Greetings again from the darkness. The festival's closing night film selection was this penetrative documentary by Vanessa Hope (granddaughter of producer Walter Wanger and classic film actress Joan Bennett). Given the state of global geopolitics at the moment, this inside glimpse of Taiwan through the eyes of its first female President, Tsai Ing-wen couldn't be more timely.It's tough to decide which is more heartbreaking: watching high school students proclaim their identity through a Taiwan they view as an independent nation, or China President Xi Jinping stating, ""Taiwan is China"", and that reunification is inevitable. Taiwan has been a democracy for decades, but it's also a de facto country, one that isn't even allowed to use their own name at the Olympics (Chinese Taipei).We immediately gain respect for President Tsai Ing-wen as an exceptionally smart and wise and tough leader. On a daily basis, she deals with suppression from China, and has to walk a fine diplomatic line between supporters and detractors. We learn a bit more about The Sunflower Movement, a student-led rebellion and what role that has played in recent history. Unfortunately, this well-made and informative documentary reinforces the dread we feel towards the future of Taiwan as an independent nation.",False
3,9,Miracle Nation,maidagk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taiwan is the most culturally complex island nation in Asia, yet little is understood here about it. Formerly known as Formosa (""beautiful"" in Portuguese, the first Europeans to have a presence there), home to numerous indigenous groups long before any outsiders, including Chinese, arrived, Taiwan is like Sicily in the Mediterranean: a large island close to major geopolitical powers, ruled by various foreigners for centuries, yet proudly and insistently their own people, especially, in Taiwan's case, since the end of WWII and the Japanese occupation.INVISIBLE NATION does the island justice in its portrayal of its president and the peaceful transfer of power after a recent election, and its stalwart resistance to being taken over by the PRC. A must-see for anyone passionate about democracy, freedom, and human rights.",False
4,10,A documentary that foreigners and Taiwanese people should absolutely watch! :),bali-14032,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where do I start?Taiwan is the most important semiconductor exporting country in the world. Taiwan is not Thailand. Taiwan is not part of China.Despite not maintaining official political relationships with most of the world, the importance of Taiwan and visibility in recent years just go sky rocketing!BTW, the CCP-lead China government has never own or rule Taiwan, not even for a minute!Taiwan has their own 23 million peace-loving people(including many foreigners), a strong military, its own land, constitutions and a thriving democracy. Its hard fought story to its current position deserves to be known by more freedom-loving people in the world. It's always one of the safest and best tourist destinations in Asia.A highly recommended documentary! Let's Go, Team Taiwan! :)",False
5,10,Rare glimpse of Taiwan from a Taiwanese perspective,chngthengteng-76955,n/a,16/08/2025,"With the power of China in media, politics and economy, it is rare that mainstream audiences have an opportunity to hear directly from the voices of Taiwanese people regarding their future.It should be clear by the title that Taiwanese people feel that their voices are silenced by the great powers in the world. In spite of that, Taiwanese people still struggle to stand up for themselves in our own unique manner as we face the challenges this world throws at us.I hope more people have an opportunity to learn Taiwan's story told through the eyes of Vanessa Hope from her experience as an American exploring East Asia. She tells an honest unfiltered view seeing how the values of liberal democracy are under threat which the Taiwanese people have embraced to improve their country.",False
6,10,MUST SEE Documentary,ksmunger,n/a,16/08/2025,"This carefully crafted documentary by Vanessa Hope is a MUST watch; Informative, and incredibly compelling. Especially helpful to an audience unfamiliar with Taiwan, a case is presented as to WHY Taiwan - and also Ukraine- are so important to democracies around the world. Vanessa Hope had a lot of access to the President, Tsai Ing-wen, and does a great job presenting both the politician and the human being. This film also feels very timely- with the challenges of a female candidate and an energized youth vote fighting to be heard. Wei-San Hsu's score is absolutely beautiful. This film deserves to be on every short list for Documentary Feature awards.",False
7,10,A thought provoking film,jaztili,n/a,16/08/2025,"No it's not a boring documentary about Taiwan's first female President. It's a very enjoyable, thought provoking film on Taiwan's very complicated history and politics. Vanessa Hope did a phenomenal job highlighting the controversial and touchy subject without making this into a political propaganda. The film is factually correct, and well researched. It's also a must see for anyone who needs a reminder how precious and fragile democracy is. The music is very beautiful and poignant too. Hopefully the movie will stream online someday soon but most likely not for a long while. For obvious reasons. No big name platforms will risk making a certain totalitarian powerhouse country uncomfortable. Sad reality.",False
8,9,Incredible Story,crhwang-00553,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to understand the history of Taiwan and it's struggle with Big Red China, this film would be a good start for you.The film clearly brings you the political transition in Taiwan from an authoritarian government into a democratic system. It is not easy at all. It takes a lot of people, who sacrifice their lives to let the Taiwanese people to enjoy the freedom now.By looking at Chinese Communist nailed down Hong Kong democracy in 2017, most of Taiwanese people stand up with free world to fight against possible invasion from China. If we lose Taiwan and it's democracy, free countries such as Japan, South Korea, Philippine, etc. Will be forced to defend their own country, sames as America.The chips manufacturing including AI in Taiwan will be destroyed or controlled by Communist, which is totally authoritarian region, very corrupted, and have killed many millions of their own people.This film will give you a better understanding about what the world is happening now. We have to fight against aggressors such as Russia, China, North Korea, etc. Right now.Michael.",False
9,8,A political documentary about Taiwan's resistance against China over the past 20 years,sparrow-90614,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a Taiwanese, I felt quite conflicted after watching it. It wasn't simply touching, heavy, or tied to any single emotion.This documentary basically touches on all the major political events related to China over the past 20 years, at various stages. Although due to time constraints it skims over each of them quite quickly, the overall structure of the film reminds me of TV programs like Taiwan Biography on Formosa TV or Taiwan Revealed on Eastern Broadcasting.Many events had faded from my memory, and it wasn't until the documentary mentioned them that they suddenly came back to me-like the incident involving Chou Tzu-yu's apology video.This documentary takes the perspective of a third party, trying to retell the political events Taiwanese people have experienced over the past two decades in a relatively neutral tone, though still with its own position. A lot of the views and incidents covered are things I already knew about or even experienced personally, so there wasn't much that felt new or enlightening to me. It didn't move me as much as the three YouTube videos released after Tsai Ing-wen left office, or the One Day as a Presidential Aide series by Tai. Still, I appreciate that someone made the effort to compile and tell this chapter of our story properly.I actually think the target audience for this film isn't people like us-those who already follow issues related to China, Taiwan's political development, and our international standing (even though we're often the ones who end up going to see it in theaters)-but rather people from the international community. It's meant to inform foreigners who don't understand the conflict between Taiwan and China about what's been happening. If war were to break out in the Taiwan Strait, we'd need international support and solidarity. But we can't wait until war actually happens to start working on that-we need to raise our voices on the global stage before that happens.Now that the film is being screened domestically, it feels more like political messaging to me-an attempt to help the public understand the direction the current government leadership wants to pursue: continuing to resist China and safeguard Taiwan, and staying firmly committed to the path of freedom and democratic development.",True

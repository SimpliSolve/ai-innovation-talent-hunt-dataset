1,7,Welp!,vadcjyxmAnthony,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was funny for a while. The ""tribute"" to Biggie was the best part of the fun. I have to say that the show took a huge.....uhhhhhh.... DIP, when Jo found out that a ""guest"" brought their 12 year old son to the venue....It changed everything.It really wasn't fair to Jo or the audience that one person chose to wreck the evening by bringing her underage son. It was very clear that the environment of the auditorium changed. That little boy who was brought to the comedy show will not be disobeying his Mother anytime soon.Overall, it was an unusual experience. Hopefully Mr. Koy's career will not suffer.",True
2,6,Entertaining...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to say that Jo Koy definitely is one of my favorite comedians, and of course I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch the 2024 comedy special ""Jo Koy: Live from Brooklyn"".Once again Jo Koy delivered a good, entertaining and funny show. He still has a great on-stage charisma and delivers his material with precious and good punch lines. He sets up the jokes nicely and delivers.Something that I didn't really enjoy about ""Jo Koy: Live from Brooklyn"" was the ranting he delivered towards the end of the show to the 12 year old boy in the audience. Sure, it was funny, but I think audience members watching this could easily be offended by this part.""Jo Koy: Live from Brooklyn"" is a show well-worth sitting down to watch, regardless of if you have never seen a Jo Koy show before or if you are a returning fan.My rating of ""Jo Koy: Live from Brooklyn"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",False
3,n/a,thumbs up for Jokoy,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jokoy: Live from Brooklyn is so good! I really enjoyed watching it. Especially the last part, as a mum thinking about that the struggles I went through the birthing process it is always nice to feel appreciated and I really laughed so hard watching it.Some may find the last part offensive and I do not blame them every individual has the right to their own preferences, but I just simply did not think it that way, it was just a good feeling to laugh.Overall, I enjoyed it. Im glad this was on Netflix. Hope Jokoy does another tour and comes back to the Southern Hemisphere.Worth the watch. Enjoy!",False
4,10,Jo koy is awesome!,daphmartin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved his show! He makes you laugh so hard! Thank you to Jo koy for the wonderfully hilarious jokes! He's an amazing story teller, animated and just down right hilarious ! Go check out his stand ups, you won't be disappointed! Funny funny funny! I would love the opportunity to see him live!! He's done a few specials by now and everyone I've seen my stomach hurts my checks hurt because of the deep belly laugh I get from his jokes. They're just amazing! Seamless well put together and I really can't say enough good things about his show! Unique material and keeps it going the entire show! AWESOME!!",False
5,3,Disappointing; Not really worth sitting through,xuminyu,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI agree with other reviews that this performance was repetitive and not particularly funny. Even from the very beginning - when a show should lead with some of the better material or provides a sense of how the show will go- it dragged on painfully with the audience politely laughing but probably thinking 'Move on, already'; really off/bad timing. The audience got a little excited when he plugged a little of his mom impression, thinking 'now he might be getting on to the funny'; but it was only a moment. And when comedians start filling time with vulgarity or crude bodily function 'jokes' that are just awkward, it's pretty sad. Jokoy should test out his material on a trial audience before doing a special; if he did with this special, the audience must've been comprised of friends who didn't provide accurate feedback because this material was amateurish and disappointing given how funny some of his previous shows were.",True
6,4,"It might seem harsh but it's true, Jo Koy wasn't good in this one!!!",armaghank-35760,n/a,16/08/2025,"I used to enjoy Jo Koy very much, his Asian accents sketch to this day is so funny and I still rewatch, however even in the Golden Globe he sounded mean and not funny!This comedy special seems the same, he laughs way too much at his own jokes, it doesn't give audiences any choice or time to let the material sink in! Very normal routine and repetitive material! I respectfully think Jo Koy got really popular and now he thinks he is too good and doesn't need to try like before, even in his recent interview on the ""View"" he didn't sound relatable anymore!I was disappointed! Not worth watching! Sorry it it sounds harsh!",False
7,4,Its a slippery slope when you get populair.,nickvriend,n/a,16/08/2025,"Used to like Jo koy shows. They had a story, inpressions and were truly funny.Now it seems hé is filling time, being repetitive and Just lacking in making something really funny.I understand it might be hard bringing up show after show after show when you gain alot of popularity but please dont try to stay Just to stay relevant. I think its a shame that even for the 59 minutes of the show, which i find on the low side for a stand up comedy show. That even these 59 minutes are not really funny. Its entertaining, Just nothing more than that.I hope hé finds inspiration to make another show, but then a good one.",False
8,1,Who told his guy he's a comedian?,georgiea-82231,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no idea how this guy got popular and I'm not familiar with his previous work. I saw him at the Golden Globes where he bombed hard and blamed his writers for the jokes they gave him. This alone was enough for me to dislike him, because... what standup comedian doesn't come up with his own jokes??? And even worse - how could you blame the writers for delivering a bad joke? Either take the gig and come up with your own jokes or don't take it at all.Anyway, Netflix recommended this to me like 300 times so I decided to give it a chance. I didn't really expect it to be hilarious, but it's actually even worse than I could ever imagine.The whole show feels like an hour-long intro to an actual comedy show. It's as if the ""What's up Brooklyn, how are you tonight"" went on for an hour. Mild, flat jokes that seem to never end in a punchline. Hell, he talked for 5 minutes about how if you're not laughing at his jokes, you should die tomorrow.Do not waste your time with this. It's like your uncle getting mildly drunk, acting way drunker, and telling a story for an hour at your 8th birthday party where only the other uncles laugh and you and the other kids die of boredom waiting for the cake.",False

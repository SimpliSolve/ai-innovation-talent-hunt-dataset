1,1,Propaganda par excellence,imdbfan-445270,n/a,16/08/2025,What a horrible doco considering Joh actually built QLD to what it is today. There were no problems with housing with joh around. He saw it as job to develop the state and provide plenty of housing for people and tourists.Yes the Police were corrupt just like they were in NSW and elsewhere.But Joh was not at all. When a developer handed him a bag of money. He deposited it in a national party bank account. A lot of politicians in those days would have kept for themselves. Not Joh.Such a mystery why he was in power for so long-lol. Voters like smart leaders who are competent. The media hated him as he would treat them like chooks.,False
2,8,Multi-layered investigation into what made Joh tick,instagav,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating blend of archive, interviews and an abstract interpretation of Joh's thoughts as he sat locked in his office refusing to resign when the end finally came. Kriv Stenders inspired telling of the Book of Joh starts with Joh as the pastor farmer's son, moves through the farmer who ran the state like a dictator with the support of a corrupt police force, all the way through to him being the farmer who thought he could run the country. There's a few references to more recent politicians in other countries who've got some similar attributes but really this is an Australian story, interestingly told.",False
3,3,Interesting biopic but fails the easiest political comparison,hillary-kerner,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fascinating watch with behind-door insight into the inner workings of the halls of power and real historical archival evidence. However, language framing and comparison to Trump fail to address the very real Australian domestic comparisons that are far more straightforward and legitimate. The daily pressors, the expanding control, the silencing of debate and use of police, the narrative construction and amplification tactics involved aligned media, the attempts at legislating language control, the ramp and corruption (mis allocation of funds, CFMEU, over budget missing money) ....These are all overt comparisons with the actions of Victorian premier Dan Andrews (2015-2023) and failure to tie such failings of governance to an Australian specific example and reach instead for populist figure Trump calls into question motives for this film.",False
4,9,Excellent investigative doco,AshleyR-67,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fine quality documentary from a Queenslander who has done their research. The comparisons to more recent leaders and their authoritarian tendancies is insightful in showing how the ""playbook"" for an oppressive regime remains the same, decade after decade.Having lived through the Joh-time, south of the border, it was hard to understand why Queenslanders would keep on voting for such a nakedly corrupt leader and his minions. This doco goes a long way to explaining the psychology of his faithful and why it still resonates today.Colourful stories, wildly improbable events and well stitched together footage. Richard Roxburgh makes a fun appearance as Joh in between a number of sequences.Entertaining and thoughtful. Will upset any number of right wingers who still miss him.",False
5,10,Great to learn more about Joh,brixtonlad,n/a,16/08/2025,"Was great to learn a bit about Joh, but the obsession with Trump is bonkers. There is no comparison, just because you don't like Trump doesn't mean he has to be mentioned in every single thing you dislike. Giving a 10 to support Aussies but this doco didn't need a comparison to others JOH was his own person. I don't think housing in Queensland was so unaffordable, cost of living so high, birth rates so low with JOH. I doubt the makers of this doco would make a negative doco in regard to these issues about Albanese and corruption is widespread in Aus with the illegal Tabacco and vape trade everywhere.",False

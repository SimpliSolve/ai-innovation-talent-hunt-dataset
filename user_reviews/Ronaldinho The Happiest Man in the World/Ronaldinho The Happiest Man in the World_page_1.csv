3,9,Skills! Smile! Ginga! Soundtrack! MAGIC!,floradora,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ronaldinho is/was a gift to football! Beautifully constructed biopic. Great footage, great new interviews/commentary. Still only on FIFA site, but worth seeing if you love football.He was amazing, played with skill, played with heart. I got to see him and he was hypnotizing, energetic, and he made it all look easy! God love him, his life must have been a lot to cope with, but WOW, he played that game!The Jake Bugg soundtrack is amazing. Bugg pushed the boat out for this job, and he would, he's a football fan. He went far beyond what a music fan would expect him to produce. He deserves an award for this work, Exquisite.Spend the time and enjoy everything about this film! I did!",False

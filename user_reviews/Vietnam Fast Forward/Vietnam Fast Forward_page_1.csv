1,8,Rise Above Challenges,azulchar,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most films about Vietnam are about the war, but this documentary is a uplifting take on this fascinating and rapidly evolving country.It is comprised of interviews with several entrepreneurs and each tells his/her unique personal story. Through their stories, I learned that many problems still exist in Vietnam, but also how courage and hard work can turn things around.I felt hopeful and inspired after watching this documentary, so I'd recommended to anyone who needs a dose of optimism.",False
2,8,"After this, I'll be visiting Viet Nam!",baccaruda1,n/a,16/08/2025,What a lovely travelogue. The beauty of both the land and people is arresting in the most perfect way. The small stories of the people and their complete resurgence all add up to an enormous success story of the entire country. Totally worth taking the time to watch. You will really enjoy this adorable and entertaining doc.,False
3,10,amazing doc!,melaniezenor,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was amazing! After being able to experience Vietnam on a trip in 2020, this was a wonderful reminder and rendition of how amazing the country and its people are. The shots of the country were beautiful and the whole production was awesome. I would highly recommend this film to anyone interested in learning more about Vietnam.",False
4,10,A shot of psychological medicine,Cyniphile,n/a,16/08/2025,"My review title is a bit corny, but it's true! After months of quarantine, isolation, and light depression, seeing this movie is like a jolt of positive energy direct to the brain. The movie yanked me out of lethargic apathy and replaced it with adrenaline and purpose.This is the story of real people who are incredibly happy and motivated, but not because they've had easy lives. In fact, most of them have faced incredible hardship far beyond what most Westerners could imagine. Yet there is something about the Vietnamese spirit that is incredibly positive and uplifting; it's infectious. They keep going no matter what, and with a smile. I'm definitely going to visit as soon as travel is possible. The food looks pretty awesome as well!",False
5,5,It's a feel-good marketing documentary made to attract tourists,JurijFedorov,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's one of those marketing documentaries cities buy to advertise to tourists. Basically a feel-good ""please visit Ho Chi Minh City"" campaign. So it's what you expect: a lot of smiles, flashy statements, interviews that constantly focus on sale and image, focus on food and clean environment, and constant positivity with no focus on anything negative.Largely the doc focuses on Vietnamese food. So he visits a bar, several restaurants/food wagons, 3 different farms, a tea store, fish boat. There is a lot of focus on how clean, cheap and good Vietnamese food is. We see all the farmers constantly mention how they are ecological and passionate about their product. Of course this cannot be the norm for all farmers. Some will be tired and want an easier job or just complain a lot about the communist rules. Not here, they are busy telling the interviewer it's their dream to be modern farmers and we never really meet any gritty or oldschool farmer or business owner. There is not a single person complaining about the country, city, the people or conditions. Which again is a tiny bit fishy unless we are in a cartoon world or they would be imprisoned if they criticize the system.The doc focuses so much on marketing that it even starts out interviewing a typical Californian who moved to Vietnam to work in tourist marketing. Every single word out of his mouth is all flashy hollow statements and he uses the words ""marketing/progress"" in every third sentence. Basically the typical Western marketing guru. He praises Ho Chi Minh's his life story basically selling the idea of the communist utopian state. And over half the people interviewed in this documentary are the same type of Western focused marketing gurus. Even some of the farmers and the cook he interviews are speaking in vague sales terms while making it all overly dramatic and focused on the Western market. 2 of the tech guru women he interviews are feminists with focus on women centric business progress whatever that implies. Again flashy jobs and titles with very little practical info about what these people actually do. 3 of the main people in the doc are just marketing people with extremely vague job descriptions. It all sounds overly American and several of the people also talk about how they were very eager to learn English and become salesmen. He just picks these people for interviews, only few of them don't speak English. They say that tourism has boomed in the capital and that they are trying to get ahead in the world. Ho Chi Minh city is basically presented as a copy of the super progressive San Francisco with similar people, restaurants and ideas. And while capitals do tend to be progressive I'm not sure most of Vietnam is full of top-dog flashy businesses gurus speaking English and looking extremely charismatic on camera as they flash their company logos to the interviewer.It's not a bad doc at all. It just feels like some weird image of Vietnam. They mention USA and the Vietnam war too. The interviewer of course invites these topics, but he should have been focused on asking people about themselves instead of letting them talk about him and USA.",False
6,9,Wonderfully optimistic,directortim2012,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came across this film by chance and I'm very glad I gave it a try. I grew up in the shadow of the Vietnam war. I learned from other movies and reading about the incredible devastation Vietnam suffered in the war. So it was a great pleasure to watch a film on the resurgence of that formerly beleaguered nation. Their economy is now growing by leaps and bounds. And there seems among the people, especially the young, a sense of great optimism. It made me feel hopeful to see a country torn about by war only a few decades ago, now so vital and rejuvenated.",False
7,1,Unnecessary agenda spreading documentary.,calvinharrisq,n/a,16/08/2025,It was completely out of the blue unnecessary tale of some country which doesn't deserve to be in the map. The real truth is that the country is full of teenage hackers who are spreading misinformation and stealing data from other countries. I've been a victim of those children. Its unbelievable that a government like that is hiring child hackers to take over virtually is not mentioned in this documentary. The truth isn't even present just pushing their agendas in the world. Wouldn't recommend this at all complete brainwash and waste of time.,False
8,9,Fascinating Look at the Booming Vietnamese Economy,jguy1128,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was intrigued when I saw Vietnam: Fast Forward while skimming through new titles on Amazon. I visited the country a few years ago and I'm missing the days when traveling was so much simpler, so I decided to give the film a shot. I love the discussion of Vietnam as a changing and ascending country. I think, at least those in the states, need to be reminded that Vietnam is not a war, it is a country. Vietnam also has some of the nicest people I've ever met in my travels too. This documentary shows how rapidly the economy is growing there and does so with personal stories that are easy to connect with. It's obvious to see this ecumenic boom both within this documentary and outside it, and it will be interesting to see further real life growth in the years to come. As a bonus, the documentary also might satisfy your urge to travel like it did mine, as you can see some notable locations and landmarks in the film as well. Enjoy!",False
9,9,A fresh insight into fast changing Vietnam,robinhoodinmoscow,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a fascinating documentary about the faces of booming and young Vietnam. It's a must see for anyone interested in the emergence of South-East Asia.,False
10,9,Wonderfully crafted tale of modern Vietnam,williamgway,n/a,16/08/2025,A wonderful deep dive into the extremely interesting country of Vietnam.

11,10,"Entertaining, educational and beautifully shot.",ysle-63069,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was fun to watch. Interesting entrepreneurs and their stories in fast changing Vietnam.

13,10,Amazingly put together and great footages,yannickga,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely adore this Vietnam: Fast Forward documentary. For starters it is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the local people in Vietnam), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic. The narration has a great well-balanced mix of facts that will be familiar to the viewer and others that will induce the right amount of surprise along the way. In short, it's just fascinating, informative and thoughtful.Overall, utterly mesmerizing. For documentary lovers it is not to be missed at all costs and has more than enough to entice one to watch it again and again, finding something new each time and never getting tired of it. 10/10!",False

17,10,Find your Passion and Seize It!,veachml,n/a,16/08/2025,"An enlightening and beautiful documentary, showcasing various individuals' struggles in order to create the lives they've always wanted. It truly is remarkable how far the country has come since its independence. And that want for freedom continues to push people to find their passion, eventually to become entrepreneurs, to create jobs and inspire innovation. A truly feel-good film with hope for the future. Not to mention the beautiful drone footage that presents the overwhelming beauty of the country of Vietnam. I LOVED the doctor-turned-farmer, Chef Tan. What a character. The film presents an enlightening message to protect the things we have, and to give back to our earth so that we can benefit for generations to come. Would recommend this to EVERYONE!Side note: Watched this with my father, who was a flight surgeon in the Vietnam War. He traveled to Vietnam in 2019, and absolutely loved his experience there.",False
18,9,A beautiful film,wetheowners,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the opening to the end, you are swept into a visually beautiful film. It is a fun, inspiring, and hopeful film about place, people, and purpose.

Well done, highly recommended.",False
21,10,Insightful Documentary,vyphamhaq,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was born in Vietnam, but left at a very young age. Almost all of the movies or documentaries that i have seen were about the war. When someone recommended this documentary, I was glad that i did because i saw a new Vietnam. The people in this documentary are incredibly inspiring and the documentary captures a Vietnam i have never seen from other movies or documentaries. Extremely well done!!!",False
22,10,Inspirational People,metoi-93125,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this documentary with my kids because came across from another website. Those shots of the country were incredible and the stories of the people are so uplifting, especially right now with the pandemic. They inspired us to do better and be better people not because we have to, but we want to. These are the people that our kids need to look up to and be inspired by.",False
23,10,A new way to see Vietnam,francoisbibonne,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know what I'm talking about because myself, I make a documentary about Vietnam, with a different frame - music, but with this same idea of changing the foreigners perception of Vietnam worldwide.I saw Vietnam Fast Forward until the end and my first impression was ""it is already finished?"", and it's very good, you know, because we usually think documentaires are too long. This feeling told me it's a very good documentary: it is inspiring, entertaining and interesting.It is INSPIRING because these interviews show you how to manage your life my passion in a developing country, it is ENTERTAINING because these interviews are about human beings with their own habits and funny lifestyle and crazy behaviors, it is INTERESTING because they bring knowledge about Vietnamese culture, and all of that got a nice story telling thanks to Shareef Haq.Watch it now!",False
24,10,A new Vietnam,vyhaq,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can across this movie when i was on Amazon and was looking for something to read or watch because it came news recently. I was aware of the country because of the world or foods. When i watched this movie it gave me a different perspective of the country. The documentary is not about visiting Vietnam, but i like it because it talked about the people of that country. It is not promoting tourism. The passion that they have to rise above their circumstances is very inspiring. I would recommend this to everyone to know a different/new Vietnam.",False

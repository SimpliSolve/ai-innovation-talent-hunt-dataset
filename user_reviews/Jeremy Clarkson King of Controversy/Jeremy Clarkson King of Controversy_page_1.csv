Which is why we need more people like Jeremy Clarkson. Jeremy stands up and says his view without worrying who it offends - which in todays society is near impossible not to offend anyone even for the most minor of things.Whilst were on the subject let's not forget that Jeremy has created more female interest in the mostly male dominated world of cars than any other one else.An incredibly entertaining and witty man.I salute free speech and I praise Jeremy Clarkson for being its ambassador. Bravo.",False

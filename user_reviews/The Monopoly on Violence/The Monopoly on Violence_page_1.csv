1,6,Libertarian propaganda but I learned a lot.,matt-233-497899,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Amazon description led me to believe this was about actual military and/or police violence but by about 20 minutes in I realized this was actually about seeing having to make compromises to live in a society as ""violence."" I could shoot holes in libertarian propaganda all day but this review is about the movie. It was informative about the unexpectedly broad range libertarian ideals and I learned more about the philosophy in general. It's always good to understand other people's beliefs and I feel better equipped counter libertarian proponents in debates.",False
2,10,Dialectic Over Rhetoric - Well-done! An Amazing Piece with the receipts to back it up!,johnlebaronpayne,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is the condensed package of why the state is inherently antithetical to human flourishing. I grew up conservative from the South with all the neo-con trappings that with with my decision to join the military as an Air Force Officer to ""fight for freedom"" and to ""serve my country"". Many voices in this documentary are the voices that have shattered my world view and have helped me build a more coherent understanding of human behavior, human interaction, and human flourishing.No doubt this documentary will come under attack from the ""establishments"" of the ""left"" and ""right"", if it's truly allowed the see the light of day on mainstream outlets where the ""3x5 card of allowable opinion"" (credit: Tom Woods for this phrase) often doesn't make room for anything but solidarity with state action and state power.The more I catch up with libertarian and anarcho-capitalist thought and bodies of work, the more I am continually humbled by the breadth and depth of knowledge and understanding I still need to pursue. This was a phenomenal documentary and will be a crowing achievement for a technological era that is still forming.",False
3,1,"Not Anarchist, Right Wing Capitalist",quitwastingmytime,n/a,15/08/2025,Most of the ones interviewed have zero to do with anarchismThey are right wingers arguing they'd be wealthier without having to pay taxesFriedman is the lazy spouse of a billionaireRon Paul is the nut who argues the government had no right to free slavesKnow what they truly want.,False

6,10,Great Documentary Highly Recommend,johneric-60073,n/a,15/08/2025,"The strongest voices in true libertarian ideology are exhibited in this amazing documentary. It appears that critics of this title are just angry because the doc didn't reenforce their pre conceived notions.Doc goes into the origin of the state and why it is immoral. some people don't like it when you argue with their ""right"" to other peoples possessions",False
7,1,Load of hogwash,jhegre-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNarcissism poorly dressed up as anarchism. As simplistic as it is stupid. This film is drenched in all the hallmarks of propaganda. Packed with ""catchy"" one-liners built on logical fallacies. This is the exact same libertarian hogwash you have heard a thousand times before. Sadly there is a big marketplace for these simplistic ideas especially in the US and especially in these days. If you are opposed to the idea that you are part of a society and a culture wether you like it or not you will love this movie. If you are desperately searching for excuses to blame everybody else for your own troubles you will love this film. If you are sufficiently self absorbed you will love this film.",True
8,10,The ultimate red pill...,ryansiepka-88178,n/a,15/08/2025,"You need to watch this if you're confused or disillusioned about the non-sense occurring across our world today.This film will open your eyes to the nature of government, I HIGHLY recommend this film.",False
9,10,The Primer on Anarchism,antiwarpodcast,n/a,15/08/2025,"Interviews with James C. Scott, Michael Huemer, David Freidman, Tom Woods, Bob Murphy, Dave Smith, Scott Horton countless others.Historians, Economists, Anthropologists, Philosophers, Theorists, and a few comedians give the most invaluable background and primer on what the state really is and how a stateless society would be an obvious improvement over the archaic and regressive institutions of the state.",False
10,1,This documentary is saying anarchy is preferable to a strong state,benniegrezlik,n/a,15/08/2025,"The world has strong states and many weak ones. Where would you rather live?The US or Afghanistan?Canada or Pakistan?Germany or Somalia?England or Lebanon?A bonus of living in a weak state is that you could start you own gang and be a warlord. But chances are, you'll be forced into an existing gang or killed quickly. Anarchy can be fun.",False
11,10,A well thought out documentary.,zfallon-59114,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lots of critiques of the state, solutions to problems, and history on what anarchism really is.",False
12,1,"Leaderless, Hopeless, Lifeless",kissmyasthma-95598,n/a,15/08/2025,"No governments, no state, no leaders, no taxes. We don't need medicine, clean water, food on shelves, electricity or anyone telling us we what we do need. And, we damn sure don't to spend money on anything that gets broken or is in need of replacement. In a world with 7.8 billion people on the planet, it basically becomes every man for himself, because, heaven forbid, another man tell any man what to do or how he should do it. Seems to me there won't be any ""monopoly"" on violence, it will eventually be in every mans hands, only becoming a monopoly when it's in the hands of the last man standing. This isn't a documentary, it's a rant by a particular shepherd looking for his sheeple.",False
13,10,A great introduction,petrospanigyrak,n/a,15/08/2025,Very good work with the best names in the anarchist movement. They explain really simply what is the nature of the state and why it is not gonna work out.,False
14,10,Wonderful film,pwgbzcue,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a great film to watch and get a view of the history of government and politics that isn't really permitted to be presented in modern mainstream society, schools or media.
There are a number of interviews with great thinkers and promoters of peace and liberty who give a much better assessment of what personal liberty really means and how we could be living free lives if it really mattered enough to people.",False
15,10,The penultimate testimony in the case against the violence of government,oldhamjohnc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Logical and well researched, this piece lays out all the evidence and draws the only logical conclusions to that evidence, that government cannot be trusted to act in the interest of the people.",False
16,10,Important now more than ever.,ryanbunting-10326,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIn times like these where the left and right are barking at each other over whose turn it is on the Xbox, The Monopoly on Violence explains in great detail why the biggest aggressor is neither the R nor D presidential pick but instead the very institution of the state itself.It explains the nature of money and how central banking/fiat currency cheats people every day, how the state uses violence to get its way, how public education is indoctrinating and zombifying the youth through the Prussian model of education - far too many topics to list, but they're covered by some of the greatest thinkers in the field.If you're disillusioned by the government and the nature of politics, you're likely looking for a ""why"" or a ""what now"", and The Monopoly on Violence will answer both for you. I cannot recommend this film enough.There are times where production quality dips a bit - namely some instances where perhaps there weren't better cameras and/or microphones available, but it doesn't interfere with understanding it. The message is still loud, clear, and thought provoking.",True

19,10,Must watch,beeij,n/a,15/08/2025,Fantastic documentary that went into a lot of detail into the various schools of anarchy and how it morphed over the years in thought.

21,10,Amazing.,jdog-18397,n/a,15/08/2025,Very well done! It's fair to all of the anarchist ideologies.,False
22,10,Fantastic documentary on anarchism that is the modern day equivalent Anarchism in America(1983) and Karl Hesses Toward Liberty,irod-87947,n/a,15/08/2025,This documentary offers phenomenal background on the history of states and explains why anarchism is the natural state of humanity.

1,7,Needs a better narrator,nielson-801-495961,n/a,15/08/2025,"Samira Wiley lacks the voice needed at narrate scenes that are ominous and foreboding. It's actually distracting to the documentary. My wife almost didn't want to continue the series to it's conclusion. Sorry, Samira.",False
2,10,Amazing,dennismontini,n/a,15/08/2025,I watch the entire series in one afternoon. The imagines captured are extraordinary. I know to capture these imagines took hundreds of hours of video in some of the worst conditions humans had to endure. Thank you for such informative documentary.! Just loved it!!,False
3,6,Did AI create this show?,dbwaterfield,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis felt like a show that AI created based on shows I like. It's beautiful and the night vision on these cameras is crazy and sometimes unbelievable...? I found myself questioning the validity of some of it. Like the mouse fighting scorpion and they casually mentioned that the mouse's skin stops the poisonous stings. Ok, how? The scorpion went hog wild stinging the mouse and the mouse just took it and casually grabbed the stinger and ate the scorpion. Sorry it all looked cgi to me. But I'm also not a nature buff so maybe they just captured things I don't know about so I can accept that. It was still stunning and visually pleasing but the narrator and music kill it for me. I'd watch this in the background on mute with lofi.",True
4,2,Overly dramatic music,emilysmmm,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the content is likely very interesting, the music is obnoxious. The unnecessary dramatic background is stressful to hear, and detracts greatly from the shots and information. Additionally, not great for evening viewing as it's stressful to watch.Wish I could turn off the track, then I'd be so happy to watch!",False
5,5,What could have been an excellent programme is ruined by the narrator,Casino-Royale,n/a,15/08/2025,This could have been excellent but the English speaking narrator was awful - this is not her genre.,False

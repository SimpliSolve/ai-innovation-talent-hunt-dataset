1,8,Notice how everyone rates this either 10/10 or 1/10,jygryphco,n/a,16/08/2025,"Trying to be objective, this is a really well argued film that puts forward arguments about climate change that go against the consensus. And there we have it. The world falls into two categories: people that think the climate science is incontrovertible and are trying to convince the rest of us that we are on the brink of disaster for sure. And another group of people who remember the many times we've been fed a lot of BS like this by ""the science"" on other issues where the data is absolutely without doubt....until it isn't. One side isn't going to be convinced by the other because we live in a world where objective truth, as an idea, is dead - everything is ""my truth"" and a political argument. On that basis, enjoy. And maybe the best approach is that of Warren Buffett: it might all be BS but if it isn't, it's pretty bad so why not take out some insurance by cutting emissions anyway.",False
2,n/a,Complete garbage,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"An obvious conspiracy theory-driven film funded by the oil and gas industry. There is no basis for truth in anything represented in this film. Don't waste your time. If you believe this nonsense, you aren't thinking critically. Sound bites, half video clips without context, and outright lies form a narrative in this film that is so far removed from reality this should be considered fiction. Don't be fooled and be a gullible easily manipulated person by believing the nonsense portrayed in this film. Doing your own research doesn't involved watching nonsense conspiracy theory ""documentaries"" like this garbage.",False
3,10,REAL experts who aren't afraid to present evidence,donmustill,n/a,16/08/2025,"You'll notice that most of the experts are long in the tooth. These people have won their awards and established their reputations over decades. They are not afraid to speak out. They have no grants to worry about. Their only goal is to defend science itself. Climate Change alarmism is entwined with computer models - virtually none of which can duplicate the past and have been PROVEN to over-estimate any warming in the future. This movie summarixzes REAL science and what REAL Climate Change is all about.The only ""deniers"" are those who REFUSE to even CONSIDER that maybe, just maybe - humans are just not that important in the complicated melange of Climate Change.",False
4,10,Superb exposition of the truth about the climate,wrxsti54,n/a,16/08/2025,"Climate The Movie does as it says, presents the Cold Truth. It gives a good overview of how climate change came to dominate current political discourse. It features a raft of prominent scientists, physicists, climatologists and Patrick Moore (the founder of Greenpeace) all who dared to dispute the prevailing consensus that the science is settled. The documentary meticulously details the 4 other more reliable measurements of temperature change (rural surface stations, ocean gauges, satellite readings and atmospheric balloons) to show that all the IPCC reports and models are mostly based on sites that have been engulfed over time by urbanization and hence subject to distortions in the record by the urban heat island effect. The 4 methods confirm only a slight temperature rise and this is reported alongside the long term historical records going back centuries and then tree ring and ice core testing going back millennia to show that we've been warmer before when there was no industrial output to blame.Finally many current media myths and obsessions were debunked including no increase in hurricanes and storms, hotter daily temps in the 1930's than recently and significantly fewer modern forest fires than the '20' and '30s.The way prominent scientists, environmentalists, politicians and the media exaggerate and distort the truth to manipulate the masses into accepting all of the constraints on lifestyle and escalating costs of enforcing net zero is dramatically laid out. This documentary is an important contribution to the debate of climate science that is in reality far from settled.",False
5,10,Outstanding,jme-60384,n/a,16/08/2025,"Climate The Movie is a must-see film for anyone concerned with the future of science and humanity. Features distinguished scientists (Nobel physicist, Princeton astrophysicist, among others) showing how climate ""science"" has been corrupted by politics, money, and the lust for power. Presents extensive data and reasoning showing that CO2 has been purposely demonized as the alleged key to climate control, knowing that this implies control of the vast majority human energy resources (fossil fuels). This completely ignores the obvious source of historical climate change - solar radiation and its variation with cloud cover, orbital parameters, and the sun's magnetic and thermal changes. Well-presented, in a calm and non-apocalyptic manner that stands in distinct contrast to most climate alarmism. Wonderful piece of work.",False
6,10,An eye-opening film based on real knowledge,ciroro,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sensational video showing what the state of the Earth's climate really is. Scientists, Nobel laureates, climate researchers, astrophysicists describe what is really happening, and what is our real threat. The best of it is that they are independent of the government, of grants, of the mercy of the media. A true picture of the ""climate fight"" on many levels.For me, often shocking, because I remember the days of Stalinism in my country. Back then, the science of Marxism-Leninism was undeniable, where there were chairs at universities, tons of books were published, and conventions were bigger than today's WEF or COP. And you could end up in a labor camp if you challenged the dogmas of this ""science.""
I highly recommend this film.",False
7,1,Dangerous fake science,radobrien,n/a,16/08/2025,"When you come across plausible-sounding polemics like this, it's always worth taking the time to look at their provenance. For example, this film is at least partly sponsored by the Heartland Institute, which also denies the ill-effects of smoking!The speakers sound very plausible (there's even a Nobel physicist) with that avuncular, trust-me-I'm-a-scientist smile, or the down-to-Earth Southern drawl, but there isn't a true climatologist amongst them, and being clever in one sphere doesn't make you an expert in another (remember Linus Pauling, who won TWO Nobels prizes, was fixated on the idea that Vitamin C supplementation prevents colds, for which there is no convincing evidence).Putting a picture of King Charles III in the cast list doesn't mean he says anything, let alone supports these ideas, and one contributor claims to be a founder of Greenpeace, which Grenpeace themselves deny.Most of the speakers are discredited elsewhere; my favourite is the one who has our solar system whizzing past other stars in the spiral arms of the Milky Way, presumably at warp factor 10 (Aye aye, Cap'n), picking up cloud-forming cosmic rays.I sat through this garbage so you don't have to, but, if you insist on doing so, look at it as an example of how these people try to suppress the overwhelming evidence they are trying to deny.",False
8,9,Such an important documentary,Paynebyname,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know you all have lots of demands for your time but this really is an excellent film all about the Green scam.I'm always looking for concise and precise documentaries on subjects that I can say to people 'if you watch one documentary on a subject, then watch this' and this one is that.It uses amazing data to showcase the lunacy and then has a brace of bona fide scientific experts dismantling the clearly fake agenda behind this tiresome charade.It's very well produced and really hits all of the key points from the vested interests to the politics to the corruption.Please for the love of this planet and your fredoms, give this a watch and provide your mind with an alternative opinion to consider.",False
9,1,Complete and utter nonsense from start to finish,mftbernard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another terrible attempt by Durkin to re-write the laws of physics, overturn climate science and support fossil fuels.Thoroughly debunked by the LSE and Skeptical Science.He hasn't learned from his previous disastrous effort and continues to use misleading, inaccurate or downright false graphs. The graph of Central England temperatures is supposed to come from the Met Office, but is different (going down recently, whereas the Met Office one rises - of course).Most of the people interviewed are notorious climate deniers and the whole narrative seems to be shaped by some ludicrous conspiracy theory.This film is only of interest to deniers and students of the psychology of climate denial.",False
10,10,silence the critics,ardrinane,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's like being back in the dark ages, if you don't stick to the narrative you will be burned at the stake. The arguments presented are compelling and only those invested in the CO2 theory would ignore them, either because of profit or their entire carrier is built on the theory. The documentary meticulously details VERIFIABLE data that contradicts the CO2 narrative.You can look around in your local environment and see how biased reporting is. In my local experience there is massive media hype when a ""green"" initiative is implemented but then later when it proves to have been a monumental mistake - there is no reporting on that. Apply that to the global stage.",False
11,1,Reused old myths,chech1965,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is nothing but fossil fuel propaganda based on old myths that have long been debunked. Solar activity is not the driver behind the recent warming. If it were, one would be able to point to other times in the history of the current climate pattern when this occurred. However, they can't because solar activity cannot drive this rate of warming. Simple fact of the matter is that all the natural drivers are negative or neutral.The only positive driver is CO2 and it's all coming from our emissions. The rate of temperature rise is unprecedented. Even faster than during the Permian when natural outgassing CO2 and methane caused the extinction of >90% of all life on the planet. We are adding more CO2 faster than during the Permian.We are in the Sixth Extinction and the fossil fuel industry knows this. Their own science proved their product's emissions would rapidly warm the biosphere but instead of looking for solutions, they buried it and started a misinformation campaign based on the same one the tobacco industry used.Read science. Don't watch You tube.",False
12,10,Compelling - A well done film that's worth a watch and discussion,magichourmediaco,n/a,16/08/2025,"Data and experts are presented in a compelling way that creates a powerful dissenting narrative to the human influenced Climate Change hypotheses. With no consensus on the science, the film takes a look at the goals and practices being implemented by each ideology. On one side there are grabs for more government control, regulation, a loss of personal freedom and centralization of power; all in the name of Climate Change. On the other there is a call for more freedom and a spreading of awareness that we are slowly losing our individual sovereignty.It brought up for me the idea of what side of history do I want to be on. One that gave up freedom to regulators, globalists, and governments, so that they could ""save us"" from an invisible enemy?Or support freedom and put faith in the ingenuity of a FREE society to persist, engineer, iterate, and survive as we have for millennia?",False
13,10,Forensic debunking of climate alarmism,gezandnerys,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some factual documentaries are simply a must-watch, and this is one of them. Climate mitigation policies affect everyone yet most people have little interest and assume the 'experts' know what they are doing. Well, they do not. The film beautifully illustrates the nonsense, futility and ridiculousness of what has become an all consuming cult, not based on good science but instead milking the government cash cow of grants. This film should be compulsory viewing. You come away understanding all the topic's salient points, it is masterfully presented with excellent contributions from the very highest level of scientists. It is causing quite a stir, and rightly so. A lot of careers depend upon the population being scared. Don't be scared, watch this movie.",False
14,10,Eisenhower was precient.,jimandsheryn,n/a,16/08/2025,The corruption of science we were warned about in President Eisenhower's valedictory speech is front and center of this documentary. Trillions of dollars have been invested in an energy transition that threatens the economies of all western nations.The enforced restrictions on fossil fuel energy in Africa and other poor nations borders on criminal. The west developed on two hundred years of cheap energy. It is shameful that much of the worlds poor are still cooking with primitive energy with all the negative effects on wellbeing.I would hope that the mainstream media embraces this film so we can begin the massive task of reconstruction from the delusional net zero project.,False
15,10,Great to see data,monkeybuttmusings,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's great to see data. I think we always knew the rhetoric was suspect. But, as we can see that there is some natural climate change, as there always has been, at last we have some answer to why there is no real discussion. At last we can qualify that human caused CC is limited and that there is no catastrophic alarm. Unfortunately the phycological damage has already been done to an entire generation. That needs to be addressed and those responsible held to account.the contributers are high quality scientists rather than just computer models and guesses. Let's hope this gains traction so we can opening discuss rather than just give in to the loud minority of bad actors.",False
16,1,Brain worms for stupid people.,pnickovich-781-88739,n/a,16/08/2025,"Do yourself and friends a favour. Do not watch this movie. If you decide to anyway, consider this nonsense a fiction. Calling this a documentary is comedy at it's best.The movie intentionally omits or misleads information. As to why it tries to rewrite already well researched and debunked fallacies is unknown. From basic denial of CO2 and temperature correlations, to wildfires are not caused by global warming. This movie really goes through the anti-science bingo (pretty much all have already been researched thoroughly)However, as someone with a background and career in this field, I can assure you this movie is riddled with falsehoods and conspiracies.You will get dumber watching this. Take it with a jar of salt.",False
17,9,Explains The Science and how The Politics has subverted The Science.,brett-online,n/a,16/08/2025,"So far the ratings are either 1/10 or 10/10, clearly this is a marmite subject! Most viewers will either be 'sceptics' and have their ideas confirmed or 'believers' in the Climate Crisis and probably won't watch to the end.A lot of excellent interviews with credible people, clearly sensible and not the swivel-eyed-loons we're told to expect.In the last few minutes it touches on causes: the rise of the new class of anti-capitalist left-leaning folk (the swamp, the elite), who use their positions in society to silence descent against the message.I could watch on loop the clip of working people, trying to get to work, pulling an Extinction Rebellion protestor off the roof of a London Underground train.",False
18,1,Do yourself a favour...,kallelikesmovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"...and check Sceptical Sciences rebuttal of the old myths (re)visited in this movie. Just put ""sceptical science climate the movie"" in your favorite search engine and marvel at how easy it is to dismantle the ""facts"" that are brought up. Complete with fact-checked sources.,Quick TL;DR: ""Martin Durkin's recently released film, entitled, 'Climate - the Movie', 17 academics, retired academics and bloggers were interviewed. How big a proportion of them have their own page in the DeSmog database? Go on, have a guess.It's 76%.Climate change denial is like a kind of flying circus. This same old carnival troupe is wheeled out time and again to spread doubt about climate science. Why? Because that's what they are good at doing, with decades of combined experience under their belts.""",False
19,10,Galileo Galilei 2.0 versus Inquisition 3.1,ober-on,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of scientific facts are used as a battering ram against the church of climatology.The movie comes with a lot of honourable and price winning real scientists that are old enough to tell the truth without beeing in fear of their carreer. Step by step in shows the average temperatures in the last millions of years, that were surprisingly most of all the time higher than nowadays.And the movie shows hom the story of glabal worming gets more and more religious and went to big business.This movie is highly recommenden for young people to heal their fear, sick and illness about the daily weather. Watch it and break free!",False
20,1,A complete strawman mess,juliecorrinegreen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a rehash of the previous version, and repeats the same misinformation and strawman arguments.It make statements like ""it's unprecedented "", and then proceed to demonstrate it isn't unprecedented - how? Well that's simple, science is not saying the change is unprecedented it is a false statement by the film makers, and of course the arguments demonstrating why it's not, are basic facts known to all climatologists etc.The whole film makes up false statements, then goes on to show their made-up statements are incorrect - fooling the uninformed into thinking that ""some huge discovery"" has been unearthed by this film!It repeats this process time after time.It is lying.Note:
There isn't sources for their data.Their graphs etc omit scales.The majority of graphics are modified versions of the correct data/graphics freely available.Even some of the contributors have openly complained that they have been misrepresented by the film makers.",False
21,9,"A very, very important film",FredJ-30083,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who has spent a large part of his life studying science, I found this film a welcome and refreshing contrast to the incessant the-end-is-near warnings that most of us are being fed on a daily basis. It uses a very simple but effective format: short but to-the-point interviews with distinguished and experienced scientists coupled with charts and data that anyone can follow.Aside from the scientific aspects, but equally important, the film also brings up some of the social and potentially devastating effects of the current climate policies. Even though this part may already be an eye-opener for some, perhaps the filmmakers should have spent a little bit more time to show just how futile most of the ""energy transition"" actually is (the current ambitions are mathematically unfeasible). In any case, this chapter should be required knowledge for all - including both policy makers and voters.A part of the film that I found disturbing was when some scientists shared how they had been ostracized from the community, simply by sharing their results and speaking up for the hypotheses they believed to be right. This censoring, if one thinks about its consequences for the future, may be most damaging for the development of science.Although this reviewer has a broad background in science, no special knowledge of science is needed to understand this film. It is for everybody!",False
22,9,The economic shadows of climate change discourse,alex-25-100191,n/a,16/08/2025,"Climate The Movie meticulously dissects the entangled web of climate change discourse, shining a spotlight on the seldom-discussed economic underpinnings and profit models that fuel the debate. By convening an array of distinguished scientists and experts who challenge the prevailing consensus, the film opens a rare dialogue on the complexities and contradictions within climate science. It probes the integrity of current climate narratives, urging viewers to look beyond mainstream arguments and consider the deeper motives shaping climate policy. This documentary is not just a film; it's an invitation to engage, a call for critical examination, and a challenge to uncover the vested interests in the climate change saga.",False
23,10,Excellent uncomplicated information on which to base personal opinions.,robtwothirds-24372,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well presented facts that hopefully will be seen by those who swallow the official story whole. Considering how profoundly the measures to combat the alleged climate crisis affects people on a personal and day to day basis, It is a constant disappointment how little people know about some of the undisputed empirical evidence regarding the climate. Simple things that would enable them to better judge the validity of what they have been told are presented here, for instance existential facts such as that we are coming out of an ice age and would normally be glad to see temperatures rising, or simple quantative facts, such as the amount of the human created CO2 in the atmosphere allegedly causing the damage.As far as institutions doing their bit to support the climate crisis narrative, it is interesting to note that this site has weighted ratings for movies. As I write, 5/4/24, Climate the Facts (2019) with David Attenborough etc has the same headline rating, the one everyone see as Climate The Movie both on 7.9. I don't know how the do the weighting of scores, maybe the same sort of thing as adjusted temperature? The raw, untampered, unweighted score for Climate the movie is 8.0 whilst the unweighted score for Climate the facts is 7.1.",False
24,n/a,Ice Cold BS,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once again gullible members of the dark past laded anti-intellectualism and anti-science movements have been hoodwinked by the work of grifters.This is the latest of in a long line of conspiracy related ""documentaries"" that manipulates individual facts, sequences and meanings of images to help grasp it's so called ""truth""I hate to be the bearer of bad news but, as the critic Michael Cieply put it:""Documentaries are not real. They are a mere reflection of reality, subject to all the tricks, techniques and sleight-of-hand that directors and producers may-or may not-bring to bear""This means even the mundane boring ones are biased reflections of reality. Therefore, the more unusual the topic, the greater the potential that the documentarian's take will be slanted in a particular direction. This is quite clear here.This is a film that has now been debunked (the call to riot word for conspiracy theory types) on numerous occasions by multiple independent parties. If you enjoyed this film, and think this a ""groundbreaking expose"", why not engage with the skeptical perspective of someone like Peter HadfieldOr are you conspiracy believers the ones who can't face the ""cold truth"".",False
25,9,Finally.. the truth,pgrieves,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat expose on how a trillion dollar green industry is socially engineering the masses and deluding us. You might watch it and say ""well, there's not many climate scientists in the film""? .. and then you realise of course they're aren't because if you speak up about the truth - you become ostracised, defunded and that's the end of your career..Everyone needs to watch this at least once...and I really found it interesting and informative. Science is far too political now. Nuclear power and what about gravity amplifiers? We are all members of the doom and gloom club until you see the truth. I've seen the film on YouTube. The took it down but then it was back up. They don't want you to see the truth. Money, money , money .. manage the people.. more government.. more control over your choices and life.",True

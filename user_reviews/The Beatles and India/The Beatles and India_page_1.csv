1,7,Interesting but not fascinating.,pritol,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary deals with the Beatles social and musical impact within India, as the country started to open up in the 60's. At the same time it explains and discusses the Beatles interest in Indian music, and their experience at a spiritual retreat run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.It's mostly anecdotal stories told by people that were there with a few historical Beatles interviews sliced in, alongside a bit of historical footage from the actual location.Some of the stories are told by people within the now dilapidated ruins of the retreat, which does add a level of sentiment to it, however despite briefly mentioning George Harrison's genuine love for India after being introduced to it by his friend Ravi Shankar, it never really shares in detail the Beatles view on India in their own words.Interesting to watch, but could have delved a little deeper and offered up more.",False
2,8,Good research,soundchaser010,n/a,15/08/2025,"The people who made this did some good research. I've seen most of the documentaries released, bootleg video, read many books, and here I came across with some unseen film clips and interviews.The ""then and now"" edits are well made and give great context to what is being shown.As I suppose like quite a few others, I came to this looking for the very seeds of the White Album, and was a bit disappointed to find not enough of that. And what was told was not very revealing for someone who has delved into the subject as thoroughly as I have.Not everything is interesting, that's why I gave it an 8, but the good parts are really good, and there are many of them.",False
3,8,A must watch,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFilmed across India at all the sites of the Beatles' visits -- Mumbai, New Delhi, Rishikesh and Dehradun -- and featuring an array of unseen photographs, footage and interviews uncovered in India during research on the project -- including unseen footage from a film shot at the ashram but never released and an interview with George Harrison recorded with All India Radio unheard since it was recorded in 1966 -- The Beatles In India tells how George, John, Paul and Ringo took a break from their lives as the biggest band in the world to travel to a remote Himalayan ashram in search of spiritual enlightenment and ended up unleashing an entirely new level of creativity from the band.This movie seeks to answer two questions: How did.",True
4,7,The way for white album,awagabukubuku,n/a,15/08/2025,This documentary explains how much impact the beatles got from india. And also the impact from the beatles to India. Interesting mixture with drug and mantra.,False
5,8,"A compelling documentary, but...",akashasoma,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI liked the film, even though it went in an unexpected direction. I assumed it would be about the Beatles' relationship with Indian culture in general, but in fact the documentary primarily focused on the relationship between The Beatles and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The Beatles, George Harrison's relationship with the Hare Krishna movement was completely omitted, while interestingly, the Indian guru Bhaktivedanta Swami lived for a time in Yoko and John's house. Harrison and Paul McCartney both helped to record the mantra album ""Goddess Of Furtune.""There may have also been mention of trivia from the post-beatles period. Harrison's long relationship with the Hare Krishna movement, to whom he bought a temple and supported them financially, or his relationship with the teachings of Paramahamsa Yogananda, to whom he dedicated an entire album (Thirty Three & 1/3) or a concert for Bangladesh, which was the first benefit concert of its kind in the world.Although the film was narrowly focused, I enjoyed it, despite the fact that not a single sample of a Beatles song is heard in the film.",True
6,4,Where's the music?,nathsoph,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some interesting anecdotes about the Beatles spending a few months in India to recharge and their relationship with the Maharishi, which evolved over time. Importantly, it describes how Indian music made it way into several Beatle songs. It boggles the mind, therefore, that there is not one second of Beatle music in the entire 90 minute soundtrack. Even those of us who know every Beatle song are left struggling to remember the sitar parts and other influences. The scenes with Ravi Shankar are nice, yet even though post-Beatle years are covered, there is no mention of George's concert for Bangladesh, where he stole the show.",False
7,3,Fairly accurate and well made until random Indians were added,navendu-misra,n/a,15/08/2025,The documentary is fairly entertaining even for those who know nothing about Beetles or India. What I found especially disappointing was introduction of Indian people who berate Indian philosophy and traditions. The fact that there was quite a lot that Beetles and other non-indians that gained from indian traditions should let it stand. Since this was made by a British and Indian director it seems that that it's the Indian director's doing to present the negative aspects. Coming to other aspects there are very nice visuals for a fairly low budget documentary. I wish they directors had done more analysis and not pulled in random people who were really not directly involved.,False

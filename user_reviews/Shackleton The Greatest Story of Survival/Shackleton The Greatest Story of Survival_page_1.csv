1,9,Human spirit,bdunne-24958,n/a,16/08/2025,"An epic story of the power to survive against the greatest odds. Brutal earth versus the human spirit. If this was a Hollywood movie I'd believe it science fiction. The hands on presenter takes you on the journey 100 years from its origin. He has previously recreated elements of the journey using traditional materials, including equipment and clothing, so demonstrating his investment and admiration for Shackleton and his men. He encounters the topical issue of climate change, and this conveys additional messaging to the viewer. A truly inspiring and movitional watch. I cannot recommend enough. A must see.",False
2,5,Let down by climate change propaganda at the end,abx-20850,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a decent documentary that tells the true story of Sir Ernest Shakleton's failed expedition and how it became an epic battle for survival for him and his men.The narrator / presenter goes to some of the places that Shackleton did in order to re-tell the story. So it is interesting to see what these places look like, although they have changed a lot since Shackleton was there.And that brings me on to what lets this documentary down - at the end, the presenter basically says that it looks a lot different now because of 'climate change' - and we all know he is implying that this 'climate change' is as a result of human activity. He states it as if climate change as a result of human activity is an accepted scientific fact, when this is far from the case. I don't want to get into the debate here, but to state it as a fact without any supporting evidence really annoyed me. Yes, the climate may be changing, but the evidence that it is caused by humans is lacking. I didn't see any need to include this propaganda in what was an otherwise very good documentary. It makes me feel like I have been tricked. Stick to the facts and leave controversial conjecture out of it.Still worth watching but just be on your guard.",True
3,1,Waste of time and money. Ecological fanaticism wins over history.,Legba74,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn interesting recreation of the second Shackleton's journey, dramatically ruined by the author's laughable obsession for Climate Change. For 10 times he goes there while totally oblivious about previous variation of glaciers sizes. In shorts the documentary is quite ok till 60% of it then it becomes a fanatical and incessant activist piece where he asks for funds and money and the use of emotional intelligence to force everyone in the world to agree with him.1 star simply because I cannot give 0. These people are the stupidification and destruction of science and the scientific method.The end of the documentary drones on about cosmic sense of life. I'm about to delete it now.",True

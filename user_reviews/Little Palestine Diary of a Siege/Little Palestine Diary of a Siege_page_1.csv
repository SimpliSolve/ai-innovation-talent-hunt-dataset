1,7,It doesnt get more real than this,FilmFlowCritics,n/a,16/08/2025,"The title is spot on... This was filmed by a ""citizen"" of the Palestinian refugee camp and by all means, it is not professional, so dont expect an amazing production with Dune cinematography, but this is down to earth, painfully real and you wont get closer to experiencing such a situation, unless you are in it!",False
2,10,Gripping and poignant,haiadakwar,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very real, inside look at life under siege. This documentary can be only described as your utmost 'real' view inside a refugee camp going through siege, the scenes are extremely real and the poetic gripping voice recounting the experience only gives more layers to allow you to delve deep within a journey of deathm and come back alive. Very recommended.",False

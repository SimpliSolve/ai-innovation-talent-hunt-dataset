1,9,"Excellent documentary, wasted life",beaconb,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an excellent documentary about a ""wing suiter"", those guys who wear suits that make them fall slightly less than straight down. (they try to rationalize that they are ""flying"", but no, they are just falling less steeply) I was so angry to see this guy's family rationalize this kid's death wish. The wing suiters definitely have some kind of mental illness, an addiction, such that if they don't quit, THEY WILL DIE. The film tries to build the kid's life up by citing how he was the youngest to do this and that, but like with many kids you read about who become the youngest at something, it's all about their parents ego building. Heroin addicts only have to worry about their drug getting cut with fentanyl, or just more pure heroin; these wing suiters only have themselves to blame for an early death.",True

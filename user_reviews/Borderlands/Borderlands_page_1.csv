1,10,"Engaging, powerful! Yet another real life gem of a documentary",ananyasri,n/a,15/08/2025,"With emotional stories spanning 6 real life people and their relationships with other and most importantly with Borderlands is enthralling. Every character has a story that keeps you connected and glued to your seat. The genuineness of each story and the emotions that it draws in one will stay with you for a long time. It's somewhere between a documentary and a commercial movie for not how it was handled but how the stories make you feel! Brilliant job, Samarth Mahajan and Nupur Aggrawal and the full team!",False
2,10,Borderlands is a beautiful piece of work.,Anup_Kulkarni,n/a,15/08/2025,"I must say done by Samarth Mahajan. He has crafted borders and human emotions so carefully that the border becomes a feeling.I have enjoyed watching each and every story in this documentary. Surjakanta, Noor Kavita, Rekha, Dhauli, and Deepa everyone has their unique story attached to the different borders of India. Jodhpur, Nargaon, Kolkata, Birgunj, Dinanagar, and Imphal.The way he has narrated the entire documentary is involving and creates a deeper impact on your mind. At the end of the film, I as an audience was very much attached to every person and their life. It makes you think of our society, human nature, reality, and our responsibility towards our nation. Very thoughtful!Before I conclude my thoughts on this documentary the song ""AAMI TOMAKE"" by Laurie Kallevig and Survivor girl Ukulele band is magical! This gives you joy and tears at the same time. Using it, in the end, was an excellent idea!Congratulations on this documentary, Samarth! Looking forward to seeing your upcoming works. Best wishes!",False

1,7,Maron's Best Work,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marc Maron is a stand up comedian, podcaster, and actor. His prior specials are very dark and very good. This one is his best. It is tight and well paced. Maron takes us on a personal look at his relationship with his parents, the state of the people, and the loss of his girlfriend during COVID. Maron is angry and curt, but also sharp and intelligent. If you never saw him before it is good, but if you are a podcast fan it is even better. The Direction and set are visually appealing. The length was perfect. This is well played by Maron and he seems more comfortable than any other show. I recommend it.",False
2,8,Marc is my spirit animal,michelle-rosenthal,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed the dark humor. It's refreshing being able to knowingly laugh at the things so few of us ever discuss. Marc put our shared humanity on full display.I too have a baseball bat in my bedroom and now I need to YouTube how to defend myself with a baseball bat because I'm no longer certain where to aim.Toxic family, I think most of us can relate and there is no expiration date on feeling angry at your parent(s).This special feels like it could be a support group where you're just listening to a fellow human and it isn't your time to share, yet.Also, I'm sorry for Marc's loss.",False
3,6,And I like him,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well. I didn't like his last special and I am not thrilled with this one. Seems that Maron YELLS his punch line to make sure when I should think that he's being funny.The fact is, I know he's funny, when he's just sitting around interviewing people for his pod cast. He's not funny when he's trying to be - on a stage with a bunch of people in front of him - who have paid a lot of money to see him!He had a couple good points that caught my attention and made me smile in spite of myself, but ....I like Maron as an actor. I know that when he has a part in a movie, no matter how small, we're going to get the best of him.Too bad it doesn't translate to his stand up.",False
4,n/a,Heavy gets Light,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marc Maron is not a yuck-yuck comedian. He is not an icing-on-the-cake comedian. He's not there to bring light to the end of your tunnel. Not in the way you'd expect. Ever had some darkness inside and bottled it with distractions and denials, but really wanted to own it for a while? Maron is the father and godfather of that. He covers heavy topics in a way that allows you to think and talk about them yourself, without having that grip on your throat. Darkness becomes easy. It becomes light. There is room to think and speak and laugh, even through the most heavy and difficult topics.Maron is known as the person behind introspective podcasting, be-real-about-your-world podcasting. This is also his style of comedy and way of being. The new norm where men can be open about their fear, their broken childhoods, and irreparable hearts. Where you can be shameless about your mistakes. Admit to them openly, often, learn how to say sorry. Get over your own broken self. That started with Maron.That cultural wave began over a decade ago when a lone man, sitting inside a studio he just got fired from, decided to make that space a confessional, and those that listened became an audience of followers and forgivers. It was his style of comedy, journalism, and way of being that opened doors to the inner-self for so many. If you've had a tough journey and want to make sense of it, laugh at the absurdity that is this life, and learn how to speak like an adult instead of a broken meme, Maron is the human for you.This special takes a walk with you down some broken bends in the road, like parents getting older, and losing your partner in the midst of a world losing its mind. He manages to ask the hard questions and come up with answers that are both harder and lighter, and tinted with love. In true Maron-form, when he comes to another fork in the road, he does not say, where do we go from here, but affirms, he will see you at the next one. He does, and will, see You.",False
5,6,"Misses my Mark, but can relate to how Marc Misses his Missus",ThurstonHunger,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maron was early to the podcast space and lauded by many I trust, but those just did not connect with me.And that's sort of how this special felt, a bit of a disconnection.One thing I cannot quite tell if it's coming from me or Maron, is a sort of George Carlin replacement wish. Carlin as he got older definitely leaned hard into the Bleak and Dark. His observations for outrage and set-ups for human failure just resonated more with me. Oh well, all ""art"" (and Dave Chappelle is right, stand up is an art) is going to be subjective.That said, boosting my review up from 5 to 6 based on some of the negative reviewers here wearing their preconceptions on their sleeves. Instead of reacting when he pushes your obvious button, maybe explore why you have that button. I definitely have a button both for
a) alzheimers - ouch isn't aging enough of an indignity
b) people who ""still"" blame their parentsHe addresses these and I get where he's coming from. His takes didn't move me much from my positions, but I liked being challenge on my presuppositions.Ultimately, this special made me appreciate not just Carlin (the lengthy Apatow documentary on George is worth it for fellow fans of his), but also Kate Berlant's recent stand-up special ""Cinnamon in the Wind"" which sort of nails the confessional/therapy/teachable formula for many such specials.Maron's quick one-man show vignettes were pretty funny, and the discussion of grief over his wife's death was definitely moving, and uniquely him.In the end, I felt like the neighbor across the Covid street.",False
6,10,From Bleak to Brilliant -- Marc Maron's show made me laugh and cry,Sasha_Lauren,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw Marc Maron perform at a comedy club way back in the late 80s. I liked him, but didn't follow his career, listen to his podcast, or know much about him. I tuned into his HBO special From Bleak to Dark because I read that in this show he talks about the death of his girlfriend Lynn Shelton from leukemia in 2020 during the pandemic. Having experienced devastating losses in my own life, I had a sense this show would speak to me, and I was right; I found it deeply moving, honest, and relatable. In fact, I thought it was so perceptive and masterful that I watched it twice.Maron opens the show pacing the stage proclaiming, ""I don't want to be negative but... I don't think anything is ever going to get better ever again. I don't want to bum anybody out, but I think this is pretty much the way it's going to be for however long it takes us to polish this planet off. And don't misunderstand me, I have no hope. I think if you have hope, what are you f---ing seven?."" Right away I sensed that this is a man who has come through a terrible tragedy and has the courage to now take it to the stage. I trusted him as a storyteller from his first line.While talking about Lynn's death he said, ""I realized no one really talks about grief. No one talks about PTSD. No one knows how to process this stuff. Everybody has it. It's just, you know, locked into us. And there's not really a cultural conversation about it."" While being incredibly funny, he explains that it doesn't take much to show up for someone in grief. Ask ""how are you doing,"" wait till they stop crying, and say ""okay."" He met his neighbor while he was grieving during Covid. His neighbor stood across the street, distancing, while Marc cried. This mattered.The Joan Didion book and mystical hummingbird bits are brilliant. One of my favorite lines, ""When you're f---ing sad, you'll go mystical."" He riffs off this in such a real way. Marc nailed so many topics from the experience of grief, loss, loneliness and the need for contact and kindness, to anti-Jewish sentiments, the softenng of vulnerable, elderly parents, and having or not having children.The piece on children is remarkably funny and spot on. Basically, if you have love in your heart to share, go for it, but don't pass on your void. ""You can now track your void on 23andMe. My void started in the chest of a tailor's wife in Belarus in the 1850s in the Pale of Settlement."" Well, some of my ancestors were Jewish tailors from Belarus during that time too, so after the show ended, I immediately looked up the surname Maron, location Belarus, on my Ancestry and found dozens of DNA cousins with that name, so hmm... cousin? Probably. We're all related.It takes a seasoned, sensitive performer and writer to create a comedy show that makes me laugh, cry, and continue thinking about it afterwards. Excellent job by Marc.",False
7,10,10/10,Herb-Mitchell-Reviewed,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerA work of art should either make life more enjoyable or more bearable. This special does a little bit of both.The jokes are classic Maron. From jew stuff to his cats you get the sense that he's super comfortable with his brand of comedy.Seeing Marc be vulnerable regarding his past relationship was a brave crack. If it can enlighten us on what's it's like to lose someone you loved dearly & ease his pain then so be it. I don't feel he crossed the line but I guess that's not up for me to say.Laughing is good and we all should do it more often as I did.This comedy special is well worth the watch.,True
8,8,The Best People Watching Experience Ever,ASuiGeneris,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe because I have a soft spot for a cute couple that meets each other through their creative work; another soft spot for couples that have distinct but similarly vibing film and performing arts talents; was already a strong supporter of him; and I was definitely, am for sure, undoubtedly will forever be, a Lynn Shelton fan, this is my favorite Marc Maron!This is pretty well known because anyone new to him will figure it out with the first few minutes listening to our watching any of his work, but Maron has a sui generis style that is consistent and maximized. There are other ""conversation"" style comedians, but none as dependably or as natural feeling as Maron. One truly believes it when he tells us that his philosophy is to not rehearse. He isn't ashamed when you catch him momentarily losing his place, pausing- not to try to remember a script, but to decide which of his many anecdotes to bring up next, or trailing away when he registers that he might have said something differently than he might have wanted to or went on for longer than would have been ideal.It is like having an intimate conversation with a dynamic, extremely open, always charismatic friend where although, like everyone, he has some mundane parts (let us be honest, we even tune out our best friends here and there), even those are told with some engaging sprinkles, and are inevitably outweighed by all the riveting ones.Tagline for his next special?All-Exclusive Access To The Best Possible People-Watching Experience Ever!",False
9,10,i love him,GrandHighExaltedMysticRuler,n/a,16/08/2025,"I laughed and laughed and laughed. Its so sad and true and genius. I love this guy. I would love to meet him. He really has a sense of humor. He is a god of comedy. What else can i say. Number one, he is the best. Very funny. We need more jewish comedians. Omg, i need more characters. What can i say about him. He is a couragous, fearless example of a good human being. Bless him.i have to say more... i wish i was as funny as him. Its truely an art. He is a brilliant genius. Maybe not, but i have to say more. I will watch all his specials and wait for more. Marc, i am on your side, and i wish i could help you in whatever you need. God bless you.",False
10,4,Low Hanging Fruit Ramblings...,ravenosa,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHard to really call this a comedy special. For most bits, Marc just sort of rambles along on subjects from religion bashing to ""gee my dad is old!"" jokes and other material that's the sort of stuff you'd be stuck hearing on a long car ride with a talkative boomer... Just like his podcast, he doesn't seem to have any interest in learning about world events outside of what Stephen Colbert and John Oliver tells him every evening. His fear of not commenting about anything that may offend anybody (but Christians) makes it seem like the guy is just walking on glass the whole time. A lot of the sad attempts at ""humor"" are him saying something silly while making a face after wrapping up a long diatribe. Time and time again, after a middling story that goes nowhere for what seems like 10 minutes, his only attempt at humor just seems like such an amateurish grasp at being funny, I can't help but wonder if this was mostly improv. This material doesn't really feel like much compared to what an actual comedian puts together through writing, revision and testing the stuff out on audiences. I'm under the impression Moron is more of an actor, so I don't think comedy is really his focus. At the end, it he mostly gives up on attempts at humor and goes with sympathy points talking about losing his wife... I think Netflix would be better of putting this in the documentary or non-fiction category so as not to mislead viewers.",True
11,10,Maron's Best Yet,momosity,n/a,16/08/2025,"Simply put, this stand-up special makes some people who are conformists uncomfortable, and that's too bad for them. Those of us who appreciate thoughtful, sardonic wit have nothing but admiration for everything Marc Maron's been through and come out the other side with honesty about the state of today's world. He hasn't changed his style so much as honed it to ridicule people who try to tell him how to live his life. Watching this again after knowing what to expect only made me appreciate it more. If you've got a thin skin or are narrow-minded comedically, you might not enjoy it. I laughed so hard it hurt, in a good way.",False
12,10,Amazing- his best yet,mikonica-14905,n/a,16/08/2025,"This special was amazing! Loved every minute. Perfect blend of personal humor thru grief as well as overall takes on current society issues in these difficult times. Maron is a wonderful person- amazing podcaster/interviewer, comedian, actor, and cultural icon. And so great to his fans. He worked hard for many years and paid his dues. I hope he keeps doing comedy and wtf for a long time. He just gets better and better with age. And he's softened his outlook over the years while still being quite relevant. I suspect most who rated this special so low are either Trump supporters or Joe Rogan meatheads.",False
13,3,Should have been called Passive Agressive Hate,yjcbrown,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maron hates himself. He tries to be self-deprecating, but it comes off as condescending, Lucky for him, his self loathing is overcome by his narcissism. He takes to the stage to begin his rant of things he hates more than himself. The only thing he hates more than himself - anything ""right wing"". Anyone who is right wing is antisemitic, unfunny, talent less and deserving of contempt. He is too cowardly to name the right wing comedians, who only have the same 3 jokes, but then proceeds to continue with his one note joke - hate. I think he is jealous of comedian who sellout theaters, when he is lucky to sell out tiny rooms. I used to enjoy his podcasts, and his standup, but his derangement since the bad orange man was elected has turned his observational comedy into a hate filled bigoted rant.",False
14,1,Stick to Podcasts,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Marc Maron quite simply is not funny. Being irreparably dark and morbid shouldn't be mistaken for humor. It's just dark and morbid.I like his podcasts. He's a good interviewer. As a comedian he's just depressing. There is no relevancy to what he spouts on about. There is no message. There is no learning momemnt. There is no funny.I'm truly shocked he got his own special. Oddly, as I said above, he has a good podcast. He's even a good interviewee. Entertaining as all heck. But as a stand up, he stinks.Give me Gilbert Godfried, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, or Lewis Black and day of the week. Marc Maron just is a bad standup.",False
15,1,Couldn't make it past the first 15 min,thisisashan-66518,n/a,16/08/2025,"What is funny is he waited until 2023 when the vaccine no longer works for the current strain, to jump in on the bandwagon about making fun of antivaxxers.That was the only funny thing, and not in the haha way.You can tell this guy sat on twitter to long developing anti-right hate rhetoric that he himself finds funny but no one else does. While everyone probably shares his sentiment, that the world isn't going in the right direction, he does a very poor job at turning tragedy into comedy here. Instead he wastes his time polarizing half the country in a way which cheapens everything he says.",False

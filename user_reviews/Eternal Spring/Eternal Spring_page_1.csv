1,8,An amazing movie!!,sovereignbrother,n/a,16/08/2025,The truth of what is happening in China is just tragic! This movie captures the many brutalities going on there now. The world is not aware of the evil that the Chinese Communist Party stands for. What they have done to the people who practice the non-violent art of Falun Gong is pure EVIL. The film touches the heart. The animation is top level.I've seen many reviews condemning the movie. It seems that the truth about the Chinese Communist party is being stopped from getting out. The power the media these days over legitimate news is staggering.I urge anyone reading this review to SEE THIS MOVIE!!!,False
2,8,Shocking & Touching,m-36130-60706,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am impressed by the drawing and the animation. The scene that Daxiong illustrates the characters appearance based on the descriptions and memories, I feel his calmness and also president. The story is indeed hard and sad, but overall I really see it in their shoes.I like how they did a 'callback' in presenting, the police near by the straw pile with the shooting scene. At first I was relatively confused. However, as story goes on, I see why they are running, hiding, protesting, fighting for a place. I like the ending a lot too, lots of factual newspapers as shown for the ending of their legacy. I hope that we can all learn from it.",True
3,10,Very real,xx-90759,n/a,16/08/2025,This film to hand-drawn to 3D animation techniques to restore the real events of the year. It's very moving because it's real. You can see that the crew has made a lot of efforts to restore the real events. Many people were interviewed and many places were visited. The music also fits well.I am also not surprised that people with a Chinese Communist government background leave messages to confuse people. In fact they hadn't even seen the film. They don't even know what the film is about. They just seem to be purposely falsely promoting it with a mission and stereotypes. To make people think that Falun Gong is bad is their purpose. And they don't care about the truth.,False
4,10,"Moving, eye-opening and must see",judithchitingcheung,n/a,16/08/2025,"Eternal Spring is a beautiful film with incredible visuals and animation. It's very eye-opening on what those in China face when they dare to stand up to the government. For those who assume this is propaganda, I would encourage you to actually watch the film because these are true stories that everyday people experience in real life. The film will bring tears to your eyes and inspire you to stand up for what you believe is right.For a documentary, it's very unique as all the scenes they don't have footage for are done in a really unique style of comic book art. The film also plays like a real like heist story keeping you on the edge of your seat.",False
5,10,"A beautiful, heart-breaking masterpiece",adelmansilla,n/a,16/08/2025,"Eternal Spring is a unique masterpiece. Through a skillful combination of animation, real-life footage, and heart-breaking interviews, the film manages to make the story and its characters come to life on the screen and in the heart of the spectators. Looking at the beautiful drawings as a spectator, one reconnects to his or her own childhood memories and builds a deeper connection with the people who had to and ARE STILL GOING through this brutal perspecution. Those grim memories become even more real through animated characters' lives, than real-life pictures and real news coverage.As a precious takeaway, the movie reminded me that real heroes are those whose strength is kind, pure, and transcending the self. And that strength is most of the time is not seen on the surface, but can make far-reaching changes. Carrying this beautiful message with me through the day helps me to be stronger in my kindness, tolerance, and in my care for the ones around me.A huge thank-you to the creators of the movie!",False
6,1,Falun Gong is The Epoch Times,mdromimmolla,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just want to say that Falun Gong is The Epoch Times
From Facing south:The Epoch Times' disinformation lands unbidden in voters' mailboxes.Voters in communities across the South have recently found in their mailboxes unsolicited print copies of The Epoch Times, a controversial pro-Trump, anti-Chinese government news outlet that traffics in conspiracy theories and other forms of disinformation.This reporter received one at her home in Raleigh, North Carolina. Facing South has also been in contact with two people in small Western North Carolina towns who received them, as well as residents of Atlanta and Fairfax County, Virginia. All of the recipients are either registered Democrats or unaffiliated. An inquiry made to The Epoch Times for more details about the mailings and their targets went unanswered.",False
7,10,Touches your deep heart,vinw96,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is so unique that it touches your deep heart. I like the way the animation portrays real history and truth. The spirit extends the feeling and imagination, and you realize that the real story happened. It is beyond words to describe the feelings that move your tears flowing down your face. Thank the producer for bringing us such a soul-touched film in the current world.From the artist's perspective, the animation visualization is also an excellent credit for this film. I like the transition part that enhances the connection of the story. And the angle of camera movement is just at the right time and point.You have to come to see it and feel it, and you'll think that it is worth the time to watch it.",False
8,2,Religion should not be extreme,monirulislam-96679,n/a,16/08/2025,"On the surface, the """"truth, kindness and tolerance"""" advocated by Falun Gong is indeed a good character, but internally it controls and brainwashes people's spirit, and some people even do extreme things. Ignorant people are innocent, but this religion can be outlawed.I was originally interested in human rights and freedom of speech in China, but I wanted to use this topic to attract the audience. I decided not to watch this film, which advocates cults. Religious belief itself needs to be respected, but if it is too extreme and irrational, we should not mythologize it, but resist it. Yes,resist it.",False
9,10,This movie is produced by lives and bloods.,lye-49489,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remembered I fist saw this movie online in May. Form the beginning till the end, tears keep rolling down on my face. I didn't know how much those heroes and their families suffered behind the scenes. But I did know that this story is only one corner of the whole picture which happened crucial in China.In the world, they are normal persons. But they have created a brilliant poem with lives and blood. And this poem will be lasted forever!I am curious, how come a person is willing to sacrifice his (her) life for others? The other people has nothing related to him (her). After I have seen this movie, I started to think of many things I have never considered. What is the meaning of life? What is the value to make living?Don't miss it! Truth and integrity give us power!",False
10,10,Really good film. Worth seeing.,xuhuizhi-40186,n/a,16/08/2025,The film is very touching. The storylines are combined in an elegant way. The combination of the animation and the present-day footage is also very beautiful and fluent. The film tells the truth of a touching Chinese history that is defamed and concealed by the Chinese authority. The film is well-made and of great value. It is really worth seeing.,False
11,10,very good and touching movie,eileenjjsx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was so touched and shocked by this movie. In China,the Evil CCP persecated so many people,especially Falun Dafa practioners,only falu dafa paractioner can stand up and insist on their faith,even though so difficult,but they never give up.very good movie!recommend!The Mandarin and English language animated documentary ""Eternal Spring"" has been selected as Canada's best international feature film entry for the upcoming 95th Oscar Awards. It was released worldwide. Combining present-day footage with 3D animation inspired by Daxiong's art, Eternal Spring retraces the event on its 20th anniversary, and brings to life an unprecedented story of defiance told through harrowing eyewitness accounts of persecution and incredible artistry. Eternal Spring is an exhilarating tale of determination to speak up for political and religious freedoms, no matter the cost.",False
12,1,"Be objective, don't be a joke, please!",whasupmagic,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is ridiculous... Animation documentary? Are you kidding me? If you wanna do a documentary, you should be objective, especially the POV of documentary should be objective, you don't shoot anything objective, you made a animation to tell a story? C'mon, you know this is fiction!About falungong, everybody knows that it's a joke! Back to that time, the guy lihongzhi is a slick cheater... He saw some stuff from Buddhist texts plus something made up by himselftell, then tell people it's called falingong... Back to that time, most people In Changchun even the whole china are not educated well, Chinese were not rich yet, most of them got no Internet to know things from outside, so it's easy to get people believing something. But, it's fine if lihongzhi just wanna make some money by those tricks, but graduately, things lost control, people started to kill themselves because of falungong said if you kill yourself you can go to heaven, even lihongzhi himsef didn't expect that! After he escaped to the states, falungong became to a good tool that can use to against China government. Things back to that time did sound sad, but this film is completely a joke.",False
13,10,"A great movie, very touching, absolutely extraordinary",shulanzhong,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie Eternal Spring is using an unique form and telling a great story. The documentary recorded the group of people are so brave, so benevolent, and... I admire all of these people and the director as well as the painter. Thank you very much for bringing this great story to us!I really like the drawings that the movie used to present the story's background. I remembered that it's a city in China that has tramway. We don't have it in New York city. I feel that the city is cold, but people has warm hearts. Especially the group of young people who risked their lives to bring people the hope. A sad story but make me feel warm in heart.",False
14,1,stir emotions,mdm-72181,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFeaturing vivid animation inspired by Daxiong's drawings, the film is somber and hushed, able to stir emotions without resorting to manipulative tricks.However, I think it should take more account of the social significance of the film. I haven't seen more visits from participants, including the Chinese government's perspective on why Legalism is defined as a cult.Organizations suppressed by the Chinese government in the film founded the Grand Era Times in the United States. Recently, their links on Twitter were warned by Twitter that ""there are security risks"". Twitter warned that the link may have ""malicious"" behavior, attempting to steal personal information, send ""spam"" and try to mislead people, because of ""violence or misleading"" or other ways in violation of Twitter related rules.",True
15,10,Touching my heart,jadex-08525,n/a,16/08/2025,"Martin Luther King said"" an in justice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere"" These people sacrificed their lives to expose the evilness of CCP, I also know the CCP has infiltrated the United State, I saw some 1 point reviews must from the people who have been bought by CCP ,let us spread the truth!

16,10,A fantastic movie!,leahlan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMy husband and I watched the film yesterday at a Markham's cinema and felt that all aspects of the documentary were excellent, the creativity, the animation production, the storyline, etc.The film showed what really happened in China 20 years ago, something that is really unimaginable in the West, and most people don't know that the Chinese Communist Party persecutes human rights to such an extent.I was also very moved to see so many Chinese people risking their lives for the Chinese people's right to know, especially for the sake of others rather than themselves.I thank the director, the cartoonist, and the team for their great work and dedication to bring us this film, and I hope to see more films from this studio in the future.",True
17,10,A noble and courageous act - a must see movie,hanfeiz,n/a,16/08/2025,"While I am not a fan of animation in general, this movie is an exception. It depicts a true story from a perspective of an artist who was not directly involved in the hijack of the Chinese Communist TV signal. His life changed dramatically and he subsequently fled China to seek freedom to practice his faith of Falun Gong (aka Falun Dafa). He interviewed those who were directly and indirectly involved in the hijack of TV signal with the objective of depicting a complete picture why they were willing to risk their life to ensure more Chinese people know the truth about the unjust persecution of Falun Gong, how they did it and the deadly consequence. The movie is about courage to speak the truth and uphold one's strong faith and belief. It's more about the importance of having strong faith and the truth will ultimately set us free. A must see movie!",False
18,1,Disappointed,x-64022,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film tells a story with obvious political tendencies under the cloak of a true story. The seemingly objective telling Angle is actually the transmission of the author's radical ideas.Behind the ""animated documentary"" is its sinister political purpose of deceiving and exploiting the audience who do not know the truth in order to compete for the right to speak.In my opinion, the success of a good film absolutely requires artistic and ideological transcendence. However, the way this film arouses discussion through violent and curious images is so poor that any film lover will deny its artistic value, and only the fanatic prejudice will be blinded by it.In modern society, film is the main tool and means to spread ideology. The ideology of the upper class of the state directly affects the whole film industry, and film culture has a crucial influence on today's mass culture. Therefore, the broadcast of a film containing the national mainstream ideology will arouse widespread heated.",False

20,10,This is a touching movie,oomichi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very real and natural interview documentary! I like it.The film is thought-provoking and inspiring. The animation is very vivid and simple and reminds me of my hometown in China where I grew up. The film uses interviews with real people and animations to restore the original appearance in an unprecedented way. I really love it.What happened in China 20 years ago? The film is shown alongside real events. In the film, the camera moves from far to near, entering the people's activity, there is an immersive feeling. What is more important is the enlightenment at the spiritual level, and the hero's righteousness appears again.Recommend watching this movie!",False
21,10,Best Documentary ever!,abbiewf,n/a,16/08/2025,"First time I see people use animation to unfold a real story, a touching, shocking, and inspiring story! Everyone should watch it. It must-see movie in nowadays. I sincerely wanna tell people, PLEASE! Do not kill too much your time in the pop corn movies, take some time to watch the high quality and serious one. I learned lot. We, as people, we have responsibilities to the society, to families, to friends, to the next generations...

Pray for them!",False
22,10,A great movie,kenxhust,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great movie! Go to watch it in the theatre!Just watched the movie this afternoon. It's a 3D animation movie, with good 3D affection with touching music, combined the real person interview and past memory.China is occupied by Chinese communist party, all the news, media organizations are controlled or audited by CCP. The truth, the first hand information is isolated from ordinary chinese. Some brave people tried to open a window for the people to enjoy the fresh air for a while, with cost of their lives.A hero, is not always a Superman/ Wonder Woman, he can be just a ordinary guy, but with belief and spiritual energy, he can beyond the fear and death threat, did a outstanding work, to help thousands of people. I like the topic of the movie.",False
23,1,I do not believe,ryan-59654,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice movie form,but i can't tell which is the truth, falungong looks too amazing to be real!There is no truth in politics and religion, you don't know who is right and who is wrong. We need to think about which one should be protected when religion and law conflict. Terrorist organizations are also a form of religion and need to be fought.So the most important thing is the truth, falungong is a terrorist organization or a legal religious organization.The movie has too strong a political tendency, which makes me doubt the authenticity. Of course, the form of animation is still very attractive.",False
24,10,Great Movie Very creative,zsrming,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great Movie. Very creative. Very touching.This movie shows how Chinese communist party propaganda lies, and show no human rights for the Falun Gong practitioner in China, unlawful persecution toward innocent Falun Gong practitioners. Under this situation, to let people in China known the truth, Falun Gong practitioners use their way to clarify the truth, they are true heroes. To let people speak out, it is the basic human rights the Falun Gong practitioner should have.I hope Falun Gong practitioners in China to practice Falun Gong freely soon.I also admire the creative of this movie. Thanks.",False
25,2,a kind of heresy,mdjahangirmia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Live action complements stunning 3D animation centering on how the Chinese Communist government has arrested, imprisoned and tortured vocal members of the Falun Gong society. The documentary ignores a dark side of the group. Practitioners of Falun Gong even commit suicide in order to enter heaven, which is obviously a kind of heresy.I checked the materials and found that the religious legal theory mentioned in the film has been deified. Many Chinese politicians have taken the lead in believing it. There are also believers who die at home when they are ill and do not cure themselves. Then many fools think about cultivating immortals every day. In terms of the whole people's livelihood, this is very absurd. In the final analysis, I think that in that era, the people's educational awareness was not rich, and they did not have the ability to distinguish between true and false. The growth of such sects is also terrible for politics. The quality of sects depends on the idea of the religious leader. It is crazy to cultivate immortals.",False

1,5,Dreadful host,leedsedu,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an important and wonderful documentary, sad and heartfelt, but ABSOLUTELY ruined by a half-witted woman with the most ridiculous questions ever: 'Do you miss your father?' and 'How did you feel when the terrorists came into your house?'), completely plastered in enough make-up to cover 3 elephants, jewellery to fill a entire shop, gold sunglesses, false plastic nails that you can clearly see she doesn't want anyone touching, her chest half exposed, and a wardrobe change in every scene. Who would ever dare to dress like that on a visit to such a war-torn area? - She's an insult to humanity.",False
2,4,The framing of the documentary is almost comical,editfmah,n/a,15/08/2025,"No one can deny the horror those children experienced, the fear, the absolute terror that unfolded and the evil unleashed upon them.Their testimonies are really honest and brutal. Although the questions were walled in a carefully curated to create the documentary's almost railroaded narrative.The supporters would say that their story needed to be told and it did. But it was extremely odd to entirely exclude the history of the conflict and the possible reasons for the attack. It weaponised their genuine suffering to try and portray an innocence for one side of the conflict which is simply not there.This documentary could have been great at showing the terrible atrocities, but was undermined by its lack of honesty about the framing which was almost jarring in its short comings.",False
3,1,Not Good - Missing Key Element,imdbfan-8091069954,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched the documentary, expecting to see a full, balanced account of the events. But what I saw was a one-sided story - told neatly, emotionally, even powerfully - but from just one perspective. It followed the pain, confusion, and aftermath experienced by a group whose voices are often centered in global narratives. Their heartbreak was real. Their fear was genuine. Their tears were raw and human. And yet, the entire time, I couldn't stop thinking: what about the other side? What about those whose lives were shattered long before this story began? Whose daily suffering is rarely documented, let alone acknowledged?As the film played, I kept waiting for a pivot - a moment where the camera might shift, just briefly, to those living on the other side of the fence, the wall, the checkpoint. But that moment never came. I kept waiting to hear about the families who have lost generations, the children who wake up to the sound of drones, the mothers who bury sons and daughters every week, the voices that are constantly silenced, labeled, or ignored. I wanted the documentary to be honest enough to say: yes, pain exists here - but it also exists there, perhaps even more deeply and consistently. But the story remained one-dimensional. Clean. Focused. Sanitized in a way that made it digestible to a mainstream audience - and convenient to ignore the larger context.This omission wasn't accidental. It felt intentional. Because to tell the full story would require facing uncomfortable truths: truths about oppression, displacement, historical injustice, and decades of silent suffering. It would require acknowledging power dynamics, not just moments of grief. And maybe that's too much to ask from a single film. But if the intention was to educate, to humanize, to invite empathy - then empathy should not be selective. You don't get to center one group's fear while erasing another's trauma.",False
4,10,Voices of Survival: A Heart-Wrenching Portrayal of Trauma and Courage in The Children of October 7,Tooommmy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Deeply moving documentary that amplifies the voices of Israeli children who endured the horrors of the October 7 Hamas attack. Through raw, firsthand accounts, the film centers on their harrowing experiences of survival, captivity, and unimaginable loss, including witnessing parental deaths and home invasions, as activist Montana Tucker guides the conversations with empathy and sensitivity. The documentary's power lies in its unfiltered focus on resilience amid trauma, offering a platform for young survivors like Yael Idan and Ella Shani Kozin to recount their stories of hiding, escape, and enduring psychological scars. While the subject matter is undeniably distressing, the film avoids sensationalism, instead prioritizing the humanity and courage of its young subjects. It serves as a critical testament to the human toll of conflict, urging awareness of the ongoing impact on those who lived through the attacks.A necessary but emotionally demanding watch.",False
5,1,Not detailed well,JoshuaL-255,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this documentary about October 7th expecting a sober reckoning with the day's horrors-not just the pain of one side, but the full, agonizing truth of what unfolded. Instead, I was given a carefully curated narrative, one that wielded grief as both weapon and shield. The film captured, with unflinching intimacy, the terror of Israeli civilians-the children hiding in fear, the families torn apart, the raw anguish of a community under attack. Their suffering was undeniable, their trauma visceral.But the documentary refused to acknowledge a harder, more essential truth: October 7th was not a one-sided atrocity. While Hamas militants attacked in kibbutzim and at a music festival, Israeli forces responded with airstrikes that killed Israeli and Palestinian civilians in both kibbutzim and Gaza-including children who had no part in the attack. The film framed the violence as a sudden, inexplicable eruption, as if it existed outside of history, outside of cause and effect. It never paused to ask: What led here? It never dared to show the Palestinian parents digging their own children from rubble that same day, or the decades of occupation, blockade, and despair that shaped this moment.This wasn't just an oversight, it was an active erasure. The documentary placed all blame on one side, all innocence on the other, as if war and retaliation could ever be so simple. It asked us to mourn some children while ignoring others. It demanded outrage at some deaths while treating others as inevitable, even justified.If the goal was truth, then the film failed. Because the real story of October 7th is not a tale of monsters and martyrs. It is a story of cycles, of vengeance, of two peoples trapped in a struggle where violence only begets more violence. To tell it any other way isn't just dishonest. It's dangerous.",False
6,9,Important and sensitive piece of document,Shachar-07,n/a,15/08/2025,"Review: The Children of October 7The director and his team have accomplished something truly extraordinary with The Children of October 7. This is not just a film - it's a testimony. It is a documentary that everyone on this planet needs to witness, no matter how difficult it may be to watch. What the creators have managed to capture is more than just a recounting of horrific events; they have provided a deeply human, sensitively portrayed account through the most fragile yet powerful lens imaginable - the eyes of the children who lived through it.From the first moments of the film, it becomes clear that the crew approached the story with immense care and respect. The narrative never feels exploitative or forced. Instead, it allows the children's voices to carry the weight of their experiences, without unnecessary dramatization or emotional manipulation. This sensitive handling is present throughout the entire movie, even during the most harrowing moments when the stories being told are almost too painful to comprehend. The team's restraint and compassion are palpable, and it is what makes the documentary so impactful.The children's testimonies are raw, honest, and heartbreakingly vivid. Listening to them recount what they saw, what they felt, and how their lives were shattered forces the audience to confront the human cost of tragedy in its purest form. These are not seasoned storytellers or trained actors - these are young souls trying to find words for experiences no one should ever have to endure. The sheer authenticity of their words and expressions leaves an indelible mark.One of the most remarkable achievements of The Children of October 7 is its ability to balance unbearable sadness with dignity. The film does not fall into despair; it refuses to strip the children of their agency or their humanity. Instead, it highlights their resilience, their struggle to comprehend the incomprehensible, and in some cases, even their small sparks of hope. The documentary becomes not only a record of loss but also a tribute to the strength of the human spirit - particularly that of the youngest among us.The cinematography and editing choices complement the tone perfectly. There are no flashy techniques or unnecessary embellishments; everything is crafted to keep the focus squarely on the children and their stories. Quiet shots, natural lighting, and moments of stillness give the film an authenticity that heightens its emotional power. Even the musical score is used sparingly and wisely, enhancing the emotional landscape without overwhelming it.It is not an easy movie to watch - nor should it be. Some scenes are deeply unsettling, not because of any graphic imagery, but because of the raw emotional truths being shared. The bravery of these children, willing to open up their wounds in front of a camera, is nothing short of staggering. Equally brave are the filmmakers, who chose to sit with that pain, honor it, and share it with the world in the most respectful way possible.The Children of October 7 is a film that demands reflection. It is a reminder of the real human beings behind the headlines and statistics. It insists that we see, listen, and remember - not just the events, but the lives altered forever. It is a film that calls for empathy, for action, and most of all, for remembrance.In an age where desensitization to violence and tragedy is a real risk, this movie re-centers us on what truly matters: the human stories. The real faces. The innocent lives caught in the crossfire. It is an experience that will leave you shaken, humbled, and forever changed.No words can truly do justice to what these children endured, but The Children of October 7 gives them the platform they deserve. And for that, we owe the director, the team, and most importantly, the children themselves, our deepest gratitude.This is not just a film to watch - it is a film to bear witness to.",False
7,10,An important and very moving movie for all to watch,FloraH-9,n/a,15/08/2025,This movie is a must see for all. To take the time to meet each child and discuss their pain is commendable. History must be recorded. These innocent children are completely traumatized and we are grateful Montana was able to sit and share their stories. What these children endured and experienced is unbelievable and to be able to share it for the world to hear is very brave. With the antisemitism rising in the world and the hate that is spewed it is more important now to watch this movie and hear the stories from the young innocent children. A must see - thank you Montana for doing this much needed documentary.,False
8,10,A must watch!!!!,KarinaM-66,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think it is an excellent documentary.. Deeply moving. Hard to watch, nevertheless, every person should watch it. Devastating what these children had to go through, beyond words. But they are so brave, strong and resilient, just admirable. Hope they can recover soon, and have a beautiful amazing life, full of love and peace, just as every human being should.Thank you so much to director, Montana and every person who contributed to make this possible.May peace increase, pervades and heal every single hart and mind of each and every human being.May all hostages return home soon.Bring them home now.",False
9,7,Let the children speak,perspectivist,n/a,15/08/2025,"After watching I'm left with a very strange feeling. On one hand, I'm so impressed and horrified by the stories of these brave children and seeing how they, even while answering, are struggling to cope with their feelings. It's really heartbreaking and humbling to hear them talk about how their families were killed and what they decided to do in that moment to have a chance at living. It left me speechless for quite some time.But on the other hand, while watching from 'documentary-technical' point of view, I was getting increasingly frustrated by how Tucker was interviewing these kids. I don't believe she has ever heard of the term 'open-ended question' and I felt the kids were not able to fully express their thoughts and feelings because of this.It really seems like she first considered what she herself would do or feel in that situation (which is a good attempt at empathy, of course) but then formulates her own perspective as the question. This leads to very steering questions with sometimes even value judgment pouring through and makes me wonder if the answer is truthful or a bit pressured by the way of asking.For instance, (I'm creating a fictional and extreme example here because I want to make clear what I'm talking about and I don't want to use the real answers here in the review) a girl could tell her ""and then I remained in my hiding place until everybody left."" Tucker would then empathize and maybe think that she would feel guilty about not actively helping her family escape, too. In itself a very valid reaction, but then (in my example scenario, she didn't actually say this literally) she would probably pose her follow-up question like this: ""Didn't you feel guilty about not helping your family?"" If you're a bit like me you can already feel that the formulation of this question is wrong on so many levels...But on the other hand, her being a star and influencer and getting, it seems, a good rapport with these children is very valuable indeed. The children seem at ease talking to her and that is also a part of interviewing which she actually does very well.In the end, I don't know if the connection/rapport compensates for the obvious lack of interviewing skills but it did leave me with an unsatisfying feeling from a more 'technical' point of view...",False
10,10,heartbreaking for parents yet important,nutzaku,n/a,15/08/2025,"My only wish is that my teen son will watch it someday. That's such an important movie. I cried few times and can't stop thinking about these kids and other kids who experienced real tragic trauma. Can't think of american kids who can't share about it in their public schools or on campuses , can't think about those who justify those tragedies. I hope those kids will get proper therapy and i wish again that my son will get same proper help and will watch this movie with open heart even when it will be painful. Sending all my love to those kids and to all the kids experiencing violence and injustice.",False
11,9,Heartbreakingly important,frannyrose-56454,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wish I didn't need to write a review for such a sad and important movie. In these times of lies and misinformation, it's crucial that people unconnected to the conflict get a chance to watch the accounts of those children who survived the attack on Oct 7th. Watch this movie to bear witness to the reality of terror and listen to the firsthand words of those children who survived.Like the Holocaust, there are times in history where we want to look away- the pain and horror is too great, but the only way to honour the memories of those innocent lives taken is to see and hear with our own eyes. This movie, created by Montana Tucker, is a first person account that sears your heart, but leaves you with the knowledge and truth of what happened on Oct 7th. Evil made its way into the life of children and it's our duty to watch and share their stories with the world.",False
12,10,Powerful Documentary,ElizabethS-191,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you, Montana Tucker, for documenting the pain and suffering of Israeli children on October 7. This movie is a testimony. The world needs to know what evil Hamas does including cold-blooded murder, torture, sexual assault, burning people alive, and kidnapping. These Israeli children are brave and resilient for sharing these stories. Hamas does the same to people in Gaza. People need to watch this documentary even though it is painful to watch. The story is told thoughtfully and lets the children share their stories in away that feels natural and non-exploitative. Bravo Montana Tucker for taking on this project.",False
13,10,Very emotional and distressing,sharonshor,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst, I want to clear a doubt, which at least I personally had; the intreviewed children and teens have consented and are in therapy for their experience.Ella Shani, one of the older withnesses, has actually commented on the result of the movie (in ynet) and said that she's thankful for having the story of her town and family out.For me it gave a relief, since I hate forcing children withnesses to emotionally share their stories for attention.Now do note; these are harsh events. The children in the movie are massacare survivors and what they experienced and tell about is horrifying. One boy has gotten kidnapped, another managed to get away by hiding under his familys' bodies and several of these children to this day haven't come back to their home or town since it is still considered too dangerous.So please, do not watch while vulrenable. Have a friend or your family around, and give yourself time to process. It is impossible to watch this movie and immediatelly get back into daily life.",True

It's vital that history is recorded - and what these innocent children have endured is unimaginable.We are deeply grateful to Montana for giving them a platform to share their stories. Their bravery in speaking out is incredible, especially in a time when antisemitism and hate continue to rise around the world.This documentary is more important now than ever.

In just over 30 minutes, it delivers raw testimonies, real footage, and personal stories with honesty, sensitivity, and care. The film doesn't exploit trauma-it honors it, showing the strength, resilience, and humanity of young survivors. It's a stark reminder of the human cost of hatred and violence.

16,10,The truth,mosheredu,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHow it all began, a heartbreaking and important piece. Eye opener. The fear, the caos, the bloodthirst and joy through this whole dreadful morning, is something which is hard to conceive.Those young children, as part of their peaceful society, lived with their neighbors in what they thought to be common interests and friendship, and that day their entire world collapsed, they saw their family butchered, their neighbors true colors, the treason of their neighbours, friends, when they gleefully cheered and participated in this horrific morning. We humans, always find a new bottom to reach. Dreadful.",True

19,10,A Heartbreaking Yet Essential Documentary,ziv-nachum,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Children of October 7 is one of the most powerful documentaries I have seen in a long time. In just 35 minutes, it delivers an emotional punch that stays with you long after it ends. The film presents the raw, unfiltered testimonies of Israeli children who survived the October 7 terror attacks, sharing their stories with courage and heartbreaking honesty.What makes this documentary so impactful is its simplicity - it doesn't rely on heavy narration or dramatic effects. Instead, it gives the children space to tell their own stories. The result is devastating and deeply moving. You hear about unimaginable moments: a child hiding under a parent's body, witnessing family members murdered, being taken into captivity. And yet, through all the horror, you also see incredible resilience.Director Asaf Becker and Montana Tucker handle the subject matter with great care and respect, allowing the children's voices to be heard without sensationalism. The documentary also incorporates actual footage from the attack and personal family photos, which make the loss and trauma even more real.This film is not easy to watch, but it is absolutely necessary. It's a testament to the strength of these young survivors and a reminder of the human cost behind the headlines. It doesn't preach or politicize - it simply bears witness.Highly recommended to anyone who believes in the importance of listening to the voices of those who lived through tragedy.",False
20,10,Heartwrenching,NavitS-9,n/a,15/08/2025,"These beautiful young children have stared into the eyes of pure evil and survived. It really gives you an idea of why Israel is fighting and what Israel is up against. The harrowing experiences are unfathomable. The deliberate evil is unimaginable to the modern mind. It should be compulsory viewing for all the know-it-all podcasters who've never listened. It should also be compulsory viewing for the politicians who think they know better. It is also a warning. This is jihad, the terrifying reality that faces all civilised people unless it is stopped and unless it is fought against. Joe Rogan should watch it.",False
21,10,The children speak for themselves,ViktoriaS-4,n/a,15/08/2025,We should be listening to the children more. Montana has done a great job in asking difficult questions and listening to difficult answers. She has not turned away from the horror of what occurred and has provided compassion for all involved. Such accurate and moving reporting is rare these days. Intimate not scripted dialogue with affected children is almost to difficult to watch. But it must be watched. The honesty and clarity of vision of children can not be ignored. This is not a documentary you will enjoy but one you should watch. Be prepared to be distressed and challenged as the stories can not be forgotten easily.,False

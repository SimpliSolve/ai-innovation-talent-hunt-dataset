1,9,Not Just a YouTube Video,maxcoh3n,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the personality known as ""IDubbbz"" may attract his fair share of controversy, edgy humor, and satire, this documentary, and this review, is none of those things.
Ice Cream Man, with its focus on the socially awkward yet unashamed Dax Flame, strikes a perfect balance between hilarious laugh-out-loud comedy and the truly melancholic despair.

With pacing and cinematography rivaling Hollywood produced documentaries, combined with the rollercoaster of emotions you are bound to feel while watching this film, it would be a mistake so simply discount this work of art based on it's creator's past endeavors.",False

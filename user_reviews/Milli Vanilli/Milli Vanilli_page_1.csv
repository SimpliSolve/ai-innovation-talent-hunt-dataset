1,8,A must watch for lovers of 80s music,mselisagrant,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThese guys were an incredibly well marketed package - and the package they offered was adored by millions around the world leading to crazy sales.Yes, we were eventually told it was a fraud and that they didn't sing on the album BUT the truth was that they were loved for more than their singing. Their look, their moves, their sex appeal - it was all part and parcel of why people loved them and those things were real!The sad reality is that regardless what the truth is about how they got caught up in the lie, the fact that they coped all the blame was - and still is- incredibly unfair. Those who really profited from it should have been held accountable and made to pay.This documentary is really well done and provides a great glimpse back into the 80s, an era that for many of us was just the best. The way the story unfolds is interesting and the content appears to be balanced and comprehensive.Worth watching.",True
2,7,Exposing the true villains once and for all,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Milli Vanilli"" (2023 release; 106 min) opens, we are in today's ""Amsterdam"", and Fabrice ""Fab"" Morvan digs up pictures from the good ol' days (late 80s). We then go to ""1986"" when Robert ""Rob"" Pilatus and Fab meet in Munich, pretty much the only people of color in this conservative Bavarian city. They are in their early 20s and desperate to become ""stars""... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from Luke Korem (""Dealt""). Here he reassesses the life and times of Rob and Fab, the front of Milli Vanilli whose lives were ostracized by the music industry and indeed the world at large when it turned out they had lip-synced all along. Thankfully Korem digs deeper and top executives of the record label Arista admit to knowing about it well before ti all came crashing down in 1990. Why is it that Rob and Fab were vilified but producer Frank Farian and label boss Clive Davis got off scot free? This documentary fills in the gaps very nicely, and it is long overdue to be honest.""Milli Vanilli"" premiered at last year's Tribeca Festival to immediate critical acclaim. It is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, if you can believe it. ""Milli Vanilli"" started streaming on Showtime (now part of Paramount+) last Fall and I just stumbled the other day on it after watching ""Thriller 40"" (also on SHO). If you are a fan of Milli Vanilli, or simply interested in a footnote in the history of the Grammys, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,7,"They all knew it, c´moon",manTOman,n/a,16/08/2025,"The document is good but mostly everyone there is lying their ass off to sugar coat the whole scam. I mean everybody knew before Milli Vanilli that only one person sang in Boney M and the male voice was Frank Farians own voice, I read about it in 1981 and I am just a consumer. And big bosses in Arista disint know about Boney M, Haloo!!! Also they all knew Frank Farian also and he was behind the massive success of Boney M. SO please DONT lie they just all wanted to make tons of money. These days with AI can make dog sing so these days this scam is more the rule, rather than the exception. And in those times there was already C+C Music Factory, Snap, Black Box, they all used model in video than showing who real singer was.But the whole music scene has change so much from these days so...",False
4,10,Excellent Documentary,mrjeffmoore,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a great documentary. First and foremost, it brought back some fun memories of the music (even if they didn't sing it). More than anything, though, it humanized them in a way I had never thought about. I always remembered feeling angry that these two had tried to pull a scam on everyone, when in reality it was dozens, if not hundreds of people all keeping quiet because of the millions the album was making. By the end, I felt sadness for them instead of anger. There have been some great music docs lately... WHAM, and now this. And girl you know it's true that I ordered the CD after watching. Go ahead and judge all ya want.",False
5,10,They would be TikTok famous today!,staciafriel,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was well done and heartbreaking. This is a true example of 2 different paths you can take when bad things happen in life. One path has suffering and one path thrives. One can't bounce back, maybe hates himself and one reinvents himself. The choice is always ours. I was a young woman when they came on the scene and I bought their tape and played it out. I still love the music and back then I was just sad when I found out because I knew they wouldn't be making anymore awesome music. I am glad to see that Fab has thrived and concurred his demons. They didn't deserve the hate they went through. I really hope this helps people to see to relax on people. There is always a scapegoat and there's always someone pulling strings that deserves the actual outrage that usually comes to the wrong party. Be kind to one another. Peace out and enjoy the amazing music!",True
6,10,Best Documentary about fame ever made.,travixius-31398,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an absolutely riveting study into the fickle nature of fame as well as the price that must ultimately be paid for lies. It's also a peek behind the curtain of the music industry and the money that fuels it. Along the way lives are destroyed as two young and naive men get caught up in the whirlwind of fame and get put on a vicious trajectory with doom by forces out of their control. As a person watching this as it occurred in 1990 it is an interesting reminder, but viewers of all ages will enjoy this. It's also an emotional story of redemption for a man who was put under extraordinary international scorn in a no-win situation. Must see viewing for rock/pop aficionados and anyone.",False
7,7,A Story of Fame and Deception: A Solid Biopic,irusvirus,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary takes you on a journey from the beginning to the end of a fascinating story, showing both the highs and the lows. It sheds light on the unsavory truths, yet also highlights the tragic aspects of the situation. Rob and Fab, despite their involvement in a controversial chapter of music history, never truly harmed anyone, which is an important point the documentary makes.In today's world, it's common for people to be more concerned with the music itself rather than who is behind the writing, producing, or performing. However, at the time, this was a major point of focus, making their story all the more interesting. The biopic does a good job of capturing that era and the consequences of the deception, all while painting a more nuanced picture of what transpired.Overall, it's a well-made and engaging documentary, and while it doesn't entirely break new ground, it does a good job of telling the story. I give it a solid 7/10.",False
8,9,Worth The Watch,Foutainoflife,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary. Milli Vanilli was part of my early teen years and I loved their music. The scandal that took them down has been one of the biggest controversies in music history. In all honesty, they were used to make a lot of wealthy people even more money and then they were used to cover and take all the heat off those same people. Rob Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan could not have done all they did without approval from the higher ups being in on all of it.I've always thought the ill treatment shown to Rob and Fab was a bit misplaced. We've seen how other artists have been treated by producers, managers and labels. They live to make money off of the talent of others. Their contracts, decisions and exploitation can be criminal.I don't doubt that Rob and Fab wanted to sing their own music but the contract made with their producer was signed before it was revealed that they would be lip syncing. Breach of contract and financial debt was the threat they faced for not complying with the producers plan. I understand why they did it and I understand that the intoxicating effects of fame, adoration and money kept them from coming clean.The powers that be did the musicians, backup singers, lead vocalists, Rob, Fab and the fans dirty.If you think you know the story or are just interested in learning about what happened, watch this. It is so worth the time. While Rob's death was tragic, I'm glad to see that Fab is still involved in music. Very good documentary.",False
9,10,Excellent,NoelleTalks,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Documentary was right on point, I remember it very well in my youth Milli Vanilli were good performers/entertainers and when the cat was let out the bag actually most fans could have cared less we still like Milli Vanilli even to this day most fans still speak positive about Rob & Fab, they had great stage presence, energy, fashion and dance.Milli Vanilli created a path for other music industry entertainers to have a great shot at riches & fame JLO I'm sure is thankful for the path they sacrificed and made. MV were great performers/entertainers I enjoyed their music very much They Rocked!",False
10,2,"This is COMPLETE BS! Charles ""Oh, Oh, Ohh"" Christopher was the REAL SINGER!",Rocket202,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is complete BULL $#lT! Their manager did NOT nominate them for a Grammy Award! Artists are nominated for Grammy Awards by GRAMMY ACADEMY MEMBERS! CHARLES CHRISTOPHER sang the original ""Girl You Know it's True"", with the Baltimore, Maryland group NUMARX, with Kevin Lyles, George Philips Jr., Charles Christopher, Bill Pettaway, Ky Adeyemo, and their DJ, Sean Spencer! They EVEN SAID, ""They had this RAPPER, Charles Shaw, but needed someone for vocals"", but guess what? Brad Howell couldn't replicate the vocals that were on the original record, so Frank Farian SAMPLED the ORIGINAL 12"" A-CAPPELLA version from CHARLES CHRISTOPHER! I had his MULTI-PLATINUM RIAA Award hanging in my house, that said, ""To Charles, ""Oh, Oh, Ohh"" Christopher, THANKS FOR THE VOCALS"". The REASON they he never spoke up was because he signed an NDA, and was paid A LOT of MONEY, to keep quiet, but after the news came out, he was on tour with other groups, singing for them, and making records with people like Ice Cube, 2-PAC, Linear, Lisa-Lisa and Full Force, and you can hear his vocals from the Roger Feat Shirley Murdock song, Chocolate City, which is where Roger used his vocals for 2-PAC's ""California Love""! Charles Christopher was taken advantage of his entire life, and was not given proper credit for all of the songs that he appeared on. There needs to be a RESPONSE to this documentary, with the REAL STORY! CHARLES ""Oh, Oh, Ohh"" Christopher sang the vocals on ""Girl You Know it's True"", and it is FULLY Documented!",True
11,9,Girrrrl you know it's true: Blame it on the FAME! (Milli Humanilli),Her-Excellency,n/a,16/08/2025,"I heard about Milli Vanilli when I was really, really young - right out of toddlerhood, maybe. As such, at the time, I never really understood everything that happened back then involving this ""scandal"", but it always surprised me how vehemently ANGRY quite a few people would become at the thought of these two men, Robert Pilatus and Fabrice Morvan having ""lip-synced some songs"". (Yes, that's pretty much what I knew of it). As I grew up, I understood more of it, especially because I was involved in dance, but still, the indignation and ire with which some people referred to it, always escaped me. As much WRONG that was done by these guys, much worse was actioned by the ones who used them and benefitted from them. Can anyone who sees this documentary, truly say they would not at least pause and consider the dream-come-true which was presented to be plucked? If anything, they brought the world some GREAT tunes which otherwise may not have been made or may not have had the success and airplay they did. What a shame that the brunt of the fallout and fallback, as this documentary shows, was paid by the two performers.",False
12,9,What. A. Story.,RannyDanny,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even after living through the rise and fall of Milli Vanilli, one could not understand how this was even possible. But looking at this documentary, it is almost a prediction it was going to happen eventually.How many people were not only duped but participated in this whole scam? Now you can see the whole picture through the lens of the characters and you cannot really blame anyone but everyone.They were even able to fool the most powerful people in the industry.The two singers were vilified and accused. But now it is clear to me, they were only pawns. Here is the thing: it was good music.Must see even if you never heard of Milli Vanilli.",False
13,9,FRAUDS,hazangel-89910,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am NOT referring to Rob or Fab!!!Honestly who cares if they were lip syncing??? I was in my 20's when the scandal happened and I still bought their music! They weren't the best entertainers out there but they were unique, eye catching and had sex appeal.These record studios, execs, song writers etc knew exactly what was happening. If they didn't know in the beginning, they knew at some point. Everyone was about the money!! Just be honest! I guess they have their reputations to maintain but everyone knows record studios are vultures!!!Ingrid pissed me off. She was so dishonest and disrespectful towards Rob and Fab. All that laughing and dismissive hand gestures spoke volumes. Of course she needed alcohol to get through the interview...I wish Rob never trusted her!!!! I just have no sympathy for her. She contributed to Rob and Fab's demise with her boyfriend/boss.If you look closely at Fab's face during the Grammy picture taking portion of the documentary you can tell he did not look happy at all. Rob was just so happy to be loved and admired. But you could see the nervousness on Fab's face.Also the fake outrage of the media at that conference was ridiculous!!! I thought Rob and Fab handled it very well!!! No one can deny the racial undertones (or overtones) of this scandal.What this documentary did not say was that they only sold 2000 albums because the company that took a chance on them was already going out of business. So no one knows if they would have sold more records had they had a bigger machine behind them.Charles Shaw is bitter to say the least but you really cant blame him.Frank is somewhere living his best life with his millions. Hope it was all worth it....",False
14,10,They filled those who listened with joy and wholesome entertainment.,Harry_Pamiaqui,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey lied, lying is disrespectful. But, if you bought their music, you got what you paid for, a great album. If you went to their concerts, you enjoyed it, and you lived through a great moment in history, for better or worse, you got what you paid for. Once again history repeated itself: the weakest were thrown to the butcher. They left them alone we a press that yelled at them, embarrassed them, made them look vile, as if Rob n Fab were the masterminds and the only ones to blame, the price that must ultimately be paid for lies. No one was forced to sponsor them, they simply pleased and filled those who listened with joy and wholesome entertainment. If they don't sing then they don't sing, but they profited from it as well as hundreds of people keeping quiet because of the millions the album was making. In the early 1980s, the local media reported that Guy Anthony O'Brien (The Sugarhill Gang's Master Gee) had died when he was shot during the robbery of his coat as he left a club in NYC. It was in 2011, almost 30 years later when ""I Want My Name Back"" came out, that I knew the truth that those idols of my youth, thank God, were alive and thriving. There have been many artists who have been manipulated into dark paths by their handlers. I feel so sorry for Rob, and I'm glad I was able to see, at least in the last 30 seconds, Fab's true potential on stage.",True
15,9,They can actually SING!,jecristiano,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirstly, this documentary was long overdue.Secondly, this was very well made & will take you through an emotional roller-coaster.Thirdly, I just could not get over the fact it was never mentioned that they could actually sing, and yes, at the time it may not have been Whitney Houston worthy, but not once was voice training/singing lessons even offered. Even Ed Sheeran says although not everyone is musical, we can all sing when trained as the vocal chords are muscles.And finally, 'Frank the Fraud' needs to have his credibility removed from the music industry and Ingrid needs to seek help!",True
16,10,Rob & Fab; You're Missed,deusfilius,n/a,16/08/2025,"The music is only part of the success; Rob & Fab sold it and sold it well. They were patsies who took a big one for the crooked team. I loved these guys and still do. They are Milli Vanilli, as are the original singers, the producers, the labels, etc. But only Rob & Fab suffered. Super documentary, but the ending was the best and brought me to tears; they really can sing-that's the whole irony. As Americans can we really throw stones? We just want to be entertained at any cost. These are two human beings who were promised the world as youths and took it. And when exposed, owned it. ""An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips"".-King Solomon.",False
17,10,THANK YOU ROB&FAB,melsem-33416,n/a,16/08/2025,MV was my era and I remember the so called scandal but never followed as I didn't think it was a big deal - watching this documentary it's just sad there was no one to represent them as the young kids they were and expose the real culprits to this harsh tragedy at the time. I was rather stunned to learn fans started a lawsuit - and to think MV were the only ones that knew about the lip syncing? And that the army behind them had nothing to do with it? This documentary showing the nitty gritty of powerful people hopefully will help the younger generation not to conform to the threat. That is all!,False
18,10,Ahead of their time,jbaltgai-82011,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary and just goes to show how fans do not like to be manipulated. Now singers are highly autotuned and many pop stars lip sync in their concerts but the shame is that all they needed to do was some voice training and I think still would have been successful. They should not have been criticized as their were, they were not the brains of this operation. Fab has done well now, he has an amazing voice and beautiful family ... unfortunately Rob did not get to experience any of that. If this had happened in the 2000s to now, it would not be even considered wrong but in the 1980s, this would have been definitely seen as wrong. The producers and labels should have definitely taken on the blame for this.",False
19,8,Pop fraud that also shows an important part of the pop industry's cynicism,dakjets,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a teenager in the 80s, I remember Milli Vanilli well. I was never a big fan of the duo, but I couldn't help but get the massive attention and success the group got. Also their abrupt end to their pop career.After watching this good, insightful documentary, I am primarily saddened by their story. Two young men who wanted to be ""stars"" more than anything else. Producer Frank Farian immediately saw potential, but opted for a sinister formula; they mimed to their own tunes. Skilled studio musicians and singers provided all vocals.The success was immediate and massive. But it was all a ticking bomb and as this documentary shows; Milli Vanilli became the scapegoat of the whole world.This documentary has similarities to many other films and documentaries about the pop industry; money rules everything.The documentary is painful to watch, the boys' rise ended in total disaster for them, both professionally and on a personal level. The people behind it, the producer and the record company escaped without a single scratch in the paintwork. The boys became the sinners who were put to the slaughter.Nevertheless, it is also a historical victory. It is possible to get back up even after being torn apart in public.I have the impression that their story is unfortunately not unique. How many pretty faces that we've dug the music for over the years are tricksters?The documentary at least corrects some of my impression of the duo. They were not without fault themselves, but paid an incredibly high price for a fraud that many powerful players were part of.",False
20,10,"Beautifully made doc about pop, fame, addiction, integrity, and redemption.",marktowns-927-421006,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am grateful that I got to learn about Fabrice's journey and his life today. I was one of the millions that bought the tapes and records and even begged my mom to drive me to Blockbuster to rent their music video VHS when it came out.The documentary does an incredible job of telling the story of those who are still around to tell it, and those who aren't. (Rest In Power, Rob) I learned a lot about how it started, and how it all blew up. The decisions people made in this story are their own, and the consequences are undeniable. It is beautiful to see how someone can choose a new path, forge forward, and even reconcile their past with their present. It is heartbreaking to see how addiction can totally consume a human being. (First the person takes the drink, and then the drink takes the person.)I was truly moved by this doc and am taking away way more than just trivia about a pop act that came out when I was in high school. Thank you to the filmmakers and thank you to Fabrice for telling us your story.",False
21,8,Needed some more people to be blamed,MajBlade2,n/a,16/08/2025,"The one thing you get from this even if they tried as hard as possible to portray rob and fab as the victims they were not at all until everything fell apart. I remember this very well and even at the time I'm like. ""So what they look good and the music is good, this is entertainment so enjoy"" But I also understand why people lost their minds when they realized they had not sung on their albums or in person. I think its because people like to believe that talent is natural and not a façade. But alot of people behind the scenes knew what was going on and no one but them really paid the price. 500000 records sold and Rob ended up on the streets and then dead. And we know someone or a whole bunch of people made a lot of money off them. And the true singers knew what they were doing they took the money to and stayed quiet until they wanted more money and the recognition. John Davis Brad Howell and Shaw all acted incensed but then they tried to cash in with Frank Farien right after MV downfall. Good documentary but they needed to get some more people on camera and twist some arms especially Farien who refused to talk.",False
22,9,Amazing and Heartbreaking cautionary tale,loolooland-81236,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched Girl You Know It's True, and, being a teenage girl in the late 80s early 90s, I remember how much I loved Milli Vanilli. I love their songs. I had a huge crush on Rob. I love their style. It was so out there and confident.I remember the scandal I remember the fallout. I remember the Grammys. I remember the original press conference. I remember the jokes. I remember feeling betrayed.I remember the news that Rob passed away from an overdose. I remember feeling sad about it.It's 30 years later, and I'm a lot older and wiser. What I felt as a teenager isn't what I feel as an adult. As a teenager, I felt betrayed.As an adult, I wept during both movies, particularly when you see how addiction and alcohol consumed Rob. I felt disgusted by how the music industry ingested and consumedboth of them. As an adult, I realize that's the way the world works.Watching Girl You Know It's True, lead me to this movie. I went in, knowing it was going to depress me. It did, but it also provided some . I really enjoyed hearing the story through a different lens.It's a sad story and a very human one. Fab does not paint Rob and himself as completely naïve or innocent. They're just two people who wanted to be famous and got caught up in a lie that couldn't be untold. When the lie became too big to hide, they were the sacrificial lambs. They were the face of the cover-up every bit as much as they were the face of the music.So many people lied and made so much money off of their image, and so many people left them to drown, without bothering to throw them a life preserver.I think the tragedy is in the scapegoating of two young men in their early 20s playing a very grown-up game of chess. There's literally no way than anyone involved in that album didn't know they were lip syncing.Interestingly, I probably would've still loved the songs without Rob and Fab, but they wouldn't have skyrocketed to fame. As a teenager, I didn't understand that what you see is not always reality.They were before Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok. They were before you could create an alternate reality for yourself online. They created reality for me as a teenager that made me so happy.They were so different from all the other people you saw. Ironically, a lot of it was their hair and Rob's beautiful green eyes. The music was catchy and amazing, but the performance factor was what skyrocketed them to success.Knowing their backstory, through this film, especially Rob's, explains so much to me as an adult. The basic human need to be loved and to feel like you belong can be so strong that it clouds your judgment, and sometimes, creates a void that can never be filled.As a teenager, I would've felt sympathy and possibly empathy had I known everything. However, at the time, there was no sympathy for them in the media. We were given the media version of the story and the record label's proclamation of how they knew nothing.So, I guess the more things change, the more they stay the same.Everyone who cashed in on these two for their own personal gain, got away completely unscathed and very wealthy. They abandoned the tools of their success.This movie paints a picture of two different men and two different paths after hitting rock-bottom. One, tragically, could not overcome addiction. The other plowed forward. Two friends, as close as brothers, who lost each other when the walls crumbled down upon them.I downloaded the album to my iPhone, after watching the movies. I've listened to it a lot lately.Ultimately, who cares if they were singing or not? Music back then was about creatingan experience, and they gave you that experience in spades.The craziest thing is I remember Rob having the stronger accent of the two. I remember thinking their English was not on point with the songs, that you had Roxette (and they had heavy accents).This particular film had a lot of live footage and Fab as the main narrator. Hearing him sing on stage was crazy.It sounded like the original song. It sounded like a lot of artists performing live without studio effects, being added to record the song itself.I realized, with experience and time, that the entertainment industry is predicated on both an illusion and a lie in which we all actively participate. These men didn't deserve what they got. The people who profited off of them didn't deserve the money they got. There's a lot of blame to go around for the debacle, and the majority of it should've been placed on the industry.I wish Rob were still here. It was a tragic and preventable death.Don't get me wrong. They fell into the trappings of fame and took an enormous risk. They knew what they were doing was wrong and that, eventually, they would be caught.However, they were so caught up in a whirlwind that no one could've predicted. It is sickening to realize how many people profited off of them and, ultimately, abandoned them.That's still very very much part of the ugly side of humanity.I'm glad Fab found peace in this life, and I hope Rob found peace in the next one.They'll be on my playlist. It's crazy to say that now because playlists didn't exist 30 years ago... I still love their songs, and I still see those videos in my head and smile about how happy they made me.",True
23,10,Great Documentary!!,ogechi_oa,n/a,16/08/2025,"The energy this documentary conveyed aligned with the emotions I'm sure Rob and felt! The director took the time to lay out the story well from beginning to end. I was engaged the whole time. Growing up during this time as a kid the only thing I ever knew about Milli Vanilli was that they did lip synch. Thank you for bringing visibility and truth to their story and how the industry preys on young, vulnerable creatives. They were great performers and Frank was a horrible individual. Blame it on the rain has such a symbolic meaning after watching this documentary and listening to Fab sing it at the end.",False
24,9,A tragic cautionary tale hopefully not repeated,Avwillfan89,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an incredibly sad story about the evils of the music industry, and how human life is disposable as long as there is money to be made.People lip-sync all the time. It's not a big deal. What Milli Vanilli were accused of in the press was overtly dramatised and unfair. Sure they were naive and impulsive to not read their contracts, but the man behind all of this, Frank Farian, got off absolutely scot free, while Rob and Fab payed the ultimate price, simply because they were the face of the product. While Fab was able to bounce back, start a family and re-ignite his career as a solo artist, Rob descended into horrific drug addiction, getting arrested several times, and ultimately passing away due to an overdose.The worst thing about this is that Rob and Fab actually COULD sing and rap. They just weren't allowed to. And despite Rob and Fab arguably not being able to speak much English at the beginning, that could have been been easily arranged. They could have sung in German, made some money, and then worked on their English and released an accessible album for all and still be successful.There have been many instances where artists were not allowed to sing on their own tracks and were just put there for show because they 'looked good'. (English R&B girl band The Honeyz being one) Human artists were seen as products. And because they they were not what they appeared, the public took it out the product. This was one of the most famous examples of greedy studios using artists as puppets for their own gain. Yet it still happens in various different ways to this day.",True
25,9,A must see,alexkzapf,n/a,16/08/2025,What an incredible documentary. Love their music. They had a lot of hits and were world famous. It was about time that the true villains were exposed. They made millions of Rob and Fab. And when the you know what hit the fan. They threw them under the bus. Their songs I still listen to today. It is so disheartening to see this played out in front of you. When you think now at days most so called artists use auto tunes and all other types of techniques it is laughable that those two were so vilified when they were put into a situation that was hard to avoid. Yes they made choices but. If you watch this you will see they were deceived from the beginning.,False

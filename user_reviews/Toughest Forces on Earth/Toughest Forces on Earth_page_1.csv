1,7,Ranger did his best,bosskeith,n/a,16/08/2025,"SBS Soldier was clearly leagues above his American brothers. I'm sure they would agree. That's not any slight on the U. S SF. They had skills, not Sbs level skills though. The foreign forces all recognised it. When they trained overseas you could tell they were honoured to see these legendary operators without it being followed by there last breath. It helped to have the ex seal explaining the operation. It was a good idea as a series, when it came to leadership quality. Combat skills, technical ability or the ability to operate under pressure it was interesting to see how each branch of these forces reacted. Make your own evaluation but for me the SBS operator quietly impressed.",False
2,n/a,a first one,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came across this Neflix show by accident, since I am not a subscriber, it was mentioned in a local paper, that our very own Austrian Special Forces ""Jagdkommando"" are featured in an episode (the alpine one).I don't know if this is on purpose, but the chemistry of the three former operators makes quite some fun TV. Dean from SBS is the silent/quiet professional, Cameron the Ranger is the allrounder and a fair bit younger than the other two. Ryan, a former US Navy SEAL comes off a bit loud and over-confident at first, but even he fits in nicely.Of course they could not go on real missions, but the couple of days of specialized training were depicted fine and the final missions usually went well. We get to see all environments imaginable, from the Desert, to Jungles and the Arctic.If there's a second season, I'd love to see the Jagdkommandos Swiss equivalent, AAD24 or the German KSK in the mix, maybe the SF of Denmark and the Royal Thai Navy SEALs too. Good on you producers, it's not award winning TV, but at 40 minutes per episode it does it's job of entertaining and giving some insight, without offering up any op-sec relevant information.",False
3,8,"A Riveting, Heart-pumping Docuseries, Amazing Narration",samabc-31952,n/a,16/08/2025,"A thrilling ride! This docuseries is an 'adrenaline-packed, visceral journey' (Ref: John Doe) that delves into the world of elite military and law enforcement units, showcasing their remarkable skills and unwavering dedication. I am still reeling from the experience.Join the three veteran special forces operatives as they embark on a globe-trotting adventure training and conducting exercises with the world's most secretive and elite forces. From the scorching deserts of Jordan to the swamps of Malaysia to the frozen tundras of Sweden, each episode showcases a unique challenge, highlighting the distinct skills and expertise of these forces. Whether it's a grueling ruck march with the Jordanian Armed Forces, an intense marksmanship training with the Colombian National Police, or a daring parachute jump with the Swedish Armed Forces, the hosts are pushed to their limits in every episode. It also features heart-pumping raids, simulated jungle patrols, and underwater rescue missions, showcasing the bravery and camaraderie of the team of these veterans.What sets this series apart is its raw, unfiltered look at the camaraderie and banter between the hosts, which adds a relatable and human touch to the grueling training exercises (Ref : John Smith). The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the beauty and intensity of each location in stunning detail. The narration is equally impressive, providing context and insight into the world of special forces operations.This is a testament of human endurance, unrelenting courage and determination and a reminder that even in the toughest of times, there's always a way forward. A MUST watch.",False
4,8,Better than Anticipated,jamespg023,n/a,16/08/2025,"I gotta be honest, This show did a lot better than I expected. After the first episode, everything comes together regarding learning the ways of other special forces throughout the world. The first episode felt basic. We kinda just followed the guys and watched them do missions that seemed awfully normal to them. But after that, going to Mexico, Columbia, Austria etc, we watched the guys actually get embedded with instructors and trainees throughout the world. And after finding out, this is from the same makers as Worlds Toughest Prisons, I got to appreciate more of what I watched. If there's a second season, I'd love to see other units they train with. It it feels like a Netflix spin off of the OG Surviving the Cut. But in a more relaxed state. We'll see, Hopefully they get a second season that would be cool.",False
5,9,Good Insights into Foreign Special Forces,dctrainer,n/a,16/08/2025,"The best aspects of these episodes involve the extreme environments and specific problems other SF units have to deal with. It's also interesting to see the specialized equipment they've come up with to deal with their specific missions, climate and geography, which can be quite different from what US audiences are accustomed to from watching both documentary coverage of various US Spec Ops units, as well drama series like ""SEAL Team"" and similar shows. Some of the pretend 'missions' the three series regulars carry out have an obviously scripted and overly staged feel to them, probably due to time constraints, but this doesn't detract from the overall effect of the series. Every episode contains some new or useful information about effective SF units, their equipment, doctrine and training.",False

1,6,Corrupt Society,kermithh,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI know very little about Argentina, I'm Swedish. The documentary was pretty good but what hits me is how corrupt it is. It's absurd that the murderers and their accomplices were sentenced to life in prison without parole but just a couple of years later they would be released because of a ""new"" law. One of them also got a free education behind bars. Justice is pretty flexible, depending on where you live and who you are. Scary and an insult to the victims family. I'm really sorry for their loss and if that wasn't enough they even have to witness the criminals walking the streets like nothing happened.",True
2,7,An intriguing true-crime doc that's worth a watch! [+68%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Alejandro Hartmann's latest true-crime documentary for Netflix takes you deep into the conspiracy and murder of photojournalist Jos√© Luis Cabezas. I loved the no-nonsense approach employed by the makers, especially since this was a case with several powerful entities involved. The investigation behind the murder branches out into two specific, carefully crafted routes - both of which converge at a particular juncture - making you realize that no time was spent unnecessarily theorizing or making vague, attention-grabbing statements. The makers also interview the ones who worked with the victim and several others in the journalism fraternity, telling us how this incident shaped the decisions of Argentine society as a whole in the late '90s. One can call this piece a political investigative murder mystery where the plotting overshadows the vile nature of the crime. Definitely worth a watch if you're into true-crime documentaries!",False
3,6,Where there's smoke...,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"A confusing and winding documentary, mainly because the case was confusing and twisted around in the police and politics. Documentary does a good job of trying to piece it together and sort out facts.",False
4,9,Documentary for Argentinians,franciscoinchau,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's difficult to understand if you are from other country. Some political characters, locations, and historical situations are not easy to understand if you don't know all the background.I'm from Pinamar the central city in this story, I really enjoyed this documentary because I didn't know a lot of things about this crime. I'm from 1993 so I was a children when this happened. Now I can understand the situation better, the documentary is really objective with the information.I'll recommend it.",False
5,2,Not done in a way that maintains interest,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though this is a film, even though this is about a tragic series of events, I was bored by it. It involves the murder of a journalist, and the attempt to cover up the murder by the political elite of Argentina. The only interesting aspect of it is the fact that there is a segment where they do man and woman on the street interviews and ask passers-by what they think of this investigation - and many of them say that it's all fabrication it's an attempt at making news entertaining - and then shortly after a number of people were convicted in the journalist murder. So I guess the moral is being careful of what you answer to local news reporters because you probably do not know the ins and outs of different cases.",False
6,1,English or NOTHING!!!,billhess-62217,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why, oh why, do producers think those of us watching the English language versions of these want to hear the native language in the background. It's infuriating! I refuse to watch any programs that do this. They should all be thrown into a room and forced to listen to Madonna songs for fifteen hours with some random person speaking Arabic in the background, not loud enough to overwhelm The Virgin's horrible voice but just loud enough to annoy the crap out of you.",False

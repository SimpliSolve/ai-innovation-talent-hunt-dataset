1,7,Thumbs Up from a Former Band Geek,chelmold,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at Sundance. It's a compelling underdog story that follows kids at a less than well funded high school in the Rio Grande Valley on their journey to make it to Mariachi State Finals in Texas. There are two other schools also featured, but mainly it follows the kids at Edinburg North.I think anyone who was any kind of band geek or who competed in anything in high school could enjoy this as a walk down memory lane, but through the lens of mariachi competition - a thing I did not know existed until I bought these tickets. The editing keeps it interesting and shows parts of the kids' lives outside of band practice, particularly some of the seniors.",False
2,9,A Sweet Endearing Documentary about High School Mariachi Competitors,JustCuriosity,n/a,16/08/2025,"Going Varsity in Mariachi was lovingly welcomed in its Texas Premiere at the SXSW Film Festival. This is the story of kids from a poor community trying to find themselves in a musical form that epitomizes their Hispanic heritage. They are also using it as an opportunity to escape poverty and access higher education. Folks in the theater were tearing up as they watched this beautiful film.The story is a simple one and sometimes those make the best films. As an educator, I loved the hard work and dedication of their teacher. The students faced a variety of challenges that are typical of young people - mostly seniors - trying to find their place in the world. They are struggling to prioritize as they transition from children to young adults. The film takes us through their year of struggles and Mariachi competitions with all of its ups-and-downs. Sometimes simple straight-forward stories are the best. This is a very enjoyable film that tells an uplifting tale of education in Texas at a time when public education and educators are under attack. Highly recommended.",False
3,9,Jealous of the Passion,tomcshane,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was very well put together. There was never a dull moment.I was an orchestra geek in high school, so it has my full attention, and it touched me deeply.As a white American, I never had the opportunity to be so passionately connected to a culture that is mine. I feel that the culture these kids shared drove them to work hard and gain so much talent. I still fell more in love with Mariachi thru this film.My review needs 600 characters, but there's not much else for me to say, except that I think it would be great to see an Oscar nomination for this film. Maybe just my own sentiments.",False

5,5,Good Concept but it Was Okay,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.""Going Varsity in Mariachi"" is a documentary about in world high school mariachi, musicians from South Texas reigns supreme. Under guidance of coach Abel Acu√±a, the captains of Edinburg North High School team must turn shoestring and diverse inexperienced musicians into state champions. As a whole, the film does have some interesting aspects about kids following their dreams for being part of the Mariachi Band and Finals but it was pretty basic and alright for one watch.The interviews provided were genuinely interesting as you get to hear from the perspectives of band geeks and people who enjoy music. Most of the editing and direction was pretty good but the information I wish could have bee explored a little more as there were some cool concepts that didn't dive deeply as I hoped for.Overall good for one watch.Rating: C+",False

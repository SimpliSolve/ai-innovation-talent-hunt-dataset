1,9,good overview of a musical life well lived,musicglenn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGoing into this, I didn't know a lot about Max Roach. I was quite amazed at the variety of approaches he explored with music over his decades. From be-bop pioneer in the 50's, to one of the foremost musical activists (with his wife Abbey Lincoln) of the 60's, to a Umass music prof and founder of the innovative M'Boom Percussion Ensemble in the 70's, to a pioneer in mixing live drumming with early hip-hop in the 80's, to later experiments with theatre and dance troupes in the 90's and 00's. A well-presented overview, with clips of interviews from people who knew him, mostly musicians and family. He lived large, and the world is better for it. There is also a clip of him in some African country at a ceremonial site, drumming with local drummers - not sure where that was, but i'd like to find out.",True

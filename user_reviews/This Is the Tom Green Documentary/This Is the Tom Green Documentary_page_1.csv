1,8,Hilarious and heartwarming!,imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you ever were a Tom Green fan this documentary about himself, directed and written by himself is definitely great fun to watch.It's somehow really heartwarming as well, because Tom (however idiotic he might be), Tom had a dream to become as famous as David Letterman and although he didnt reach THAT kind of stardom, he did get to host the David Letterman Show and he did get to hear from so many people in the entertainment industry that he was their inspiration, like JackAss and Joe Rogan!If for some reason (being young) you never heard of Tom Green you gonna have a good time watching it as well and look up some old shows of him on Youtube because this man sat comedy on fire back in the nineties!What a guy! What an incredible journey into comedy. And he is still rockin' till this very day, now living in his homecountry Canada, but still performing live, at which he excells!",False
2,10,"Tom Green's Chaos, Reconsidered",steffenhoffmann,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Tom Green Show Documentary isn't just nostalgia. It's a quiet revelation.Through home videos, candid interviews, and Green's own narration, the film peels back the layers of a man best known for 90s cringe.What emerges is a portrait of an artist who turned absurdity into a vision and walked away to let the world catch up.There's warmth in the way Green reflects, decades later. Archival clips take on new depth when framed by his current life. At his breathtakingly beautiful cabin. Reflecting with his parents.The film argues, gently but persuasively, that beneath the intentional stupidity hides a sharp comic genius. One that shaped everything from Jackass to modern Late Night Shows to TikTok prank culture.What sticks isn't the absurde clips. Though some still made laugh. It's the storytelling. In quieter moments. Being at Letterman. Getting older. Cancer survival. Burnout. He reveals a vulnerability that reframes his legacy. You're left marveling not at how wild he once was. But how human he's always been.",False
3,10,THE O.G.,labellav,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow! I remember being a kid and seeing Tom Green and just being in awe of all the crazy things he did. This documentary just proves he was ahead of his time. And finally seeing the overdue recognition he deserves. Co-signed by the biggest people that are doing what he has done, after and now. It's amazing how time has passed and you sometimes ""forget"" these pioneers. I'm glad it came across my screen on Prime to see and be like ""Ah! He was very that"" and all the nostalgia that comes with it! It is definitely a good watch! I rarely make reviews but, I had to for someone that graced my TV screen often as a kid! Realizing it's literally what everyone has been doing for years now on the Web. But just to know now he basically started it all! Lol Best wishes in all Tom!",False
4,10,Makes me remember why we all loved Tom Green,Not_a_Movie_Buff,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary on Tom Green was so good. I started watching it as background noise, but found myself glued to the screen within the first fifteen minutes of the show. Tom takes us all the way to the very beginning of his career and gives you back all those feels you had when you watched The Tom Green Show as a teen. (Talk about some nostalgia!) I laughed out loud and I got choked up. I loved how he went through what happened with the show and why he is the way he is now - and it made me appreciate him even more. A must watch for anyone who loved Tom in the 90s and can relate to the process of growing up and going through life.",False
5,10,Finally someone puts a spotlight on this show!,kruss-37266,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Tom Green show was a pivotal aspect to my childhood and developing my sense of humor, so I was thrilled when amazon announced they were making a documentary about it. This show had such a big impact on comedy and prank humor that I can't believe it's not highlighted or talked about more in this day and age. We would not have jackass without this man. It seems like the general public is completely unaware this show existed or the impact it had, and I can happily say Amazon did Tom Green justice with this documentary. I had no idea that it started out on public access tv and it was amazing to see his journey bringing it to a major network. It had me laughing hysterically at the old skits and even brought me to tears at one point. Tom Green was such an important figure in comedy and it's a shame he doesn't get the acknowledgment he deserves. He is far too humble to boasts his contribution, so I'm glad Amazon put some much needed spotlight on him. If you're a fan of comedy, prank humor, or reality TV this is a must watch.",False
6,10,What a life,HypnoticPoison7,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not sure I would have heard about this documentary coming out if Tom hadn't appeared on Useless Farms playing Stan's piano, so thank you to Amanda and her chat for letting me know this happened!As a loser kid without much going on, the Tom Green show changed my life. I remember seeing it on Canadian TV before it hit MTV and being so proud that Tom made it big. His show really started my interest in comedy and made bad days much better. I remember emailing Glenn after Tom gave out his email on the show, though Glenn rudely never responded, but I kept trying. Tom Green influenced so many artists and art forms that he was a true underappreciated gift. You almost forget without this documentary to remind you. Eminem absolutely wouldn't have been as famous without Tom Green. Being from Detroit, I'm not so proud of that part.This documentary actually somehow made ME feel special for being allowed to grow up with this guy and be influenced by him. He helped shape the content I consume and how lucky am I that he could be such a creative genius. It's almost magical how naturally funny he is. I feel ashamed to say I've sort of forgotten about that time in my life and him as a result, but that's a mistake because he's definitely part of why I'm still alive. We're nothing without comedy and somehow Tom Green is one of few people to understand that and do something about it. I'm so jealous he gets to live on a beautiful farm now, even if it's in cold Canada. I have to go, I'm about to check out his stand up special now.",False
7,5,He's Still Annoying,arfdawg-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Plot:
From outrageous stunts to a life-changing cancer battle and his decision to trade Hollywood for an Ottawa farm, this is Tom Green like never before. Follow the comedy legend through his most personal moments as he navigates fame, faces illness, and embraces a quieter, more grounded life.I loved Green's MTV show in the 90's, but then the 90's was twenty some years ago and Howard Stern was the King of Radio. Times change.I've watch Greens later stuff and as I got older I started to think he's got some sort of OCD. He's manic and repeats himself over and over. I also noticed in this doc that when he says hello to old friends, he holds his arms out tentatively for a hug as if they might not hug back.It's not a bad documentary and there are some interesting parts, but the 90's are gone and Tom's personality is sort of annoying these days and not in a funny way.",False
8,9,Never Liked Him - Until Now,snabbs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Years and years ago when he jumped onto the scene I found him to be funny but too silly for my liking. I watched other movies and followed different comedians. But I found the house swap from the big city to the ranch intriguing.I am SO happy I gave it a chance. His parents are endearing and he is a level headed really good dude who has a good story that I didn't know, but I do now, needed to be told.I don't want to give anything away. Just watch it. He is living his best life now. Something we should all aspire to.If you would have told my younger self I would one day tear up at the end of a Tom Green production I would have called you crazy.",False
9,9,Groundbreaker,calgaryerin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Back when I was a teenager, my brother lived in Ontario, and I was out in Alberta. He'd send me VHS tapes of The Tom Green Show, and honestly, it felt like I was being let in on this weird, underground comedy scene before anyone else even knew it existed. At the time, there was nothing like it on TV-this completely absurd, off-the-wall humor that felt totally unfiltered and unpredictable. I'd invite my friends over, and we'd sit in my basement watching these tapes, laughing until we couldn't breathe. It felt like we were in on this incredible secret that nobody else around us knew about. Watching Tom Green push every boundary felt rebellious, chaotic, and honestly kind of genius. It's wild to think about now, knowing how much his style shaped comedy later on, but back then, it was like having a front-row seat to something revolutionary before anyone realized it.What's remarkable is how far ahead of his time he was. Today, prank culture and shock comedy are everywhere, from YouTube influencers to viral TikTok skits. But in the '90s, Tom Green was doing it without the wide reach of the internet etc... He was putting himself out there in front of live audiences, critics, and a world that wasn't quite ready for his brand of chaos.I think his ideas and work was absorbed and repackaged by the American entertainment machine. Tom Green's innovations were adopted and amplified by American creators, often without the recognition he deserved. The rise of ""Jackass,"" for example, took the absurdist, risk-taking humor Green pioneered and mainstreamed it, but with little acknowledgment of where that DNA came from. It's a familiar pattern: Canadian talent and creativity often serve as the wellspring for ideas that Americans make their own, leaving the original creators overlooked or erased from the narrative.Overall it's a sweet little documentary, and worth watching.",False
10,10,Memories...,b4blue,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember watching clips from the show and occasionally I would find a whole episode. People were divided between liking Tom Green and Andy Dick show. For me as an introvert it felt liberating to see him make fun of human behavior and authority. I loved how he pranked his parents, because they are the most calm and loving people. There was never any over the top reaction from them, like with Bam Margera's parents. Of course, most of the studio interaction was trash but it was sprinkled with sketches which many of them were brilliant. Freddy got fingered is one of the craziest comedies of all time.",False
11,10,Tom Green's Legacy Shines in the Nostalgic Documentary,seantajipour,n/a,16/08/2025,"In This Is The Tom Green Documentary, the Amazon Original dives into the chaotic, hilarious, and deeply innovative career of a man who redefined comedy for a generation. This nostalgic time capsule takes viewers back to an era of absurdity in entertainment. Boundary-pushing antics were dominant. No one did it better than Tom Green.For anyone who lived through his heyday or for those curious about the origins of modern comedy's wild streak, This Is The Tom Green Documentary is an absolute must-watch. Tom Green hasn't just inspired a generation-he continues to be a beacon for those unafraid to push boundaries.",False
12,10,Not just a joker,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - I only knew Tom Green from his show ... well and a few movies I watched. I think I was one of the few who watched his failed movie 20 years ago - I don't think I liked it to be honest. But you can't fault the guy for trying.As it seems - he has shaped a lot of people ... like Joe Rogan ... or even Jackass the show that came after his show was off the air (due to his health issues). Who would have thought? I am not sure everything worked out in a nice or good way ... but he had an eye for things and he kind of could feel where entertainment would be going ... he sort of had the first podcast .. he called it something else of course.A very engaging and a very honest look behind the scenes. Tom Green bares it all (no we do not see his ... well the area where he had to do surgery). Even when he was sick - he was joking ... the scene at the dinner/restaurant ... poor waitress ... but her completely shallow remark made it comedy gold too ... so there is that.I did not know most of the things revealed here ... I was not too fond of him making fun of his parents, but they were kind of in on the gag I reckon. More than worth a watch I'd say.",False
13,10,Thank you Tom Green for being a pioneer,Lolarobot,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tom, you and I are exactly the same age, and I remember watching you as a young lady doing your pranks, and I didn't realize now that you were such a pioneer. Thank you so much for doing this documentary. It really highlighted everything you actually had done in the past with your TV shows and your movies. Very few people like you come along in this world and I very much appreciate everything you've done. I like that you had your parents on and that you showed your entire life and your current life and everything you've done. It really shown a light on why you are such a genius. Personally for me, I loved your pranks and your man on the street and I absolutely loved you and that Canadian laugh out loud show. When you said grilled cheese sandwich like 100 times, I peed my pants thank you for being you.",False
14,10,What can I say..,Oojamaflip88,n/a,16/08/2025,"A pure delight to watch this, seeing Tom's journey, it's no small thing to show this kind of vulnerability to the world, so beautiful. I cried and I laughed and smiled. So wholesome, what more is there to say.There's a sense of tension in the world since the lockdowns. It's palpable, no wonder he needed to come home to the roost. He conquered Hollywood, he has been a pivotal innovator, and yet he knows what's more important than any of that and that's 'home'.Looking back to his career, id say some of my favourite points were his supermarket tannoy skits and his skateboarding, I wonder who followed in his footsteps..cky, Jackass, umm maybe everyone!!",False

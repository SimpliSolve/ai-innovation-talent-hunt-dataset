1,10,Lovely & relaxing documentary,haggisLover,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this movie was like a breath of fresh air for the mind. You get to see beautiful pictures and also learn something about crows and ravens, which is immensely relaxing and also necessary, I believe, in turbulent times like these.Also, compared to the ever blander movie franchises like Star Wars and many of the newer Marvel movies, I did not leave the cinema disappointed nor wanting my money and my time back - on the contrary.This is a movie for young and old, because every one can learn something from it and afterwards you might look around and observe your surroundings a little bit more.Definitely recommend it.",False

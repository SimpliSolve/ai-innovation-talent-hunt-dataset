1,8,"Fascinating and informative, but sometimes frustrating",richard-1787,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this last night on Netflix, and found it often fascinating and informative, but sometimes frustrating, leaving me wanting to know more about Mitchell's views on certain films.Basically, the issue here is that the film maker has decided that he wants to cover a LOT of Black films, which forces him to deal with some of them very quickly. One of the seven previous viewers attributes this to a desire on Mitchell's part to show off how many Black films he has seen, but that was not my impression. Rather, it's clear that he is fascinated with a lot of these movies, and intent on sharing his fascination and knowledge with us. That's hard to do in a movie, though, unlike in a book. Mitchell might have thought about doing what Ken Burns has done with some of his documentaries: focus on the most telling things in the movies themselves, and then provide the rest of the information in an accompanying picture book.Books are good for annotated lists. Movies, not so much.On the hand, because Mitchell sometimes seems like he is trying to be encyclopedic, some of the seven previous reviewers have criticized him for leaving out X or Y Black film or star. A few have a point, but others didn't pay attention. One complained that Mitchell left out James Brown, for example, which is not true. There is a very striking scene of Brown standing shirtless in a doorway, in all the glory of his virile, muscular, and very angry masculinity. It would have been nice to learn if he was offered roles other than those, but that would have taken more time than Mitchell had in this movie.The same is true of some of the other previous criticism. Those viewers just didn't watch closely enough.My take on this is that it was interesting for what it offered, but that it often left me wishing for more than just a tidbit on a given interesting movie. So, I guess, I would have preferred less encyclopedic coverage and more in-depth analysis of fewer movies.On the other hand, I don't regret having seen any of what I saw.Mitchell clearly knows this material. He should definitely treat us to an accompanying illustrated book, where he is not limited by time.",False
2,6,Not Bad But Inaccuracies Abound,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,15/08/2025,"There's a lot of truths in here, but an awful lot of assumptions made, which is supposed to be the antithesis of this.Lady Sings The Blues- I was young when my mom took me to see this in the theater. I was 8, but I was told this was an important movie of an historical figure that needed to be implanted into my young mind. I honestly don't recall the makeup of the audience but I do remember the seats being packed, and being angry at the end. My mother explained to me how important Billie was to music today, and how awful humanity can be to one another.That's a pretty heavy message to lay on an 8-year olds head, but the message was not lost on me. My point is, not every white person was avoiding important black films and during the 70s, racism was being addressed and a lot of white people were horrified. Growing up in and around Madison, WI, there were quite a few black children in my class, and it honestly never occurred to me that they were anything other than classmates, and some were my friends.As I grew, things like Roots, Blazing Saddles, Mahogany, Car Wash and stealing listens to my dad's Pryor and Red Foxx albums dot my youth and it wasn't ever presented as anything other than entertainment- my parents weren't 'white knighting' for black culture,!there was just pop culture and skin color had nothing to do with it.Now, make no mistake, I'm certainly not saying there was no racism, no ignorance, stupidity, but not everyone was a racist hilljack from Alabama- it just didn't occur to us to judge anyone by anything other than their character and fortitude.I find it a little odd that there's not a single reference to Roots- how does one discuss black film and dismiss out of hand this important contribution? I remember being a teen and seeing Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder in a few buddy movies, along with Gregory Hines and Billy Crystal- there was significant overlap in racial viewing, and bands mentioned like EWF, along with other funk bands like Commodores, Sly and the Family Stone, Rick James, etc that had soaring success with as many white fans as black.It's ironic that Poitier declined to be interviewed for this, and speaks volumes when the producers list includes conspicuously white names like Steven Soderbergh and David Fincher. I'm not sure what purpose is served by this doc, and what the intended consequences are- there's no amount of revisiting the issues that will change the outcomes, and the outcomes intended here aren't necessarily that of truthfulness, either. Billy Dee Williams had a significant impact on the genre of film, as did Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, the list goes on and on.",False
3,8,Outstanding documentary on the golden era of black film making,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Is That Black Enough For You?!?"" (2022 release; 135 min) opens, the voiceover (from director Elvis Mitchell) observes how his grandma was influenced by the movies she saw, and how it led to the golden era of black film making 1968 to 1978. Talking heads like Lawrence Fishburne, Harry Belafonte and Whoopi Goldberg offer their perspectives, and a wistful Mitchell asks ""Why did these pictures stopped getting made?"" At this point we are 10 min into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of longtime writer, producer and film critic (including at one point for the New York Times) Eric Mitchell. Here he fondly looks back to the golden years of black film making, which he identifies as 1968 to 1978. And ""film making"" is to be understood in a broad sense: not just actors, but also producers and directors and anyone else involved directly and indirectly. Everyone knows of the phenom that was ""Shaft"" but as Mitchell demonstrates, there were so many other noteworthy black films in that era, many of which were made outside of the Hollywood studio system and hence never seen by most of us, including many of the so-called blaxploitation movies (""blaxploitation is the commoditization of blackness"", observes one of the talking heads). The works of Gordon Banks and Melvin Van Peebles get extensive attention, and along the way we get dozens and dozens of movie clips, one better/more intriguing than the other. It leads one (or at least me) to want to see these movies. It was amazing for me how quickly these 2 hrs. And 15 min came and went, and a genuine pleasure to watch this from start to finish. Last but not least, in the movie's opening credits, the title is showing as ""Is That Black Enough For You?!? How One Decade Forever Changed the Movies (And Me)"".""Is That Black Enough For You?!?"" premiered in early October at the new York Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim, and it is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. If you have any interest in a slice of movie history which most of us know very little about, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,6,Excessive focus on pre-2000 black films!!,li0904426,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie 'Is That Black Enough for You?!?' is a provocative documentary that examines the history of black representation in American cinema. The documentary is narrated, directed, and written by Elvis Mitchell and it sheds light on the groundbreaking blaxploitation movies of the 70s. Numerous black actors, directors, and writers have shared their experiences, challenges, and struggles in the white-dominated world of Hollywood.The documentary delves deep enough to uncover marginalized black films intended for black audiences that have gone unnoticed by the media and the general public.The movie's editing becomes unsteady when it jumps back and forth in time, with testimonials that elongate the script. The script also places a heavy emphasis on black films prior to 2000, leaving the film feeling incomplete or as if it is anticipating a sequel.",False
5,8,The Blaxploitation Treatment,judas-55637,n/a,15/08/2025,"If been an on and off listener (if I find the guest interesting) of The Treatment for way over a decade by now. So for a long time I've been aware that Elvis Mitchell is a very smart and thoughtful person. When I found out Mitchell did a documentary on Black Cinema I instantly watched it.The documentary mainly focuses on Blaxploitation movies of the 1970s, basically 1968-76, the introductory bit deals with movies before that time. Killer of Sheep and Symbiopsychotaxiplasm get special non-Blaxploitation mentions. I'm not sure I heard Blaxploitation discussed from an afro-american perspective before, certainly not to this extend. Like most people of my generation I learned of these films first from Tarantino. Who as Mitchell points out here got his start by putting dialogues common in black films into the mouth of his white actors. Which, as much as you might dislike that take, is true. And yes you want so say: But, Samuel L. Jackson... and I tell you: he is not in Reservoir Dogs. Now, is he? He is in this documentary though.Mitchell make quite a number of other interesting point throughout, highlights some of the forgotten pioneers and gives you a good overview of the film of that time. Unless you are easily offended by black view points and you are interested in movies, this is way worth your time. Does it at times makes points I disagree with. Sure, but I am an adult, I don't need people to agree with me 100% to find it interesting what they have to say. And yes sure it could have talked about more or other movies, but it already crammed a lot into it's run time.Ps. I read in another review here that is very telling that Sidney Poitier wasn't interviewed for this. No, it isn't. Poitier already quite sick by that time, do your f--ing research. Do you really think Poitier was not aware of the things Mitchell says about his career? I'm a white European and I was aware of them beforehand. Also, if you want to know why Roots isn't discussed, because this is about movies not TV.",False
6,7,MANY ARE MISSING,dasilentpardner-65037,n/a,15/08/2025,"From Bill 'Bogangles' Robinson to Louis Gossett Jr. To Marlene Warfield to Denzel Washington (!), there are quite a number of major artists and performances missing. Yaphet Kotto is mentioned once, but his best performances ('Bone,' 'Report to the Commissioner,' 'Blue Collar') are not seen. Pearl Bailey is never mentioned and Redd Foxx is seen for 2 seconds. You would likely never know that Jim Brown and Fred Williamson were, in the 1970's, supreme sex symbol icons as well as icons of masculinity. Cicely Tyson's storied career is distilled to her Oscar nod for 'Sounder' and an appearance in one other film. Spike Lee's films (even his early work) gets glossed over. So, yes, I have some problems with it. However, I must admit that it is an admirable and sophisticated try. Should've been 3 hours long and they should've allowed the film clips to breath a bit more. A nice primer to whet the appetite of the film student. The initiated will find a number of cinematic holes and missed opportunities.",False
7,10,Encyclopedic Brilliance,antoniomcafee,n/a,15/08/2025,"A brilliant encyclopedic survey of black cinema. The interviews are revealing and entertaining. There is a lot that is covered and it is organized well. I will be referring to this documentary repeatedly to watch films I haven't seen and never heard of. This film coupled with the black horror film documentary ""Horror Noir"" will feed the curious mind, enthralled by black cinema and its progression.One of the more unexpected aspects is it's inclusion of experimental films, from animation to split screen. There is minimal focus on this but it does highlight ambitious storytelling and filmmakers responses to a restrictive system.",False
8,7,"Interesting, Informative but misrepresentations abound",Musicianmagic,n/a,15/08/2025,"This does cover black cinema from really the 1930's to 1980's. Everything outside of that is an afterthought at most.Unfortunately, there are two major problems with this documentary. First is it skips over a lot. If not completely skipping it only skims the surface of those films, performers and filmmakers. Some of which it can be argued are more important that a lot that was included. Often they opted to cover & present as more influential fairly obscure films (never even released on DVD) rather than more successful films. Still what it did cover was entertaining.Second, it made it sound like much of black cinema especially the 1960's to 1980's was only for black film goers. Some of these movies were successful because they also reached a white or other audience. Movies like Shaft, Coffey & others they mentioned were simply excellent movies with excellent performances, period. Funny they kind of mention that Motown music was only for black audience. Ridiculous. Even the Beatles recorded a couple of Motown songs.I will rate this 7 out of 10, mainly for being entertaining. Plus I did learn about some films I've never heard of.",False
9,10,A magnificent and beautiful history lesson of black film and it's influences and impact,moony1983,n/a,15/08/2025,"You sometimes have to sit back and surrender to what you are watching as it will take you to that magnificent place so many films promise to. I watched this with a reverence that I cannot remember experiencing for a long time when sat in front of a screen. It somehow manages to package and explain the impacts of black film in 2 hours without making it reductive. So many important landmarks are recognised for their contribution to wider popular cinema and preserved for a younger generation. It's a great documentary on the origins and impact of blaxploitation films. If you are a student of cinema this is absolutely one to watch, if you are a student of black history this is absolutely one to treasure.I will watch this again and again over the years.So beautiful and majestic, it really is hard to put into words how great this film is.",False
10,10,A GREAT VISUAL RESEARCH PROJECT...!,masonfisk,n/a,15/08/2025,"A current documentary airing on Netflix from former New York Times film critic, Elvis Mitchell (who I saw about 20 years ago when he moderated a screening of American Psycho at the Brooklyn Academy of Music). Using the blaxploitation movement of the 1970's as an entry into his thesis, using coping clips & interviews of the actors of the period (sadly many are archival since may have passed) where it was a ripe time to see black faces on the screen (albeit in various degrees of quality) which has not been seen, in this vast capacity, since. If you've never delved into the movement a lot of the films are great fun & some may even achieve the status of art (my favorite of the period is still Trouble Man starring Robert Hooks w/a score by Marvin Gaye) so what are you waiting for?",False
11,5,"Starts out interesting, but eventually peters out...",imseeg,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary starts out interesting with lots of historic facts about the earliest black movies that were made, with lots of interesting interviews by big Hollywood names like Samuel L Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, Harry Bellafonte and Sidney Poitier.The bad: but after an hour this documentary veers of into all sorts of directions, becoming disjointed and long in the tooth.It is as if this director simply had no control over his urge to namedrop as many film classics as possible and then start analysing what was wrong with them.Recommended watch for the first hour, but I fear not many will stay focussed till the very end, because this documentary unfortunately peters out after the first hour.",False
12,8,Hollywood Owes Us More: Is That Black Enough for You?!? Breaks It All Down,mindovermatter520,n/a,15/08/2025,"Is That Black Enough for You?!? Is a sharp, necessary deep dive into the history of Black cinema, specifically the seismic shift that happened in the late '60s and '70s. Directed and narrated by Elvis Mitchell, the film isn't just a documentary - it's a cultural critique, a love letter to Black artistry, and a long-overdue reckoning with Hollywood's treatment of Black creators.Mitchell breaks down how Black filmmakers and actors fought to define themselves on screen, pushing past racist tropes and reclaiming space in an industry that never wanted to give them a real seat at the table. He doesn't just highlight classics - he contextualizes them, showing how these films weren't just entertainment but acts of defiance and self-determination. And the archival footage? Incredible. The interviews? Stacked. When you've got Samuel L. Jackson, Laurence Fishburne, and Whoopi Goldberg weighing in, you know it's legit.Beyond the history, what makes this film so powerful is how it connects the dots to today. Hollywood still sidelines Black voices, still erases contributions, still acts like representation is a trend rather than a necessity. Mitchell makes it clear that these battles aren't new, and that's what makes this documentary so frustrating-but also so important.If you care about film, Black culture, or just understanding why things are the way they are in Hollywood, Is That Black Enough for You?!? Is essential. It's eye-opening, validating, and at times infuriating, but more than anything, it's a reminder that Black cinema has always been about more than just movies - it's about power.",False
13,2,"An Undisciplined, Scattered Film by Semi-Intellectual Elvis Mitchell",themediaranger,n/a,15/08/2025,"A meandering, otherwise promising, yet undisciplined film that uses the 'kitchen sink'/Jackson Pollack strategy in handling its subject matter, brought to us by hopeful filmmaker Elvis MItchell. The main reason folks have always given Elvis MItchell a repeated pass is due to his diversity status, which has propelled his career despite repeated (documented) flake-outs, no-shows, and other flaws. Yet that trope is growing old, and it's time to see actual merit and thought in a work output. Along these lines, Elvis falls short, as a sort of meandering semi-intellectual as others have observed. He's much more suited to delivering rambling, doctrinal 'reviews' as seen through his handy and ever-present lens of race and race identity, versus producing a coherent and compelling thesis that can actually move, inform, and elevate a viewer. Even so, the movie starts out in a promising way, hence the two stars.",False

2,9,"Great movie, great subject.",cqgdqsr,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have a deep respect for artists whose compulsion drives them past rational action. Harth is a stupendous example of this. This is one of the most honest and compelling portrayals of that kind of compulsion I have ever seen.Harth is a man whose need to act upon his artistic ideas is overwhelming and powerful. As he says in this movie: if I don't make art I'll die. That danger is so clearly illustrated and explored by the very careful and respectful tone of the filmmakers. Harth opens himself up in a way that could trigger ridicule, but his pursuit is portrayed empathically, even while the ridiculousness of the pursuit is never out of one's field of vision.I feel so grateful to have seen this in a theater with a full house. It's a great movie about a great subject.",False
3,10,Fascinating!,sfirisen,n/a,17/08/2025,"A fascinating look into one man's artistic compulsion for over twenty years. I found it particularly interesting to watch the celebrities very different responses to being asked to sign the bible. While I don't understand what propelled Harth forward in his Bible quest, I do respect and admire his dedication. A very interesting film about an interesting man. This film raises thoughtful questions about what makes something art and how far it's reasonable to go in pursuit of that art. I found particularly interesting how Harth goes about choosing the signatures he finds bible-worthy. It's not always the most famous people...",False
4,10,WATCH THIS FILM!,eastphotomagic,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat an amazing and captivating documentary. It was truly amazing to see someone dedicate such a large chunk of their life to a project in the name of art and not even conventional art. The amount of planning and waiting to MAYBE get a signature and maybe not even get a signature, amazing dedication. Aside from Harth's dedication to this project I really enjoyed the director's story telling and his dedication to document the last year of Harth's Bible project. It truely felt like a team effort. This is a great documentary if you are interested in celebrity worship and non conventional art. Can't recommend it enough!",True
5,8,An Absolute MUST Watch!,guarrasin,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Book of Harth is a vivid and introspective documentary that delves into the tumultuous life of an artist driven by the need to create at all costs. The film masterfully captures the internal and external struggles of its subject-an enigmatic figure whose creative genius is both a blessing and a burden. The result is an evocative exploration of passion, sacrifice, and identity.Directed with a keen eye for emotional nuance, The Book of Harth offers more than just a biography; it's a meditation on what it means to pursue art with unrelenting fervor. The film balances intimate, confessional moments with sweeping visuals of the places that inspire the artist's work. These sequences, juxtaposed with raw archival footage, create a layered narrative that draws viewers into the labyrinth of Harth's mind.What sets this documentary apart is its refusal to romanticize its subject. While Harth's achievements are celebrated, the film does not shy away from exploring the toll of his pursuits on his personal relationships and mental well-being. The interviews with friends, collaborators, and critics add depth to the story, offering multiple perspectives on a figure who is as polarizing as he is compelling.The pacing of the documentary mirrors Harth's creative process-erratic yet exhilarating. While this approach can feel overwhelming at times, it effectively conveys the intensity of the artist's life. The soundtrack, a mix of melancholic strings and pulsating beats, underscores the emotional highs and lows with precision.The Book of Harth is a haunting yet inspiring portrait of the artist as a flawed but fearless human being. It challenges viewers to reflect on their own creative ambitions and the costs they are willing to bear. For anyone intrigued by the intersection of art and identity, this is a must-watch.",True
6,7,Book of Harth,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerFor 20 years, conceptual artist David Greg Harth had a Bible that he carried with himself every single day, seeking signatures from the most culturally significant people in the world.In this movie, director Pierre Guillet follows Harth as he finishes this project, standing in line to meet people, sometimes having conversations, often only getting an autograph, sometimes even getting interviews with people like Noam Chomsky to Kevin Smith.Harth feels like this project has cost him some of his life. It certainly has been a quest, as his sweat and hands have warped the Bible and made it into a work of art transformed by the artist. What does it all mean? Does it mean anything? This feels like twenty years of creating something made of hours of standing and waiting and nerves as you approach famous people, so many of whom have no idea they are part of a piece of art.",True

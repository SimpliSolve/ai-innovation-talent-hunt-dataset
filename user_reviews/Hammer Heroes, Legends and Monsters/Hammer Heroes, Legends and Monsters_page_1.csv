1,6,"Hammer: Heroes, Legends and Monsters",henry8-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Enjoyable and fascinating new documentary focussing primarily on the period that the great studios were most famous for ie the horror films. The film makers have managed to track down many of the makers, executives, set designers, make up artists etc or their children who all talk with great reverence about the making of many good and not so good films. As usual, a strong pile of modern film makers - John Landis, John Carpenter, Tim Burton and Joe Dante talk with great affection about the many great films and with a smile about the more dubious ones that the studio produced on very limited budgets. As to the documentary itself, it very informative, full
of fun anecdotes with many clips and interviews with all being interviewed in spooky sets. Good fun for true Hammer horror fans.",False
2,8,Hammer Horror Lives!,MarkLotinga-1064,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Hammer films, always have, always will, ever since I was a lad.I have watched the main thrust of their horror output multiple times over and have several books detailing the history and the films of Hammer.I was unaware of this brand-new documentary until it popped up on Sky Arts.Always great to see new Hammer content even if a lot of this in terms of archive clips I had seen before.The talking heads amongst which were Joe Dante, John Landis, Tim Burton and Jon Carpenter seemed to be genuine fans, I enjoyed hearing what they had to say.It was also terrific to hear from Martine Beswick and especially Madeline Smith, who has always been a favourite of mine.Although I was shocked to hear what Maddy had to say about how badly she was treated by one person in particular and I am sorry that she was put through that all those years ago.It clearly left its mark on her.One thing new that I did learn was about the talks with Marvel and Stan Lee in the 1970s, the potential slate of characters and films had me thinking ""if only""!?Perhaps my only gripes with this documentary are the clunky title and the awful CGI/AI version of Peter Cushing at the end.This makes his earlier ""return"" in 2016's Rogue One: A Star Wars Story seem like a work of genius.To dream of a return to the halcyon days of Hammer is unrealistic, however one can hope, it will be interesting to see what new owner John Gore is actually able to achieve with this fabulous brand.And on a final note, fascinating to read on IMDB that the hooded Tarot Dealer was none other than the delicious Valerie Leon!Recommended for fans both new and old.",False
3,7,Great until the end....,gurumaggie,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA lovely documentary about the Hammer film studio with some charming actors from the films and directors and behind the scenes stories.The documentary rattles along nicely with insider info on lots of the productions and who and how they were made.It's lovely to see the surviving actors clearly having a nice time remembering their films, unfortunately there is an appearance that is not so welcome, and A. I. Version of Peter Cushing poorly rendered and quite distasteful.The other problem is they don't tell us about the TV company and the famous show Hammer house of horror, which we would like to have seen explored.",True
4,6,"Hammer: Heroes, Legends and Monsters",jboothmillard,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMost people who love scary movies will recognise the term ""Hammer Horror"", the ground-breaking British studio best known for several gothic horror films throughout the 1950s until the 1970s (and occasional revivals in modern times); I was most interested to watch a documentary film exploring the history of the films from the perspectives of its stars and filmmakers, and the fans of them. Basically, former comedian and businessman William Hinds founded Hammer Film Productions Ltd in 1934, alongside Spanish émigré Enrique Carreras, a former cinema owner. Through the film distribution company Exclusive Films, which they formed, the studio only made four films before going into bankruptcy, being liquidated in 1937. However, James 'Jim' Carreras, Enrique's son, joined Exclusive in 1938, closely followed by William Hinds' son, Anthony, and revived the studio. Several smaller films were made throughout the 1940s before the breakthrough and the birth of ""Hammer Horror"" in 1955. Hammer's first significant experiment with horror came from a full-length adaptation of the BBC television series The Quatermass Xperiment. The ""X"" of the title was to establish that films from the studio would not shy away from receiving an X certificate (the equivalent of the BBFC 18 certificate today) for their violent and explicit content. The studio had its biggest hit when it produced The Curse of Frankenstein (1957), an adaptation of the famous Mary Shelley novel, which would spawn six sequels. Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee, who returned in many Hammer films throughout the years. The next big hit for Hammer was Dracula (or Horror of Dracula) (1958), an adaptation of the famous Bram Stoker novel, which would spawn eight sequels. The studio had no problem borrowing from and exploiting the success of past Universal Studios features, and so came The Mummy. The biggest trademark of Hammer against Universal was Technicolor, pushing the boundaries with high amounts of colourful blood and gore in their various films. The films boasted fantastic music scores, most from renowned composer James Bernard, and had creativity in production and set design. Problems arose in the 1960s when crew members moved on, but they continued with bold genre ideas. The success of sequels to Frankenstein and Dracula continued, the budgets became higher, and posters for new ideas were made even before a script was written. Clever ideas included: Countess Dracula (1971), a female leading vampire movie, and Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde (1971), based on the famous Robert Louis Stevenson novel, but with a gender twist. By the late 70s and early 1970s, Hammer films pushed the envelope to gain the X certificate by increasing female nudity and sexual scenes. Women were given bigger roles in the films, and the studio created beautiful buxom and often naked female stars, including Ingrid Pitt, Caroline Munro, Valerie Leon, and Madeline Smith. The problem was that they became seen as sexploitation films, ruining the reputation of the studio and not concentrating on the horror or the scripts. By the late 70s, the studio was declining, it was threatened to be sold, there were creative struggles, and the Americans pulled financing for further projects. Hammer's last production, in 1979, was a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's thriller The Lady Vanishes. The Hammer studio has been kept alive by recent blockbuster revivals, including Let Me In (2010), The Resident (2011), The Woman in Black (2012), and The Quiet Ones (2014). The studio will always be recognised for its peak period in the 1950s and still brings in new devotees, especially for fans of horror movies; this film is a good way to celebrate its 90th anniversary, an interesting and worthwhile documentary. Narrated by Charles Dance, with contributions from Hammer stars/filmmakers/staff members Sarah Appleton, Martine Beswick, Philip Campbell, John Gore, Micky Harding (daughter of Hammer director Terence Fisher), Caroline Munro, Brian Reynolds, and Madeline Smith, and Hammer fans/historians Tim Burton, Axelle Carolyn, John Carpenter, Janet Clemens, Joe Dante, Wayne Kinsey, John Landis, Andy Murray, David Pirie, and Jonathan Rigby. Good!",True
5,5,Mixed bag,gavcrimson,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNice as it is to see one of the TV channels doing something special for Halloween -this went out on the 31st October on the Sky Arts channel- Hammer: Heroes, Legends and Monsters left me with the overall impression that the time to do a thorough documentary on Hammer has passed, with so many of the important voices in that story no longer being around. Don't get me wrong, the expert talking heads here do a good job of retelling the Hammer story, but the extra dimension that could only be brought by people who were there, knew the people involved and were privy to the back stage dramas and power struggles is noticeably absent here. Bringing out children and surviving spouses of the people who should be being interviewed here, only adds to the sense of absent friends and a period of history having passed. Of the filmmaker fans interviewed, Joe Dante and Tim Burton offer a few worthy sound bites, John Carpenter seems grumpy as if he's been prematurely woken up from a nap, and John Landis just makes silly noises. Despite these set backs, the documentary eventually finds a dramatic narrative thread when it comes to the story of Michael Carreras, who certainly deserves to be classed in the heroes part of the documentary's title, even though as heroes go, Carreras was certainly a tragic one. His father, Jimmy Carreras sounds like a total blaggard who behaved terribly towards his son throughout his life, eventually committing the ultimate betrayal of forcing his son's hand into buying the Hammer company from him, fully knowing that he was selling his offspring a failing dud.Perhaps due to the fact that the documentary has a vested interest in making Hammer seem relevant and in line with modern mores, there is a tendancy here to throw the 'sexy' vampire movies they made in the early 1970s under the bus. They are largely dismissed as sexist and exploitative of the women who were in them. Although Michael Style, the outside producer of The Vampire Lovers, is damned by his own actions, and sounds like a total creep, whispering obscenities into the ear of sweet, virginal Madeline Smith. Maddie seems a strange bird, in the earlier Hammer documentary 'Hammer Glamour', there are moments where she seems quite amused and comfortable with her former sex symbol status, yet others where she comes across as a prim and proper schoolmarm, berating these movies for there reliance on female nudity. Maddie really likes to remind people she was a virgin when she made these films. In full disapproval trip mode here, Smith seems like a person who, all these years on, is still conflicted over her screen image and lasting legacy.I'm guessing that the company's reliance on film versions of politically incorrect sitcoms in order to stay afloat during the 1970s is a source of embarrassment to the current owners. So, don't go expecting mentions of Love Thy Neighbour and the On the Buses films here, even though such productions are said to have been more successful at the British box-office than the horror movies made during that period. At the same time, I do wonder if this documentary isn't grabbing too much credit when it comes to the company being a socially progressive outfit. Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde is presented as a pioneering movie in terms of exploring sexuality and gender, echoing recent online attempts to claim it as a pro-trans movie. An interpretation that conveniently ignores a fair amount of the movie's plot itself. Ralph Bates' Dr Jekyll doesn't set out to change his sex, or has any desire to live as, or be regarded as female. He narrastically wants to prolong his life, and his attempts to do so causes him to become a woman, because women generally have longer lifespans then men. The use of drugs to inadvertently alter his sex, also results in him becoming a sociopathic, cold blooded killer as well...in that sense, it hardly holds up to pro-trans interpretation, does it.As for the AI at the end, yeah I'd agree with the general consensus that the documentary really excretes the bed at the last minute. The unveiling of AI Peter Cushing is breathtaking, but not necessarily in the way that was intended. Rather than provoking a elated reaction of ""cinematic magic can bring dear Peter Cushing back to life"", it seems to have provoked a collective groan of a ""who thought that was a good idea"". Interestingly Kevin Francis, litigious head of Tyburn films, was recently in the news for attempting to sue Disney over the AI use of Peter Cushing in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Francis' claims to own Peter Cushing's image is contradicted by the end credits of this documentary which suggests the current owners of Hammer actually own Cushing's likeness. I have a feeling that an interesting documentary will one day be made about the inglorious battle for Peter Cushing's soul that currently seems to be brewing between Kevin Francis, Disney and Hammer.Hammer: Heroes, Legends and Monsters puts forward a convincing case that the company has a past worth celebrating, but that last minute AI leaves you with concerns that Hammer's ability to make bad decisions didn't end with the 20th century.",True
6,1,Appalling editing..,Osmooms-201-517112,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was almost unwatchable for me. The film shifts from still to still, not lasting more than a second on each. The interviewees don't fare much better, they are reduced to a single sentence before interrupted by another shot or another person's interview. I lasted 15 minutes before turning it off. Which is a bit of a pity, because if you have the patience to sift through the dreck, there's probably a lot of good information regarding the history of Hammer Films to be had here.If you want to watch a good documentary about Hammer Films, I'd suggest the 1994 release ""Flesh and Blood: The Hammer Heritage of Horror"". Far superior in my opinion.",False

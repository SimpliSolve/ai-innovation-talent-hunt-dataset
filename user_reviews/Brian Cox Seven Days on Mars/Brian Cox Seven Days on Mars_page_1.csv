1,8,Very interesting,davidburkett-46818,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unlike the only other review left here so far (which seems to have been made by a disgruntled scientist, for some reason) I found this to be an enjoyable watch.I know Cox isn't everyone's cup of tea but I think he describes and explains incredibly complicated subject matter in a way the lay person (you and I) can at least get a handle on what is being said.And if you're watching this in the first place, I'm guessing you have an interest already so I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I did.It's well produced and has some lovely visuals, as you would expect from this particular department of the BBC, and is well worth your time to just learn something and appreciate the filmmaking.",False
2,2,Would be great if it weren't for Cox.,Plantasma,n/a,16/08/2025,"Speaking as a physicist, Cox is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to physics documentaries. I remember seeing him in a documentary where it literally showed his ridiculous reactions more than the actual science it was supposed to be showing. Cox definitely tries very hard to be a public darling, but it just doesn't work - at least not for people who are interested in the science and not his newest hairdo.He wants to be the next Carl Sagan, but he just isn't. I keep trying these docs, but it just doesn't ever comes off well. I am so confused what the BBC sees in him. I guess they are really trying to reach a younger audience. But Cox isn't the answer. Physicists actually make fun of these docs. It's a shame, because the public NEEDS docs like this.",False

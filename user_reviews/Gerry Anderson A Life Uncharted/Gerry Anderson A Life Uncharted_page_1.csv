1,8,All about the man that made Thunderbirds Go,RossIronfield,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up in the 1990s I became fascinated by the worlds of Gerry Anderson - catching repeats on BBC2 of Thunderbirds, Stingray, Captain Scarlet and Joe 90. I had all the toys, made my own Tracy Island, collected all the comics, had the posters and FAB cutaways on my wall, and I must have watched those Channel 5 Video tapes so many times they wore out. Gerry's work inspired me to go to university to study film and TV, and I read all the magazines, biographies and making-of books I could get my hands on. I wanted to know exactly how he'd managed to make all that magic happen.Fast forward a few years, when Gerry died in 2012, I felt like I had lost my childhood hero. Thankfully, Gerry's youngest son Jamie, has worked hard to ensure his memory is not forgotten. This documentary is particularly interesting, as it uses innovative new techniques such as 'deep fake' to tell the story, something Jamie points out is what his father was known for - to use pioneering technology. Surprisingly, the documentary isn't afraid to explore other aspects of Gerry's personality, such as his troubled relationships in his personal and professional life, which somehow makes him seem more human. Yes he is someone I have always admired, but it is interesting to learn about his flaws - nobody is perfect, and that's ok.A really enjoyable (and at times quite moving!) documentary film, if you're a fan of Supermarionation, or any of his later shows, Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted is well worth a watch.",False
2,8,Excellent balanced review,steberesford-43446,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is pretty much essential viewing for Gerry fans, either hardcore or casual. Some folks have been grumbling about a lack of coverage of his programs, but they're not realising that's the point - this is a story about Gerry the person, as told in his own words and contributions by those that knew him, and not about his legacy of work. There's plenty of other documentaries and books on that subject.It's a fascinating, emotional rollercoaster of a journey with many things revealed that will likely surprise and shock you. May need a tissue or ten, and something to cuddle. Warts and all, as they say, I think it's a very fair and balanced tale of a very private man.My only complaint? It's not long enough. I'd like to have seen it as a miniseries.",False
3,6,Gerry Anderson: A Life Uncharted,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is Jamie Anderson's documentary film about the life of his father, who was famous for producing puppet shows such as 'Stingray' and 'Thunderbirds'.Sons producing books/films about their famous fathers is nothing new. Michael Sellers did it for Peter Sellers, and it seems like Gary Morecambe spends every waking moment up in the loft trying to find new material about his dad, Eric.This is a good effort, and well made. I didn't mind the clips interspersed between the talking heads, I think it would have been dry. The Deep Fake technology was a bit hit and miss though.It isn't afraid to go for a warts and all approach, and I found the section of Gerry's sad decline with Dementia quite moving.Perhaps being the son he was a bit too close to the subject matter to go really deep about the man, but this was good.",False
4,7,"Insights into Gerry Anderson marred by editing ""humour"".",Charlesc-5,n/a,16/08/2025,"A true gem of a documentary for die-hard fans of the creator of a wide variety of TV shows and movies featuring miniatures and puppets.Gerry Anderson etched his mark in our culture with his innovative puppet work and miniatures. With his steadfast dedication in using those things toward producing a wide but distinctive variety of shows, he will be remembered by generations around the world.There have already been more than a few specials concerning the development (his invention of ""SuperMarionation"") and production and reception of his various shows such as ""The Thunderbirds"", ""Space 1999"", ""UFO"", etc.The topic which this documentary reveals for the first time, to my knowledge, are various personal difficulties Anderson had in his life, and how those difficulties probably inspired his creative choices throughout his career.For fans of his work, I would consider this as ""must viewing"".The editors of this video, however, have seen fit to persist in cutting in clips and phrases from his shows / puppets, etc which, IMO, don't have anything to do with what was being discussed, either in subject or tone. Seeming to echo an old radio trick which is done for humorous effect, these clips only detract from the underlying story which is not funny.If those clips were scenes or even the shows being discussed at the time, then the clips would have been relevant, but as they were used, they were a needless distraction, subtracting a point from my review.",False
5,10,An exploration of the creative process,sarahsoden,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a child of the 60s then the World's of Gerry Anderson were an integral part of growing up. Action, adventure set in a fantastic world that expanded your horizons and set so many of us on the path of science and technology. The film reveals the genesis of the creative spark in Gerry, his determination to always be better and the sadness of being left out in the cold as times change despite the rich, unexplored potential of the world's he catalysed into being. The film also treats the final years of Gerry's life and the decline caused by Alzheimer's disease with, respect and dignity, more than once I was fighting back a tear. For any fan of the fantastic worlds of Anderson or student of pop culture this should not be missed. SIG.",False
6,10,Compelling......,s3276169,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up in the 1970's, on a television diet, partly comprised of Gerry Anderson's work.Many of my happiest, early memories, comprised me plonked down in front of ""the box' watching series like Space 1999. It was then, fascinating to get a glimpse into the life of the man behind behind the magic.This documentary, offers up insights into the inspiration, that led to many of Anderson's iconic series, like Thunderbirds.What really surprised me, was how touching and at times, really quite sad, this story could be. I personally, was left with the sense of a man, who got to do everything in adulthood, he might have wanted to do as a child. Creating worlds filled with adventure and fun.In summary, this is a compelling look into the life a remarkable man, who was a real ground breaker in television and science fiction. I doubt we will see his like again, in an age of soulless CGI and bad writing. Much loved and much missed.10/10.",False
7,9,Extrodinary! Most Extrodinary!,DanTheMan2150AD,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most eye opening documentaries I've ever witnessed, while the deep faked scenes of Gerry are certainly hit and miss, the raw emotional core this enlightening documentary provides is not one to be skipped. While I chose to remember the man who shaped my childhood with his incredible shows and movies with fondness, there's no doubt this one is going to sting for many fans...",False
8,10,Essential viewing for all 'Anderfans'!,MadGeordieRob,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was fortunate enough to attend a screening of this documentary at the Electric Cinema in Birmingham, in the company of good friends, fellow fans, and the two creative minds behind the film, Jamie Anderson and Ben Field.I have been a fan of the works of Gerry Anderson (and the talented people whom he always managed to surround himself with) since a very young age when my father first sat me down and showed me a rented Captain Scarlet VHS. As the years have gone by, I have discovered more of Gerry's works, learned about the making of the shows themselves, bought countless items of merchandise and become more involved in the large and wonderful fandom which exists thanks to the great man and his work. My experience is not unique, it is no doubt similar to countless other fans' experiences all over the world over the decades, and there is one other thing that all of us have in common. None of us, not even his own son, really knew Gerry Anderson at all.This documentary goes a long way towards putting that right. It is an honest, candid, heartfelt and deeply moving work. It contains much of the humour that permeates Gerry's own productions, thanks largely to the intercutting of clips from the various shows between the interview and archive material, but there is also much sadness and I very much recommend you have tissues on standby. It covers Gerry's early life his relationship with his parents, the tragic death of his RAF hero brother Lionel, his three marriages and the children they produced, the highs and lows of his long and illustrious career, and it culminates in the tragic tale of Gerry's decline in health through dementia and the work that he and son Jamie did to raise awareness of this terrible illness. This last section of the film resonated deeply with me on a personal level as my own nana passed away just over a year ago and she too suffered from dementia. When I compare my own response to her condition with Jamie's response to his father's, I found myself sorely lacking, and I can confidently say that in this regard, Jamie Anderson is a far, far better man than I.Doubtless you will be wondering about the use of 'deep fake' technology, still in its relative infancy and something of a contentious issue itself, in this documentary. Deep fakes when used in a manner such as this, in a production such as this, can very easily cross the very fine line into 'disrespectful'. Thankfully, this does not happen in 'A Life Uncharted'. The deep fake technology is used only to put a face to archive audio footage of Gerry discussing his life (and one other use which I shall not spoil, but I am confident you will find this moment tastefully done) and is definitely complimentary and does not distract OR detract.Jamie and director Benjamin Field have produced an absolutely wonderful journey into the mind of a man who overcame his own unhappy childhood and ended up shaping and enhancing the childhoods of millions (and, even though he is no longer with us, he's still doing it) on a scale that would previously not seemed possible. It was an absolute joy to watch, even the parts that were slightly cloudy and blurry due to my tears, and if I could only offer one constructive criticism it is this: I wish it were longer.Marvellous work, Jamie and Ben. I'm sure Gerry would be very, very proud.",False
9,9,Fascinating look at the life and career of an innovator,lhicking,n/a,16/08/2025,I loved Gerry's live action shows but knew little about him. This is a fascinating story told mostly by the man himself with poignant snippets from family and colleagues. His son Jamie is a marvel.,False
10,10,Makes you appreciate Gerry's work even more!,rgoodbourn,n/a,16/08/2025,Such a great documentary and insight into the great man that created so many TV shows for over three generations.You really relate to Gerry and his family with what happened in his life.,False
11,10,Never to be forgotten,jaydermott,n/a,16/08/2025,"What does a quiet, unassuming, hard-working visionary do when he realises that he had a sad and miserable childhood? Answer is, he sets about creating highly memorable TV to make unforgettable childhoods, and much more, for many millions of others. Gerry's life has been chronicled before but never has the complete story been assembled and examined from every angle. With natant skills that so won over a hard-bitten media magnate that he promised to back Gerry in whatever project he wanted to make, this film follows such peaks and troughs that only a very special, and very human, person could traverse. So high were the peaks, however, it's certain that the name of Gerry Anderson will always be remembered in the richness of the worlds he built, the characters he created and the loyalty he's inspired from countless colleagues, employees, audiences and fans.",False
12,10,Magical,pamelamarch,n/a,16/08/2025,Where can I start? What a wonderful documentary of the life of a man who inspired me from a young age. Which got me interested in space and oceans and a sense of adventure. Thank you Gerry so very much. I'm happy that Jamie and Co is keeping your memory alive.FAB PWOR SIG WIN.,False
13,10,Anything can happen in the next half hour.,petermcnerney,n/a,16/08/2025,Spend yours watching this moving and brilliant documentary. Why moving? Why brilliant? You'll have to watch! Quick annecdote ..in 1975(me 15) I persuaded my Dad (RIP) ..a Matchoftheday/IClaudius/Sweeney type of viewer to watch the opening episode of Space 1999 with me. He watched until the end! And said he enjoyed it. I can still remember that warm feeling.,False
14,10,A heart breaking story of a very human man.,sir-hamster,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary follows the story behind the name, you may know Gerry Anderson for being the guy who made Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet, but this film gives a much more indepth and personal accounts of his life, in his own words and by the people who know him best. This heart breaking tale will give new meaning to his love of heroes and escaping reality. This film is beyond FAB!",False
15,10,Breathtaking,tjpadgett-19621,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having first discovered the works of Gerry Anderson in the mid-90's when BBC2 began showing Thunderbirds, I've been hooked ever since.Some of the things covered in this documentary I already knew a bit about, such as his marriage to Sylvia breaking down badly, but to be immersed in his life so deeply and so overwhelmingly, you are left by the end feeling like you knew Gerry personally and also with a whole new level of respect for such an incredible man.This programme cannot have been easy for Jamie to make, but you get a real sense of the genuine love he has for his father, and it shows right from the start.An utterly breathtaking film documenting the astonishing life of a man many of us rightly call a legend.",False
16,10,Fantasic story of Gerry Anderson and Super marionation,oilkids,n/a,16/08/2025,I girew up in the U S watching the majority of Gerry Anderson shows including supercar Fireball XL5 stingray Thunderbirds Space 1999 and In the back of my mind was who is ITC and who are these guys doing these great shows that we're not from Hollywood or on your typical American broadcasting stations. I can't tell you how this led me to more future scientific endeavors in my life as an interest in aviation engineering and all forms of futuristic endeavors. I'm sorry I never got to meet some of these great individuals over the pond.,False
17,10,Great Story about a great Storyteller.,spencerrodd,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a shy boy in the 1960's fascinated by electronics (computers weren't a thing you had then) the TV programmes made by Gerry Anderson were must see events. This innovative documentary using deep fake tech combined with good old fashioned creative editing brings the story of the man to life, explaining lots of the odd quirks of the programmes and providing a warts and all view into the work of a creative genius. Thanks to all involved especially Jamie Anderson, many of us in technology wouldn't have had the careers we had without your Dad's imagination showing us what might be possible.",False
18,10,"A must watch, fan or not.",willowwitchy,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a huge fan of almost all the Anderson shows, this documentary was something I had very much been looking forward to seeing. It didn't disappoint. It also didn't shy away from the more negative aspects of Gerry's personality and life.It was a very interesting watch and elaborated on some of the stories and situations that I had heard about previously.Full of a wonderful mix of funny, sad, upsetting, tear jerking and poignant moments, it certainly tugs on the heartstrings and gives you a deeper insight into the life of the man that helped make our childhoods (and adulthoods) so magical.",False
19,10,Utterly splendid!!!,jimdparsons,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wonderful piece of documentary filmmaking, absolutely riveting from beginning to end!!Anderson Entertainment have given us a super thing with this movie, a truly lovely and very honest document attesting to the huge impact Gerry had on the industry and the entire world with his groundbreaking creations!!Show after show they took us all on the most amazing adventures and changed for the better the way so many saw the world!!A total must see event!!!",False
20,8,Surprisingly moving documentary that gets quite dark in places.,trevorwomble,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was expecting this little film to be a superficial hero worship of a man that made entertainment for kids worldwide for quite a few years, especially as it was produced by his youngest son, Jamie.However to my surprise, Jamie (who is presenter and co-producer) allows this interesting documentary to get quite dark. He is more interested in the man behind the legendary productions like Thunderbirds, Stingray, Space:1999, Joe 90 and Captain Scarlet than the actual productions themselves. It is a calculated gamble that the audience would be too but it pays off in spades.We learn another side to his father, some of which we already knew, some of which we didn't. The driving force behind his incredible imagination, his miserable childhood of near poverty, a manipulative and bitter mother, his sadness at how it affected his relationship with his father, a terrible family tragedy in WWII, being a victim of anti-semitic bullying at school and how it affected his education and how he struggled with his relationships with women and his deep regrets at the carnage of his first two marriages. Whilst Gerry portrayed a fun world for children in his legendary television series, he himself had a childhood to forget.This film pulls no punches, with Jamie's own memories of his father (Gerry was 57 when Jamie was born) being a mixture of fun but also sadness as he saw his own dad fall victim to dementia and robbing him of his own memories to a point where he didn't recognize people anymore. There are also archive clips from people who worked with Gerry who are openly critical of Gerry's personality and what they thought of him. Much like Willie Wonka in Roald Dahl's book, beneath the fun surface of the man there lurks a deeply troubled person.It can't have been easy for Jamie to learn that not everyone thought his father was wonderful but fair play to him for sharing it with us. If anything it humanizes him . We learn that although Gerry was a very innovative, forward thinking and creative man, he was also a lousy businessman. He got lucky in that he made his biggest shows for impressario Lew Grade and his ITC company. Grade cut Anderson a lot of slack and showed faith in him but even then he would pull him up if he wasn't happy over some of Andersons decisions. Anderson also had a nasty, expensive and vicious divorce from Sylvia that dragged on for years. That too is addressed here and this is one of the few flaws in this film as I felt it a little bit one sided. As Sylvia died in 2016 and her daughter from her first marriage refused to be interviewed it obviously wasn't possible to obtain her perspective but I would have liked to have heard more from someone who knew her as there are always two sides to an argument.The documentary uses A I generated scenes to animate audio taped interviews that Anderson had recorded a few years before his death. This is the other issue I had with the documentary as although the filmmakers tried to do something different in order to use these recordings, I felt that the A I was a bit obvious, despite them trying to disguise it. However that was a minor quibble in comparison to the mine of information in this documentary.All in all this is a warts and all film that fleshes the man out and shows he was actually a far more complicated man than I guess most fans realised. He as both a pioneer but also very naive too. He had huge success but then lost it all. Jamie addresses the fact that the successful 'Terrahawks' TV series (1983) led to a resurgement of interest in the man and his back catalogue and he was able to get his life back on track after a decade where the offers had dried up. Anderson wasn't a big fan of Terrahawks but it did his career a power of good.All in all, a bold but worthy watch with a very moving last half hour.",False
21,10,All The People Who Showed For His Funeral Reveals How Much Gerry Was Loved!,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"The creations of Gerry Anderson were must see television for me as a young child. They fascinated me and, though at the time it was just great TV shows, I later realized at an older age what an incredible creative/original mind he had.This will be of specific importance to Anderson TV shows fans with a no holds barred revelation of his awkward sad childhood and, story's of the sadness of some of his children. It also reveals and uncovers two of the most obnoxious women anyone would be at a great misfortune to meet. You will be surprised to know who one of them was!Its a bio-documentary so there really isn't much to be said about it other than, it reveals a lot about the man, its well made and that his last 30 years on Earth he had the wonderful love of a good woman and a devoted loving son (Mary and Jaime).",False
22,8,I'VE ONLY WRITTEN A HANDFUL OF REVIEWS - BUT THIS DESERVED ONE.,andrew-1698,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't normally write reviews but sometimes something moves me enough to inspire me into action.As a 60's kid Gerry Anderson was as important a name to me as Walt Disney, or Cubby Broccoli. Gerry made shows that left a lasting legacy as well as an imprint on my childhood & British culture (& beyond).This documentary focusses on what made the man, not just the shows, & the events which influenced those shows & their characters. If you're not too familiar with Thunderbirds, Space 1999 or the other tv programmes it's still a balanced, nuanced & interesting piece of film making by Gerry's son, Jamie. It's not ultra reverential or sycophantic, but adopts a warts & all approach, even pointing out Gerry's flaws & failings. It shows him as human which just endears the subject matter to the viewer even more. It doesn't try to whitewash him or attempt to deify him in the way many modern documentaries & families do with someone so iconic & culturally influential. I found that an incredibly refreshing approach.As I've grown older I've revisited many aspects of things which played a part of my life including some of Gerry Anderson's programmes. However in this I enjoyed learning about the man himself, the people who orbited in (& out) of his life, & how those events affected the productions.Despite some of the reviews here I for one didn't object to the inclusion of ""clips"" from the shows which punctuated the piece throughout as if to add levity & humour, particularly if the segment dealt with disturbing or dramatic issues. Besides, it seems to be commonplace in many current biographies in recent times. It's most filmmakers shorthand & punctuation these days.In conclusion I'd urge viewers to watch this if given the chance, even if you're not a 60's child who was brought up on the shows like ""Thunderbirds"" which were made mainly for kids with ""puppet stars"", or for the family & fans of SciFi in the form of ""Space 1999"" or ""UFO"" when Gerry finally got to feature real actors.This is really more of a film about a very interesting, even introverted British filmmaker & producer of great British tv programmes. There's not many in that field that are as deserving of such a laid bare for all biography, or can be regarded by fans of the medium as a truly great British Icon. Give it a watch.",False
23,10,A very good documentary,dalek-64129,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerGoing into this i was a bit worried about the deep fake and how Gerry anderson reputation might change because of this.But i was blown away my the honestly of the all the contributes to a Life uncharted.This showed the human story of Gerry and how we are all human after all.It showed how the tough things that happened in his life he over them and wanted to make never be poor again.Because of this Gerry made enemies through the years but this is how life can be tough.Ben Field was a great director and liked how this documentary was shot. Liked the audio clips chosen to go with the deep fake.Deep fake was good i feel and this was very emotional story of the legend Gerry Anderson.We are have tough times in life and lots of people can relate to this watching a Life uncharted.Lots of people can relate to Alzheimers disease and how affects people.This was a great piece of film making.,True

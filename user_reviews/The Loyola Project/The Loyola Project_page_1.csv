1,10,An Absolute Triumph,nvsszaki,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw THE LOYOLA PROJECT last night at Loyola Chicago, and this film is an absolute triumph of filmmaking. The cinematography, sound design, animation and voiceover work from Lucas Williamson hook you in the beginning and never let go. This is an incredibly important story and I'm thrilled it's being told through such a miraculous documentary. I was in tears by the end.",False

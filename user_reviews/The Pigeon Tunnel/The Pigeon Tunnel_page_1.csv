1,7,The Pigeon Tunnel,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Did you know that ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" by a certain David Cromwell (aka John Le Carré) sold between 12-15 million physical copies? That's before Richard Burton took on the mantle of ""Lemeas"" from that novel and long before Sir Alec Guinness took on the part of the forensic super-spy ""George Smiley"" in ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and that gives us quite an indication as the phenomenal success of this writer who basically bares his soul here in a one-to-one with Errol Morris. Spurred on only sparingly by the director, we are left with what is an succinct and informative retrospective on the life of a man who might not have seemed obviously destined for literary greatness. We start with his childhood where he was largely brought up by his con-man father (after his mother got fed up of the crooks and the mistresses and fled when he was five) and follows his education through Oxford, his recruitment into and ultimately boredom of the the British Intelligence community before turning his hand to bringing all of this experience to life in over twenty published novels. This isn't a treatise on how to write a thriller. It's an enjoyably structured lesson on how a little bit of experience, an understanding of human nature and a vidid imagination can create works of fiction that enthral and captivate. He delivers this with candour, humour, a tiny bit of self-deprecation but most notably - truthfulness. You need to have your thinking cap on, too. He uses language eruditely and in a considered fashion that I could listen to all day. You won't learn much about how to write a spy story, but you will learn something of this fascinating and engaging human being. It's an Apple TV production so might get only a limited cinema release (though the BBC seem to have supplied quite a bit of archive, so perhaps they secured a tx as a quid pro quo?) and it's most definitely worth a watch if you are remotely interested in the genre, in writing - or in just listening to an interesting man.",False
2,7,the real deal,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. When John le Carre passed away in 2020 at the age of 80, conversations and debates raged about the best spy novelists, and what stood out was, no matter how many writers were mentioned - Ian Fleming, Tom Clancey, Robert Ludlum, Ken Follett - everyone's list included le Carre. Oscar winning documentarian Errol Morris (THE FOG OF WAR, 2003) has taken le Carre's final and most personal interview and adorned it with film clips, rare archival footage, and some dramatic effects to create a lasting tribute to a superb writer and a most interesting man.John le Carre was a former member of MI5 (British Security Service) and MI6 (British Intelligence Service), only at the time he was David Cornwell. Adapting his now world-famous nom de plume, le Carre became a spy who wrote spy novels. Really good spy novels. Not only were many of these to become bestsellers, many were also primed to be adapted to a film version or TV series. A few of his best-known novels include: ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"", ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"", ""The Night Manager"", ""The Constant Gardener"", and ""A Perfect Spy."" His recurring character George Smiley was always a favorite, and was played expertly by two Oscar winners, Sir Alec Guiness and Gary Oldman.For anyone who hasn't read le Carre's 2016 autobiography, ""The Pigeon Tunnel: Stories from My Life"", Morris is kind enough to include the explanation of the title. ""The Pigeon Tunnel"" was the working title le Carre used for many of his books while in progress, and we do get to hear the author detail how that particular phrase happened to stick. In fact, the real treasure here is in hearing le Carre's distinctive voice spin the yarn on so many stories. Whether writing or speaking, he was a fantastic storyteller, mesmerizing the readers and listeners.With his storytelling-on-the-fly approach, le Carre recalls his childhood and life with a seamless blend of experience, memory, and imagination ... often with the Cold War as a backdrop. We aren't always sure where the blurred line between fact and embellishment falls, but we do know we are along for the ride. When John le Carre speaks of his fascination with ""betrayal"", we can't help but wish he were still around to provide commentary on this modern world.Streaming globally on AppleTV+ beginning October 20, 2023.",False
3,7,The Pigeon Tunnel,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Based in part on Le Carre's book, this is a fascinating insight into the mind and works of Le Carre / David Cornwell. The documentary mixes interviews with Cornwell in a darkened library with dramatised clips, as he recalls his childhood especially his extraordinarily disreputable father who despite being a complete fraud seems to have influenced Cornwell considerably. He then goes on to explain his role in the secret service and the seemingly deranged minds of those around him, including Kim Philby who seem to thrive on deceipt. Thereafter he has used this knowledge, his fertile imagination and his childhood experiences to craft so many great spy novels.It is all thoroughly absorbing helped immeasurably by the man himself whose warm treacly erudition cannot fail to keep you entertained. It is interesting that this smooth manner must have helped a lot when he was interrogating and you therefore wonder when being 'interrogated' himself by filmmaker Errol Morris whether everything he claims is true, actually is - he is after all an expert on deception.The Pigeon Tunnel title is explained at the beginning of the film and goes some way to explaining why most of his books start off being called The Pigeon Tunnel.",False
4,6,An solid documentary story about John le Carré,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director Errol Morris has made some pretty great documentaries in his career like ""The Thin Blue Line, A Brief History of Time, and Fog of War"" as Morris provides some interesting insightful documentaries and stories. With this one focusing on the career and life of John le Carré, Morris takes an interesting look of Carré's personality, career and the outlooks of the Cold War era and for the most part, it was solid.John le Carré being the main subject provides some good and interesting conversations and discussions about his ideas and career with some pretty interesting dramatic reenactment moments to demonstrate the setting and environment. Throughout, the production was solid with the camerawork being good although nothing too special about it's presentation and colors. The conversations between Morris and Carré are strong as if there was good chemistry between the two of them.However, the engagement wasn't the strongest as since topics about spy career isn't my most favorite genre of literature, there were some pacing moments that did feel a little sloppy that made certain subjects feel uninteresting to discuss about. There were certain discussion moments that I wished they had focused a little on more. The soundtrack does end up getting obnoxious as the soundtrack distracts certain moments.Overall, it's an interesting documentary but it's not my favorite from Morris.",False
5,6,Not One of Errol Morris's Better Efforts,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Getting inside the head of a spy is undoubtedly challenging; getting inside the head of a novelist who was once a spy who now writes about that enigmatic profession is nearly impossible. And that's one of the hurdles that hampers this profile of former MI5 and MI6 operative David Cornwell, better known to the world by his pen name, John le Carré (1931-2020). Based on the author's memoir of the same name, the latest from documentarian Errol Morris puts the best-selling espionage novelist under the microscope, seeking to discover who le Carré is, what factors impacted his life and writings, and how his novels mirror those influences in terms of content and themes. Through discussions of books like ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,"" ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy,"" ""Smiley's People,"" ""A Perfect Spy"" and ""The Looking Glass War,"" backed by clips of film and television adaptations of these works, le Carré and Morris ruminate on the writer's objectives in bringing them to life, some of them personal in nature and some of them expressions of his feelings about the murky underworld he left behind and brought to life on the printed page. Much of what the author consequently discusses comes across as dark, cryptic, and characterized by rampant intrigue and betrayal, not unlike the life he left behind (as well as the dismal upbringing he underwent at the knee of his untrustworthy father, a professional swindler adept at plying his craft). The insights, to say the least, are rather depressing and disquieting. But that unsettling material is further compounded by a string of often-perplexing observations about le Carré's existential outlooks and literary intentions, some of which seemingly amount to little more than oh so much navel gazing and intellectual masturbation, overstated attempts at encapsulating his perspectives on human nature and human relations as reflected through his works. I can imagine that there's probably a market for a film like this among Anglophiles captivated by the writer's works, the spy novel genre in general and PBS/BBC television dramas, but it really didn't do much for me, especially since this offering pales in comparison to many of Morris's other better productions. Thankfully, the picture's merciful 1:32:00 runtime proved to be its saving grace (even though the picture admittedly improves once it gets past an overly long, excessively detailed prologue). Ironically, le Carré notes in the film that he sees his novels as an antidote to the James Bond books and movies, but, from where I stand, I'll take 007 over this any day.",False
6,8,A literary life in words and deeds,iancurd-70178,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating, insightful, and informative. I could say more, but the ""actor"" says it better. However ... talking heads (with the occasional interjection from the writer/director Errol Morris in this case) often use other author's words, and this can leave the viewer feeling as if the question asked has not been answered, and sometimes avoided. Here, whilst the subject replies honestly, he also admits to a possible distortion by the hand of time, youth, and literary escapology and invention. I thoroughly enjoyed his affable demeanour, his candour and the insight it gave into the parallels between the books and his life. Any and every fan of John Le Carre's work should watch this tv film/documentary.",False
7,9,A unusual documentary for an unusual man and author,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never read John le Carre books, but I appreciated the movies that were made from them and now that I have heard the author speak about his life, I am even more enthralled. He admits that at times he is not even sure what's real and what is fiction.He educates us on what it takes to make a good spy - and made me happy that I am not of that ilk, but did appreciate that he was.He explained what made him a write and why he titled his biography ""The Pigeon Tunnel"". It was all very educational to us, the viewer, if we really listened.The filming of it was brilliant and quiet. Quick quips of photos and some news prints and the stories behind them.He lead a complicated life and shared it with us, in books and this documentary.He died at age 89 in 2020, so we were lucky at all to have had this time with him, but we still have his books.Enjoy!",False
8,8,A different type of movie,allanwinks-755-66732,n/a,16/08/2025,"This would be of particular interest if the viewer enjoyed the authors fiction which I did. This is a remarkable movie about a remarkable author living in Cold War times.LeCarré somehow manages to capture the colour of the paint (tobacco brown) on the walls of the meager interrogation rooms and offices in his prose, and the underlying violence is subtle and implied rather than evident. And although there are sides to take his writing never demands this of the reader.His skill in capturing the zeitgeist of the Cold War years is his brilliance which somewhat diminishes in the post war era when he still continues to shine in a more contemporary way.See the video, LeCarré is the star.",False
9,3,Shouldn't the emperor put some clothes on?,jake_fantom,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe it's me, but having tried and failed to watch this through TWICE, let me just say this emperor is buck naked. The magic of Errol Morris's early documentaries seems to have faded into an overly dramatic, pretentious, and stylized flow of irrelevant images and superfluous rambling -- and John Le Carré is the perfect subject for this treatment, endlessly tooting his own horn and holding forth in pompous windbag mode for what seemed like an eternity. Plus, there is really nothing new here, no revelations. Le Carré has been interviewed ad nauseum over the years, and regaled us with tales of his con man father and super spy exploits. In fact, his tales of British spies and Communist moles have been told in other far more insightful documentaries. I suppose if you are a super fan of Le Carré's books, it might be nice to view his final interview, but despite the glowing reviews, I think many will find this a boring and repetitious rehash of very familiar narratives.",False
10,9,"The art of ""exquisite self-hatred""",Love_Life_Laughter,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe startling honesty of this fascinating interview reflects the shadow boxing interplay of John LeCarres ouevre. Mr LeCarre is the pre-eminent painter of quiet existential despair, the life of the double-dealing spy as metaphor for the lives of quiet desperation we all ostensibly live, reflecting the every day mask of propriety society demands of us all.I for one complletely believe the utter guilelessness the famous author purports to evince here, and it is both fascinating and touching. His horrific childhood, bookmarked by a conscience-free, jailbait con-man father and the mother that abandoned him as a young child, is coined as the ""credit card"" for his art.This is not the world of James Bond, but the gray world of betrayal without moral absolutes. In the end, this respectful interview hoping to get at the heart of this great author is as poignant as any of his beautifully crafted, universally sad novels.",True
11,8,Fascinating insights on and from John Le Carre,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Pigeon Tunnel"" (2023 release; 93 min) opens, Le Carre and the film's director Errol Morris are discussing the making of this film (supposedly the last interview LeCarre ever gave). LeCarre (real name: David Cornwell) then reflects on his upbringing, which he admits was anything but easy. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary...Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from Oscar-winning director Errol Morris (""The Fog of War""). Here he reassesses Cornwell/Le Carre's life and times. And how does Morris exactly do that? For the most part he simply lets the interviewee do the talking. It's almost as if we get a glimpse of what Le Carre is such an accomplished writer. The movie is at its best when Le Carre explains how his own real life experiences as a spy for the British secret service influenced the novels he wrote. Morris uses film clips to illustrate various points. At a certain point, it blurs the lines of what is real and what is fiction. I found is rather fascinating. THe movie also benefits tremendously from the delightful original score by Philip Glass and Paul Leonard Morgan, who has scored several earlier Morris documentaries.""The Pigeon Tunnel"" premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in early September, earning immediate critical acclaim. There is good reason why this movie is currently rate 95% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie just started streaming on Apple TV. If you are a fan of John Le Carre or of Errol Morris' earlier documentaries, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
12,8,"Man and Myth, Merged?",MattCummings,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Pigeon Tunnel isn't just an interview with spy novelist John LeCarre, but a fascinating and deeply rewarding introspection. LeCarre is engaging, open and honest about his childhood and his deeply flawed relationship with his parents. A former British spy - although he contends not a very good one - he would use those experiences to pen some of the best spy novels ever, including my favorite ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Soy."" LeCarre visits and revisits betrayal as the central source of his writing, which he claims as art, a thought that many critics might not agree with. In the end, LeCarre imagined a world both bludgeoned with honesty and filled with a desire for fantasy to stunning effect. The Pigeon Tunnel exposes the spy and the man within, leaving us to wonder who he really was. At the end of the film, LeCarre admits ""If I'm not writing, I'm an actor without a part,"" perhaps giving us some amount of insight into this complex and engaging man.",False

1,2,A mess that made it difficult to understand the case,ainitasandy-99,n/a,15/08/2025,"The structure and information of this documentary made it difficult to grasp it. Everything wasn't made clear by how they we're jumping between the trial, protest, the suspects and everything else.After seeing the trailer and reading the comments I couldn't stop myself to read about the case in Wikipedia. And I think of was good that I had done it otherwise I would have been more lost than I was by watching the documentaryIt is sad when this case was horrible and also considered one of the first labeled feminicidios, something that was mentioned 2 minutes before the movie ended. It had an important message but it didn't feel like it by how the documentary was made.",False
2,1,"Don't quit your day job editor, director, whoever did this",Kepart,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the worst documentary I have ever watched. There is no information at all. What's the girl's name? How old was she? What grade was she in? What kind of person was she? Was she nice or was she a floozy? Where are the news reporters or law enforcement? I didn't bother to finish. I would liked for there to be some sort of introduction about the abducted girl. What was the motive? You're not giving me anything to go on here. Who are the people giving interviews? Did they really know Maria? Where is the family? Why is there no emotion? I know this isn't the best review, because there is no actual information about the story, but this girl deserved better. She needed to be remembered, not just some random girl. Unless that's what she was.",False

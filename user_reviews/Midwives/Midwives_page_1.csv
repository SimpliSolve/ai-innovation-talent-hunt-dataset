1,6,There's Nothing Too Much to Say,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this back at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival""Midwives"" is directed by Hnin Ei Hlaing and it's a story about two midwives, one Buddhist and one Muslim, who both defy strict ethnic divisions to work side by side in a makeshift clinic in western Myanmar, providing medical services to the Rohingya of Rakhine State. The presentation is very well shot, some really interesting moments about culture and religion presented throughout this story. However Hlaing really seems to like to focus more on going around places with the camera and the structure of the documentary is really lacking and lazy. The conversations between the participants at points felt like they don't wanna be there and the information provided sometimes feels there is moments that are missing.I ended up feeling bored when watching documentary and almost skipped through but I kept on going because I hoped that maybe something may improve my viewing. However, it didn't really offer much so needless to say, it was kind of boring.Rating: C+",False

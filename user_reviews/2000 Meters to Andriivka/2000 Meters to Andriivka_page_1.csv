1,9,"Harrowing, distressing and the true realities of horror",peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Mstyslav Chernov comes again with another horrifying, risky, and harrowing documentary of the conflicts and deadly war between Ukraine and Russia. Presented with nightmarish war and fighting sequences caught through live cameras, Chernov doesn't shy away on showing some of the dark sides of humanity and demonstrating the harsh realities of what soldiers are going through and how war itself, affects individuals and the world.The way Chernov presents each of the participants, scenarios, and environment is both incredible. Having cameras and people going through the battle fields, where there are many moments of near death and terrifying moments are displayed is quite a shock. I don't think I have ever seen a war documentary this harrowing and scary in my entire life. And having seen some of the best war documentaries ever, this is some real scary stuff.I do applaud Mstyslav Chernov and the rest of his crew having to go out there to film and document about the war. Putting yourself in the shoes of soldiers and danger for the people to see is really the biggest risk, yet purposeful thing to do. Highly recommend for those interested in the war conflicts.",False
2,9,Award winning documentary,VorpalJay,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well, I have yet to screen this I eagerly await it. It's just received an award in Denmark filmmaker has previously received an Academy award. This film follows a Ukrainian platoon battling to retake Andriivka from the occupiers.The CPH:DOX 2025 jury said, ""It's a masterpiece in filmmaking: a haunting, multi layered portrayal of war comparable to All Quiet on the Western Front. But this is not the First World War, it's today. The meaningless of war, and also its unsettling poetry are all on full display here. An artist in amongst bloodshed brings the reality home, and make an anti war film that forces us to reflect on the diginity of each human life lost.'",False
3,8,War up close and personal,irishrebel98,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you think this is a documentary about high tech war in 2025, forget it. With the exception of the occasional drone popping up, this is about infantry war where the soldiers, due to a specific terrain feature, are really tight together. You get to feel close to these Ukrainian troops, and when they die or are wounded, you see it and feel it, because you know who they are. Even when Russian soldiers are shot dead or rooted out of bunkers, you will feel good for the Ukrainians but you don't feel any elation, at all. I fully back the Ukrainians, and seeing this film just breaks my heart that they have had to endure this carnage for three and a half years now, where all they want is to be left alone..",False
4,10,"If you still think this war is complicated, watch 2,000 Metres to Andriivka - and then try saying peace talks without choking on your own comfort.",silenceissexy666,n/a,15/08/2025,"I never thought my country would end up stuck in the biggest war Europe has seen since WWII. And while we bleed out, Western leaders - the same ones who promised us security in 1994 - scroll past our war on their phones. Ukrainians are dying. Not symbolically. Literally. Slowly. Brutally. Why? Because the world decided to monitor the situation.Let me be clear: if we fall, Ukraine becomes one giant mass grave. The kind of grave Chernov filmed in Mariupol. How long will this war last? No one knows. But history does: 1914. 1939. 2022. Pretending it's not your problem won't save you when the fire spreads.Andriivka was liberated by Ukrainian soldiers - and then taken again. Every meter of that village was paid for with blood. Real people. Real names. And when someone from your side tells us to make concessions, give away territory, or seek compromise, I imagine that person buried at the bottom of a mass grave. Too harsh? Good. Maybe now you're paying attention.Do you know what's happening in Ukraine? Really? I doubt it. But if you want a dose of reality - go watch 20 Days in Mariupol and 2,000 Metres to Andriivka. Then tell me again that peace comes from giving in.",False
5,10,The best documentary ever,nikjulia,n/a,15/08/2025,"Heartbreaking ! But everyone need to see it, to see what are Ukrainians going through. Chernov is a genius! The hardest thing is to understand that the same happening right now in that moment while you watching it. I was crying. The music is incredible, the picture is incredible, this is so fantastic work!",False

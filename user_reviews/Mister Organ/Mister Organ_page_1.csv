1,8,A Solid 8!,tadted,n/a,17/08/2025,"This guy is the antipodean Louis Theroux. He has a great knack of developing a story and making you want to join him on the journey. I love documentaries and came across ""Tickled"" and loved his style of production. That first documentary was weird and intriguing and there was a taster of this one at the end but it went out of my mind for a while because it wasn't going to be released for a while. So I came across it recently while looking for a documentary to watch and again was not disappointed. I hope he goes on to produce plenty more of this type of this in the future because - like Theroux - he has found a formula that works.",False
2,8,Is this safe to review?,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,17/08/2025,"I remember liking Tickled many years ago, but Mister Organ I thought was even better as a documentary, and I think it's shown David Farrier to be more than just a one-trick pony (though it does have the same kind of mix of suspense, intrigue, and tension that Tickled had, just stronger).It starts a little too chaotically for my liking, but after about 10 or 15 minutes it settles into a groove and starts feeling baffling in the right kind of way. Maybe some of the opening scenes were supposed to get your head spinning right away, but I think I would've liked a slightly more patient build-up to the central premise. But once it does get underway, Mister Organ is fascinating, even when the director admits that he doesn't know where anything's going or how he can even end the documentary he set out to make.It's an exploration of a very unusual and rather terrifying individual, and the way it functions as a character study of this man makes Mister Organ feel more intense than a good many genuine thrillers. It's the kind of movie where I feel a little worried even saying anything about it, due to the man at its center. I doubt he'd ever read this, but I still don't want to speculate on the man beyond what's presented in this documentary; partly out of fear, but also partly because this is the kind of film that should be watched without knowing much about it in advance. I went in thinking it was going to be about organ transplants in some way, and no... it wasn't that at all.It's on Netflix currently in Australia, and I only shout out the streaming service because this is one of the few documentaries on there that's genuinely great, straight-to-the-point, and keen to tell its story in just 90-ish minutes. Certain documentaries need longer runtimes, but most documentaries on Netflix don't, and are needlessly padded out to be told in three to four-hour miniseries rather than 90 to 120-minute movies (a big reason why I just stopped watching most documentaries on the platform, be they hosted on there or produced by Netflix itself). Anyway, Mister Organ's one of the good ones currently on Aus Netflix, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys unusual and captivating documentary filmmaking.",False
3,7,Hold onto your butts,scatterscott,n/a,17/08/2025,"""Mister Organ"" isn't just a documentary, it's a slow-motion train wreck you can't tear your eyes from. Director David Farrier sets out to investigate claims of an online troll named Michael Organ, a self-proclaimed ""reputation assassin"" with a penchant for manipulation and mayhem. What he stumbles into is a rabbit hole of lies, gaslighting, and psychological mind games that will leave you equal parts aghast and fascinated.Farrier's on-screen journey is the film's driving force. His initial naivety, slowly morphing into disbelief and anger, mirrors the audience's own emotional arc. We laugh at Organ's absurdity, wince at his cruelty, and ultimately find ourselves questioning: would we have fallen for his act too?""Mister Organ"" is a masterclass in suspense, building upon each revelation like a Hitchcock thriller. The film masterfully blends humor and horror, leaving you in a constant state of nervous anticipation. You know you shouldn't be enjoying Organ's antics, but there's a morbid curiosity that keeps you glued to the screen.Beyond the sheer entertainment value, ""Mister Organ"" offers a chilling peek into the dark corners of the internet and the depths of human manipulation. It's a cautionary tale about the dangers of online anonymity and the ease with which our own perceptions can be distorted.But the film's true strength lies in its portrait of resilience. The victims of Organ's abuse, who share their stories with raw honesty and courage, remind us of the human spirit's ability to overcome. Their voices serve as a powerful counterpoint to Organ's narcissistic ramblings, ultimately reaffirming the importance of truth and justice.""Mister Organ"" is not for the faint of heart. It's a wild ride that will leave you feeling drained, disturbed, and oddly exhilarated. But if you're seeking a gripping, thought-provoking documentary that dares to push boundaries and explore the darkest corners of human nature, then look no further. Just buckle up, because you're in for one hell of a ride.",False
4,7,A self aware documentary that failed? It works,maxpl-58908,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerAlmost like a slightly more aggressive, less passive Louis Theroux, Farrier delves into the story of an abusive manipulator, halfway through I enjoyed the fact that he was self aware of what he had gotten himself in to, did this bizarre man's mundane fabricated stories and rambling warrant a documentary? Maybe not, but it was still fascinating. I enjoyed watching the process of even the creator David himself getting sunk into Mister Organs draining presence and creepy passive aggressive threats.I wondered at times where the documentary would conclude, it felt lost at times. I do think this story would have had a more profound message to the audience if it explained and explored more the details of the damage to these other people who had crossed paths with Mister Organ in the past, however it sort of brushed over these leaving you to wonder how traumatising the effects of this manipulative man were.The last 20 minutes of the film wrapped the story up very well, if you enjoy Louis Theroux then you will enjoy this.",True
5,6,David Farrier is Louis Theroux's clone,chrislawuk,n/a,17/08/2025,"I don't know whether he's his doppelg√§nger or what's going on. Maybe its like a photon, he can exist in 2 different places at simultaneously-New Zealand being for all intents and purposes, the other side of the world.I mean he looks like him, talks like him, does documentaries of a similar nature just like Louis Theroux. He's probably an inch or two shorter, but that might be gravity down in New Zealand. Put him on a stretcher for half and hour and can soon sort that out.That said, he's a good documentarian if not an entirely original one, even if just by the hand of god he is unfortunate enough to be genetically very similar to his counterpart, and making dramatically similar movies and tv series.Michael Organ was a mixed bag. Its a very watchable documentary, but all said and done, once its over, you are left wondering if this guy warranted a documentary.He seems a small time crook with mental problems. If even that, as what he's doing seems pretty boarder-line illegal, although morally corrupt. The people brought forward to support the documentaries theory, that Michel Organ is the devil incarnate, all seem to be pretty crazy on their own, without anyone else needed to help them. Its pretty far fetched to seek to blame this guy for all there issues, although he's likely unpopular for good reasons.It is pretty funny in a bizarre way and Michael manages to get Farrier's knickers in a twist.",False
6,9,More great work from Farrier,hilary_nz,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerOn the surface it's another interesting Farrier doco about a very weird person who gets their jollies from manipulating people.But as the film goes on, and you start to comprehend the nefarious and vindictive nature of what is happening, it becomes a deep insight into how utterly cooked it is that we don't have any means to protect people from the Mr Organ's of the world.We hear a lot about violence in relationships in New Zealand, but this is the first time I've seen a documentary capture the destructiveness of the emotional/psychological abuse that people are forced to endure at the hands of abusers. The people who have chosen to tell their stories are incredibly brave - and I hope they never have to feel alone standing against this truly vile character.It's a wild ride, its very funny in parts... and its the most chilling insight into coercive and controlling people I've seen.",True
7,5,A lasting sense of paranoia and dread,wolfjawsucks,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI honestly don't have much to say other than, seeing something like this in my own backyard is very telling of the legal and societal parameters that allow for people like this to succeed in this country.The fact that David Farrier stands a better chance at dismantling a mega-Church than one man in Whanganui does also says something.It's funny, terrible, sad, exploitative in moments, very well put together and full of heavy dread. If you don't live in a country as small as ours I forgive you for not seeing what's to worry about when there's people like this that scurry around.Watch it! Free Jillian!",True
8,10,If you have ran into someone with NPD & ASPD you understand thisüëàüèª,emmakmonroe,n/a,17/08/2025,"If someone hasn't ran into someone like this they will never ever understand this documentary. People that have ran into these types with personality disorders will get it. I have never wrote a review I just wanted to let people know what's up about this film.So the best way of putting this are men like Michael are also known as con artists, and unfortunately that is
the best way of describing him. I doubt we will know much about his family history unless he does something very bad and gets out behind bars. Then they might be able explain it if that happens. Maybe there will be a part two. That would be very interesting to say the least.People like Michael confuse people on purpose to make themselves feel more lifting up.Once you have seen this personally you will never unsee it by doing tons of research. FYI.",False
9,3,Pointless,puteweet,n/a,17/08/2025,"A documentary about a Farrier's grudge & eventual obsession with the titular Mister Organ. There's no hard reason for the documentary to be following Organ and the film ultimately becomes the viewer being witness to Farrier's folley to find one. This all culminates in the final 20 minutes of the film Farrier desparately calling old acquaintances and asking, ""So has he got some sort of disorder? Is he a bit out-there or...? What do you think his deal is?""The documentary spends it's entire length searching for some tangible lead for the documentarian to sink their teeth into and ultimately goes nowhere & lacking.",False
10,9,Stunningly funny and astonishingly scary,mikebryantnz,n/a,17/08/2025,"The feeling of watching this in a relatively small but jam-packed kiwi cinema was absolutely fantastic.Everyone laughing and gasping along at this funny, horrifying, distressing and impactful film.If you can see it in a full theatre, absolutely do so.There were parts of the movie where my partner and I gripped each other in horror. My stomach sunk at parts and a few minutes later I was cackling merrily.David Farrier clearly put a lot of himself on the line for this movie and put himself in the sights of a very scary individual and the results are something he can be proud of.This is a brilliant piece of cinema and a stunning showcase of journalism.",False
11,2,Can't understand the hype. Farrier's teasing twists and turns that never materialise.,ben_bradford,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerHeading in to see Mr. Organ I'd read and heard nothing but good things, early rave reviews and countless plaudits for the shocking events that awaited me.Literally, even as I walked into the cinema the attendees of the previous screening were still in their seats discussing and dissecting what they'd watched, seemingly in disbelief at what had just unfolded. They assured me I was in for a wild ride, and I took my seat with the anticipation coursing through me.Post viewing, the thing I'm in disbelief about is that I hadn't seen any negative, or even middling, reviews of the film - and that I might be the only person in the country who thought it was a dud.It's mentioned in the film that New Zealand is an incredibly small place when discussing the reluctance of some of the film's subjects to go on camera. And that's entirely true. The old adage of everyone in little old NZ being connected by two-degrees-of-separation is usually not far off; in fact, I was surprised to see one of the central talking heads in the film is the husband of an ex-colleague of mine.So, my working theory is that basically everyone in New Zealand is connected to David Farrier somewhere down the line, and nobody wants to give him a bad review. He also seems like a really nice guy, more or less constantly. He has the soft demeanour and wry smile associated with other successful documentarians in getting their subjects to open up - and I too really want to like him. But I left this screening feeling like he'd strung me along with some old rope and false hope. I think Farrier may have thought he had another Tickled on his hands, but unfortunately it's more of a Fizzled.What starts out as a journalistic probe into a rogue car clamper extorting people to have their cars released almost immediately sets the expectation that worse is to come and that this guy is seriously bad news. Or, there wouldn't be a film about it, right?!Ironically though, for most of the runtime I felt like I was trapped in a car park by Farrier, pinned in by this particular vehicle that supposedly had a truckload of revelations and big reveals yet to unload.It just feels like Farrier is postulating here and teasing something that never comes. There's lots of discussion about feeling like you're losing your mind and investing lots of time with someone who is doing lots of talking without really telling you anything... and for a second there I thought that perhaps something very meta was happening - but there was no such layering or payoff there either.Similarly, there's a point in the film where Farrier is questioning his choice to make this film and pursue the subject for so long. He's fighting back tears wondering whether he's on the precipice of something big, or is just being strung along by a guy who's 'a bit of a dick'. I empathised with David here - but was internally screaming at the screen that it was the latter; the subject certainly is one of life's dickheads, but I don't think there was an entire movie's worth of content here.There are countless assertions throughout that Mr. Organ is 'dangerous' that are never really detailed more than some further cryptic anecdotes from former flatmates. One central trumped-up thread is around how on earth Mr. Organ had come to possess a key to Farrier's flat. I guess Farrier didn't want to admit that this big mystery was probably his own fault for leaving a spare key lying around; after all, he'd already covered how Organ had been snooping around outside his home. Or you know, just change the locks and give more screen time to all the REALLY bad stuff that Mr. Organ's done! *Cue tumbleweed*.There must be heaps of documentary films that abandon their story mid-way when it fizzles out, and for the final act of the film I felt like I was watching rushes of a documentary that never materialised. I'm aware that this is a pretty scathing thing to say - it shouldn't have been made - especially when the maker does really seem like such a nice guy. I just can't shake the feeling that it should have been left on the cutting room floor; or scaled back to a YouTube format webisode.The only criticism I can levy against Farrier directly as the writer/director of this whole non-story was his decision to include his fruitless attempts to interrogate the family members of Mr. Organ, who all explicitly declined to be included in the film. It's made abundantly clear that none of them wanted to be recorded, interviewed or involved at all; but Farrier's insistence not only to record these exchanges, but to include all of their refusals in the film reeked of further desperation.None of them had done anything wrong - and Farrier's hounding made me especially uncomfortable as he discusses on-film how one family member in particular seemed genuinely hurt and upset as to what had happened with their relative. But, in lieu of anything juicer I suppose, these morsels all made it into the final edit.Overall, I don't know if Farrier just believed his own hype or was egged on by production bodies that this story had more twists and turns than a particularly twisty turny thing, or if it was some sort of sad bureaucratic tenet of modern movie financing in a small country like New Zealand that now he had started his film and got the funding he simply had to make a story of it.While it's arguably better value for money than $760 for 30 minutes of parking, Farrier will do well here taking $20.50 a pop from moviegoers expecting the twists, turns and mind games alluded to on the film's poster that simply never materialise. Disappointed in both the film, and the impending withdrawal of my New Zealand Citizenship.",True
12,9,Wild ride,gallagherkellie,n/a,17/08/2025,"Holy crap, I went into this the same way I went into David Farrier's other documentary Tickled...without knowing much at all about it. And I was again in awe by the end of it.In parts I was cackling so hard (the whole cinema was). In other parts I gasped so loudly. In others I felt dread. I felt scared, sad, bewilderment. Basically anything and everything you can feel.The subject of this documentary is just plain impossible to explain. We saw David trying to explain him and he couldn't either. But he's narcissistic, manipulative and downright strange. He's also the most boring hilarious person in the world. All of this combined made for a very interesting story with lots of little twists and turns.I don't know how David finds these people but he manages to make the most insightful documentaries while putting himself in danger, and I commend him for that!I can't wait for his next movie!",False
13,5,Don't Care in the Community...,Xstal,n/a,17/08/2025,"Now here's a curious proposition, as the hunter becomes hunted and put in awkward position, in pursuit of an oddball, he's then setup to take a fall, although it's not the most engaging documentary supposition. Perhaps the maker has ambition to become Kiwi Theroux, perhaps there's little going on in far off land that live so few, but the editing is stilted, the story rather wilted, I guess if you were in his place it might make good debut. Sadly nothing is presented that engages or connects, there are crazy folk in all corners that work with great effect, they control, manipulate - navigate as they predate, leaving damage, decay, destruction and misery in their wake.",False
14,10,Riveting,southaussie62,n/a,17/08/2025,"The more I went down the rabbit hole the more interesting it got. Extremely well put together documentary about a wheel clamper but as the intro says, there's much more to this story than meets the eye. The story is intriguing and plays out much like a good whodunnit. I hear there's another documentary out by this same producer so I am going to have to source it after watching this one. Thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish. Full of twists and turns and wtf's? Almost a comedy but for the dark side of the whole story. Keeps the viewer wanting more. Highly recommend this to any armchair sleuths out there and even if you're not I think you will still enjoy it.",False
15,2,Like watching a firework that feezels out,yqpzqyv,n/a,17/08/2025,"Like watching a firework that feezels out, after the fuse burns out you sit there waiting and waiting for an explosion that never comes. This film starts with an interesting premise but nothing comes of it. Hints of twists and horrors that never take you to any place new or satisfying. The central character is painted up as this horrible human but the more you learn he isn't likeable but no where near evil as the film maker wants you to believe. As for the film maker he seems to want to be desperately likeable but his actions speak of a person quite comfortable at exploiting people for his own benefit with little regard of the effects on other people, example being the family members of Mr Organ who seem innocent but the film maker put them in the film against their requests.",False
16,10,Farrier's attempt to make sense of a madman; a human parasite who invades and destroys the weak like a slow growing cancer,davejff,n/a,17/08/2025,"When we watch a film or a documentary we have an expectation that the end brings us to a logical conclusion ; a natural close ; not so with this documentary so don't expect one because like a virus , the main antagonist of this documentary lives on to do what he does ; slowly destroying the lives of all those he involves himself with. Farrier looks into the strange world of an ego centric madman lost in his own reality; there's no happy ending , no conclusion and like a shark the main antogonist just carries on doing what a shark does. If you've never seen intot he mind of a human being that manipulates, destroy lives and brings chaos to all around them then this is an insight into an uncomfortable man who brings misery to all whose lives he invades.",False
17,3,Absolutely no hook or reason for us to stay invested,jtindahouse,n/a,17/08/2025,"'Mister Organ' has a problem. The problem is that it has no hook. It has no reason for its audience to keep watching. The film tries to begin with an intriguing scene from later on in the documentary, which is supposed to keep us curious and invested. The problem is that there is nothing intriguing about the scene. This film is going to lose a lot of people part way through because there is simply no reason given to us to push through.The film also asks us to spend a tremendous amount of time with an extremely annoying person. It is so tedious listening to these long-winded phone interviews with someone babbling on about absolutely nothing. David Farrier even mentions this himself. It's like he wanted us to be as punished by this guy as he was.Basically it seems Farrier has decided to make a career out of taking a story that is complete non-story and using clever filmmaking techniques to convince people that it is a story. There's nothing to see here. 3/10.",False
18,10,A gem of a film. Beautifully done,ian-robert-douglas,n/a,17/08/2025,"In 1977, Michel Foucault - who at the time was France's foremost intellectual - wrote a preface for a book that never materialised. His essay was called ""The life of infamous men."" The book was to be a collection of excerpts from so-called lettres des cachets - complaints that 18th Century French citizens could submit to the king about the behavior of a relative, spouse, neighbour or acquantance. From his Paris apartment, Foucault spoke about these lives rising up through the centuries. Lives condemned in a few words. Despicable personages. Scriveners. Lecherers. Fantastical usurers.Foucault admited to being more moved by these characters than by the canonical tomes of official history. In their blasted and blighted lives, he found points of fascination, and one could say more; he appeared to find a wellspring of uncanny understanding, about the human condition, about human life, about the architecture of knowledge and power that envelopes and saturates all of us, and about the straight and narrow line that runs through the decades, and around which human life gathers as it veers toward an unnameable norm.I was reminded of this essay and Foucault's feeling towards these extra-ordinary figures while watching David Farrier's documentary. It is a glimpse into a substrate of human life that reverberates almost as the mirror opposite of the branded celebrity culture we all know. A substrate of disorder and fanastical absurdity, and that is as colored by malevolence as it is quaint and incredible mundanity.Lachlan Anderson's soundtrack is perfectly pitched. It captures an emotional landscape that magnifies the question marks thrown open by the film. But what deserves more praise still is the gentle openness of Farrier himself, as a protagonist in this entire work. He seems to share something with Foucault that allows the film to be made at all. Because whereas many might back away from the subject of the documentary, Mr Organ, or respond aggressively to his behavior, Farrier approaches him as something curious and worthy of being known. And yet that does not constitute condoning Mr Organ's apparent actions. So it is less about passing judgment as it is putting into the spotlight one unique and troubled character, and yet letting that character have their say.What emerges is beyond fascinating. It's a true document that casts light on many things it would be impossible to express in words alone. In the editing, in the camera work, in the narrative, a consciousness about what is so remarkable in this story appears evident. It is this consciousness that deserves recognition. Because there is a humanism here that goes beyond mere gesture. It's real, and it brought something to light that we can all ponder, and probably learn from. What do we learn exactly. There is wonder everywhere, even amid what is distasteful and disturbing. We share this world with multiple worlds, and amid tremendous latent chaos.",False
19,2,What was the point of this?,heatherworkmanrios,n/a,17/08/2025,"Okay, so the guy is an narcissistic jerk. But there was nothing interesting enough about him to make a full on movie. I kept thinking maybe it will get better or maybe some truly heinous secrets would be revealed. But no. Just more boring stuff that literally happens on a regular basis to millions of people. The guy is a narcissist and manipulates people and lies a lot. Okay? He wasn't much different from half of the men I've dated. üòÖ
I'm thinking that if a person like this is so out of the ordinary in New Zealand that someone made a movie about him, then New Zealand must be the most boring place on Earth. And I mean that as a compliment. Because here in America, this story is just another Tuesday afternoon. A-holes like him are a dime a dozen here.The film was made well and the journalist guy seems to be good at what he does. But just way too boring of a story. I personally have known several dozen people whose lives would have made for a more interesting documentary.",False
20,9,NZ is not like this strange man,garyoneil-76018,n/a,17/08/2025,SpoilerI like the story of a weird encounter turned even stranger discovery of a seriously sick con man. He is disordered to a point - genius ? Maybe. But this shows a person who gets sucked into his world and Farrier found himself in a giant black hole. His life is now on an edge and the reality is that he was trapped in the strangest of situations with no out. I would have moved country or perhaps taken a sabbatical to the islands. The psychology that was at play is an interesting story in itself. I felt sorry for David Farrier who looked a little lost in the middle of the film. A tale to warn those impressionable people out there. Be wary. Great film.,True
21,1,Says nothing which is backed up by nothing,ksutton78,n/a,17/08/2025,"As the movie slowly progressed, in my waking moments I thought Mr Organ was in fact Ricky Gervais and we are all being duped (conspiracy theory was better than the film and there was definitely a likeness in looks and mannerisms).For 5 years journalism we have a film with numerous people saying 'dont cross him' ' poisonous', 'plays with your mind' and virtually nothing to back this up. And why is there surprise that Mr Organ doesn't want to be filmed all the time for a documentary that is not going to be complimentary, would you?The best bit was googling before hand ""how long does Mr Organ last"" and instantly regretting it!!",False
22,5,A documentary about a documentary maker making a documentary,scopesclare,n/a,17/08/2025,"I have to admit I really don't like documentaries in which the documentary maker features heavily. This is one of those documentaries. From the very beginning there is lots of narration by the documentary maker, rather than putting the story together using other sources.When the documentary fails to do the expected - uncover more serious crimes committed by the subject - it switches to an attempt to examine the subject's extremely odd and unpleasant personality.The subject of the documentary is a difficult person. A very difficult person who has burnt a hell of a lot of bridges and leaves destruction in his wake. A person who has problems telling the truth and likes to manipulate people.I have had dealings with a person like this in my life. He had a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, and the mister organ in this film is likely one of these types. A compulsive liar who can never ever admit to being in the wrong, a serial litigant who represents them self in court, and generally a pest to those he comes across. More than a pest, a menace, a palpable, malignant presence.I had a visceral reaction to this film, it brought back the bad experience I had with the same type of person in my life. Another reviewer points out that unless you have experienced a person like Mr organ, you can't know what it feels like. This part of the documentary I understood. How much the documentary maker is creeped out by his subject.But the documentary maker make some questionable decisions himself. He decides to harass the family of his subject even though it is abundantly clear they have no intention of talking to him. Yet the documentary maker takes his equipment and turns up at their door expecting them to talk to him?No of course he doesn't expect them to talk to him, he just wants a little bit of footage of them refusing to talk to him. It's the kind of journalism you see on crappy current affair shows. From the very start, he has his camera on as he approaches his subjects, before asking permission to film. There's a disingenuousness to this sort of behaviour. It reminded me of a Martin Bashir style documentary.A mistake the documentary maker made was not abandoning the project halfway through, throwing all the footage in the bin and setting fire to it. That's the only way to defeat the malignant narcissist, deny them any kind of attention whatsoever.Unfortunately people like mister organ thrive off attention, and this film will probably give him some sort of thrill. He will probably try to sue the documentary maker for defamation.",False
23,2,When a docu tips into self-indulgence,mcfrood-27885,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerSo, while this started of strong, a bit passed the halway mark, the documentary maker asks the question of an unseen friend, should I continue? It's semi-rhetorical because he answers along the lines of ""I have to, I am making a film after all."" That for me sums up this doco. It was only finished because it was started. The second half of the dick drags on and becomes increasingly self indulgent, and the viewer is left asking the question, would this film have been bothered to be more than a 20 min article in a current affairs show of the filmmaker hasn't lost in court to the antagonist? No doubt the main subject is a troubled individual, and a spreader of misery, and potentially diagnosable with a narcissistic disorder (something hardly touched on at all, and a massive missed opportunity for exploration with a qualified psych), but does he warrant an 1¬Ωhr plus expose? IMO No Way. I also feel the doorstepping ambush style of journalism, seemed at times petty and didn't endear me to the film maker. Beside the physical resemeblance definitely not a Theroux (the comparisons other reviewers have made). Overall this documentary proved to be twice as long as it needed to be, seemed too personal (maybe bordering on vindictive, not that the antagonist was a nice guy, but no criminal mastermind), and completely missed the opportunity to broaden its scope beyond the film makers own interpersonal tangle e.g. Exploring the damage that narcissists can reek - particularly to vulnerable individuals in society, thus resulting in a product that was both self indulgent and inevitably ends nowhere.",True
24,3,Sad,oversteps,n/a,17/08/2025,"I feel bad for the director. As others have pointed out, this never should have been made. The director basically admits as much, 3/4's of the way through it. And by that point, I was just kind of in a daze, wondering how on earth this got past all the levels of approval something like this would have to go through.As another reviewer stated, perhaps it's indicative of the fact NZ is so small and none of the local film community wanted to actually tell him the truth about what they really thought of it.There are some mildly amusing moments, and it has a small amount of camp factor but if I'd known how banal it would end up being I never would have watched it.",False
25,3,"Boring, wasn't sure what the point of this was",cwbzoonie,n/a,17/08/2025,"So when I heard about this documentary I thought it sounded interesting. The first part of the movie was, and then it just started going downhill for me. After a while, I couldn't even stand the sound of michael organs voice and cared nothing about him or the people around him. I don't know how anybody found this guy charismatic or interesting and his incessant talking was so annoying.Perhaps as an introvert who doesn't care for many people, this guy would not be allowed in my life and if he kept bothering me I'd slap a restraining order on him. Just listening to him for five minutes was enough for me. Why David Farrier found this guy worth this long documentary is beyond me. After a while, I didn't know what the documentary was about and why I was even watching it.Towards the end when David goes around asking everybody, what do you think is wrong with Michael? Do you think he has a disorder? I'm sitting there thinking, yeah he has a disorder, it's called malignant narcissism. This isn't some enigma or mystery to be solved. It's not rocket science. The guy is nothing more than a narcissistic conman. I didn't find him charismatic or funny or worth listening to.I'm wondering if the people who got taken in by him subconsciously wanted to be conned and abused? I don't know.. I was so bored I couldn't finish it. I would stick to David Farriers documentary Tickled. Now that one was actually interesting.",False

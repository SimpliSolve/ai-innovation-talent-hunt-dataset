1,8,Love Endures,Minnesota_Reid,n/a,16/08/2025,"At the end of World War II, a boatload of women survivors of Nazi concentration camps debarked in Malmo, Sweden, to begin new lives. Someone filmed this, and this is director Magnus Gerten third movie tracking down the stories of the women shown in that bit of film.This one is an amazing and touching transcontinental Lesbian love story, spanning prewar literary salons, World War II resistance, survival in the concentration camps, separation, reunification, and a new life in South America.Note to screenwriters: this would make a hell of a good fiction film, when you aren't constrained by what pictures happened to survive....",False
2,8,"Remarkable love story, movingly told ...",ok_english_bt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Magnus Gertten's 2022 documentary 'Nelly & Nadine', the classic love story of 2 survivors of the Nazi concentration camps of WWII, is also a film about film-making. Gertten patiently constructs a fragmented narrative to reflect his main subject's trepidation. Sylvie Bianchi is the granddaughter of Nelly Mousset-Vos, a Belgian opera singer who fell in love with a mysterious Chinese national Nadine Hwang when they met over a rendition of Puccini's 'Madame Butterfly' on Christmas Eve 1944 at Ravensbrück. In 'Nelly & Nadine', this farmer's wife in idyllic Northern France embarks on a personal journey in relation to this remarkable couple.It reminds me of another recent film, 2022's 'Three Minutes: A Lengthening'. Bianca Stigter's forensic examination of old cine film of a Polish village immediately before the Holocaust (based on the book 'Three Minutes In Poland' by musician Glenn Kurtz published in 2014) uses the moving images of people and place as a research tool for examining bite-sized pieces of erased history. 'Nadine & Nelly' starts with the archive of women refugees liberated by the Red Cross disembarking at Malmö, Sweden, on 28th April 1945, Gertten (who has made two other films about women shown in these pictures, 'Harbour of Hope' (2021) and 'Every Face Has a Name' (2015)) lets the camera hover over Nadine Hwang's intriguingly long gaze. What is she thinking? How did she get here? And we're off ...It's fair to say there are bumps in the road. Sylvie's grandmother left behind a mysterious Pandora's box of documents. By presenting 'pieces' of a story , the film raises as many questions as it answers. Gradually, a little frustratingly at times, it sets out to answer them, so I did eventually find out what I wanted to know. Probably history will take care of the rest, but for the purposes of this film 'Nelly & Nadine' is a beautiful story that affected me very deeply.A couple of noteworthy things. Reels of Super 8 film are very illuminating, mostly shot by Nadine during the couple's life in Caracas after the war, adding 'colour' and intimacy which a still photo would struggle to convey. There is also powerful prose and poetic verse, entries from Nelly's diary manuscripts which the couple worked on together after the war with a view to publishing (rejected, strangely, possibly because of the nature of their relationship and social taboos of the time). Pure horror is Nelly's account of the couple's first separation ""At the top, crowning the mountain, lies the camp, Mauthausen, the antechamber of hell"", the 5 days and nights of the train journey described in harrowing detail along with the still image of the infamous 186-step 'Staircase Of Death' carved out of stone up which quarry workers were forced to carry huge slabs of stone until they dropped dead.The film contains many other aspects, not least highlighting the journey of discovery Sylvie goes on, but 'Nelly & Nadine' comes good by the end, so it's well worth watching Gertten & Co.'s account of this remarkable couple's life. British viewers can watch on BBC iPlayer as part of the 'Storyville' collection of award-winning documentaries.",False
3,6,"""Give yourself permission to live""",evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerRavensbrück concentration camp inmate Nelly sings an aria from ""Madame Butterfly,"" attracting the attention, and a hug and kisses, from fellow political prisoner Nadine. From that day on, their bond helps to keep them alive.This beautiful-to-watch, thought-provoking documentary unfolds impressionistically, as we piece together a love story through the perspective of Nelly's granddaughter, a farmer's wife who inherited yellowed diary pages, faded photos, and strips of 8mm film.""How they managed to have a relationship like that at someplace as terrifying as a concentration camp, I just don't know,"" Anne muses. ""The chances that both of them would survive were incredibly slim.""Although the movie doesn't explain how it happens, the lovers reunite after the war, establishing a peaceful life in Caracas, Venezuela, where Nadine works at a bank and Nelly at the French embassy.Nelly was separated from her husband, and responsible for two young daughters, when the polizei arrested her at the Moliere statue in Paris. The girls were taken in by friends until liberation, and we're told that one came to dislike Nadine. (The movie is totally opaque on how Nelly eventually opts for life with Nadine rather than her kids.)We learn here that Nelly and Nadine kept separate bedrooms, called themselves cousins, and held salon-type gatherings in their well-appointed apartment. ""Nadine loved to film,"" we're told, and we see snippets of home movies spotlighting the glamorous Nelly.It's unclear whether Nelly penned her poetic writings -- "" snow like powdered sugar"" -- at the camps themselves, or authored them -- ""One day, if I return to my life..."" after the war. Whatever the circumstances, her impressions can sustain us all:""How to find the courage to survive?""",True
4,7,A lot is missing...,marianne-34569,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched it and it left me with a lot of questions. To many...It felt they didn't share all what was inside grandma's box... Instead we get to see this granddaugter who wasn't even curious enough to look inside this box for more then 20 years; when she got the box from her mother. This story is about two brave women and we start with seeing the opposite, the scared granddaughter.I missed the simple details about the grandmother. Who was this woman before the Nelly & Nadine Story started? Where was Nadine burried?Instead we get to see the same 8mm homemovies over and over again and this creates this image of two older women in your head. And when seeing that one photo again, the one with a younger Nadine wearing thick glasses, or the video of Nadine arriving in Sweden you get confused.It lacks certain details... crucial details that can be found with a little research.",False
5,10,Love conquers all things,Red-125,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nelly & Nadine (2022) is a documentary film co-written and directed by Magnus Gertten. After the German defeat, a boatload of women who had survived the concentration camps were brought to Sweden. Someone filmed the event, and director Gertten has previously identified two people in the film and made movies about them. This is the third movie, and it involves two women--Nelly Mousset Vos and Nadine Hwang.The two women met and fell in love in Ravensbrück concentration camp. They were separated, but both survived. Years later, Nelly's granddaughter contacted director Gertten, who made this meticulous documentary about a lesbian couple who traveled all over the world in order to be together.Nelly & Nadine has a good IMDb rating of 7.3. I thought it was an outstanding movie, and rated it 10. We saw this film as part of Rochester's great ImageOut, the LGBTQ Film Festival.",False
6,6,Nelly & Nadine,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"At the very start of this documentary, we are shown a photograph of a woman staring into the camera. It's fairly unlikely she knew it was pointing at the group in which she was standing, but it was taken as the Ravensbrück concentration camp was being liberated by the Swiss Red Cross in 1945. She is quickly identified as Nadine Hwang and now director Magnus Gertten tries to piece together her story. For that, he is fortunate. She kept a series of diaries and when it falls to her grand-daughter to finally read them - with quite a degree of emotion-laden trepidation - we discover that before the war she was in a loving relationship with Nelly Mousset Vos. With the aid of photographs and the sometimes quite harrowing narration from her text, we trace the lives of these two women both before and after the horrors of the Nazi invasion. Not wishing, in any way, to trivialise this - but as a documentary it's all a bit lightweight. The story itself is one that's truly ghastly, empowering, emotional and sometimes quite shocking, but factually there is just way too much missing, and what we do have to go on and/or know is squeezed just once too often. It might actually have made for a better source as a drama, allowing some of the understandable gaps to be filled in, albeit speculatively, and leaving less scope for us to have to make our own guesses about their difficulties not just with the SS but with a society as yet unfamiliar with their candid and loving lesbianism. Much of the heavy lifting comes from the soundtrack - it turns out Nelly was quite a good singer, too - but somehow it's really only the shell of a poignant story that falls disappointingly short. It is worth watching, and the plentiful photographs and some archive footage add a little richness, but it doesn't quite deliver.",False
7,10,A thought-provoking experience,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was already interested when I first heard about this documentary feature, but as someone who primarily watched fiction and especielly so on the theater, I gave it a pass for the time being.When I heard it was nominated for the Swedish equailent of the Oscar, 'Guldbagge', my interest peaked once more, and I was able to catch it on TV.For what it is, and as simply told it is, it's a very beautiful documentary. It's shot and edited very well and tells a very emotional and incredible love story, that was very interesting to be sure.Overall, I would recommend it if you're looking for an interesting documentary. In that area, it's very incredible indeed!",False
8,8,Remarkable love story with high historical value,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Nelly & Nadine"" (2022 release from Sweden; 92 min.) opens, it is ""April 28, 1945"" and a large contingent of women reach Malmo, Sweden, including Nadine Wang. The event was recorded by multiple sources, and we get some amazing footage. The voice-over wonders what Nadine was thinking about ""and I found the answer in northern France"". We are introduced to Sylvie, the granddaughter of Nelly, and keeper of tons of archive materials which she has never reviewed closely... until now. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from Swedish producer-director magnus Gertten (""Every Face Has a Name""). Here he carefully reconstructs the absolutely remarkable story of two women who meet in a concentration camp, get split up, and what came thereafter. The movie uses Sylvie's reading of numerous documents and watching ample 8mm footage to built the story, layer upon layer. The movie's pace is deliberately quite slow, so that we can register what we are hearing and watching. There is a fantastic classical score to accentuate it all.""Nelly & Nadine"" was released in late 2022, presumably so as to qualify for the Oscar nominations, which it failed to garner. Don't let that fool you. This documentary id currently rated 94% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, and for good reason. I stumbled onto this film last night on Amazon Prime. So glad I found this. Not only is the story remarkable, but it contains a ton of footage that has high historical value as well. If you are in the mood for a moving love story of a different kind, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False

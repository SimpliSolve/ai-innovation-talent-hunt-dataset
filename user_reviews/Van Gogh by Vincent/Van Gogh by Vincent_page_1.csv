1,8,A direct encounter with the soul of the artist.,gipsyblood,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a world saturated with biopics, any new film daring to tackle the incandescent life of Vincent van Gogh must offer a truly unique vision. The 2025 documentary, Van Gogh by Vincent, achieves just that, not by inventing drama, but by stripping it away to reveal the profound intimacy of the artist's own words. Rather than simply recounting his well-trod biography, the film immerses us in his world through a masterful narration of his letters, allowing Vincent himself to guide us through his passions, his torment, and his unwavering dedication to his craft. For anyone who has ever been moved by a stroke of his brush, this film is an essential pilgrimage. It forgoes sensationalism for something far more powerful: a direct encounter with the soul of the artist. To watch this film is to understand that Van Gogh's greatest creation was not any single canvas, but the extraordinary, vibrant, and deeply human life he lived.",False

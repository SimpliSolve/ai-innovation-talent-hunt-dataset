1,8,Love is love,akira-hideyo,n/a,15/08/2025,"What stands out from this docu-biographic film is raw courage, faith and hope that true love will triumph over deliberate obstacles and challenges created both by circumstances and an extremely primitive political eco-system against LGBTQI+ in Hungary. What these 2 protagonists faced for their life commitment to each other is nothing short of miraculous. Not many men, hetero or otherwise, would have had the same public bravado to showcase their struggles and continual fight globally through this film plus their on going media projects. They proved beyond any doubt that they possess the real alpha qualities of real men that fight and win wars that inspire revolutions that inspire mere mortals to fantasize for that honor but lack courage to emulate for unspeakable consequences. God bless them both with all their communities rising up to meet them rightfully.",False

1,1,Tripe and word salad,mymumbakescakes,n/a,15/08/2025,Same old arguments. Same old nonsense.Nothing new here.It is just a condensed version of Eric's 200 proofs in film version.,False
2,1,It should be zero stars.,travismarshall-51437,n/a,15/08/2025,Eric Subway is a yoga instructor. His lack of intellect is hilarious. The Earth is NOT FLAT. Dubay surrounds himself with an echo chamber of idiocy. These morons couldn't find their way out of a cardboard box. It's laughable that this idiotic tripe can be published. This sort of idiotic drivel leads to the dumbing down of our already mentally inept society. Do yourself a HUGE favor and watch the flat earth movie on Netflix instead. We should all point and laugh at these morons. We shouldn't be giving them a platform to spread their moronic views.,False
3,1,Rehash of tired flat earth arguments,rnjoe,n/a,15/08/2025,"A white rapper, a tattoo artist, a musician, a martial arts instructor, a cowboy, and others rehash debunked flat earth arguments and demonstrate arguments from ignorance, arguments from incredulity, cherry picking, and quote mining. The last segment is a Neil DeGrasse Tyson hate fest. If you are in the flat earth cult, you will probably find something to chant in agreement. This is more an Eric Dubay infomercial than a documentary.",False
4,1,I think there's been a mistake!,chilledpilchard,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is categorised as a documentary... Move it to comedy and I'll change my review to 10/10. Even though it's the same old arguements, it's hilarious how they've recycled them and still included, on screen, blatent errors in their points. It almost looks deliberate. Looking forward to a follow up with some actual new ideas.Although for what it's worth, fair play for actually making this. It's more effort than most flat earthers would have gone too, so at least you have that to be proud of.",False
5,1,Very mixed feelings,mihaimm-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"On one hand, when you hear the flat Earth ""researchers"" speak, you will feel much, much better about yourself. And, if something (anything) that would seem like a ""proof"" is not immediately and clearly flawed to your mind, all you have to do is search for a debunk of that ""proof"". In this way you can actually learn what's happening and how to see the same for yourself. So... from this point of view, it's nice: you feel good about yourself, and you can search information elsewhere to learn about some phenomenons.On the other hand, the fact that people waist resources (like oxygen) in order to put out something like this is very worrying for the future of humanity itself. What went so badly wrong that people need to believe in something so obviously false? How can the education system fail so miserably as to have people as inept as these at math, physics and... observation? Are we heading straight for Idiocracy?? Should we worry that is the dystopian future and not 1984, or Brave New World?",False
6,10,Hilarious parody of Flat-Earth documentaries,junk-810-381519,n/a,15/08/2025,"This perfectly parodies flat-earth documentaries. Very realistic.They didn't even use pseudoscience, skipping instead straight to the most hardcore of the not-sciences: anti-science.They:1. Tell us science is wrong (because... well, see: #1).2. Dismantle reality with common sense (again: see #1).3. Bring it home, taking full advantage of anti-science by exempting their own claims from the burden of proof, or even evidence.They just care about claims. It's the best faction of the anti-science crowd: ""If I can imagine it, it's real. And I've got it inked up and down my sleeves, bruh.""The actors nail the we-own-the-truth elitism projected by real flat-earthers.Any one of them could win an award for capturing that empty, nothing-going-on-in-here flavor of ignorance worn on every face. That kind of realism can only be the work of highly trained method actors.Can you imagine what kind of world it would be if someone put an alcoholic tat-bro in charge of All the Science? The guy in this can. Well written characters.You won't find a better spoof of flat-earth documentaries. And you won't find a better spoof of flat-earth rap soundtracks.",False
7,1,Funny,Beno_HR,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you don't take it seriously, it's a funny mockumentary about a complete failure of educational system.",False
8,10,Here is the problem.,stonyfony,n/a,15/08/2025,"If i just knew what school have teched me i would rate this a 1 out of 10.I have read a lot books in my life, from 1500 to now times.Almost everything in this documentary that being said can be traced in old literary. So I believe he is on to something and ignorance will tech you nothing.Read your old texts, internet is not everything.Love.",False
9,7,some hiccups but overall an exciting development for counter mainstream narratives,muhammadshahnur,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie was eagerly awaited and overall im happy with the outcome. Some of the proofs for flat earth here i dont agree with, but only because it suggests a model thats different from the one i adhere to myself. However, the film managed to highlight some key objective arguments for a non spinning, flat plane that we all live on. Debunking NASA and demolishing the proponents of the heliocentric model like Niel deGrasse Tyson and the like was enjoyable to watch and i always chuckle from seeing the moon landings story utterly destroyed.I didnt enjoy the aggresive tone of the movie, i think that was unnessasry and also the 'bad boy' type image that some of the guys here were displaying. Its true that Joe Rogan was going to have Tyson debate Eric Dubay but the way it was presented felt a little cringey.Love the mic drop at the end! Overall a good movie and another step in the mass worldwide awakening taking place in all corners. Very happy to have watched it!",False
10,1,This is nonsense.,ssteffy,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is idiotic gibberish from people who for some reason love to trumpet their ignorance of basic physics and science to the world. I have not seen one piece of their ""evidence"" that cannot be explained as just misunderstanding the actual correct explanations and the science that supports those explanations.",False
11,1,Not recommended,mschedler49,n/a,15/08/2025,"Poorly written and excessively slow. I found it difficult to get to the end of the film. The subject matter is confusing and frequently contradicts itself. As a documentary, it explores it's topic from a single viewpoint and offers very little commentary or explanation that makes sense.This could have been much better if the presenters had provided some source material for the subject. References or additional source materials would have been very helpful to me as a viewer.In short, I found it to be somewhat boring and unremarkable, lacking substance as a documentary, and no real entertainment value either. I would not recommend this title at all.",False
12,1,Seriously??????,cdftqkhgb,n/a,15/08/2025,"The fact that this movie even got 1 star is only down to the fact that I couldn't give it a negative score.Never have I seen a bigger example of misunderstanding of reality, cherry picking of information without fully researching the subject, lack of scientific knowledge, cognitive dissonance and disregard of scientific facts.These people obviously didn't manage to pass any form of science classes in school and their 'research' consists of them watching other Flat Earth 'Truth' videos and reading ancient books that confirm their already biased attitudes towards the shape of the earth.If you want to watch a movie about people misunderstanding science and reality then this is the movie for you.",False
13,1,ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£,moldysnowballs-24160,n/a,15/08/2025,"The earth isn't flat! A sun set proves it. If the earth was flat, the sun would remain high in the sky and get smaller as it disappears. What happens in reality? The sun stays the same size, and appears to dissappear under the horizon.",False
14,1,Tripe,strangegoat-02838,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe wilful ignorance of science and reality displayed in this piece of work is simply outstanding. Literally everything mentioned within it has been thoroughly debunked repeatedly. This 'documentary' is nothing more than a collection of lies, deceitful statements and mis-information. It is merely snake oil for those gullible enough to pay for the 'unedited' version.",True
15,1,Math/geometry is the cure,Arnror_II,n/a,15/08/2025,"Flat earthers, propose a geometric claim, yet none of them has even come within ten yards of a geometry text book without fainting.It's their CryptoniteAnd we keep laughing our ba_ls off.Never change, but stay out of my country!!Hihi!",False
16,n/a,Really boring.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,This film drones on incoherently randomly skewing voices and lacking anything resembling scientific evidence or even simple reason.,False
17,10,Outstanding masterpiece,governmentlabrat,n/a,15/08/2025,"The one star ratings here are hilarious. This information really has people sweating, the 'reviews' of one stars that I have glanced through have either watched the wrong documentary or haven't watched one at all.It's quite clear that their efforts aren't working anymore as majority of the flat world knows this information, and those who still have a brain cell to ignore the biased lying reviews will only be faced with undoubtable truths that will change your life!The movement does not believe we're a spinning disk in space. We are at the bottom of the universe with everything revolving around us - just like we see and experience.Say goodbye to social conditioning!!Just to confirm - great documentary.",False
18,1,Baffling....,tommo-59790,n/a,15/08/2025,".....beyond words. This film contradicts itself at every turn, presents zero factual evidence - and is devoid of any artistic content. A monotenous regurgitation of tired rhetoric, presented in an 'edgy' style (yawn) - not the worst film in the world - but close.As another reviewer here pointed out - if your guests have overstayed their welcome, play this, they'll soon leave.",False
19,10,What a wonderful documentary,scientist-08817,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you to those involved in this film. I am a home school teacher and have been providing education away from corporate schooling for over 10 years.This film is extremely detailed and fact based, it actually provides more evidence for the flat earth model than can be provided for our well known globe theory. What people must realise is that despite nasa and social conditioning - there isn't any way of proving that we live in a spinning ball. Science tells us that water is always flat and level, it cannot stick to a ball moving faster than a bullet through space. It's so blatantly obvious we are not moving and the sun moon and stars all circle us. We are the centre of the universe we are all special- even those who live to deny the truth. Thank you hibbeler productions.",False
20,1,Senseless tripe,rorynewby,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerIf you are that easily led then this is for you. Enjoy.,True
21,1,Propoganda not documentary,Homer_Ate2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good to see IMDb changed the classification to fantasy as this film has no factual basis in reality. There's no evidence in this, just rhetoric. You're lead down the conspiratorial trail by people who are as far away from science as you could image. If it wasn't for cherry picking these denialist would have zero content.",False
22,1,Great Fiction film,sallyhardy-90794,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're interested in watching something about as real as The Hobbit, then enjoy this.Full of unsubstantiated fairytales, all of which have been debunked.",False
23,1,"The Earth isn't flat, and this film presents no novel ideas",eddyweg,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film is is a bad re-hash of a collection baseless assertions which all familiar with flat earth claims will all have heard and seen debunked before.There is little entertainment value as the presentation is enough to induce sleep.In the entire film, sadly no actual evidence is ever presented to back up the assertion, which should surprise nobody but does make one wonder what the purpose therefore was.I can find nothing of merit, and worse, the film pushes an anti-science anti-education agenda which I find very regrettable; the 21st century is becoming the home of the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory and here is just another unsubstantiated conspiracy. It does not offer anything new, and not even any food for thought. Sadly everything here is long debunked already, and that's sthe simple truth.If you want to check you live on a globe then just watch a sunset or a sunrise. Because they can't happen on a flat earth. The end.",False
24,1,Nothing new to see here.,yobbo-32904,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just the same old rehashed Flat Earth proofs that have been debunked hundreds of times over. Also this is not the first Flat Earth documentary, that was done by Netflix last year. And two famous Flat Earthers proved not only rotation, but curvature.",False
25,1,A very poor attempt to prove the earth is flat,daniel-77181,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yet again more false information about the earth and the people that 'control' it. The earth has been proven, scientifically and visually, yet stuff like this gets released to prey on the weak minded to fund their lifestyle.",False

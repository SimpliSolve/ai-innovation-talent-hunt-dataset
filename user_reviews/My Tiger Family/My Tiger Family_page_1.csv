2,n/a,Here Kitty Kitty,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm working on my bucket list and a visit to Ranthambhore is the next notch. Anyone traveling to see India's wildlife should watch this. Just beautiful. The connection the narrator feels with these tigresses comes through the screen. I wish this were available on more streaming services. Tigers are the main characters in this but the preserve has lots of birds and fauna that make it worth a visit. Thank you Valmik Thapar. We will be there in October! I know Wild Tiger spotting is not guaranteed but luck may be with us. Just know that if I vanish without a trace my last words were ""here kitty kitty"".",False

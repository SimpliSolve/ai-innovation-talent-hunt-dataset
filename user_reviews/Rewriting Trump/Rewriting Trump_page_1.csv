1,1,A despicable hit piece by Michael Wolff !,FoxfordCounty,n/a,15/08/2025,Michael Wolff ignores the electorate and general feeling on major issues raised during the 2024 US Election. Discards all public opinion to narrate his own opinion where Trump and many more people are slated by a disaster artist who refuses to accept reality. Continues to demonize Kamala Harris as well highlighting that it's just an attack on everyone this old man doesn't agree with. All in a bid to stay relevant. When Wolff knows that the only thing that will keep him relevant is attacking Donald Trump. Really can't get head around how this documentary. Offers any amount of problems but zero solutions to any of them. Anti-America whether you are a Democrat or a Republican. Vile.,False
2,10,Marmite guy,christianberrisford-51236,n/a,15/08/2025,"The reviews are ether people who worship Trump or detest him, the first give it one star the latter ten, so these reviews are less about the subject matter in its entirety and more about the man. Personally enjoyed this, but to be honest for the wrong reasons and yes gave it a ten...Actually wonder if we could know this man anymore intimately (some probably won't want to) but yes there is lot more crazy to come. Lol
This second term in power has been eventful even in so short a time. So look forward to getting behind the scenes again in any forthcoming documentarys.Love or hate him, he will be remembered.........",False
3,10,Brilliant documentary,lornavassallo,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWonderful and fascinating documentary, following author Michael Wolff through the Trump 2024 campaign. Spoiler: there are revelations about how close Trump and Epstein really were. Recordings of Epstein describing their friendship of 10 yearsStormy Daniels also interviewed and she came across as believable. Trump has never sued her of course. He was found guilty of a felony.Wolff himself is an interesting character, seasoned journalist but even he is shocked at the performance of Joe Biden at the Presidential debate.A must watch for anyone interested in how America put Trump back in power.",True

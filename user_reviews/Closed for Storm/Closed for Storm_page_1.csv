1,5,A Chaotic Storyline That Didn't Paint the Full Picture,jongamer-53413,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a big fan of Bright Sun Films and have been anticipating this documentary since it's announcement.However the film was sorta a let down for me and heres why:1. The IntervieweesI found almost all the interviews to be lacking structure and the story's a bit dull. During the behind the scenes video they did express how difficult it was to find qualified people to interview and I definitely believe that would be a huge challenge on a topic like this.The interviewees didn't really provide much insight into the actions/decisions made behind closed doors within Six Flags Corp. Ryan Bordenave however, was a fantastic speaker and storyteller of the events that unfolded.I think the story was too focused on the old fun memories than on the hurricane/abandoned situation itself.2. The HurricaneI found the transition into the hurricane itself (president bushes address) super sudden with only the one interviewee mentioning it quickly. It didn't flow too well.I was expecting most of the documentary to be footage/stories of the hurricane itself. However the footage of the storm only lasted a few mere minutes.3. The Parks DecayThe lack of close up footage of the park decay and abandoned state really shocked me. There were a lot of fantastic drone shots but it was impossible to really see the overgrown/decay of the rides and buildings from above. There really should have been a lot of close up and jaw dropping B roll shots of the park.During one part they were exploring a few of the buildings, but that was it. Not much exploring the rides or other areas of the park.4. Ending VoteI may not have picked up what was going on during the voting section at the end of the film but I didn't think it was clear what was actually happening. Who were these companies they were voting on? And what was the plan?5. The Interview Camera Work(This one is kinda a nitpick)Being a videographer for many years myself I was really surprised on the style of camera shots they chose for the interviews. The vast majority of the shots had the background in almost clear focus with no depth of field. This may have been a personal choice but it is uncommon to see that shot style in films.ConclusionI know I was super harsh here but I really wanted to be honest of my thoughts on the film. This was a major achievement for Bright Sun Films and the team should be super proud! I'd still watch it again and recommend to my friends! Great work!The score was also incredible! It really gave Toy Story vibes at times.",False
2,7,"A worthwhile effort, needs refining",rmmil,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ultimately it is my hope that a documentary educates me about a topic I know little / nothing about, and makes me care about it. In this sense this documentary succeeds. I didn't know about Six Flags New Orleans, and I care that it was destroyed. Those poor people.From a technical perspective, there was some ironing out that could have been done. The music is often too loud, and misplaced. The narrator should either narrate less or more, it comes out of nowhere, but some random images I would have liked to know more about them.The film, when they finally show the post-hurricane park? It's underwhelming, and too many instances of hearing the director exclaim things like ""Oh my God!"" or ""Holy Christ!"" Not sure that added anything?What I liked though, was a lot. It was done on a budget, but made good use of drones to capture footage. Good interviews with relevant people to the story. And again, the story made me feel something, so that's a win in my book.",False
3,6,"Decent, but lacks focus",fischer_patrick,n/a,15/08/2025,"Is this film about the rise and fall of the park? Is it about the greater Hurricane Katrina story? Is it about the failure of local politics on New Orleans East? Is it just a cool urban exploration of an abandoned park? The film tries to be all of these things which hurts it over all. The film could have been sharpened it's focus on one or two of these themes and been better served for it. That being said, it still was an interesting documentary and will hopefully spur some action to help the local residents who want something done with the land.",False
4,n/a,Mother Nature always wins in the long run.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a retired ""senior"", I have seen and/or experienced many acts of nature over my lifetime. My fond expression, because it is true, ""Mother Nature always wins in the long haul.""In the case of the new amusement park in New Orleans, opened as Jazzland in 2000, it didn't take very long. Hurricane Katrina in August of 2005 pretty much did the deed as it did to much of the rest of New Orleans. The park has remained closed and abandoned since that time.This documentary deals with all that, plus some recent years efforts to either rebuild it or re-purpose it but so far it still stands dilapidated, just a ghost of its short glory years. The title comes from a sign at the park's entrance which still says ""Closed for Storm.""I found this documentary very interesting with interviews with many people, some video of the park when it was new and thriving, some current video of the ruins, and a view of New Orleans neighborhoods in the Katrina aftermath. What the documentary could have used was periodic subtitles that specified when, e.g. ""June 2010"" or ""May 2020"" to inform exactly when certain things were represented by the documentary. But overall pretty interesting. I have never visited the park but do remember driving by on I-10 headed east.I found it on Amazon streaming videos.UPDATE: March 8, 2023 - It was just announced that a deal has been made for a 4-year, $500 Million project to clean up the site and convert it into a brand new theme park. Most details are not yet available.",False
5,6,"Like the sign that reads ""Closed for Storm"", the park is frozen in time with several of the office calendars still showing August 2005 as today's date.",TheDocumentaryDistrict,n/a,15/08/2025,"Closed for Storm is just another example of how the bureaucracy of major corporations and government often leave citizens to pick up the pieces when hard to handle situations surface.It's hard to believe that it has been 15+ years since Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc on the New Orleans area. It's even harder to believe that there are places like the former Six Flags New Orleans (Jazzland Park) that have sat untouched for the last decade and a half. Walls caked with mold, buildings graffitied, ride vehicles stripped of anything valuable, towering rollercoasters that look like they could collapse at any moment, and a sign that has fittingly read ""Closed for Storm"" have remained in place for the last 15 years. These are just some of the disheartening images Closed for Storm features.In Closed for Storm, several people were interviewed about the abandoned park, each one nostalgic for what once was and what could have been. You can't help but feel the disappointment in a number of the interviewees' tones when it came time to talk about the redevelopment, or lack thereof, of the property. As mentioned, we see bureaucracy show itself near the end of the film when plans for redevelopment of the area appears to leave out the voices of the citizens of East New Orleans and ultimately leave them with no real resolve.Not only was it sad to see the archived footage of people's homes destroyed in 2005, but it was just as sad seeing this same area struggling to bounce back all these years later. The citizens of East New Orleans were promised increased property values and a Disney-like atmosphere, but instead, they were left with views of an abandoned amusement park and a never-ending cycle of unimplemented redevelopment plans.The Film:
Closed for Storm is filled with aerial shots of the the former Six Flags New Orleans property, stitched together with home videos from the early 2000s. Much like Bright Sun Films' YouTube videos, we get an inside look at several of the abandoned buildings and observe the damage that Mother Nature has done. Promotional videos are the perfect touch for viewers unfamiliar with the park's significance or history to understand the importance of the former Jazzland. Like the sign that reads ""Closed for Storm"", the park is frozen in time with several of the office calendars still showing August 2005 as today's date.In Closing:
If you have ventured to this film from Bright Sun Films' YouTube page, you're a fan of theme parks, or you familiar with New Orleans/Jazzland history, then this film is perfect for you. For those of you who may not understand the history of Six Flags New Orleans, I would still highly recommend Closed for Storm. The film pieces new footage with old footage in a way that tells a proper story of the park and its history.-The Documentary District-",False
6,7,Decent documentary with a couple issues,marcadamweiner,n/a,15/08/2025,"I decided to buy this documentary both because I'm a huge fan of Bright Sun Films and because I'm a hardcore roller coaster enthusiast. I have had a huge interest in Jazzland/Six Flags New Orleans in the past and I couldn't pass this up when I found out it was being made.Closed for Storm is an expertly made documentary with absolutely stunning drone footage of the abandoned park and the surrounding area. The cinematography is on point and the interview segments are very well done. I greatly enjoyed the storytelling of how the park was designed, built, operated and ultimately destroyed, and the historical footage provides a glimpse of the past and complements the interviews perfectly. Once we get to the Hurricane Katrina section it did tug on my heartstrings, with the footage of flooded homes, blazing fires and livelihood in ruin; I really felt for the people of New Orleans even though I was fairly young when the hurricane actually hit. I enjoyed the accounts by previous employees as well; they gave life to the park in a way that I had not considered before. This park employed hundreds of people and served as an escape for thousands in the area before Mother Nature came to remind everyone who was in charge. The soundtrack is also fantastic and it gave me chills on multiple occasions. I was really impressed overall by the documentary and I'm glad I pre-ordered it, if only to support one of my favorite YouTubers with his filmmaking endeavors. This documentary does not feel like an extended Bright Sun Films video, by the way - it's its own thing.However, I do have a couple of issues with it. Number one is length - I feel like the documentary could have been 30 minutes shorter had some of the cinematic footage been cut; the footage of the theme park is great, but I found that there was a ton of unrelated footage that padded runtime and made the film unnecessarily long. At times I felt that this footage even took the place of a story, as it cut in at seemingly random times. This also goes for a few snippets of interview; although the vast majority of interview footage was necessary and interesting, there were a couple of times that I questioned if what I just heard was really needed to effectively tell the story.This leads to my second issue, which is the story itself. The first half of the film is fantastic; it's essentially a chronological retelling of everything that happened with expertly filmed drone footage, historical video and interviews with people involved in the development and operation of the park. However, at about the halfway point or a little after, it started getting a bit messy. The timeline became unclear and it started getting into the nitty-gritty of two separate redevelopment plans that weren't ever finalized. Although this portion of the documentary did express how complicated the whole situation is and how indecisive the City of New Orleans is, I don't entirely think it was necessary to get into such detail with both of the plans; I think it would have been better to simply highlight any and all plans that have been proposed and/or rejected and make the documentary far shorter, ending it on a much stronger note than what was actually achieved.Overall though, Closed for Storm is great. It's filled with breathtaking aerial footage of the abandoned park and interesting interviews that tell us the story of the development, operation and ultimate downfall of Six Flags New Orleans. The documentary does a superb job at conveying this through a mix of cinematic shots and urban exploration footage, similar to what you'd normally see on the Bright Sun Films YouTube channel. The urban exploration footage is very neat (although most of it was filmed at night with a flashlight for some reason) and I'm glad it was included as a supplement to the film. For the first attempt at a documentary by filmmaker Jake Williams, Closed for Storm is fantastic and I'd highly recommend checking it out.PS: It would've been cool to see footage from on top of the rides or climbing up them, but maybe Jake is saving that for his YouTube channel ;)",False
7,6,In the middle of things.,lu_lou_belle,n/a,15/08/2025,"You know how sometimes you're with some casual friend, acquaintance or coworker, and they relate a story as if you know everything about their life and social group, when you mostly have no idea what they are talking about? That's one of the main weaknesses in this film. It feels like viewing random home movies. I say that having lived in Louisiana for longer than I ever thought I would, with multi-generational ties to New Orleans and it's surroundings. Nonetheless this is a pleasant enjoyable passion project that will be appealing to urban explorers and fans of childhood chimeras.I couldnt begin to tell you who, how and why Jazz-land was ever built, and I lived there during the years when its inception was becoming a reality. It always sounded like a boondoggle to me. Coming out of the era of very high murder rates and economic malaise in the early- mid 90's, it must have taken people with extraordinary vision and tenacity to bring it to fruition, long before Katrina came along. That is certainly one story worth telling, not told here.For to me the vast terrain of New Orleans East as observed from the roads and highways is a wasteland of broken dreams, consistent neglect and strange decade-specific civil planning experiments, one after the other abandoned in boom bust cycles, that are not visible in such stark relief in the more densely populated areas the city. It is geographically and metaphorically out of sight, out of mind for the rest of the city and suburbs. This documentary could be improved by rooting it in such geographical context, and support its positions with some input from area architectural historians, for a little grounding in objectivity, solving the film's problem without delving into the byzantine and arcane chicanery that got it open, and promptly forgot about it when an opportunity presented itself.For the few years it was open, it was loved by the people that went, and profitable even as it was left to its own devices. That is the story that is attempted here, in its personal nostalgic tone of mourning for what was lost and might have been. I have seen these same post Katrina. Videos and snapshots, the mold and watermarks and the drone of insects buzzing in someone's abandoned office or home. A story that is told over and over in New Orleans, which never was and never will be The Big Easy for the people that call it home.Very recently I have heard rumblings that it might revert to a natural park of some sort. There is much enthusiasm in New Orleans these days for streamlined light-handed reclamation of abandoned or not so abandoned properties to ecologically stable public use, along the lines of NYC's The Highline. I hope such enthusiasm is sustained beyond the current real estate bubble.",False
8,6,"Not great, but not bad either",nancylmarine,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'd often wondered what happened to this amusement park after Katrina destroyed it. I was glad to see this documentary. I enjoyed seeing the abandoned park and the destruction Katrina heaped upon it.I was not happy to see what's stalling anything at all happening with this abandoned park is typical Louisiana politics.My dad was stationed in Louisiana back in the 60's and my mom would regale us with tales of the crooked politics of the state. She once told of a parish sheriff so bad the national guard had to remove him for his illegal activities. After he got out of prison, he was re-elected sheriff. My mom overheard someone she worked with telling another person the reason they voted for the criminal sheriff: ""I felt sorry for his mama.""
And that's Louisiana politics in a nutshell.Katrina's storm surge, which is what actually happened to NOLA, not a hurricane, could have been held back had the powers that be in the local and state governments hadn't insisted on the Corps of Engineers NOT do the upgrades to the levees they wanted to do.What this documentary does, more than anything else, shines a light on the cesspool of Louisiana, more specifically NOLA, politics.It's been 10 years since an RFQ was issued, and three contractors were chosen for further review, but it never happened. Why? Oh, because it's just the poor people in NOLA East who are suffering under the neglect of their city's government.Sadly, nothing will come of this documentary's major point, which is... There is 140 acres of blight in the city and no one in a position to do so will do anything about it.I saw buildings that could be converted to housing. I saw buildings that could be retrofitted to be restaurants and stores, making for a beautiful outside shopping experience.The bones are there to do something wonderful. The politics of NOLA is what's holding it back.",False
9,4,Worthwhile but odd documentary with obnoxiously annoying stock soundtrack,johnbthomasiii80,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerWeird little documentary that tells the story of what happened to Six Flags over NOLA. Interesting but amateurish. The soundtrack is incredibly annoying - like it was borrowed from some 1950's school science film.,True
10,6,Story of corrupt and incompetent city management,Erik_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sad to see things like a theme park fall into a derelict state, but government mismanagement and corruption is what New Orleans is known for. Even other corrupt, Democrat cities like New York can handle being hit with category 3 hurricanes, like Katrina was on landfall.New Orleans is controlled by such malicious, inept, morons that only crooks can be successful there.That is what this story is about, but it is not presented this way.The derelict park actually represents New Orleans and local residents more accurately now, than it did while it was owned an operated by out-of-state owners.Still a somewhat entertaining watch if you like ghost town type stories.",False
11,3,Underwhelming,chris-h-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"I think the biggest problem with this is that there is no story here. It opens with title cards and lots of dramatic music suggesting a scandal or mismanagement and then... there is nothing.If you remember this park you might get some nostalgic enjoyment from seeing video of the park and if you are young enough to not remember Katrina then you might get something from seeing the footage of that, but beyond that there is nothing here.The film opens with no context, with the first interviewee mentioning a lot of people and names that we don't know and won't hear anything else about as the film goes on. The film is very superficial as a whole, companies and people are mentioned as if we should know more about them but you don't actually learn very much about the park other than, a park opened, it wasn't very profitable, there was a hurricane, the park closed. It feels like the only research done was to quickly scan the parks Wikipedia page.Technically the sound levels aren't great and more the dramatic music at times drowns out the talking head interviews and the interviewees as a whole aren't particularly revealing of anything or engaging. At times some of the footage just seems random and out of context, we get someones home video of them driving around which goes on for several minutes and then someone in a back room at the closed park excited to find some Halloween decorations in the trash there. It does seem very padded out, I think you could probably edit this down to about 30 minutes and not lose anything of worth. The narration is sparse to the extent that its a surprise when something is said.Overall this feels like a student project with decent production values and, for me, was generally lacking.",False
12,8,A Fantastic Look into the Devastating Effects of Katrina on a Specific Spot,babellec,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a huge fan of Jake, Bright Sun Films, and the Abandoned series he makes on YouTube.This takes his concept from that Abandoned series to a long-form feature-length medium on all major platforms for the first time.The documentary itself focuses on the rise and fall of New Orleans first major theme park. Jake does a fantastic job finding people from the community and interviewing them. He digs to the soul behind the abandoned structures. He also does a great job giving us the history of the park before Katrina so we as viewers care about the park as much as the people in the community did.My biggest nitpick would be I found the last 15 minutes to be a little flat. The producers on the project gambled choosing to follow a few specific people trying to repurpose the land; no one got the ending they wanted. The gamble could have paid off, but even as is, I think there was a missed opportunity to show more of the heartbreak and disappointment this plot of land has been subjected to for the last 15 years. The last few scenes in the documentary are flat because we didn't get a deep emotional pay-off on one of the narratives they set up. Digging in deeper on the heartbreak and frustration of those people that were trying to repurpose the land may have elevated the final moments of this documentary just a touch.If you are a fan of Abandoned on YouTube, this is a must-watch. If you are just a general fan of documentaries, this holds its own without any knowledge of Jake's previous work. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in Katrina, New Orleans, theme parks, or urban exploration. For a first feature-length documentary this is an amazing achievement and Jake could easily find himself helming more documentaries in the future!Well done and keep up the great work!StrengthsJake is a fantastic narrator (A+++)*** His slow and clear cadence works perfectly with the somber abandoned material, sweeping drone footage, and delivery of heartbreaking backstory; this is a skill he seasoned with hours of YouTube narration and he has a gift for narration***Interesting and diverse interviews cut well against other footage and peppered throughoutGreat footage. The drone work on the abandoned park is fantastic. They also mine old footage to juxtapose the current dilapidated state of rides against the vibrant footage from the past. Very well cut and one of the strengths of both this documentary and the Abandoned series!WeaknessesAt times the score overpowered the narration early; they did seem to dial this down later but I found a few spots in the beginning that the narration was fighting with the scoreThe last 15 minutes was a bit of a letdown.",False
13,6,a comedy?,pm2025,n/a,15/08/2025,Just wondering if this is meant to be a comedy because of the background music. It's more like a melodrama than a documentary. Interesting story but a bit too much cringe.,False
14,5,A good story in need of major work,solitudeape,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a big fan of the various Bright Sun Films, I was expecting a lot. This film either needed a whole lot more content to sustain the feature length or should be heavily edited and make it a short film.Instead, it feels like one of their 25 minute Youtube videos with added, and duplicative, content. There is only so much meandering through the carnage wrought by Katrina the audience can take. Additionally, my guess is that the interviews they conducted had few gems. So, they chose to include a lot of filler, dull comments to keep striving for a feature film.It didn't work.",False
15,n/a,What was that,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first half came off as a normal documentary, but the second half was just interviewing two people about the future of the park. Terribly boring. The creator must have run out of ideas or money.",False
16,7,"Like the Big Easy, this documentary lacks care",stinky_kniggits,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNew Orleans is the city that care forgot. Having been to the park, after Six Flags bought it, as well as being from the region and old enough to remember Ponchatrain Beach amusement park and the rides they had there (many were installed at Jazzland in one name or another). True research would have shown that there were efforts to bring amusement parks to other areas in the region: Biloxi Beach, Madison County, Mississippi, and Jazzland.New Orleans loves its nostalgia and that's why they wanted a park. They wanted to remember better times when the park was on the lake. Hence the dream and vision for Jazzland. As an observer, I knew it was going to fail. It was not a shock that they zeroed out so soon. As such, 6 Flags got a bargain.One evening, I got a call from them asking me to buy season tickets for the family. I guess they had my number from visits in other parks. I declined, but took the family there that season (2003). The rides were 'okay'. The water used was dirty swamp water. So when you see the kiddos on the walkover waiting to get splashed, it was with dirty swamp water, no cleaned filtered water. To me, it was a reason never to go back.The swing (the one the paralyzed woman rode), was not included in the park entrance fee. You paid extra to do it. Another reason not to go. The region is too poor to afford things like this. That's why 6 Flags bailed. They cut their losses. Between dealing with unbearably hot weather, poor patrons looking to save every nickel they could, and the corrupt governments of NOLA and the state, it was destiny.This film did not cover these topics. As such, it's okay. But I give it a higher score than it deserves.Would have loved to have seen the 2020 versions of some of the kids in the home videos.",True
17,6,"Competent, but runs out of steam",gmaileatsyourlunch,n/a,15/08/2025,"CLOSED FOR STORM does a good job covering the park's history pre- and post-Katrina. Some of the footage is amazing and shocking, particularly the aerial footage when it was flooded by the hurricane.However, as an overall documentary, it doesn't quite engage. The former park employees are adequate in relating their memories, but just not terribly interesting. The park itself had a short history and hadn't had a chance to really become part of the landscape and culture of New Orleans.If you're a fan of theme parks or urban exploration, you'll probably enjoy it.",False
18,6,A decent look at an abandoned park,lhmosca,n/a,15/08/2025,"What I don't get is that of these filmmakers weren't trespassing, why film inside at night with flashlights.

""Closed for Storm"" focuses the tragedy on a place whose sole purpose was to bring joy. Heartbreaking to see what happened..
Great use is made of vintage footage showing the park in happier times and the interviewees are clearly sad about its demise. Understandably economics precluded the park's development, but New Orleans deserved better...and this film couldn't have made that point more clearly.",False

No story, no one to follow through the before-during-after (i.e. The storm that destroyed the theme park which at least for me is the main subject)
So... why should the audience care? Yes it's been tragic: people lost their lives, houses, job and so on. Nothing that we already know from the news.What is this about? The city? The them park? Local residents? Politicians?

23,1,Extremely disappointing,Texino,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been a longtime fan of Bright Sun Films' Abandoned series on YouTube. Had expected this to be a notch up from those short form productions. Seriously, Jake and BSF do a great job with those videos and was excited that they took a shot at something bigger.But this was bad. Really bad.Highly repetitive, constantly revisiting the single statement of how horrible it was to just let the site deteriorate for 15 years. Agreed, but do we just have to hear that obvious statement over and over again? Random (beautiful) drone flyovers interspersed with interviews with very little story or structure.A few of those interviewed were interesting, having had a significant role with the park when open, or actively pursuing its redevelopment. But there were far too many people interviewed who really had no deep connection to the park and provided little insight into the park's history or demise. Mostly banal comments, rarely insightful. The movie even veered off to being a sub-par Katrina documentary at times when it looked like they ran out of content on the park itself.Was almost nice to have a musical score (the score was well done) but the mixing was poor and Jake's narration was almost buried at several points. His YouTube videos are much more tightly edited and mixed than this.Jake is usually a GREAT storyteller with a well planned script, but this ""movie"" went nowhere, and provided FAR less information and a less engaging story than any of his 20 minute YouTube videos.Was initially excited to support Jake with this purchase, but this wouldn't have been worth a free YouTube viewing. Very disappointed in this expensive purchase.",False
24,3,A YouTuber decides to make a full length documentary...and it shows.,planktonrules,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Closed for Storm"" is a full-length documentary that was made by a YouTuber famous for his urban exploration videos on the channel. In other words, his claim to fame is sneaking into various abandoned sites and posting videos of what he finds...something that likely is illegal but apparently is rarely prosecuted. It also is popular among younger internet users.When you know that this is the pedigree of the film, what you see about Jazzland (later called Six Flags New Orleans) makes lots of sense. This is why it feels very heavily padded, is full of grainy clips, is why the interviewees are mostly no-names reminiscing about the park (as opposed to local government or officials from Six Flags) and features a LOT of footage of him breaking into the park and wandering about the place.I watched the film to learn about the damage to the park and to learn what was going to be done with the rotting park...but this really takes up a tiny portion of the film and is best read about on the Internet. As a result, I would not recommend it to anyone other than urban explorer devotees...many of which inexplicably give this poorly made documentary plenty of 10s...though objectively speaking it is clearly flawed and far from perfect.",False

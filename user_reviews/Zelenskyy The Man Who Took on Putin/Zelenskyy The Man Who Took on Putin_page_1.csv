1,10,This movie is worth watching.,sany_stcom,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film reflects the real mood of today's events. Shows the cohesion of Europe at a time of real threat. Offended Russians put bad marks, and the film is chic and makes you think.",False
2,10,Important video for USA,peterthejustokay,n/a,15/08/2025,"Many things to think about here...how a no-account like Hunter Biden sucking up to some oligarch ends up changing the world, Trump's refusal to help Ukraine because of his re-election ambitions (Zelenskyy not having anything to say about Hunter Biden), Zelenskyy's own charisma, Putin's decisions - it's a lot to think about for such a short documentary. I don't understand why other reviewers rated this so low- was it because they've been Nirvana-ed? (""Entertain us!)"" This is important stuff!",False
3,1,hypocritical america and blind europe,pechkinhw,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are no real facts about Nazism. Documentary? And where are any documents, sources, references? The level of a school movie. Discovery fell in moss eyes. You are not ashamed to take off a political offense. Shame!",True
4,1,Wrong hero....,olts-28037,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ukraine did not lose not because of, but in spite of Zelensky. The hero is not Zelensky. Hero Ukrainian people, army, volunteers and western countries.",False

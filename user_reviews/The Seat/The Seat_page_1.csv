1,7,one big whatsapp advertisement.,soab24,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kimi Antonelli has a great life-story so far. But this video is a bit too constructed.

2,9,Really solid pace,JordanSatmary,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big fan of Drive to Survive, but this documentary has a far superior pacing. I really appreciate how much time is spent just living with this young driver, especially the scene with Bono where he's talking about his weight. So much of the short film breathes so well and feels far more intimate that DTS does sometimes.The interviews are beautiful, have great lighting and lenses. They utilize expert camera movements that were a lot more planned and careful than DTS feels at times.Overall, it's just wonderful to learn more about Kimi in this way. He's so likable and I can't wait to see more.",False
3,3,Could have been so much better,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Seat"" (2025 release; 41 min) opens, the unthinkable is happening in the Formula 1 universe: Lewis Hamilton, the face of Mercedes and 7 time World Champion, is leaving Mercedes (and joined Ferrari), unleashing an unprecedented scramble to see which driver would get his seat. Enters 17 yo Italian Kimi Antonelli, an up-and-coming racer with exactly ZERO F1 experience...Couple of comments: this documentary, a co-production with WhatsApp (!), gives some quick impressions about what goes on behind the scenes of a top F1 team, but alas, it is done in such quick brushes that you can never really get into the minute details. I believe it took about 5 minutes in the documentary from the moment that Antonelli's name is mentioned to Antonelli being informed that indeed he will be getting the Mercedes seat. This decision pretty much stunned the F1 world, and of course it remains to be seen whether it was a stroke of genius or simply a wild and expensive gamble gone wrong. Netflix has had great success with the Formula 1: Drive to Survive documentary series (now in its 7th season). In contrast, ""The Seat"" feels rushed and is simply unfulfilling.""The Seat"" is currently streaming on Netflix. Whether you are a fan of F1 racing or simply a fan of the ""F1 Drive to Survive"" series, I encourage you to check out ""The Seat"", albeit with lowered expectations, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,9,Great little watch,imdbfan-012961,n/a,16/08/2025,Stop listening to these geezers complaining about the WhatsApp bits. Advertising drives publication. Grow up.

5,5,WhatsApp ad on Netflix I paid for,joncoles,n/a,16/08/2025,"This could've been a really highly rated short about the interesting progress to date of a young rising star, but the some of the content felt too constructed, and the WhatsApp calls/messages and pop-ups and bings throughout felt forced and were irritating and distracting and left me feeling more negative about WhatsApp.It has still raised his profile for me, and helps promote this season of F1 a bit by giving added dimensions to a new name on the starting grid, and he came across as likeable, confident and humble, it's just disappointing that I've had to come away with negative feelings about the film and the product it was hamelessly plugging (WhatsApp, not F1).",False
6,10,A great concise snippet of Kimi's rise...,ChaoticAtmosphere,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great concise snippet of Kimi's rise to his seat with Mercedes. Toto and Mercedes chose well in replacing Lewis Hamilton. From his first introduction, I took to his humble demeanor immediately. I sense this kid will grow up to become the next legendary Formula 1 driver.I encourage any F1 fan of any level to watch. I would also like to thank WhatsApp for sponsoring/funding this mini-biography of this young talented and potential F1 legend. I love learning about the lives of the drivers of the most outstanding motorsport on the planet.To the people giving low ratings because WhatsApp sponsored/funded this great mini-biography: Do you also whine and complain about too much Lenovo advertising at races? Or any other sponsors? If it wasn't for WhatsApp, you wouldn't have even been able to learn about Kimi Antonelli's life and rise to his seat in F1.Give it a break.10/10.",False
7,1,Love Kimi but learnt nothing,mizoor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGot to see him ride a bike for 1.5 seconds, heartfelt talk with his dad for a few seconds, aaand a small dinner with the family, short view of the chat of when he got the seat. Yikes! I'd almost go as far as to say that this year's race in Japan was more interesting than this... Honestly I expected much more, Kimi is sweet and I've always liked Toto, but this just gave me nothing of value. So unfortunate... Races and the interviews after are definitely more interesting than this, following F1 on social media gave me more information about this situation than this did... Even Drive to Survive had a more interesting edit of when he got the call in his family home!",True
8,10,Loved it!,imdbfan-cookie17,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was such a heartwarming and inspiring film! It offers a glimpse into Kimi's early racing journey and his first steps into the world of F1. I thought this was beautifully shot and thoughtfully paced. It delivered an emotional journey that really resonated with me. Overall, it's a beautifully made short documentary that left a real mark on me. I cant wait to watch it again and again!!Also, The dinner with Kimi's Nonna and entire family was so precious, loved that. Made me want to go make lasagne and share a moment with my family. So beautiful.(Writing for required minimum characters...)",True
9,10,Amazing,kfdynks,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an amazing documentary that started with Mercedes refusing to give Hamilton a multi-season deal and him announcing to Toto he has signed with Ferrari. The search immediately starts with a search for his replacement and Toto picks Kimi. It goes behind the scenes with Kimi and his family and shows the dedication needed to make it into F1. Kimi mirrors Max Verstappen in that his father was a racing car driver and he started carting at a very young age. The work behind the scenes on cardio and strength and conditioning and diet, reaction time training. Some fantastic cinematography with Kimi sitting alone with a lightning storm going on around him. The devastation of the rookie mistake and crash at Monza in FP1. There has been no Italian drivers in F1 for a few years and Kimi is likely to develop into a future world champion.",True

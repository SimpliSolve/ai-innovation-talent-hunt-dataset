With some organising, this documentary could have been put together from start to finish in less than 2 weeks. Credit where credit is due: they do a good job explaining the ""unhealthy vegan"", but it's not worth your time.200 more required characters to submit the review... have a good day you reading this, stay off drugs, be nice when possible, enjoy the good weather, stay safe, stay healthy, give yourself a pat on the back sometimes and take it easy!",False

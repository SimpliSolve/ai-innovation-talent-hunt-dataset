1,7,Good And Bad Guys Are Only In Movies,Bydmoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, if you are someone who is sensitive to animal cruelty then this movie is not for you. No punches are pulled in regards to showing the actual events of the Grind which makes some scenes very uncomfortable and difficult to sit through. While the documentary shows us these events in full it is always very careful to not choose a side or show any bias towards either argument. Both sides are shown (flaws and all) which allows the viewer to take in the opinions and arguments from everyone involved and then come to their own opinion which is refreshing in todays world in which even the news stations have a spin on every story.There are truly stunning shots in this film showing off the natural beauty of the land. Unfortunately the movie falls short with pacing issues and redundant interviews. Instead of expanding on one of the few new points introduced within the final 30 minutes of the documentary we continue to get variations of the same three statements we have already heard. Overall this documentary is well made and gives the viewer some tough philosophical questions to ponder, but it is tough to recommend because of the pacing and graphic scenes involving the killing of pilot whales.",False

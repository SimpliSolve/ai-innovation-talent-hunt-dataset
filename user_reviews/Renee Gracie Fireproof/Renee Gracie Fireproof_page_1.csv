1,10,V8 Supercars are in trouble!,sampurts,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely love a doco that digs up the dirt and this is no exception! This doco, amongst other things, is an amazing story of a tall poppy racing driver battling years of patriarchal domination in the motorsports industry. Renee shows her tough skin and resilience that was honed by years of being the outsider in a man's world. Yet she remains so humble and down to earth. Her Dad is so camera friendly too. They weave you a story of Renee's racing career from its start in go-karts to making her own GT racing team, with a hell of a lot of bumps and bruises along the way. The V8 Supercar organization has made a huge mistake in how they have mishandled Renee eg: shunning her for being on only fans; not allowing her a wildcard V8 supercar entry; not allowing them to use race footage in this doco etc etc They are showing their cards, and it's obvious they are an outdated sexist bunch of sad men that have a lot to hide. Enjoy the doco üëç",False
2,10,Ye-Olde Motorsports Industry,sallyjb-34378,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a fantastic documentary!It is a big BEWARE to all 'ye-olde' blokes in power of male dominated sports. It is a beware that someone is going to eventually call out the bad behaviour and misogyny taking place in your sport. It seems industry denied both footage and interviews - I wonder why?When trailblazer car driver Renee Gracie and the documentary makers get together, this documentary is just that - a whistleblowing extravaganza.Its Renee's story that drives this documentary of course (she had lost her voice in the industry obviously), and it highlights the abuse, bullying, and misogyny she endured.Even during her young years entering Go-Karts, as the only girl, ""Dads"" were encouraging their sons to 'don't let the girl beat you' and to use physicality by smashing into her Go-Kart.For goodness sake! Many young girls would turn their backs on the motorsport industry at this stage.Not Renee. Her supporting Dad told her to fight for what she she wanted and to ignore their comments. Those wise words worked well for her. I do not know many females who would get past the Go-Kart treatment.In her Supercars career the bullying and misogyny continued. She decided her love of racing had gone.Re-entering the sport, getting her own car, her own sponsor, and joining OnlyFans just seemed to make her more of a target.This is eye-opening - I think all women and supporters of women should be appalled and angry. This is, after all, 2024.",False
3,10,Hearts Racing for Gracie,curiouscloud-25568,n/a,16/08/2025,"An absolute must-Watch documentary from talented all-female team.The powerful story of a woman reclaiming her autonomy after being used and exploited by the Supercars establishment. All women can see parts of their own experience here; as Renee gives a gloriously polished middle finger to the patriarchy.You only have to read the comments section to understand why this documentary is important. The story of misogyny and violence amongst the power hungry Supercars represents a microcosm of the broader cultural climate of sexism in sports (and everywhere).I can't help but chuckle at the the amount of one star reviews being left for the doco; no doubt by angry little car-boys; doing the very same thing Rene has accused them of doing throughout her career in motorsports. Way to prove her point fellas.And jokes on them- Something tells me Renee is going to be just fine.(Also, I wish Ray was my dad.)",False
4,10,Incredible Australian story.,bearandkid-07002,n/a,16/08/2025,"A brilliant look into the life and career of an exceptional woman and racer who fought against the odds and a misogynistic system to find triumph in her own way.

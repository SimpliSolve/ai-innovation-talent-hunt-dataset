1,1,Red Ollero: Mabuhay Is a Lie (2024) - A Corny Comedy Show That Fails to Hit the Mark,ulbricht1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Red Ollero: Mabuhay Is a Lie is a comedy show that aims to make people laugh, but unfortunately, it falls short of its goal. The humor in the show feels forced and outdated, like jokes you've heard many times before. It tries to be funny, but it doesn't quite hit the mark.One of the problems with the show is that the jokes seem a bit corny. They don't feel fresh or original, which makes them less likely to make you laugh. Additionally, the timing of the punchlines is off, so they don't have the impact they should.Another issue is the documentary-style segments in the show. While it's interesting to see real-life aspects mixed into a comedy show, these segments end up being boring and slow down the pace of the show. They don't add much depth or entertainment value, which is disappointing.All in all, Red Ollero: Mabuhay Is a Lie tries hard to be funny, but it misses the mark. The jokes are corny, the timing is off, and the documentary parts are boring. If you're looking for a comedy show that will really make you laugh, you might want to look elsewhere.",False
2,1,"Why him, Netflix?",whilmeister,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched several home grown Filipino stand up comedians and I am pretty sure there are good,if not better comedians than him. I watched the entire show giving it a chance that there could be some jokes at the end of the show that will make me laugh but there are none. Not only his jokes are way not funny and using harsh/hardcore disgusting sex jokes material, its not even believable at all especially stories that he said from his own experience. I cant see connections to every jokes he throw at and transitions are really bad. Not a good stand up comedy show to watch, and instead of laughing, you will cringe the entire show watching.",False
3,10,"Congratulations, and Great Job, Red!",JR_Adriano,n/a,16/08/2025,I like this Comedy Special Movie because my wife and I are in it. We used to catch Red's shows in Mow's or in the Samsung Theater (plus some Wrestling shows). We skipped work to watch this show live and it was totally wprth it. Everyone can visibly see that I laughed during the part about how nobody needs research nowadays in the age of disinformation and fake news. It was too real. My wife was the one dying of laughter in her seat while Red was drinking his water. We really had a good time watching the real thing live and we enjoy rewatching this on TV. We also had fun when our friends said they saw us on TV too!,False
4,n/a,A Lackluster Attempt at Comedy: Disappointing Netflix Special,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an avid fan of stand-up comedy, I approached Red Ollero's Netflix special with eager anticipation, only to be met with profound disappointment. From start to finish, this performance felt like a tedious exercise in forced laughter and recycled jokes.The humor, if it can even be called that, was stale and predictable, relying heavily on tired stereotypes and cheap shots rather than genuine wit or clever observations. It felt as though the comedian was desperately grasping at straws, searching for any semblance of a punchline amidst a sea of awkward pauses and cringe-worthy delivery.Furthermore, the material itself lacked any semblance of originality or depth. Instead of offering fresh insights or unique perspectives, Red Ollero opted for the lowest common denominator, resorting to tired clich√©s and juvenile humor that fell flat with each passing joke.Even more disappointing was the apparent lack of effort put into the production value of the special. The set design was uninspired, the lighting was lackluster, and the overall pacing felt disjointed and unpolished.This was a forgettable and regrettable addition to the platform's comedy lineup. Save yourself the time and skip this one - there are plenty of other, far more deserving comedians out there whose work is actually worth your attention.",False

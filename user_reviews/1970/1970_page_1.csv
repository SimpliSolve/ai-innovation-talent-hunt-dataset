1,10,Fantastic,Holodreams,n/a,16/08/2025,"An absolute must-watch. I saw 1970 at the Transylvania International Film Festival this June. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it surely wasn't a flawless blend of stop-motion animation and breathtaking archive footage of the 1970 Polish uprising.The documentary's structure builds upon archive recordings of telephone conversations between the Communist leaders tasked with silencing the uprising. It makes for a chilling, authentic insight into the devious decisions made by the Communist leaders (and the overall power apparatus) as they attempt to shut down the initially unyielding protestors, which rioted for an impressive 8 days.Just watch it!",False

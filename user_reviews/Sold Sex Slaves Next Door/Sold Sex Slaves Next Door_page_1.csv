1,5,Underwhelming,roxlerookie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I guess getting funding for this kind of journalism is hard, but this piece felt anecdotal, with the input of a handful of parties, and little work beyond that.One thing is clear: most of the stuff that is described is not illegal. It may be morally repugnant, but it's apparently not illegal to be 50yo and have a 12 year old lover. It's also apparently not illegal to live in a UK brothel in very precarious conditions. What is described here as victims do not identify as victims, and refuse help, whether they're of legal age or not.I suspect this was a very safe documentary to make, given there was no reference to organized crime or organized rings. We just hear of a handful of cases where the girls essentially say they're not victims.I guess a solution is education, good parenting and a nurturing environment? But if it's not illegal, i dont think it makes much sense trying to arrest people, because a judge or police can't do miracles.I suspect the Romanian police is often corrupt, but this is not addressed. I suspect there's a mafia doing the trafficking, but it's not addressed.Overall, a very underwhelming documentary that reminds us that prostitution is the oldest job, and that apparently pimping is very lucrative and comparatively safe.",False
2,3,Catchy Title! Low on Journalistic Ethics!,collectorofsorts,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI like shows of this genre because they show the dark side of life and the people who try to help. BUT, that's not exactly what you see when you watch the show. Yes, there are younger girls getting rescued. But there are also grown prostitutes bragging about how they make over $1000 a day! Why they chose to add hardcore prostitutes who do this by choice into a story about true victims is a mystery to me. It makes me wonder about the integrity of the reporters and producers and I have to take that into consideration for my rating.",True

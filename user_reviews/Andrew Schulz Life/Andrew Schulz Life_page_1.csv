1,8,Hilarious all the way through,Zoro3,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMe and my wife enjoyed this special and both chuckled the whole way through. Schulz lands joke after joke and doesn't miss a beat. Although he's not politically correct and he takes shots at homosexuals, transexuals, disabled people, people of different nationalities and different faith. Importantly though Schulz knows where the line is and doesn't go too far. It's all hilarious and done in the name of comedy. The majority of this special is about him and his wife's journey trying for a baby. It gets a little bit heavy in the final act, but of course it ends in relief. He already told us at the beginning that he's a father, but the emotional play gets the audience teared up.",True
2,9,Andrew never disappoints,GladLaksen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Simply amazing.This special is both funny and wholesome, it's simply a piece of art that at least gives you a smile on your face.Watching this made me laugh all by myself for the first time in over a year, and it felt amazing.It's really difficult to review a stand-up special without any spoilers, but simply put it is a typical Schulz special spiced with a wholesome touch.Watch it, if appreciate good comedy, you'll enjoy it.I really don't know how to write more about it right now, so i just have to type some random stuff because of the minimum required characters, but i finally reached the minimum limit.",False
3,n/a,Didn't plan on laughing & crying so hard,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,This was my first time watching Andrew Schulz and I am so happy that he was on Netflix top 10. I was in the mood for a stand up comedy show while I was cleaning that way I can have audio to keep me entertained. Boy I was laughing so hard. He had a great balance of energy and comedic humor. His material was relatable for some (maybe not all) but it had me laughing out loud.His blending of machismo energy with the loving and supportive husband role is like Andrew Dice Clay had a son (also named Andrew) and learned to love on a greater scale.I hope to hear more from him. I'll be checking out his other videos.,False
4,10,The legend at his best,strangeinked,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is probably one of the most well curated comedy by one of the finest comics of our time. Respect him for being so valuable yet brining out the fun in those moments. What stands out to me is the indulging storytelling capability which just makes you forget the rest behind while watching it. Highly recommend watching it with your friends and loved ones. I have been watching Andrew from 2023 and his work ever since. I don't know why but at this point like many others, I feel personally invested in letting the world know we need to celebrate comics like this who are ones in a lifetime artists. Cannot wait for what he does next!",False
5,10,Class,fingazmc,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't listen to the haters, this is good and spot on for me.If you don't like him in podcasts or his hot takes etc, this is still worth a watch (most people hate watch him and Rogan nowadays, mad, wasting your time to listen and comment just to give grief).My favourite comedian of all time is Jim Jefferies (that'll get me some down votes lol) so this was perfect for me, an hour long story with loads of jokes on the way.A beautiful ending and cheeky offensive jokes, if you're a Brit or liked old school Jefferies, you'll enjoy this.I mean why not it's only an hour and I guarentee that even the haters couldn't watch the whole hour and not laugh once!!!",False
6,10,Andrew Is Hitting A New Level,joey-18702,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been following Andrew for years and this is his best special yet. The guy is hitting a whole new level in his comedy. His first special was more flagrant and fowl, but in the best way possible. With LIFE, I see the evolution in Andrew's stand up and Andrew has hit a new level.This new special is more serious and heartfelt, but the jokes are still there. It's FUNNY. The entire hour is thoughtful and done with extreme respect. It's a must watch with any new parents, families, and comedy fans as a whole.All in all I can't wait to see what's next for Schulz. It'll be hard to top this one!",False
7,10,Great new hour,alex-77529-36545,n/a,15/08/2025,Loved seeing this more heartfelt subject matter from him! He can do the storytelling without losing the solid jokes peppered in along the way. Also happy to see his fanbase of men being empowered to talk about these uncomfortable moments in adulthood. Healthy masculinity is being able to joke about shooting blanks. I laughed quite a bit I have to say. It did leave me wondering if he'll ever let his daughter watch this one day? Also thinking I should stop taking hair pills and I probably could have gotten away with buying a lot less plan B over the years. All in all great stuff worth the watch!,False
8,10,Fricking Hilarious,spitericomputers,n/a,15/08/2025,"**Review of Andrew Schulz's New Netflix Comedy Special, *Life***Andrew Schulz's new comedy special *Life* on Netflix is a whirlwind of sharp wit, brutal honesty, and laugh-out-loud moments that leave you wanting more. From the first minute, it's clear that Schulz has perfected his craft, diving into topics that are universally relatable but also hilariously bold. It's rare to see a comedian who can strike the perfect balance between raw, unfiltered commentary and intelligent humor, but Schulz pulls it off effortlessly.What's most impressive about *Life* is Schulz's ability to make you think while simultaneously making you laugh. He addresses everything from relationships, societal expectations, and everyday struggles to the absurdities of modern life with a keen, unapologetic perspective. His delivery is electric, his timing impeccable, and his energy on stage is contagious, ensuring that the audience is hooked from start to finish.Schulz's storytelling is masterful, making even the most unconventional topics feel relatable and accessible. There's a vulnerability to his approach that resonates deeply, even as he's cracking jokes that make you cringe and laugh in equal measure. It's a comedy special that doesn't shy away from pushing boundaries, but does so in a way that feels fresh and authentic rather than forced or mean-spirited.The production value is top-notch, capturing the energy of the crowd and the intensity of Schulz's performance in a way that adds another layer to the experience. The intimacy of the special makes you feel like you're right there with him, experiencing every punchline firsthand.In conclusion, *Life* is more than just a comedy special-it's an event. Andrew Schulz proves once again why he's one of the best voices in comedy today. If you're looking for something that's both hilarious and thought-provoking, this special is a must-watch. It's honest, it's daring, and most importantly, it's *funny*. Prepare to laugh until your sides hurt-Schulz is at the top of his game!",False
9,10,Surprisingly relatable,tarohang,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOn a whim wife and I decided to watch Conor's one night after I worked 15 hours and she so graciously made me dinner. We went through IVF ourselves and found the show to be so relatable and hilarious. Found the Latina woman section to be notably funny. He speaks about racism and religion in a ""omg"" kind of way which is refreshing to have no filter on such things once a while. My wife teared up during the video part and it was very touching to have him encourage and uplift hope into those that are on the journey. Currently we are waiting for our baby boy and he is an IVF baby. This is a great segment to sent to people that may just want to be uplifted on such a situation.",True
10,4,Wait what?,KingKelma,n/a,15/08/2025,"I normally enjoy the wit of this guy but this was reduced to slap stick corny sex jokes. The kind that is usually done by bad female stand ups.Constant yapping about jerking off and his wife vajayjay being entered by a doctor. What in the seven layers of comedy was this, i have no idea.This format does not suit him better then his old style. When you see the other 10/10 reviews is because the guy has built a solid reputation.It would be nice that the same people that love him could be more critical about this show because this ain't it unless offcourse they are... and then we are really doomed.Please Schulz.",False
11,1,Boring,kmkjuggalo56,n/a,15/08/2025,"I hope comedians learn we don't care about their parental experiences enough to listen to a full special about it, and this just proves we don't care about the process of becoming a parent for a full special either. After a killer shane gillis 15-20 min set schulz hour seemed like a tortuous eternity where laughs were forced. In LA he did great city specific jokes but the actual routine he toured with was unnecessarily long and i'm sure would have been fine if he tried to take on different topics. Or just maybe make this hour more interesting, i don't know, im just an audience member who shares the same sentiments of other audience members i spoke with. This will do great on netflix since they have an audience for every comedian whether they're good or bad. If schulz continues down this path he's gonna be another ""parent"" comedian like kevin hart or tom segura.",False
12,3,Stale. Not the usual Andrew Schulz genius work,thynxink,n/a,15/08/2025,"Been a fan since he was scraping by on YouTube to break 1000 views. Been to every show in (and around) Nor Cal since he's been touring. We've even drove 8-10 hours to shows where he didn't come to Nor Cal. We've NEVER missed a tour. Watched him blossom into one of the best comedians. With that being said: THIS AINT IT. Literally never smirked, let alone laughed. Tried watching it multiple times and just couldn't come to terms with this being Andrew Schulz. Whether it was a comedy special or live, he's always brought me to tears in laughter. Not this. Don't be fooled by the sound effect of laughter. He's built such a big reputation, that he can say almost anything on the mic, and you'll hear forced, fake laughs from the crowds, acknowledging he's said a joke, but not genuine laughter. The same laughter you now here from Kevin Harts stand up. That's what this special is filled with. Attempts at being funny, followed by ""sound board"" crowd laughter. This is rather boring. Not funny. Not Schulz regular comedy genius. DONT RECOMMEND.",False
13,1,Garbage,eaalperto,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis standup is excruciatingly bad. For an hour he laughs at his own jokes about dicks, jerking off, cum, women being emotional (early 2000's style), occasionally touching his mustache, doing an exaggerated hispanic impersonation, and making up unfunny stories. Anyone that thinks this stuff is funny has terrible taste. This is bottom of the barrel humor. Honestly I've heard much better jokes from my coworkers. I feel dumber for watching this and it's pathetic and annoying that people actually enjoy this guy. I heard funnier things come out of my ass than any of the ""jokes"" in this special. Trash, boring, unfunny, uneducated humor.",True
14,1,Couldn't even bring myself to fake laugh & knee slap,mdlamsis,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just another Joe Rogan ass licker who's not funny at all. Rogan has ruined comedy with his band of insufferable, unfunny duds. Joe is the worst ""comedian"" on earth so surrounds himself with duds that make him not look so bad. Comedy is probably at its lowest ebb thanks to Joe Rogan.The fact that these so called comedians lick the boots of the billionaires & right wing fascists tells you everything you need to know about them. True comedians like Bill Burr, George Carlin, Robin Williams & Billy Connolly mock those types & attack those in power. The sooner these Rogan ass lickers disappear the better.",False
15,5,I dunno about this one...,ryanconduit,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had really been looking forward to seeing this special, but unfortunately like most of Andrews other material this one doesn't really hit the nail on the head.Lots of cheap lude jokes, they weren't all that bad but they definitely didn't have me in stitches. If I had to give a honest review from my point of view I would have to say the format seemed alot different, definitely not for the better. The amount of times the show almost became background noise due to not being overly entertaining whilst I watched was disappointing. Its fair to say it can be easy to lose interest during this one.",False
16,5,Just Okay,Chrischristophr,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're in the mood for a stand-up comedy show where the comedian seems to enjoy his own jokes a little too much, then this performance might be just what you're looking for. Dude took the stage with an abundance of self-amusement, practically doubling over with laughter after every punchline, even if the audience wasn't quite as enthusiastic. The show wasn't without its moments of genuine humor. When he wasn't busy cracking up at his own material, there were flashes of wit and insight that got a chuckle or two from the crowd. Unfortunately, his over-the-top laughter sometimes created a sense of disconnect between him and the audience, as though he was more focused on having fun than connecting with his listeners.",False
17,1,Really crosses a line,nannykaplan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I rarely spend the time to write a review on this platform, mainly because there is a minimum number of characters required and I prefer to be brief. However, I am making an exception here. The ""humor,"" if you can call it that, really crosses a line, and I am rarely offended. I even watched the ""Sorry"" comeback special by Louis C. K. and admittedly enjoyed it. This special is an exception of the worst kind. Had to turn it off. I am surprised there's a demographic for this guy's rants, though to each his own, as the saying goes. The material is outwardly homophobic, vulgar, misogynistic and racist. Importantly, it's just NOT FUNNY . . . At all. Totally tone deaf. Spare yourself and skip this special. There are so many others that will make you laugh and smile while feeling both entertained and uplifted. This is not one.",False

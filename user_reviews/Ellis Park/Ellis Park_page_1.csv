1,10,Transcendent experience - restores faith in our species.,moviedays1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Please see this movie and support the vital and incredible work of Ellis Park in rescuing, treating and rehabilitating wild animals that have been injured and abused by the deplorable wildlife trafficking industry. Warren Ellis, Femke den Haas and all the animal activists, liberating these exquisite animals from hideous suffering and cruelty, deserve Saint like status.Incredibly inspiring to see Warren support such a desperately needed venture - his respect for and dedication to these precious yet vulnerable and powerless animals is truly beautiful. He honours the animals and those that care for them with such warmth and sincerity. Not a whiff of ego or artifice, a gifted musical genius with a deep soul and empathy for animals. Watching and listening to him play violin is sublimely moving and heart wrenching, particularly after learning about his childhood and adult struggles. Wish there were more wealthy humans and celebrities who would support the widespread neglect and abuse of animals. Hope his noble endeavours inspire all of us to do something.",False

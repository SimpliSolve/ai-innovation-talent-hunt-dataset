1,2,Sorry - what?,Gretchen_X,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like rambling, anecdotal pseudoscience devoid of real evidence then Chilbolton Incident is for you. This will seem smug and distainful, but it periodically make me laugh. Did the lady in purple actually say (paraphrase) ""this is real science, in a lab, it's not rocket science""? Imagine being trapped in a room with her, under a creeping realisation that she is unstoppable. The other guy, the one who offered some kind of credentials, thought it would be OK to construct, on camera, his ad hoc hypothosis ""It makes you think"".But hey, let's pass by the low hanging fruit. If the purpose of this film is to educate, it's a fail. I think it's most likely to be successful in preaching to the choir. Perhaps it's satire, and I failed to catch on.The film's mission appears to be to convince the audience that this particular (Chilbolton) crop circle, unlike (nearly) all the others, which were made by humans, was made by, er, non-humans. In support of this mission is offered a selection of rather baffling claims about unreliably observed phenomena whose presence points to the impossibility of people having created this crop circle.The logic goes that, in the wake of their heyday, most crop circles turned out to be handbuilt by nerds, but concurrently extra-terrestrials were making better ones, using extra-terristrial powers and techniques. It would've been nice to have a crop circle nerd in the film to give a bit of background about why they did it, rather than just referring to the 'ropes and plank' explanation, with a couple of faded photos of said nerds operating their laughably primitive tools. Despite showing aerial views of highly complex crop artwork whose construction has been owned by humans, it appears, according to this film, that there is a celiling of sophistication above which nerds cannot rise, despite having built stuff like the Hadron Collider. This makes no sense to me. Adaptation and development are the greatest of human qualities. Isn't going one better likely more human than alien? Prove me wrong, as the adage goes.In any case, why would such technologically advanced beings choose to communicate with us by pressing patterns into field crops? We have radio, for example. I don't recall this being addressed.One suggestion in the film, regarding the location of Chilbolton, seems to be that they were attracted to nearby Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles. Perhaps though I had become confused by the relentless equivocacy and the presenters urging me to think.Anyway, I could go on and on. It's a mildly entertaining and relatively short (could've easily been shorter) watch but I would say not to be taken seriously as a balanced, well-researched and factually sound documentary. It's more anthropomorphic than anything else.Two stars for audacity.",False
2,1,"""...a little too early...""",owendrew-94698,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Had to turn off after just 10 minutes of some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. I have assumed this ""Documentary"" is more a very poor ""Mockumentary"".Acting aside, the Aricebo message was sent in 1974 to the globular star cluster M13. This is over 22,000 Light years from Earth and therefore the message cannot have been received, let alone a response sent. A response would take at least 22,000 years to Earth and then only if it was another radio based transmission. Therefore a physical reply would have to take considerably longer than 44,000 years. The reply is a little too early.Maybe ""they're"" closer than we think ðŸ˜€",False
3,1,No more garnish please!,shaunbethell-71807,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw another review on here discussing the time it would take to send and receive a message. Exactly right.Everyone is now fully aware that crop circles are entirely man made and have become more and more elaborate. Have to feel sorry for the people who still believe they are created by aliens and, dedicate their lives researching it.I took only watched 10 to 15 minutes. I was curious to see if it was going to debunk the whole thing.Maybe it does just that at some point in the film; I'll never know because I got bored and watched something else. If you still believe aliens are able to travel light years but are so primitive that they have to create crop circles to communicate, then this is probably for you.",False
4,1,Blatant misinformation,tom-54-750131,n/a,16/08/2025,"From a director with dubious links to the military and the air force, this film is designed to deceive. The majority of the content in the film is fragmented and the interviewees are not compelling or saying anything with any substance whatsoever. Which I believe is deliberate.There are plenty of other videos available to view which put forward evidence in a clearer and pragmatic way. There are man made crop circles, but there are also some that raise too many questions. Unfortunately this film tends to skirt around the correct questions to ask.If you want to know more about crop circles, don't watch this.",False

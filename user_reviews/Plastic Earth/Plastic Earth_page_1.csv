1,10,Very informative film on solutions,dreampost-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I highly recommend this film because it focuses on ten solutions to this problem. It is very well thought out, researched, and put together. If you want to know more about this issue and ways to solve it, then you need to watch this film. It will educate you on the multifaceted way this problem is being worked on around the world to be solved. Unlike other plastic films that are about the problem, this is a first of its kind truly making the person feel hopeful and also inspired to continue to care and believe we can solve this. I want everyone I know to see this film because I know it will help change the world. It is a must-see!",False

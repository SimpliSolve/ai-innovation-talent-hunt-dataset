1,7,Must be experienced on a full-blown OMNIMAX screen,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Into America's WILD"" (2020 release; 40 min.) opens, we are introduced to John Harrington, who 20 years ago became the first Native American to travel in space, and the screen blows us away as the space shuttle Endeavor takes off. As Harrington does a space walk to make repairs to the International Space Station, we then are transported to the beauty that is Oregon's outdoors...Couple of comments: this is the latest from veteran documentarian Greg Macgillivray, who is now a crisp 70-something years young. Just as important, it seems, is that this documentary is the product of Brand USA, the median company that encourages travel to and into the US. The documentary definitively has the feeling of a 40 min commercial of the beauty of this country's outdoors, as we get astonishing footage from around the country, but mostly the western states (California, Utah, Arizona, etc.). The film was shot specifically on IMAX cameras and it shows. Morgan Freeman narrates the documentary.We recently saw this film at the Omnimax here in Cincinnati (IMAX is a large flat screen, whereas Omnimax is a large domed screen), and the visual experience was absolutely tops. If you can't see this film on an IMAX screen or, even better, an Omnimax screen, then don't bother as this is the entire point of watching this documentary.",False

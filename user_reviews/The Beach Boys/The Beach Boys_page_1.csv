1,7,California Dreaming,Screen_O_Genic,n/a,17/08/2025,"After finding out a new Beach Boys documentary was going to be released this year I naturally got quite excited and looked forward to enjoying it. ""The Beach Boys"" is a pretty compelling documentary on the legendary band. Featuring interviews of the band members, their families, associates and fans including footage of home videos, live performances and the times the film chronicles a memorable and dramatic story of a trio of siblings who formed a band with friends and relatives and, seeing the potential their times and surroundings promised as a rich source of inspiration went on to fame and fortune with trials and tragedy serving as a dark counterbalance.Beginning with a shaky start on an abrupt introduction to the Wilson household the doc charts the band's formation and their tapping of the popular surf craze in Southern California during the early - 1960s. With bassist, vocalist and main songwriter Brian Wilson emerging as a major songwriting and production talent the boys came up with a string of great songs that topped the charts which have since become classics and standards of Rock and Pop Music. The pressure of fame, drugs, competition from the other side of the pond led by four young and talented men from Liverpool and changing times brought the group's winning streak to a halt. A compilation album of their hits from their peak years hit #1 leading to a revival of the group's fortunes and they've been coasting on that success since.From the start the flaws of the documentary are apparent. As mentioned above the film starts too immediately with the formation of the band without giving a necessary background to the band, their place and the times. The Beach Boys is one of the most influential bands in music history but only a scanty number of prominent figures are featured in the film to justify the band's important and enduring legacy. Don Was, Lindsey Buckingham and Janelle Monae (!) are the only notable figures included. Finally the film is too short with it ending in the '70s without including Brian Wilson's controversial relationship with his therapist at the time, Dennis and Carl Wilson's passing and the other major comeback they had with the huge hit ""Kokomo"". There's no final summary and conclusion to the band's inestimable legacy although it's nice to see the surviving members get together at the end of the film. This is one tribute that should have been at least another hour long.Flawed but watchable, ""The Beach Boys"" is a good artifact of a great band, a great time and great music which is what it all boils down to. When snippets of the band's great tunes buoyed from the speakers I felt that instant automatic rush and high I always feel when I listen to their masterpieces. Watch this release and celebrate the power of art and music to uplift life and make it truly worth living.",False
2,8,Some much needed good vibrations!,samuelbourneagain,n/a,17/08/2025,"Thoroughly enjoyed watching this. Knowing a fair amount about the ups and downs throughout The Beach Boys' history, I kept waiting for things to turn dark. I was pleasantly surprised however, that the documentary prioritised the band's music and the impact it has had and continues to have on the world. Most people who are familiar with The Beach Boys are likely aware of Eugene Landy and the premature deaths of Dennis and Carl and so I found it refreshing that the film focuses mainly on the good. It reminded me of the recent 'Wham!' Documentary in that sense, taking you through the different musical phases of the band and ending on a positive note long before outstaying it's welcome. The film doesn't shy away from drama completely. Tensions between band members and the negative impact Murray had on the group are covered. Everyone gets a fair shake however, including Murray, whom without The Beach Boys may not have had the initial success they did. The documentary also reinforces the often overlooked fact that each member was integral to the band's sound without taking anything away from Brian's brilliance as a visionary. A moving tribute to one of the greatest bands in pop music history. I recommend this to any music fan and those in need of something positive (aren't we all?).",False
3,7,fun fun fun,ferguson-6,n/a,17/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. Casual fans of The Beach Boys music are attracted to the light-hearted and fun songs that are always good for a burst of feel-good energy. More attuned fans remain in awe of the intricate vocal harmonies ... rarely matched by other bands. Co-directors Frank Marshall and Thom Zimney have successfully presented the story of The Beach Boys without either over-the-top gushing or digging too deeply into the dirt.By going all the way back to the childhood of the Wilson brothers, the film details how singing in the backseat of the family car began the transformation into a supergroup that changed pop music forever. Oldest brother Brian has always been accepted as the musical 'genius', while Carl was inspired to pick up a guitar after hearing Chuck Berry, and rebel Dennis played the drums almost out of necessity. Cousin Mike Love wrote many of the lyrics for Brian's music and became the band's lead singer, while good friend (and Brian's football teammate) Al Jardine's exceptional voice was a natural fit. We learn it was Al's mother who fronted the boys $300 to rent instruments after hearing them sing together (smart lady). We also learn that Murry Wilson (the boys' father) sold his business to manage the group towards gigs and their first record deal.It's really that history - the foundation of the band - that is the most interesting aspect of the film. For the most part, it tracks chronologically through the album releases and tours, while emphasizing the importance of the band bringing beach culture to the masses. Hearing about their musical influences: The Four Freshman, Dick Dale, The Ventures, and Phil Spector, allows us to understand exactly how things progressed so quickly.The filmmakers (with impressive music doc and music video backgrounds) mention but opt not to dwell on the darker aspects of the band's history. The commercial failure of ""Pet Sounds"" (now considered a masterpiece) played a significant role in Brian's emotional fade. Father Murry's inexplicable decision to sell off the band's publishing rights prevented any of them from reaching the financial status they deserved. As was commonplace for the time, drugs were detrimental to individual band members as well as the band's productivity. Deciding to pull out of the Monterrey Pop Festival (no real explanation given) resulted in the band becoming irrelevant for a few years. Mike Love sued the band for songwriting credits, creating a huge rift. These points, along with Dennis' happenstance involvement with Charles Manson, are all mentioned yet given no real depth ... which is fine for a documentary working so hard to stay positive.As a conclusion, Capital Records' release of the double-album ""Endless Summer"" injected new life and popularity into the band (getting them past that earlier 'rivalry' with The Beatles), and the finale is a shot of a recent reunion with surviving band members Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston at Paradise Cove ... with no insight into what was discussed.The film begins streaming on DISNEY+ on May 24, 2024.",False
4,6,"Not bad, but could've/should've been more.",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIs there a difference between a fluff piece and a puff piece? The Beach Boys (2024) is one of them. Or maybe both. Hang on. I'll check.Okay, it's a puff piece. A puff piece is something that feels overly complimentary toward the subject at hand. But it might also be a mild kind of fluff piece, since a fluff piece is seen as something that's lightweight and without substance. Perhaps The Beach Boys is a pluff piece.I still can't despise it. I don't know. Hearing the music is nice, but the substance of the documentary is lacking. I have doubts about the sincerity of the final shot, and trying to get Brian Wilson in the present day involved at all, but having it conclude on the beach where they took the photo for their first album cover, 60 years later, did get me. I get to thinking about how aware Brian Wilson was of the whole situation, and they get him to say one thing in the present day very early on (before relying on older interviews with him) and that made me feel a little sad and uncomfortable. He's not there anymore, and wheeling him around even just a little for this documentary... I don't know. It's murky territory. He is still alive, but he's not the man he used to be, and maybe it's best to leave him in peace and quiet at this stage in his life. I feel bad for the guy, and the documentary - being fluff - doesn't explore his health issues and current living conditions. There was a documentary called Long Promised Road specifically about Brian Wilson a while back that was better than this, and more insightful/honest.But... The Beach Boys is an overview. It's an overview that leaves out the most uncomfortable things. Lawsuit and the Manson connection are mentioned, but not explored. You could argue that Love and Mercy and the other Wilson documentary already explored Brian Wilson's hardships, but they are a bit glossed over here. And if you're big into The Beach Boys, you're going to raise your eyebrows a lot whenever Mike Love is speaking (Al Jardine seems more sincere to me; he's a little corny at points, but his vibes are still decent).The 3/5 rating here feels generous. I'm a sucker for The Beach Boys and their music in any context, maybe. And again, it's a watchable overview. But also, I don't like such a conclusive title (the doc's name is the band's name) being given to something that's pretty lightweight. It is assembled competently, for what we do get, but it's also textbook stuff as far as documentary filmmaking is concerned, to the point where you can probably guess some of the needle drops and anticipate the flow/direction of the next scene before they happen.",True
5,6,The Sandbox Five.,fostrhod,n/a,17/08/2025,"Beach Boys (2024)
A documentary that is a visual and audible treat on the origins and rise of the Beach Boys and the sad fall of the sandbox five.I think with all these types of documentaries, the enjoyment factor depends on how much you love the featured artist, I Love the Beach Boys, preferring their late 60s early 70s work to their sunshine pop. That said there are too many talking heads in the film, which is pretty standard for these films, does anyone actually care what this if that musician or journalist thinks of the featured band. In this case we have a couple of musician types who talk of listening to Pet Sounds as if it was new we to them and gave them a moment of epiphany . Due to their age, the album wouldn't , couldn't even be revelatory with much more spiritual music of more relevance to those younger ears.Footnote, I can't actually see who will find this documentary of interest, diehard fans have heard it all before, and newbies would find all the early footage and music very twee and lacking any sophistication.Sad end to the film when we see the now geriatric and dementia suffering Brian with his surviving band mates. Like the Beach Boys of the last 50 years we see one more cheque and payout at the expense of Brian's mental health and vulnerability.",False
6,7,Reach the Beach,Lejink,n/a,17/08/2025,"When you consider the Beatles got six hours out of their group life-span in their ""Anthology"" TV series of the mid 90's and they weren't in existence above ten years, it seems a bit strange to have the plus 60 years working career of the Beach Boys condensed to under two hours.That said, I thoroughly enjoyed this surf through their career, although it effectively ends at 1974 when the release of their oldies hits collection ""Endless Summer"" put them back at the top of the US charts after being in the wilderness for so long. I totally get that subsequent hits like the awful ""Lady Lynda"" and ""Kokomo"" don't begin to compare with anything on ""Endless Summer"" but to just write off the last 50 years or so, ignoring one or two decent records like ""The Beach Boys Love You"", ""15 Big Ones"" or they are more recent reunion album, seems to me to do them something of a disservice. There's also no mention of Brian's return to recording which included at least one fine album ""Love and Mercy"" and his own imagining of the ""Smile"" album or about Dennis Wilson's lovely solo album ""Pacific Ocean Blue"". I also felt the omission of mentioning the passing of Dennis and Carl, apart from a subtitle commemoration over the end credits.Anyway, let's quit with the moaning and hit the beach, because unquestionably some of the best pop music ever made came from the band and in particular the creative genius of Brian Wilson. Much is made of the sense of competition he felt with the Beatles but you have to remember that there were four of them with three strong writers plus George Martin as their producer, while Wilson was more or less left to do everything on his own. Throw in poor promotion on the part of their record label for their classic album ""Pet Sounds"", mismanagement by the Wilsons' own father which cost them millions in royalties and of course Brian's well-documented problems with drugs and you can see that the band certainly had to ride some big breakers in their time.Inevitably much of the narrative centres around Brian but I do think that the contribution of the remaining group members was unfairly downplayed. Even after Brian effectively withdrew from the band after the ""Smile"" fiasco, they made some great records before big brother hooked up with them again. I didn't even hear the likes of ""Do It Again"" (a UK no..1), or their early 70's classic ""Sail on Sailor"" on the soundtrack, not do I recall hearing ""Heroes and Villains"", surely one of the most important songs in their library, never mind the stories about how it was recorded and ""failed"" on release.All the surviving members contribute to the story and are supplemented by vintage footage of Dennis and Carl. Programmes like this always feature fan-boys and girls offering their adoration and this one's no different with Lindsey Buckingham and Ryan Tedder chorusing their approval.It ends touchingly with the remaining members reuniting at the location over 60 years on from the cover shot of their ""Surfin'"" album, with Brian and Mike happily letting bygones be bygones in the wake of their rather uncivil lawsuit case.All of the members come out of it well in their advanced ages, although for me Brian will never look fully recovered again and Mike Love acts much less like a prat than he usually does.A fascinating family story then which however rather seems to skim the surface rather than go for the deep dive I'd much rather have seen.",False
7,10,"The Perfect Doc For Its Length, Subject, And Audience",zkonedog,n/a,17/08/2025,"Because The Beach Boys are such a long-tenured musical institution and feature the requisite history (good and bad) to go along with that longevity, one could do a 5-part doc and probably still leave some topics on the cutting room floor. What this Disney+ doc accomplishes in just under two hours, however, is an excellent summation of the group that primarily focuses on the family aspect and the timelessness of the music they created. Plus, it is a positive-focused doc--albeit one that doesn't completely shy away from some of the more controversial material.In terms of general chronology, ""The Beach Boys"" focuses on the group's creation through roughly the late-1970s--plus a sort of ""where are they now"" coda that is extremely moving. As mentioned, the material largely revolves around two themes:-Family: The Beach Boys are extremely unique in that they were mainly populated by three brothers (Brian, Carl, & Dennis Wilson), a cousin (Mike Love), and a close friend (Al Jardine). Very few other music groups can boast such a tight-knit family bond--highly credited with keeping the ship afloat during the rough patches.-Music: The group created harmonies that have proved to be timeless as new generations keep discovering them. While Brian may have been the composing genius behind the scenes and Mike the perfect ""front man"", this doc makes it clear that every Beach Boy (even the ""fill-ins"" along the way) was vital to the overall sound and success of the group.Is this a positive and upbeat doc befitting of its Disney roots? Of course--and that's almost certainly the right approach to take with ""America's Band""! But director Frank Marshall also doesn't completely shy away from the more sensitive topics: the influence of Murry Wilson, Brian's turbulent mid-70s period, and Mike's legal suit for songwriting credit among them. But such material simply is not dwelled upon.All things considered, ""The Beach Boys"" seems like the perfect doc for its length, subject, and audience. Deeper-dives can easily be done via large tomes or specific docs/movies on other Beach Boys topics--but this doc is an excellent summation of why their music is so magical and where it all came from.",False
8,9,Absolutely Wonderful,jstorm505,n/a,17/08/2025,"Ignore the negative Nancy's that choose to share their lonely views ; if you're a Beach Boys fan, you are in for a treat. I treasure these interviews, this documentary in general. I was second wave BB aficionado, discovering the Beach Boys in the Endless Summer era, long after the surfing extravaganza. Their music is truly an American genuine gift to the world and besides being infectious, the melodies are part of your fabric, your life's soundtrack. I loved the entire piece and if you're even the slightest fan, you will ,too. Watch and enjoy, and remember when things were simpler and a great sonf on the radio or from an LP, made you smile.",False
9,10,"More than just Fun, Fun, Fun!",jovi7,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI loved this, finally a comprehensive look at all the things that made this band special, why their music has lasted so long, and how they did it. Great new footage I have never seen before and fascinating interviews and family dynamics. We all know about the dark side of the band and Brian, but the refreshing thing in this doc is that it focuses on how and why they became so popular and gives the rest of the band their due credit. My favorite thing was the friendly duel with The Beatles and how they made each other better. And a very nice healing moment at the end when all the surviving members, including David Marks, meet back where the first album cover for Capitol Records was photographed. Among the talking heads, Josh Kun really puts things in perspective.",True
10,2,Sugarcoated and Very Poorly Done,crumpytv,n/a,17/08/2025,"Anybody expecting a Peter Jackson Get Back style documentary will be disappointed.Visually this is very poor. Old photos and films have all been seen before in countless other documentaries on the Beach Boys and generally, apart from some recent interviews, there is nothing new at all. In fact there is so much that is not in-cluded that should have been.It would have been interesting if the early days and their first four albums (1962-1963) were covered in some depth.The same applies to the Wild Honey/Friends/20-20/Sunflower period. These hardly get a mention or the fact that some material from the abandoned Smile album was included on these albums.Any compilation of hits by the Beach Boys is inevitably going to focus on the early days and the ""Californian Dream"", and as such, more time should have been spent on the surf/hot rod/girl music of that period.The shelving of Smile made no mention of a well aired opinion that after hearing Sgt. Pepper, Brian Wilson felt his Smile project was not suitable as a Beach Boys album. He expressed this view in the documentary but then they released Smiley Smile which was even less representative of their music culture.The last album mentioned was Holland, but the Beach Boys made 10 studio albums after that and these do not include Brian Wilson finally releasing a version of Smile in 2004.After the confusing Carl and the Passions album (not mentioned), they made Surf's Up, an important album that barely gets a mention. The same with Holland.No mention is made of the deaths of Dennis and Carl, the true state of Brian's mental health and the fact he reportedly spent three years in his room sleeping, smoking and taking drugs is not covered at all. Neither is the piano in a sandbox or how he was treated and manipulated by a psychologist in the mid-1970s.Overall, a missed opportunity. I am left with the impression that is was made on the cheap and relies on the Beach Boys name to sell the documentary.",False
11,8,A GOOD CATCH-UP FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW...!,masonfisk,n/a,17/08/2025,"A recent Disney + documentary on arguably the greatest American rock 'n' roll band we ever produced. Culling interviews from the surviving members (since brothers Carl & Dennis Wilson have passed & any interviews w/Brian are archival since he's gotten a recent mental decline diagnosis) gives us the soup to nuts of the band w/the usual trajectory of them being the preeminent surf band until Brian's intense studio time (prompted by his distaste & mental unbeing for the road) took him into infinitely more experimental & interesting places even though their father wanted none of that. Tracing a good chunk of the later half of the doc on the revolutionary Pet Sounds recording pretty much shows why that record is what it is & why the world loves it so. Some time director Frank Marshall (Congo/Alive) does the material well but being there are so many docs made on the band (at one point I think he clipped a scene of Brian Wilson being interviewed in bed from one made in the 70's or 80's which I remember seeing when I was young) especially a recent one about the Pet Sounds follow-up Smile which Brian & Van Dyke Park reunited to finish & later perform on stage, this film feels fresh for the uninitiated but for those in on the know, not so much.",False
12,10,Love is Love,estelle58,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerA few weeks ago, I was letting auto play go through music videos on You Tube.When ""I Get Around"" came on, I became re-hooked with The Beach Boys. In 1976 I bought their ""Endless Summer"" album, and listened to it over and over. So when I found out they were coming to the Iowa Jam, I promptly bought my tickets. It was a great concert. And now 50 years later they are on tour to celebrate that album that came out on June 24th, 1974. And luckily. They will be performing near me, so I naturally bought tickets.Anyway, this documentary was a pleasant watch. Much of it, I have seen in recent videos on YT. But, the one thing I will keep with me that took about 5 seconds of screen time, was Mike Love's profession of love for Brian. Quite genuine, indeed.There were some pretty wretched bygones between these two, but that is all they are, bygones.If you hold resentment towards Mike, this documentary may change that feeling for you.",True
13,8,Positive documentary!,michaelRokeefe,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerOut of the many documentaries featuring The Beach Boys, this may just be the most positive I've seen. From humble beginnings to superstardom. Brothers Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson along with cousin Mike Love and close friend Al Jardine were not wrong thinking that when they harmonized vocally they were on to something big.The story of The Beach Boys is presented as well as it could be. Not exactly sugar coated and just skimming over the warts. This film is filled with some down notes. We have Brian's conflicts with the rest of the band, especially Mike Love, the unofficial rivalry with The Beatles, the production clashes with Capitol Records and even the bad blood between father Murry Wilson's misdealing with music publishing rights.Barely skimming over the real importance of Brian's poor mental health strife, dealings with Brian's doctor, Dennis' involvement with the Charlie Manson Family and no deep dealings with Dennis' death.One favorable thing is this documentary examines and explains why the group was so unique and popular and why Brian Wilson earned and deserves being called a genius.",True
14,3,Not Very In-depth,daylan-9966,n/a,17/08/2025,"I am a bigger fan of The Beach Boys, but this is incredibly light in terms of what's actually happen.Part of me gets it because they are still real people who have to live out their lives. But their stories are so old and long forget that it shouldn't be this clean.I knew it was trouble immediately when I saw it was produced by Disney. From there you can always tell it's going to be very clean. But too clean.They don't get into their family drama, how the father Wilson was controlling it all and causing rifts between the members and him. Like others pointed out, no talk about Brian and the state he was in when he was younger using drugs and whatnot.Just felt like there was more than what most wanted out of this story and the fact people are happy with the little they got is disappointing. They should want more, even if they are uncomfortable with the material, that is their story.",False
15,10,Wow!,julieb-35-327991,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThe touching reunion at the end was the perfect coda to a documentary that dug deep enough to show us their lives and motivations but not too deep that it would feel like there was a thesis or agenda. They just need to be remembered. Endless Summer was my first album, purchased at the age of 12. I was already familiar with most of their oeuvre, and I would play that album over and over, while studying the liner notes and memorizing every bit of the cover art. I finally saw them play when I was a college freshman. They were and are America's band. I can't believe Brian is the only Wilson brother to still be alive. I could not tear myself away from this documentary, from start to finish. Well done, and a fitting tribute.",True
16,8,Great Documentary!,iloveseaotters,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI have been a fan of the Beach Boys since my parents introduced me to their music when I was a kid. I always associate any of the Beach Boys songs with my mom or my dad, because they absolutely loved the surfing group.Of course I was going to watch this movie but I figured it would be just like the other documentaries that I'd seen. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't ""preachy"" and that there wasn't an annoying narrator. It's mainly told thorough audio and video clips of Brian Wilson and company as well as interviews with the band and people who worked with them.Although I've seen lots of documentaries on the band, I actually learned a few things by watching this one. I liked that it was free of swearing except for one F word.It definitely made me want to play Beach Boys music on repeat. It was a very well done movie and the ending was cute. My only complaint would be that it ended before I was ready. I was hoping they would cover their later success with the song Kokomo, but they did play the song during the credits.",True
17,5,Was Hoping for More,crashto1,n/a,17/08/2025,"Decent, staight forward documentary on the group. It's formation, all the surf/car 60's parts, Pet Sounds and a Bit of smile. But like other docuseries I've seen, It just glossed over the late 60's early 70's records that didn't really chart but the hardcore fans Loved! Sunflower, Wild Honey, Friends, 20/20. There was so much more history to cover and it just didn't dig deep. Some of those records got me more into the non beach, surf sound and how deep Brian was as a musician.I was hoping for a 6 hr or more series like The Beatles - Anthology or Let it Be.Its just good.. for average fans..",False
18,5,I wanted more,maryrosepractice,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis Beach Boys doc is not what you'd expect. Of course it highlights the early days of their success that encapsulated the American dream of the 1950s, but throughout the film it descends into the sad truth of how an experimental groups sound doesn't always resonate with the majority. It's a tale that repeats itself over and over, where music artists change and want to express that change through their music, but people just want to hear the same ol stuff that the artists often already grown past. When it comes to popping out a hit, there's a million different formulas you could use, but not all artists are machines desperate for fortune and fame. Music is truly a form of artistic expression for thousands of musicians and its admirable to see people gain success doing something they love.But what makes the Beach Boys story in particular stand out is that unlike other boy bands whose run ends when the members decide to go their separate ways, the Beach Boys fell off after producing unsuccessful albums. Not bad songs, not offensive songs, just a vibe that changed as they did over time. But despite the decrease in success, it's because of their ambition and the persistent experimental elements of their songs that brought them to Pet Sounds, which is one of the greatest albums of all time.Nostalgia is such a satisfying feeling and being able to capture that retro, surfer, california vibe successfully with each song was what made them so special. But creating something entirely new is what makes legendary songs.I loved the deep dive approach this documentary gave from the perspective of just trying to gain success, but it did lack in what felt like telling the full story of the Beach Boys. Like this documentary doesn't dive into the personal lives of the members much at all. It's all told through the musical lens and what songs defined eras that particular members were a part of. At the end of the movie they're just kinda like, ""oh yeah, and a couple of um died."" whatttt??? I coulda honestly watched another hour of this just giving insite on each of the members and how they viewed the group, the songs, the success, and the overall experience.God only knows what the Beach Boys legacy could have been like if they did what they did back in the 60s today, but i'm glad documentaries about these legandary artists are still dropping because the perspective of music and it's impact changes everyday.",True

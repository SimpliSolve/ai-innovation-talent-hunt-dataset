1,10,The last episode was heartbreaking ðŸ’”,footeaimee,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely amazing tv series, warning the last episode is so sad and it really portrays how tough the vets jobs can be sometimes. You can really tell how much the animals mean to the owners and also the vets and nurses. I loved the native animals that were treated and how the vets were so caring with the patients and explained everything that was happening so well. I hope they make another season, as I'll be glued to the television for another week binge watching it! It's absolutely amazing to see what Dr. James could do with a simple paper clip on the turtle George/Georgina! Highly recommend watching!",False
2,10,Incredible people working with incredible animals,leesean-45267,n/a,16/08/2025,I am lucky enough to call these amazing people my Vets. I have taken my reptiles to the Peninsula Clinic several times over the years with amazing results. Their knowledge and empathy to their patients and there owners is well portrayed in this series. It is great to see behind the scenes and see their skills at work.My family binge watched all six episodes and are hoping for a second and further series in the future. This is just the tip of the iceberg to the daily routine at these amazing vets.Australia has some of the most unique animals in the world and many are showcased in this wonderful series and hopefully the world gets to experience it as we in Australia have too. The stories for each patient are real and heart warming and exactly what I have experienced during my visits.,False
3,10,Informative viewing,noeleenenglish,n/a,16/08/2025,"Awesome show! A glimpse into to world of exotic pets and the talent of these vets in designing sometimes bespoke and innovative treatments. I'm enjoying seeing my vets and the myriad of animals they treat. Really good viewing. Great job !Have you ever wondered how you treat a goldfish? A crocodile? A goose? Learnt some of the issues and illnesses that can arise with parrots? Chickens? Monitors or bunnies?These vets are fantastic, across 3 (soon to be 4) states. I'm learning a lot about my pets and also learning about animals I've thought about getting one day. It's good to know there are experts who can treat these animals.",False
4,10,Captivating Television,jaydenprav,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Bizarre Pet Vets highlights the intricate work veterinarians complete as well as the diverse skills they possess. It is also enjoyable to learn about cases that differ from those you may see in programs covering cat and dog practices.Additionally, this program encourages those who care for 'bizarre' pets to offer their pets access to medical care. Often well-meaning caregivers do not realise that their beloved exotic animals can receive appropriate, specialist medical attention when they are feeling unwell.I sincerely hope that this show receives a second season. I am confident that the lives of many humans and animals have already been enriched by the first season alone.",False
5,10,Warning: It's binge-worthy! You're in for a treat!,renllinas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love, love, love The Bizarre Pet Vets show! I couldn't stop at one episode; I had to binge the entire first series.If you're an animal lover, intrigued by pet medical cases, and fascinated by exotic and unusual pets, this TV show is for you! The series gives a great insight into what happens behind the scenes at an exotics vet clinic, and the patient cases are so fascinating.Dr James and the teams of vets and nurses are remarkable and demonstrate so much care and compassion for their patients and owners; it really warmed my heart. It's a genuine TV show where unusual pets and their people come first.Can't wait for season 2!",False
6,10,Loved this show!,denh-15477,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved this show! Was so great to watch a series that showcased exotic pets and how amazing they are, as they always seem to be forgotten about in vet shows, when they are actually such popular and wonderful pets!The Unusual Pet Vet team are so incredibly talented in what they do and how they are able to treat everything from the smallest little finch to a big snake, and how cool are penguins!Mike the lizard was my favourite of the series!Well done to everyone involved in the show and fingers crossed for a second season so we can get to meet the rest of the UPV team and learn about some more interesting cases that they see at the clinic.",False
7,10,Wow!,Ali_D555,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis show is amazing! There are so many cat and dog vet shows that sometimes include exotic pets but The Bizarre Pet Vets has so many cool pets that my whole family was glued to the screen.It's really great that it's filmed in different places so there are some very different species to our local ones and it's awesome that there are vets who dedicate their careers to these wonderful creatures.Our favourites from the first episode were the turtle that Dr James preformed surgery on and the albino python that had a big lump.We're looking forward to seeing more episodes and more really great pets!,True
8,10,10/10 - heart warming and interesting!,kiarasimonis,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show was fantastic - so many interesting stories and cases. Both the vets, clients and patients were fantastic and it was great to get a look into a different side of veterinary medicine and surgery! When there is so much content about dogs and cats it is so unique to have a show dedicated solely to the weirder pets!It is definitely worth watching through as the final episode has one of the most interesting cases - a penguin from the Melbourne aquarium. Without giving away spoilers, this episode gives a really raw look at the peaks and troughs of working with animals, and the love that the veterinary staff show for their patients is so evident in this episode.",False
9,10,Captivating series highlighting the amazing work of some very talented Vets,kilobyte-76953,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this series! It highlighted the work of some very talented Vets and Vet Nurses. It also showed how much people love their pets, and how much the staff cared for their patients.It was great to see how much people will do for their pets; it was one of the first shows I've seen where people care about their pet fish so much that they take them to the Vet for treatment.It was great to see a behind the scenes view of how a vet clinic works, especially as this one was different to regular small animal clinics.I liked that there were animals shown at other places, not just the vet clinics.I really hope that another series is made! It didn't take me long to watch all 6 episodes.Definitely worth watching, and worth following their social media accounts.",False
10,10,Instant Classic,cjwardle-49018,n/a,16/08/2025,"Funny and refreshing new series.While some intended, and some unintended, comedy occurs throughout the series. The heartfelt love of animals shines through; from meeting the owners to the intricate surgeries on some exotic species the owners and vets clearly care deeply for the animals.I also particularly like the relatability of the show and the vets seem like they have genuine personalities and not overy dramatised. For me this sets this show apart from some other vet shows. I particularly liked the very relatable father son banter, was hilarious and reminds me of working in the back yard with my old man.10 out of 10 I would watch again!",False
11,10,A brilliant portrayal of what it's like to be an exotic vet,jmhaberfield,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you to the team at Metamorflix for producing such a great show that really gives a great insight and front row seat to what it is like to get to work with such incredible animals and owners each day.I love that the show takes us on a journey from getting to know the owners of the incredible pets seem, right through to watching the intricate surgeries as they are performed. The animals themselves are simple incredible to see.Some of my favourite cases were the crocodile vs turtle case in episode one, Greg the goose in episode 2 and Benji the rabbit.The mix of in clinic vs field work at zoos and aquariums was great too.",False
12,10,Our favourite family show!,danluhsu,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is so refreshing to see an Australian- based vet show focused on unusual pets. Where animals, many may seem as unconventional, are valued just as much as dogs, cats and horses. The series has captured the realities of exotic animal practice, its daily challenges, triumphs, joy and heartaches exceptionally well. As well as a rare insight into the incredible team of dedicated staff and their amazing clients.I highly recommend The Bizarre Pet Vets. The show was thoroughly entertaining and had us laughing, crying and experiencing a whole spectrum of emotions. Very well done indeed. Can't wait for season 2!",False
13,10,Have they found Australia's best vet?,ApianMist,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved the show and chewed through all 6 episodes in 2 days! It had a really interesting mix of cases and animals, who knew how much work went in to keeping birds and rabbits healthy?!It was really nice to see a vet tv show that showcased clinics across Australia instead of just one, and the range of 'unusual' people who own all of these bizarre pets.I think Drs James, Hamish and Shane might be on their collective way to de-throwning Aussie TV vets Dr Harry and Chris Brown as heroes for children and animal lovers across the country!Would love to see a second, third and fourth season!",False
14,10,Amazing show and talented team!,ppjqxrqmnh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a great snippet into the exotics sector and how very talented the vets are! It's not an easy job and it's great to see just how hard you all work behind the scenes and what's involved.I'm a regular at you're peninsula clinic and have also been to the Perth clinics. I wouldn't take my pets anywhere else.Thank you to the entire team and for producing such an easy to watch, entertaining show on our little unusual pets and sharing your day to day lives with us.It's great to be able to show friends and family just how talented you all are too.Would love to see another season...or 10!!!!",False
15,10,Informative and fun,lisaziazan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love that you get to see so many awesome pets and what vetinary care they need. The Unusual Pet Vet in Murdoch Perth is our vet and they have looked after our guinea pigs so well. This series shows how knowledgeable these vets are and how caring they are to all the creatures they see. This show is great for all people who are considering getting a more unusual pet so they can learn how these animals need to be cared for and what potential health issues they may have. It is wonderful to see such good care for all these different birds, animals, fish and reptiles and the good outcomes that can be achieved with expert vet care.",False
16,10,Amazing and heartfelt!,ellengpieper,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Bizarre Pet Vets takes viewers on an emotional journey in every episode, beginning with the unique perspective of the owner and their beloved pet, problem-solving the diagnosis and watching captivating up-close surgeries.The Bizarre Pet Vets stands out as a fantastic show due to the genuineness shown by the veterinary team, clients and cases. Not only does the show take us through interesting cases, it is also very educational about the unique animals owned as pets in Australia.Highly recommended for anyone interested in exotic pets, for animal lovers, or an entertaining, educational experience.",False
17,10,Amazing on and off the screen,raanamaewalsh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dr James and the fantastic team he has built at The Unusual Pet Vets are as knowledgeable, caring, dedicated and curious off screen as they are on screen. My frogs and I have been fortunate enough to have the support of the team for roughly 13+ years. I LOVED the show. Showing the community how to appropriately care for unusual and exotic pets, but also giving those who have unusual and exotic pets, an insight into what happens behind the scenes to ensure our pets safety. I hope that a second season comes to fruition so ongoing education, in a fun and engaging way continues to be possible for all.",False

1,8,Not a new and improved Armstrong,dneher,n/a,15/08/2025,"I suspect that Armstrong hoped that this video would help rehabilitate his reputation, but his performance does him no favors. His petulance and self-absorption are on full display. With his deep pockets and his ready access to media, Armstrong tried to ruin the lives of people who he knew were telling the truth; yet he is more concerned in this video with what he imagines to be the world's unfair treatment of him.",False
2,7,A bad person who does bad things,michael-kerrigan-526-124974,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lance - a two part documentary about the rise and fall of seven time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong. I didn't get into cycling until after Armstrong's reign as TDF winner and his infamous confession about doping on the Oprah Wimphrey show. Now - after spending over 3 hours in his company, I don't like the guy. It feels to me as if he's trying to deflect blame for his actions. To allow himself a new career (which is already happening as a cycling commentator on US radio. It feels like that - in his eyes - it is his road to redemption. I didn't know how to articulate how I felt about him until, towards the end of this often compelling doc his former team mate said ""there are good people who do bad things, and there are bad people who do good things"" and let's the viewer decide which category Lance belongs. My view is that he is a bad person who does bad things and I have zero sympathy for his demise. Yes - I'm sure there are reasons for his 'badness' - such as his tough paternal upbringing - but reasons are not excuses. I hope LA is not welcomed back to the public fray - he's all in it for himself, as I'm sure he's always been. A really interesting watch - 7.5 out of ten",False
3,8,An interesting view of a guy who has spent as much time lying to himself as to everyone else,drt10,n/a,15/08/2025,"He pretends that he accepts the wrong that he did but he still can't forgive Landis? He's still trying to reframe himself as hard done by, as much in his own mind as in other people's. The mental gymnastics he must go through on a daily basis makes me almost feel sorry for him. Except that he's a manipulative narcissist.I'm looking forwards to a similar documentary with Trump after he gets out of jail for tax evasion...",False
4,8,Well made about a pure evil person,nlpieter,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary concludes with an exploration of the moral compasses of its subjects, particularly Lance, who is unarguably a figure of pure malevolence. His regret seems to derive more from being exposed than from remorse over his actions. Over a decade, he has wreaked devastation on numerous people's lives. The fact that he has managed to avoid incarceration for his deeds, not even considering his doping offences, is truly astonishing.The documentary is skillfully crafted. However, certain background sounds might inadvertently elicit sympathy for Lance, which he doesn't warrant.Lance, do all people a favor, and stay home and ride your boat! Also stop talking about other people!",True
5,8,A Lesson in Narcissism,guitarmuscle,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe problem with Armstrong is he is a winner, a champion who can't stand losing, and he lost big time, he's trying to get on with his life but his bitterness and resentment can't help coming to the surface and someone has to be blamed for his downfall, and that person is Floyd Landis whose E-mails set in motion the events that exposed his lies. His defence.all along, since he had to admit his lies, has been everybody was doping so he was leveling the playing field and he was made scapegoat for everything that was wrong in the Sport of Cycling, but he never seems to grasp that while other Dopers have been forgiven and rehabilitated back into the Sport, his crimes were much worse. He was the poster boy for the sport, he inspired millions of people around the world, yet he used his power and influence to try and ruin peoples reputations, he ruined some cyclist careers, had doping violations covered up and got politicians to bury investigations into him. This Documentary shows him admitting some of his failings and apologising for some of the things he did to people, but he still leaves you with the impression that he thinks he did nothing wrong and he still won 7 Tour De France's fairly, he can't even admit that Betsy and Frankie Andreu were right when they heard him tell his Cancer Doctor about all the Drugs he'd been taking, because to him that feels like Betsy would have won, and Lance can't have that because he hates to lose, and as he says this Documentary is his truth how he remembers things, the trouble is as with every Narcissist, someone else is always to blame for their problems, this Documentary just leaves you with the feeling that deep down he still believes he was made an example of because of his name and he did very little wrong, tell that to Emma O'Reilly, Betsy Andreu, Filippo Simeoni, Tyler Hamilton, Floyd Landis, Christophe Bassons, Greg LeMond, David Walsh and many more who crossed him over the years, tell them you were Scapegoat Lance.",True
6,7,This Guy!,grahamchris,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is basically 3 hours of Lance Armstrong trying to justify his years and years of blatant cheating. His constant mantra ""I wouldn't change a thing"". Is laughable.The documentary itself is very well done and I'm pleased I've watched it. If you have an interest in cycling and the Lance Armstrong saga. It's definitely worth a watch.But I must say, Armstrong's demeanour and language throughout is rather disappointing. Surely he should be more humble.",True
7,8,OK document.,jtukko,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nice document. It's scary that he still things that Floyd did a wrong thing, when spoke truth?! That's attitude is just horrible. Well lance did good things too, so sometimes bad things can produce something good. He still is bad person in many ways. Not only he cheats but he is talking bad things about other athletes like Sastre. That comment about Sastre was just horrible.",False
8,7,"""Lance"" vs. ""The Armstrong Lie"": and the winner is...",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Lance"" (2020 release in 2 parts; 205 min.) is a TV documentary about the life and times of Lance Armstrong. As the movie opens, Lance addresses the camera and says ""I'm going to tell you my truth"". The first question from the director to Lance: ""When was the first time you dope?"", which seems to take Armstrong by surprise (""so this is how it's going to go, huh?"" Armstrong eventually responds it was at age 21). We then go back in time to Lance's upbringing in Plano, TX, and how at age 15 he became a break-out star in triathlon. At this point we are less than 15 min. into the documentary...Couple of comments: this film is directed by Marina Zenovich, the award-winning documentarian whose previous work includes ""Robin WIlliam: Come Inside My Mind"" and ""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired"", just to name those. Here she is granted ""all access"" to the Lance Armstrong of today, with Lance being forthright to the best of his ability and memory as to what all transpired in his cycling career and beyond. The first part of the documentary takes us through 1999 and includes of course Lance's battle with testicular cancer and his eventual return to cycling while also presiding over the Live Strong non-profit. The second part of the documentary focuses almost exclusively on Lance's fall from grace. If you are a cyclist fan, beware that some, but not a great amount, attention is given to his cycling achievements. You may recall that in 2013, Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney released the documentary ""The Armstrong Lie"", in the wake of Lance's confession of it all to Oprah Winfrey. So the question is what does ""Lance"" bring to the table that ""The Armstrong Lie"" didn't? To be honest, not a great deal. No new revelations of any kind. Yes, Lance is more remorseful than in 2013, but equally more cocky than ever before. Not sure if this documentary will change anyone's mind about Lance the person and/or Lance the cyclist.""Lance"" premiered at this year's Sundance film festival to good acclaim and recently aired on ESPN in its ongoing 30 For 30 series. I quite enjoyed watching this, although it lacks of course the element of shock and dismay when all of this unfolded in 2012013 culminating in the infamous Oprah interview. Still, if you are a fan of cycling and/or of Lance, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion...",False
9,8,Not a pretty picture,sjonno-20676,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's maybe an unpopular opinion but I still think he's one of the best ever to play the cycling game. Everyone else was doping and I think they still are and he was the best. Apart from that, this is clearly a portrait of a sociopath. Lying comes natural to this guy. Incapable of emotions, although he tries to fake it during his Ullrich / Pantani speech, which turns out to be whitewashing himself. This is just a really scary dude. The world should be glad he was a cyclist and not a politician.",True
10,7,Absolutely shocking!,wim-vds,n/a,15/08/2025,"You have to watch this , to actually see for yourself , how shocking this story is! Lance Armstrong abuses his healing from cancer and all his charitas to justify a life full of cheating, lying and using doping, destroying other peoples life's along the way but most of all ruining 7 Tour de France years long the cycling sport. Destroying also the chances to win this race for the few ounces that want to do it clean....And it makes you realise that it hasn't stopped after that . Landis admits in this programme that he won the Tour on doping as well.... and there was Ullrich...and how many did the same the following years...
And today..?!
Shocking!",False
11,8,The fall of the boss,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Does the world really need yet another documentary about disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong? This series is very thorough, and benefits from an unusual frankness from its protagonist. Clearly, Armstrong is, while admitting to his crimes, trying to build the case for his partial rehabilitation; but he seems more honest here than previously, if not necessarily more likeable. He clearly carries resentment that other dopers have been treated less harshly than him; but he was the boss of the peloton, a rich man and a bully with it, who denied everything as aggressively as possible for as long as possible, and there's simply no way sociery could, or should, have given him a free pass. If Lance will now foreover be the poster child for sports doping, he made it so. Armstrong's story is still both an amazing and terrible one, and it's retold here well; he remains an intriguing figure, albeit not a nice one.",False
12,7,More complex portrait than some other docs. Still a pathnarc.,lu_lou_belle,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jeez what a resentful odious creature. The fire in his belly is slowly consuming him. I am so glad he found sports instead of killing small animals as a child, or the world might have had to endure a completely different type of suffering. 10 years later, and a world set on fire since the last set if epics on all if Armstrong's transgressions, and this presents with a littke distance perhaps a more complex portrait of personal ambition in a sport that only seemed to catch on as a result of Lemond and then Armstrong. The most interesting quote in this two parter comes from a former team manager who when talking about Americans involvement in cycling that American sports are Football and Basketball, Anericans that go into cycling don't fit in(as in they are oddballs in their own culture). And yet Armstrong did nothing if not adapt an American competitive approach-win at all costs whether or not you destroy that which you set out to conquer. The family annihilator model of if I can't have it, I will amke damn sure no one else can.Well anyway, Lance has been to therapy, seen the effects of his consequences meted out on his family, gotten the best coaching, legal and business advice power and influence and money can buy, and he's still desperate to settle scores, although he was nice enough to apologize to Emma the Soignier. It'll be fun in a new way to hear Christian V comment occasionally about Armstrong's alt Tour de France exploits during NBC's race broadcast.",False
13,5,"Wow, narcissism has a new poster boy, what a psychopath",davefurney,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary actually achieved the goal of removing any doubt about Lance Armstrong's character.Brace yourself if you have ANY hope that there is a scrap of humility or that Lance may have learnt something. He certainly has not, and never will.After following cycling for a long time, and after posting this review, I'll never talk about, think of, or give this human being another second of my time.Farewell Lance Armstrong. The worst of humanity.",False
14,8,Sad,t-yanagimoto,n/a,15/08/2025,A house of cards is all he was. Still hoping for some kind redemption but I'm not too optimistic after watching this.,False
15,9,Solid,brett-76260,n/a,15/08/2025,Really good documentary and probably the best one out there on Lance. Really worth watching and a very well made show...,False
16,7,Wasted talent !!,kagey-28769,n/a,15/08/2025,"Single minded , arrogant and selfish !! Along with a talent . Problem is that only winning mattered and winning anyway possible!!
It's always the others not me attitude!!
It's a very interesting film but it's the same as all these type of people. It's a shame because he was a fantastic talent and didn't see that as enough!
Not sure if there was much point to this film ! You do hope that he can put his demons to rest !!",False
17,9,Big cycling fan,soundasatrout,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm a big cycling fan, stopped watching during the lance era. Loved this movie, lance comes across kinda badly but he owns it and I kinda like him a bit more after watching. Favourite part was when he called out the todays cycling community for the hipocrasy.",False
18,7,No surprises,michigirl-41979,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't say I enjoyed watching this, it merely confirmed what I already new to be true about the man. I have had some close encounters with Lance and if you are not cover-girl beautiful he has no time for you. My nephew had the same cancer that Lance had. His sister had the opportunity to speak to Lance and merely wanted to thank him for his work with his Foundation. He basically told her to f#@k off. I didn't like him before that happened and after that I hated him.If you expect apologies or meaningful dialogue from him, this show won't provide it.The show is very well done, interesting and compelling. Watch it then draw your own conclusions.",False
19,2,Nothing new,jahanskov,n/a,15/08/2025,"I dont really see the point in this, there is a bit about his new life, but all in all it is the same, or less, than what has already been told in other documentarys, for instance, the armstrong lie.Waste of time.",False

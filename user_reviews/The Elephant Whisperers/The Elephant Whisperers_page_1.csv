1,8,There needs to be a follow-up documentary...,edwin-wks,n/a,16/08/2025,"About all the keyboard eco-warriors furiously pounding out their reviews in righteous indignation at the alleged mistreatment of these elephants. I can almost hear the blood of these armchair conservationists boil as they watch this documentary through their privileged first world lens. ""I am a sponsor of an elephant trust"", one declares, while another bleats, ""I do not care about your (Tamil) cultural reasoning!"", most likely from the safety and comfort of their modern abodes, and on devices like MacBooks that probably cost more than the annual salary of the caretakers in the documentary. In doing so, they expose their lack of any cultural sensitivity and indeed any true sense of sacrifice or worldliness.Elephants are as revered as cows in India, because of a god, Lord Ganesha, who is part elephant. This does not mean that elephants are not used as a means of transportation like horses. It simply means that they are bestowed more respect than most animals. The elephants left behind or cast out of their tribe would very likely perish if not for human intervention. The impoverished caretakers find meaning and purpose in their lives through looking after these elephant cubs, just as the e-conservationists do so by aligning with values of animal welfare and ethical treatment without ever risking being eaten by a tiger or stabbed by an elephant. My only complaint is that the documentary was not nearly long enough.",False
2,9,Heartwarming and a Stunning Short Documentary,etcrushabh57-432-364331,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this on Netflix 2 days prior to the Oscars & absolutely fell in love with the documentary..The visuals are breathtaking, the emotions are so genuine, the production value is on point, the narrative so engaging & lastly, you end up longing for a part 2 !!The 2 central character are so caring, down to earth but the main takeaways are specific to how the director humanized this topic into showing the culture of this Indian tribe & how love is the only eternal emotion that transcends everything in this universe..Special shoutout to Ammu & Raghu who make this documentary so heartwarming!!!A well deserved Oscars !!",False
3,8,good one,saru2020,n/a,16/08/2025,"Though it was on my watch list, it was prioritized to the #1 position after it got the Oscars, the first Indian-made documentary film to ever receive that award.The cinematography capturing the forest & the lives of the elephant maintainers were just mindblowing.The old couple whose lives were portrayed was so simple & shuttle, though it was very short, the emotional connection they have with the elephant gets us emoted as wellthe communication & emotional connection these people have with the elephant was amazingly captured and presented.The naughtiness of the elephants playing around did bring smiles to our faces.Documentaries like these should probably be made as feature-length films for greater coverage of mass audiences, if you ask me.",False
4,10,"If you love elephants, you'll love this film",jarch-99944,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is about a Tamil couple who fosters orphaned elephants. Most baby elephants don't survive human care, especially if they are very young and require a lot of attention. This couple managed to raise baby elephants, whereas others have failed. Unfortunately, failure means death. Watching the bond between humans and elephants grow into genuine affection is heartwarming. It's not too much to call it love. Elephants have very good memories and develop emotional attachments to humans. It was a joy to watch. This film does a good job of humanizing elephants and humanizing a foreign culture to this sheltered ""ugly"" American. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",False
5,10,The Elephant Whispers is indeed loud!!!!!,rohanpatil-28566,n/a,16/08/2025,"No matter who you are, what religion, colour or race we are all a part of the Earth and we unite as one in this shared landscapes. This documentary grows on you as it progresses. The director has beautifully captured the story about how a bond is developed between the orphaned Elephants and a couple who had recently lost something in their life. It will make you smile, cry, touched and engaged throughout the 41 minutes.Kudos to the forest department of Tamil Nadu for supporting and allowing this story to be heard.The documentary footage has superb cinematography and has captured the landscape of Mudumalai splendidly. You feel like watching this docu again and again.",False
6,7,love leads to love,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director Kartiki Gonsalves introduces us to Bomman and Bellie, indigenous Kattunauakans working together to care for Raghu, an elephant rescued as an injured orphan in Tamil Nadu, India in 2019. The elephant preserve where they live and work is run by the Forest Department, and Bomman's hut is right next to the stall where Raghu sleeps.The love they share for Raghu soon develops into a romance between Bomman and Bellie. They talk to Raghu, train him, feed him, bathe him, play with him, and even tuck him in bed at night. Later when they also become caregivers for 5-month-old Baby Ammu, we can see the similarities to raising human children. Both elephants make it into the wedding day pictures of Bomman and Bellie, but when Raghu is re-assigned to other caregivers, we witness the grieving of the couple, as well as that of Ammu, who has lost a friend and role model. The 41-minute film serves to show how animals and people can live off the same forest and share a love.",False
7,10,I loved this movieðŸ’œ,alexandrasaundersart,n/a,16/08/2025,"At a time like this when the world is so much in turmoil it is easy to get disheartened. Once in a while, though, you run across a movie that will pull at your heartstrings and make you realize that there is still goodness in the world. This movie will make you break out in smiles knowing that there are some very special people in the world who are kind and devoted to helping raise 2 baby elephants. I am so happy I found it on Netflix. I recommend it highly! I myself have already watched it twice and told all my friends and family about it! Kudos to the Director, wildlife photographer Kartiki Gonsalves, and her film crew for making this charming movie and bringing it to the world.",False
8,6,Beautiful Ode,Mabkid,n/a,16/08/2025,"This Oscar winner was probably chosen for its beautiful editing and narration. It is beautifully done... the musical score, the majestic views, the endearing narration...Unfortunately, the story is limited in scope. There are the stories about the blue ocean, an endearing octopus, and so many more nature documentaries that I'm surprised this one stood out... probably at this moment in time. There isn't much depth into the bigger birds-eye view of the locals or the elephant situation. This documentary is like following a cute pet around.The Oscar is good publicity and attention to somewhere around the world that isn't America. Thanks for recognizing that environmental issues span borders and the whole world isn't America. Good view into a forgotten yet charming part of the world.",False
9,10,"A powerful, emotional account of a human-animal relationships",nishantjnereyeth,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredibly moving documentary about a couple in Southern India who foster orphaned elephants. The film does a phenomenal job of providing environmental, societal, and historical context to a heartwarming story. The elephants are undoubtedly the stars of the film - their mischief, gentle nature, and unconditional affection display a human child-like character that only makes you smile. Where the viewer is truly lucky is that the couple is able to translate exactly what the elephant is thinking, doing, or feeling in a way that a parent can for a child. The best thing about this short documentary is that it has something for everyone. A must watch.",False
10,7,Cute Raghu and Ammu,abhilashaa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Review for ""The Elephant Whisperers""**Rating: 6.5/10*""The Elephant Whisperers"" offers a touching glimpse into the bond between humans and elephants, set against the stunning backdrop of South India's forests. The real stars are Raghu and Ammu, two incredibly cute baby elephants whose playful antics and gentle nature are beautifully captured. While the documentary excels in showcasing this connection, it occasionally drags and could benefit from a more engaging narrative. Still, the film's heartwarming moments and breathtaking cinematography make it worth a watch, especially for animal lovers.",False
11,10,Simple sophisticated and classy story telling,shivang-21605,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some stories are simple yet complex because they are storming with emotions. This is one of them and making a film that connects with the masses becomes a challenge. Elephant Whisperers conquers this challenge because of some great direction, exquisite story telling, super camera work and great music. Human animal relationships weaved in the wonderful landscape of Mudumalai with a strong message of elephant conservation in India to end with, this is a complete winner. One feels like personally going and meeting this ele couple and ofcourse Raghu and AmmuWell done team and ofcourse it's a must watch.",False
12,n/a,If there was Zero I would rate so,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film shows how humans manipulate animals for their benefit. You'll see Elephants in chains, people riding them, handling them with sticks. Check how elephant's ears are pierced. Why there are holes on Raghu's ear flaps? Carefully watch how Raghu's so called parent ask Raghu to change direction by pinching his ear. If the place was seriously an animal shelter, why on earth there are so many elephants gathered for being sheltered? Why they are being ridden, why are they painted and most of all why are they tortured with chains? I couldn't withstand complete documentary. Shame on Netflix for making and promoting this documentary. Documentary is no different than circus and we as audience are promoting this crime. Seriously...",True
13,6,Seemed like the poor calves were being used!,divyamcoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"The couple claims to be elephant carers but I think they are only a means of income for them. Although their bond does seem genuine to an extent, it also appears like they use these animals for their benefit. Chain them and ride them.No doubt the forest officials are doing a great job at saving calves but why can't they be rehabilited in a proper manner and reintroduced into the forest when they are old enough?As an Elephant lover, it was uncomfortable for me to watch the calves being chained and isolated from other elephants!Yes, the rescuing of orphaned/lost calves may be necessary however raising them in captivity is not! As much as humans like to think that animals require their intervention to survive, they mostly do not!",False
14,5,Not the best sanctuary,mirian_w,n/a,16/08/2025,I sponsor elephants at Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.They do not chain elephants. They do not ride elephants. They do not paint elephants. They do not poke holes in elephants' ears. Baby elephants go through 3 long stages of rehabilitation to survive in the wild. There are very strict rules regarding human contact. Check out how it should be done here.In this movie they make elephants be their servants and do not rehabilitate for the wild. They use elephants for their own entertainment.But they get a passing mark for saving injured elephants. They should learn more from DSWT.Another good sanctuary is Elephant Nature Park. Lek Saengduean Chailert is the founder of Elephant Nature Park and Save Elephant Foundation in Thailand. They help many elephants that are rescued from slave labour. Many are maimed or very old. I doubt this place in India would care for such elephants as these elephants are of no utility use for them.Raghu is like a dependent domesticated pet.,False
15,10,The story of animal love which needs to be seen,navneetyps-92578,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started watching this when i was feeling low but there was such a calmness about this doucmentary. Such a simple story yet told in such an intricate fashion. Hats off to the cinematography team for capturing the beauty of wildlife reserve in Tamil Nadu , each shot better than the previous. The innocence of the baby elephants and the parallel to the connection between humans and their babies being same as elephants and their caretakers is shown very aptly.In a world where animal cruely is increasing day by day, this a truly a story, a story of love and affection, which needs to get out and be seen. I highly recommend everyone to give it a watch!",False
16,10,Must watch now!,gigipandole,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such an inspirational and beautiful story between the bond of an elephant and his two so very kind caretakers. The fantastic story, footage, and soundtrack together created such a magical and emotional film that will leave you smiling throughout except for one tiny part where you may become a little teary-eyed. It also beautifully sheds light into stunning tribal villages in India and how they co-exist with nature - something we need to starting doing as well!! Apart from showcasing a spectacular bond it also underscores the importance of elephant conservation and instills a deep sense of gratitude for the amazing people working towards making a difference. I seriously recommend watching it!",False
17,7,"""Our people do not fear elephants.""",classicsoncall,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis story takes place at an elephant rehabilitation camp at the Madumalai Tiger Reserve in India. We're first introduced to Bomman Kattunayakan and his elephant Raghu, which he found suffering and nearly dead, when it was lost from its herd. With special tenderness and care, Bomman was able to bring it back to health and we see it thriving while forming a special bond with its master. Shortly after Bomman took up this unusual vocation, he was joined by a lady named Bellie who he eventually married. She shared the same special dedication to fostering elephants, and it was quite unusual to hear of the couples' reverence for their animals, holding them in the same regard as they would for God. Not understanding their concept of religion, that sounded almost sacrilegious to me, but as I say, one would have to experience their spiritual nature in order to comprehend the feeling they had for their elephants. A second elephant they named Ammu was brought to the couples' care when it was found separated from its mother, and it was interesting to see how Raghu expressed jealousy at first, but gradually became friends with the younger animal.This film is a contender for a 2023 Oscar in the category of Best Short Documentaries. I was lucky enough to catch this film along with the four other contenders for this year's Academy Award at the Paramount Theater in Middletown, New York. It's also available at the present time as a Netflix documentary.",True
18,10,unforgettable,lee_eisenberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"The winner of Best Documentary Short Film at the 95th Academy Awards focuses on a group of indigenous people in India, and how they care for elephants. ""The Elephant Whisperers"" is never preachy. What we learn from it is that by staying connected to wildlife, we understand ourselves better. Kartiki Gonsalves has done a fine job showing a culture that we in the west don't usually get to see (how many people in the western countries have ever even heard of Tamil, much less heard it spoken?).Most importantly, the documentary shows us what life is like for the pachyderms who roam rural India. It can be a tough life for them, but they press on.Definitely see it.",False
19,7,Great movie,annvadakkan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie beautifully shows the special bond between people and elephants in Southern India. This documentary focuses on how caretakers look after orphaned elephants, sharing their daily life and the deep emotional connections they form. It's great for anyone who loves stories about animal care and the connection between humans and nature. While it mainly tells personal stories, it gives a heartfelt look at caring for wildlife, making it a wonderful watch for those interested in animals and their well-being. It was a great movie and I throughly enjoyed it, it is a great watch for anyone who wants a good watch.",False
20,10,"So beautiful, so sad",nitz-rockz999,n/a,16/08/2025,Loved it! Animals have the same emotional range as humans and elephants are no different. This documentary shows such a beautiful bond between the caretakers and the elephants. I wish everyone respected them the same way. These gentle giants don't deserve the hardship that humans cause to their environment and wellbeing. The documentary is so soothing to watch. This is a slice of life about an aged couple who is tasked with raising orphaned elephants. They are so gentle and caring towards the elephants that you can feel it through the screen.The film will make you happy but will also leave you teary eyed. Happy watching!,False

Full of joy and sadness, this documentary takes you on a journey not many of us will take in our lifetime. It will not take too much out of your day to give this a watch.",False
22,10,"Such an overlooked, yet powerful story",sumanth-35247,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary/film is truly one-of-a-kind! I am so glad that stories that need to be told to a wider audience is finally being told by empathetic film makers. While all credit to the makers, equal kudos to the Tamil Nadu forest department for supporting and enabling this story to be told. The bond between mahouts and their elephants is one to be experienced in-person, failing which, this movie comes a close second! I hope this encourages more such individuals and teams to look at stories right in front of us with a different lens and create more such work. Do watch, especially with impressionable children!",False
23,1,All about the people,maaike_suijker,n/a,16/08/2025,"How can this docu win an Oscar?You see the animals in chains the whole time. And the 'caretakers' walking around with sticks and the 'ritual' where the elephants bow a bit and trumpeting all together. So unnatural... pure cultural reasoning, very sad.A place is a good sanctuary where elephants are walking freely in their own habitat and people watching them from a distance. They don't ride on elephants, they don't touch them nor paint them or put flowers on them.Truly don't understand why this docu can win an Oscar. We have still a lot to learn about taking care for these beautiful creatures. This is not the way. Very sad.",False
24,10,Heartwarming and sad,PeteThePrimate,n/a,16/08/2025,"This story of a Tamil couple fostering (successfully) orphaned elephants is worth 40 minutes of your time. Fostering has a high failure rate and by failure read death. This couple obviously love each other and love what they do and there is one particularly sad moment when a decision is taken out of their hands that shows you how much love they have for these creatures. Beautifully shot, the camera never intrudes and you can see the bond between humans and animals and you get to see the playful side of these amazing creatures. A worthy Oscar winner and you cannot help but feel some admiration for this lovely couple. I wish the film had been longer.",False
25,10,Refreshing story about a unique relation of an elephant and a couple,varunrandom,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a beautiful story about elephant caretakers. Raghu is assigned to a couple as he lost his mother in an accident. Although paid, the couple takes immense care of the baby elephant and successfully raises them. The interaction between the couple and the elephant looks similar to a tiny baby and the parents. A true reflection of love is seen both ways. The movie will shed light on the importance of tribal and village culture in India as these people are the genuine caretakers of nature and animals, unlike urban dwellers like us, who have already lost touch with the environment. The movie has an important message that humans and animals still need each other and can survive in harmony.",False

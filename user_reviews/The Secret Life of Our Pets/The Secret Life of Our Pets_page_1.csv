1,7,No screen time for cats,crazybat-52811,n/a,15/08/2025,The creators probably don't like cats much. They have used a cat only for the poster. As soon as they start speaking something about cats they immediately switch to other animals. It's like for a moment you are seeing a cat and happy that something is going to be explained about them and the next moment it is some other animal.,False
2,4,lolcat documentary,lampadaire20002,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you own a cat , a dog , a turtle or a rabbit & constantly look at your pets thinking ""aoooooww they're so cute"", in order to fulfill a feeling of loneliness in your life, then you shall like this documentary.Otherwise you might feel a bit disappointed about the scientific facts mentioned in this , jumping from one to another without any deepening educative goal, and finally realise that you are watching something like an endless ""tiktok"" streaming that will lead you absolutely nowhere.You might then decide to watch your pet instead that documentary and keep your ""aaaaawwww so cute"" attitude : your response to boredom will be exactly the same.",False

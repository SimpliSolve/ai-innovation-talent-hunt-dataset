1,9,Ideal tribute to Anita Ekberg,jrsx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anita Ekberg has been hailed for her beauty. But was she ever given the opportunity to show her acting skills? (If she even had any...) Or was she trapped for life in the image of the gorgeous girl parading in Fontana Di Trevi in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960)?This must see documentary (or rather ""mockumentary"" since most of Monica Bellucci's scenes are staged) tries to answer this question. I'm not sure if it succeeds or not. But it definitely works as a touching tribute to a legendary and unfairly forgotten star and as a window to the every day life of a modern cinema icon like Monica.",False

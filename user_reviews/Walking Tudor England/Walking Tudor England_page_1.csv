1,6,Fine content but struggled with sound quality,russmilham,n/a,16/08/2025,"To the reviewer who impuned Suzannah Lipscomb's quality as a presenter on matters of history, I suggest they look upon her CV and weep. Her doctorate in medieval French history from Oxford is just the start. At one point we see her reading from contemporaneous primary documents written in French, translating on the fly as she did so. Staged? I suppose, but why bother? She is the real deal. I only wish she was better mic'd when she was bundled up out in the field. Her speech was so muffled that I often had to run captions to follow her comfortably. I loved how much she openly enjoyed encountering details that gave glimpses into everyday life of people during the era. The ways that she provided context for those details through conversations with local experts and fellow academicians, was delightful.",False
2,8,Interesting tour!,Fowl_Weather,n/a,16/08/2025,A very interesting series and thoroughly researched. Good presenter whose passion for the subject is clear. Enjoyable and well worth a watch if history is your thing.,False
3,5,Informative with a tinge of wokery,anagent,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an interesting documentary series and fascinating if you happen to live in any of the areas in England that are covered. Suzannah Lipscomb is superb and obviously does her homework.However...Straight off the cuff in episode 1 we are treated to lots of nods toward diversity in Tudor times, Given the time period when this program was created, 2021, I get the feeling that idea of Anne Boleyn being Black,as portrayed in the 2021 channel 5 production of Anne Boleyn starring Jodie Turner-Smith, greatly influenced and triggered the collective wokery moguls within the production staff into pushing the diversity point. And it doesn't stop here...Later when the narrative moves on to Queen Elizabeth the 1st The fact that Tudor times societal norms allowed people to act in ways that would be abhorrent today is overlooked for the purposes of driving home the details of those responsible for starting the Slave Trade.Sadly, this documentary, although informative goes along way to make points that serve to subtly dig at white people. White men in particular.As for the production itself, It has been well done and there are lots of historians on hand to expand on interesting subjects. In some of the episodes the sound quality of Suzannah's speech is rather poor.English people have every reason to be proud of our country. There is not a country in the world with a totally clean slate and those who choose to come and live here, should take our history into consideration before packing their suitcases, because we cannot change it, and nore should we need to.",False
4,2,History can't be changed,john22615,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm always interested in history documentaries but prefer to hear just the facts. Suzannah Lipscomb likes to write her narratives in a judgemental way of things that happened in our history. What maybe considered wrong by the standards of today does not mean it was wrong 500 years ago. I realise we all learn from history but it is important it's reported in a factual way rather than a judgemental way. Little comments like ""Sir Frances Drake the so called naval hero"" put a slant on the history. He was a naval hero at that time and that's all there is to it.I think I'll give any other episodes a miss.",False
5,2,Poorly..,kmr-22308,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poorly organized, and poorly written, and I wouldn't even know where to begin with the host. Her IMDB page says she's an actress, but Acorn says she's an historian. Explains some of why she seems so uneducated and confused.",False

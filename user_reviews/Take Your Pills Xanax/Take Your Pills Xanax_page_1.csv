1,7,AN EXCELLENT REPRESENTATION OF THE SITUATION,bobr-37646,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've taken Xanax for over 25 years and I know exactly what these people have experienced. I started taking it when I came down with Meniere's Disease which caused severe attacks of vertigo that could last 8 to 10 hours. The need for help was very real and Xanax allowed me to continue working and carry on a fairly normal life. Three inner ear surgeries in about four years time resolved the worst of my symptoms which was the vertigo. Unfortunately I kept on taking 1MG a day for many years when I should have stopped taking them altogether. My experience was similar to that of several of the people in this documentary. I no longer take a daily Xanax but I have a few small doses in case I'm having a really bad day and start to feel dizzy. I don't think the people who gave this documentary low reviews understand the situation very clearly, this was well done and contains useful information. It's worth watching!",False
2,5,Started well,koofasa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Studying the long term affects of benzodiazepines is a really important topic and this documentary started out with a focus on this. Sadly though the movie devolves into looking at a few neurotic people who have issues much bigger than Xanax could ever address. Sadly too many of the people who they spoke to ended up saying they still take it and it works for them. Very little time was spent on the idea that being human has always required juggling stressful situations and that we as a species need to figure out how to get back to where we do that without pharmaceuticals. Instead we have been medicating children with Adderall and other behavior drugs so kids never have to learn how to cope with stressful situations. We're making it worse, not better and this movie is part of the problem not the solution.",False
3,6,"Worth checking out: prescribed ""too often and too long""",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Take Your Pills: Xanax"" (2022 release; 90 min) opens, we are reminded that prescriptions for Xanax have exploded the last 20-25 years. Why are so many Americans anxious and filled with dread and fear? Many talking heads are interviewed, including in the medical field as well as past and present users. One of them is Scott Stossel, author of ""My Age of Anxiety"". At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from producer-director Blair Foster (""The Clinton Affair""). Here she reassesses the rise and rise of Xanax. As an occasional user of Xanax myself (more on that in a minute), I saw a lot of recognition points throughout the movie. One of the women doctors interviewed sums it up this way: ""Xanax is meant for short term. It is prescribed too often and too long."" Bottom line: much of what I heard and saw in this movie feels on point and resonated with me. As for my own experience with Xanax: as I got older, I developed an irrational (but very real) fear of flying, to the point that I stopped flying altogether. That was a real problem, and about 5 years ago, my doctor prescribed Xanax to me. I have to tell you: it's been a life changer for me. It works like magic, and I can now travel again. I never use Xanax for any other situation, and I am frankly puzzled how one could function on a day-to-day basis when taking Xanax literally every single day. But to each their own. My personal experience with Xanax could not have gone any better, and I will never get on a plane again without it.""Take Your Pills: Xanax"" premiered a couple of days ago on Netflix, and I stumbled on it as I was browsing the latest additions on Netflix. When I saw the title, my interest was piqued immediately. Is this a revolutionary documentary? It is not, but for me it was well worth checking out, and it definitely feels on point for me. Of course don't take my word for it., so I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,1,Hypocrosy at its finest,rufusmcd,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, it starts out by saying we live in a society where everyone thinks they can solve all their problems by taking a pill. Then towards the end it says "" Oh, dont take that pill. Take this one"" You cant make this stuff up. Did I just watch a commercial for Lexapro, Celexa and Prozac? Because that's exactly what it felt like. And then the hypocritical "" Therapist "" Start yamming away at how bad Xanax is when they are the ones who prescribed it to begin with . If they were such great therapist their patients wouldnt need drugs to begin with. This is simply a hit piece paid for by the makers of the other drugs.",False
5,2,No conclusion,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"They did try to show a motley group of people with different experiences with the drug. The results ranged from great success to driving a person to suicide.It seems the person who fared the best was the woman who tries to take it ONLY a few times a month when she is feeling at her worst.What I didn't like was offering SSRIs as an alternative. I took Paxil for a while and the side effects were unbearable and getting off them was no picnic. They might not be technically addictive but you cannot stop cold turkey.A few of the people they profiled were unbelievably IRRITATING. You couldn't help but wonder of THAT was their real problem in life.My sympathies to anyone dealing with depression and anxiety. The world is a tough place for anyone intelligent and sensitive. Now if we could really make the world an easier place, we wouldn't have to dope ourselves, would we?",False
6,8,Balanced Point of Views,mike_NY,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well balanced history and overview of Xanax, the pros and the cons. I'm unclear why so many reviewers are angry about this. It in no way villifies benzos or patients. The stories / case studies represented a broad demographic of patients. The clinicians from the mental health community were very careful and succinct in their language. The only segment discussed that did not fare well was the medical community (regarding the patient who was misdiagnosed at Mayo Clinic). It doesnt go terribly deep but it does cover a lot in an hour. I also appreciated the history of anxiety treatment as well as the advertising that was discussed.",False
7,4,What is this documentary about?,smokeysmokeysmokey,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSeems too unfocused and jumping around between different issues. There seemed to be no conclusions to the people's stories who were taking part of the documentary. Started out not bad, but eventually as a viewer you had no idea where you were. No story arc. No clear journey for each of the film's characters.Every time they hit on something that might make the viewer question the Xanax drug they came back to reassure us that these drugs were a good thing. And at the end they slip in positive information about SSRI's without mentioning the mountains of critical information on those.The trials for many of these pills were conducted only on the short term, which to me makes the drug companies criminals. You should not be legally allowed to prescribe a person a brain altering mainstream medical drug long term if said drug was never studied long term. I also question how the companies who make the profit from the drug are allowed to be the one who tests the drug for themselves? That's not how safety testing works in the motor industry. How this charade is set up is ripe for cutting corners and lying with statistics. I mean, we're talking about companies here who've been fined billions many times.If you want to watch a better anti-psych tablets documentary watch ""Medicating Normal"" documentary on YouTube. It's a proper documentary.",True
8,1,"An Important Subject, Given a Superficial Treatment",sgcim,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA simple minded presentation of a very serious, complex problem that completely ignores the decades of research.into the biological basis of anxiety disorders of former head of the Psychiatry Department of Columbia University, the late Donald F. Klein, generally considered the 'father of biological psychiatry'.The director of the documentary has no scientific credentials, and is known for making documentaries on Frank Sinatra, James Brown, and various political topics.This is not to deny that Xanax addiction is not a serious problem, and that the drug should only be prescribed as a last resort in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but there is a huge difference in clinical anxiety disorders, and many of the cases presented in this documentary.Towards the end of the doc, the clueless psychiatrists present antidotes such as 'communing with nature, meditation, mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy (which has a large failure rate in the treatment of clinical anxiety disorders, though is effective in milder cases, and educating patients in simple facts about their illness), and other ways of dealing with their problems, which is perfectly fine with dealing with stress. But the only reason Xanax should be prescribed is for the treatment of Panic Disorder, which is something completely different than stress.The fact that doctors are prescribing Xanax for stress, is part of the problem. Of course it's extremely effective in alleviating stress, but that is not what it is approved for by the medical field.Using Xanax for stress is like prescribing a powerful opioid for simple back pain. Sure, it works, but it's overkill, because of the addictive nature of opioids and benzodiazepines.The statement one of the doctors makes, that Xanax is the same thing as alcohol is erroneous,, because while alcohol works on some of the same receptors as Xanax (GABA), it also acts on other receptors, and Xanax is much more selective, and only acts on GABA. Therefore , alcohol is what's known as a 'sloppy' drug, with dangerous side effects, while the benzodiazepines.are 'cleaner' drugs without the side effects of alcohol
The other problem with benzodiazepines is overdose, but that only occurs in using them with any other CNS depressant like alcohol, opiates,etc. In adults, and in huge doses with young people, who probably shouldn't be prescribed drugs like Xanax to begin with. Unfortunately, many young people use Xanax as a recreational drug, and combine it with alcohol and other CNS depressants and wind up overdosing also..",True
9,1,Arrogant psychologists who started the problem,mrslakok,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis entire documentary is just a bunch of arrogant doctors who prescribed Xanax complaining about the Xanax problem, some claiming it's because ""the system is broken."" Then the documentary focuses on marginalized people who grew up in primarily healthy households (assumed, the documentary didn't say otherwise for most individuals) who complain in circles for as long as possible to make this a full length movie. One of them says they have anxiety because of those evil Christians (of course.) Others have more serious problems and Xanax is apparently working for them.I got about 45 minutes in and couldn't listen to another sob story before I turned it off. I would rather waste my time elsewhere.Would have rather watched a documentary about the science and potential dangers of Xanax. Unfortunately, that's not what this was. There was practically no science or logic involved at all. It was all emotion based, as usual. So tired of it.",True
10,8,It's unnecessary scare tactics for those that don't have experience,malmevik77,n/a,16/08/2025,"Take Your Pills: XanaxNetflix followed up the original Take Your Pills documentary on Adderall, and pivoted to another overprescribed set of drugs: Xanax and the other benzodiazepines such as Klonopin or Valium. Anxiety happens to all of us. The documentary really pushes forth the theory that instant communication through cell phones has forced anxiety on the world. I call bull on that as it seems like an excuse for people to ask for drugs.I have never taken Xanax, especially since everything in this documentary has been known for years. The interviews of people who used the drug, the ones still alive anyway, are striking. Folks: medication can be useful and appropriate. Don't go buy street benzos, possibly laced with Fentanyl, just because you can't handle anxiety.The worst part of the information given is how deadly these drugs can be. Like the Adderall documentary, uneducated young people follow their celebrity heroes, and take these drugs thinking it's the wonder drug that'll fix everything.I write what I want in these essays, so here's my soapbox. Anxiety is real. ADHD is real. Mental health issues are real. Medication, meditation and mindfulness together are very helpful tools that can be used with therapy to help be functional and peaceful. We don't need to be a culture that pops pills, sometimes way above prescribed, in order to cope with every day life. This leads to addiction, health problems and even death.Regardless, the documentary is well done, going into the history of benzos and how they were originally used, morphing into the epidemic today. There was a lot I didn't know, and since I've used Klonopin and Valium before, I'm more upset by the folks that don't know what they're doing, versus someone watching the documentary who's never used these before.This writer is happy to listen if anyone wants to talk about mental health awareness. There's alternatives to abusing drugs. Please be careful out there.",False
11,3,Medical humdrum,Snootz,n/a,16/08/2025,"On the positive side, this ""documentary"" does establish ""Be careful what drugs you take and how you take them."" Thanks for that bit of unique wisdom that everyone already knows.The film does try to present a balanced view of Xanax, displaying both beneficial and negative experiences in using the drug. But people are different. The guy that had to withdraw from Xanax over years using microdoses is an extremely rare case; the focus on him was excessive. Most people can withdraw in a month or two, some faster. People who take a prescribed maintenance dose may have no need to withdraw. For many people this medicine is essential to function in a normal manner.They did discuss doctors over-prescribing these drugs and not doing proper follow-up. Their presentation of the medical community is quite accurate in regard to the ""corporate doctor"" situation we see so much today.The young blonde who took a regulated dosage of Xanax daily due to serious panic attacks and properly balanced her life with that dosage-- that is more what the drug is intended for. Again, they touched on but didn't even name PTSD-- a condition which is more common than most people realize, and which may absolutely require treatment with such drugs for the person to even survive. When the brain is totally out of sync with their body, heart, lungs and hormones, Clonazepam (another form of Xanax) is almost a miracle cure for such people-- and taking it is not an ""option"" if they want to live a normal life.Largely this film just touches the surface of issues but doesn't really establish anything. At the end, viewers are left knowing no more about the drug, its benefits, its dangers, and proper administration or use than they did when the documentary began. It's an hour and a half of non-accomplishment in which they discuss a wide variety of viewpoints, with no real solutions or even suggestions. Oh, except smoke weed. That can be a viable alternative.This is basically a non-helpful, uninformative non-documentary. A person can learn more by simply browsing the Internet and reading about Xanax. The only thing to take away from this is the obvious: Don't take Xanax recreationally or in excess. Don't ""get hooked"" on it. That's for those of us who need that ""duh"" kind of information.",False
12,3,A horrendous watch.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A look at the story of Xanax, a well known name, and a medication that many people relied on.I didn't particularly enjoy this, not the content, but the tone, delivery, input, it felt to me as though they were trivialising a hugely serious topic. Some of the interviews, was it me, or were some a little obnoxious.It infuriates me so much that anyone believes in this day and age, that you can sort out everyone and anyone's problems with a pill. Does anyone truly believe that popping a chemical concoction will remove all of someone's problems?It's a pity that some of the so called experts couldn't have looked for alternative ways of dealing with people with mild anxiety issues, prescribing stuff like Xanax, just awful.As a Brit, I was left speechless to learn that the pharmaceutical companies are allowed to advertise, unscrupulous.One thing this pretty poor documentary did, was to remind me not to watch the news, or limit it to a few times a week only.Didn't enjoy it, 3/10.",False
13,2,Ableist Documentary,hromag,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is extremely biased and made me furious. It is anecdotal and does not take into consideration that there are some of us who cannot function in moments of panic. It's debilitating and crippling. It destroys relationships. They interviewed mostly people who were just ""stressed"" and put the blame on those who truly suffer. Stress related to a bad day or dealing with a breakup has nothing to do with brain chemistry. This is the fault of the doctors who give I'm proper diagnoses. Big pharma can obviously be toxic and cruel. Of course Xanax needs to be used and monitored with caution, BUT...those who actually need it are less likely to abuse it because moments of despair can cause real harm because sometimes Xanax is the only thing that can assist in moments of unprovoked dread caused by your brain going into fight or flight mode. Often caused by real trauma or mental disorders. This film is triggering, heartbreaking, and dangerous. Those who actually need it are less likely to abuse it. We can't just make our brains work with cognitive behavioral therapy. Weed can help some people but it also causes paranoia and many develop at tolerance for it. I'm beside myself with this film. I felt attacked as a viewer. Everyone responsible for this film has obviously never dealt with mental illness.",False
14,3,Terribly Misleading Message on a Vital Topic,rt-19441,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has the message of a '90s after school special. I expected to see Nancy Regan as the director in the credits. As just one example of the blind fear-mongering and rejection of science advancements that can truly help people and change their lives for their better, this documentary conflates SSRIs with BENZOS. Those are two entirely separate drugs with significantly different risk factors. SSRIs like Zoloft have been life saviors for countless people with no side effects. These are the same people who were forced to suffer in silence for decades unnecessarily because of tragic messages like this documentary.",False
15,1,Once again adding to the stigma,virginiajhurley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why?!! I hoped after ""Take Your Pills:Adderall"" the film makers would have learned from their mistakes. But no. They demonize another drug that is abused by people who do not need it and over prescribed by doctors who don't specialize in anxiety disorders. Is Xanax addictive? Yes, IF you don't use it for its intended purpose. Panic Attack Disorder. It's debilitating and life threatening in that once in a panic spiral you want nothing more than for it to stop. This film fails to shed light on how Xanax can be life saving for some of us. Mindful breathing, meditation, yoga doesn't work for panic attack disorder. I practice TM, and it does wonders for any of my general anxiety/stress but it can't stop a panic attack.. . And Panic Attack Disorder unlike other anxiety disorders,
generally has no trigger. Watching your favorite show,
perfectly content and BAM- panic attack. It's awful, I never know when it will happen and thank goodness for Xanax. I don't take it everyday, I take it when I have a panic attack. These filmmakers need to stop. This one sided narrative harms people who genuinely benefit from this drug. Recreational users and abusers make it so difficult for people who need this medication to actually get it.",False
16,2,Infuriating one sided finger pointing at the mentally ill,MsDarcyFarrow,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirstly, I did not even realize I could write a review. I really hope it gets posted. Upon reading the featured review in which the person stated it infuriated them and why I was in whole-hearted agreement, I thought I want to express my thoughts here also. I suffer from debilitating anxiety, depression, PTSD, sleep paralysis, and panic attacks. I literally could not function without my medication. This film is absolutely one sided and very triggering to me personally. This documentary is designed to make you feel badly about yourself and your anxiety, or dependency on medication. Most of the ""therapists"" interviewed seem to have a ""suck it up and deal with life"" attitude, going as far as to state that life is supposed to be painful. I strongly disagree. I realize this is more personal than an actual assessment of the film. However, I really hope these few words aid anyone else who watches the film and feels lesser than - you are not.",True
17,3,Difficult to watch,erhanipekciler,n/a,16/08/2025,"Omg I don't know but I didn't watch that with full attention. Something wrong but I don't know what is the problem. Last years Netflix documentaries are very nice, I watched many of them and I loved them but this one really boring. Some people talking about side effects and bla bla.. No conclusion and a little meaningless. Why all ladies have green necklace on this documentary? It is too long also. I finished but I didn't learn anything and didn't give me new horizon. Actually my review finished here but I have to write something more for 600 characters.Final words : boring and unnecessary documentary. If you have a time you can watch but I don't recommend. Sorry Netflix, not good this time.",False
18,1,This is not the documentary you are looking for...,pegaxs,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an avid watcher of documentaries that revolve around the drug industry, I was fascinated when I came across this doco that was something different from the usual ""opioid"" based doco I had watched in the past, so I thought I would give it a go.It starts out interesting with lots of people talking about what the drug is and what it is used for. Ok, no problem, we need to know its legitimate uses. Then it goes on to interview people who were on the medication, and that is fine, we need to know about them and why they started...This is where the doco stopped being about the bad affect this drug was having on society to just being 1h20m of a Xanax infomercial. It appeared to just be a ""paid for"" and ""sponsored by"" fluff piece by the companies that make these drugs.This doco is a waste of time if you are trying to get to the underbelly of what these drugs are doing to society and how it affect users over the long term and how doctors just write people whatever they want. It isn't that at all, if anything, this doco glorifies the use of these drugs.I was an hour in and though, what is going on here, there is only 10 or so mins left to talk about the bad aspect of this drug. It never came.The users interviewed in this doco were non-examples of what disastrous affects the over prescription of these types of drugs can have on people, their families and their community. They were literally the poster children of the Xanax wonder drug.In summing up, this wasn't a documentary, it was an hour and 20 minute long Xanax commercial.",False
19,4,"Support group, without the drama",phildeesnow,n/a,16/08/2025,"The message here is, Xanax is a drug...drugs are bad... don't take it...but you might need them...
Confusing message if the goal of a documentary is information.I wasn't expecting a ""scare straight"" kind of documentary, but at least some idea on how should I approach my psychiatrist during the next visit. This left me clueless.It doesn't explain how the drug works in your brain, if there's a genetic factor, or why nowadays they send your saliva for a DNA test before they give you any kind of psychiatric medication.I'm just like the guy with the beard. Same experience.It's informative, but not enough.",False

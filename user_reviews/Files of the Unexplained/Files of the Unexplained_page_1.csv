1,4,"Two episodes are decent, the rest is garbage.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Several bizarre, unexplained stories, unanswered mysteries, including UFO sightings and apparent sea ghosts.If ever a series disappointed me, it was this one, I was expecting something along the lines of Unsolved Mysteries, and for the most part, it feels like a series made my conspiracy theorists and cranks.With every episode I felt my brain cells dying, there are very few voices of reason, way too many cranks.I can deal with outrageous theories when they're delivered with a little bit of humour, or a tongue in cheek attitude, but we're made to thing that half of this nonsense is fact, it's excruciating.It's funny that not one of them comes from Australia or The UK, or France etc, why do all the bonkers things only happen in The States, all I'm asking is why?If I were reviewing two specific episodes, namely Missing Yuba County Five and Bizarre blobs of Washington, I would be giving a more moderate review, as both were really interesting, both held my attention.Just watch the two mentioned episodes, skip the rest.4/10.",False
2,4,Not in the same league as 'Unsolved Mysteries',JR_1_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was pleased to see the 'Yuba County Five' mystery on this series. This has baffled me for years, and I am glad that there will now be more awareness of it. I disliked the Narrator, I may be biased as I was comparing it to the captivating voice of the late Robert Stack (Narrator and host of the Original Unsolved Mysteries series). However I thought she spoke far too deliberately and slowly, and I simply just wasn't a fan. It is hard not to compare this series to Unsolved Mysteries, as both shows have the same premise, and a similar structure. Of the eight episodes, only three of them (3, 5, 8) are based on missing persons or unexplained deaths/mysteries. I barely count Episode 5 'Haunting of Lake Lanier' in this, as although it is based on apparently unexplained deaths, they claim the reason for this is unrested spirits/paranormal, which I think is hogwash. Personally, I think there should have been more episodes which focused on missing persons/unsolved mysteries, as they are simply more important. I dislike anything paranormal or UFO related, as the only 'evidence' is ALWAYS word-of-mouth or 'eyewitnesses'. Don't get me wrong, they are on occasion vaguely interesting stories (this is being generous), but personally I have a hard time believing it and I think this show could have utilized its episodes better. There are so many unexplained deaths/mysteries they could have taken their pick at.",True
3,6,"Some Good, Some Not so Good",lornak-18008,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since there are 8 episodes you would almost need 8 separate reviews. Some I was very interested in, others were pretty boring. I think the one that fell into really boring is the one they showcase before you start watching. So that was weird. The little globs that fell from the sky on 3? Occasions. I started with that one and almost quit, but continued and watched all 8 back to back. The rest were better. The UFO ones were the most interesting to me, but others might not like them. There's a haunted lake and plantation. The plantation one was interesting, but too long as there wasn't a lot of mystery there. A mystery about 5 young men that go missing together was good. I wouldn't go into this thinking they are all going to be good because everyone has different likes and dislikes. Some I would rate low and others high so I settled on 6 stars.",False
4,1,What an utter snoozefest,hisxlnc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix is trying extra hard to make documentaries that retain viewers interest but sadly making documentaries is an art and this series is found wanting on that front.Just watched the first episode . The topic was interesting and could have been presented in a much better and engaging way however the entire narration is monotonous and dull. As a viewer, one begins to lose interest quite fast. Ultimately this turns out to be one of those countless conspiracy theory documentaries that one wouldn't really take seriously.Netflix need to explore ways how to make these documentaries more interesting and gripping .",False
5,7,Thank You Netflix üôèüèª,laurakatie1987,n/a,16/08/2025,"Episode 1 is 100% as authentic and real as you can get, I've studied UFOlogy for years. We need to start listening to people and believing them. So to the skeptics and non believers, I genuinely feel sorry for you. I've woken up. Let's stop living in The Matrix. To Calvin, I believe you. I know too much already. I've researched about your story for years. You're so incredibly brave. The shadow government will probably sadly delete this comment one day. They don't want us to wake up and maybe there's good reason, I honestly don't know. If anyone ever calls anyone else 'crazy' or 'mentally unwell' after they talk about their experiences, you need to have a good at yourself, and you are most certainly not welcome in my life. Let's watch, listen and learn, and have a heart. This world is too divided it's truly heartbreaking. We need to come together as one and create a better world through unity and harmony.",False
6,1,Why they made this the biggest mystery,gurumaggie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boring stories told by a world weary or simply lacklustre narrator, I've watched some real rubbish on netflix but this takes the biscuit and tramples it into the ground.There are dozens of this type of show but they are well made and interesting this isn't I fell asleep during the first episode and struggled to keep.y eyes open during the second, I suppose it might be good for insomniacs it certainly helped me sleep.Decent shows get sidelined while rubbish like this exists, why?I pray they won't have a second season of this mindnumbingly boring hogwash, it's an insult to the men who passed away in the minibus R. I. P.",False
7,1,Worst narrating ever,ninaerchy,n/a,16/08/2025,"These series have a nice title and decent thumbnail and that's it.Looks like it was made in a hurry. Like creators had two good stories and added a few terrible ones just to fill the series quota as fast as possible.To me personally the worst part is that woman's voice narration in an annoying ,,housewifes series,, style. Like she's literally trying to bore viewers out of their minds. Just so unfitting.It doesn't deserve to be even close to Unsolved Mysteries to which everyone is comparing it to.I have to say I wouldn't recommend watching this.Oh and also the direction is very bad (lots of missing information, nonconsistency..).",False
8,1,The lowest form of 'documentary'.,fad-38798,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely terrible.Take a few opinions, find some material from Facebook / Instagram that supports the 'fact' you want to frame as sensational, add an interview from an emotional victim and we have 'Files of the Unexplained'.If this is the standard for Netflix documentaries I'm not sure I'll bother with any more.Evident with every episode that no effort has been taken to fact check the material presented by partisan 'experts'. Some old police records are taken as fact, some or not but no real explanation as to why, except for a talking head saying 'I think this...' or 'I think that...'. For a 'documentary' there is an alarming lack of scrutiny.This is probably the worst TV I have seen in 2024. Maybe this decade...",False
9,10,There's tons of Unsolved Mysteries true-crime clones - now there's a high strangeness equivalent.,falseflagattack,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who grew up during the late 80s and early 90s, shows like Unsolved Mysteries, In Search of, The Extraordinary etc. Were unavoidable.Personally, I always gravitated to the more 'out there' segments - the Lonnie Zamora incident, Kecksberg UFO crash, Gulf Breeze sightings and anything that drifted into territory considered bizarre. True-crime cases can be equal parts fascinating and horrifying, but nothing wormed its way into my brain quite like the fear of those few truly strange incidents that could not be fully explained - and I've stayed that way ever since.Throw in a few anomalous experiences through life, and you have an example of the perfect target audience for this new series. I've always said 'give me Unsolved Mysteries without the murder cases' and this is essentially that. I understand and respect that some folks have the entirely opposite opinion, where they want more crime and less 'woo', but to be fair Netflix has big budget crime content by the ton. This simply balances the scales a tiny bit.Nobody is asking you to believe without evidence, or to watch this and change your world-view. I feel like all that's being asked is that people give it a chance without negative preconceptions. Even if you don't believe those retelling their experiences, it seems clear to me that the vast majority of the witnesses are at least sincere in believing what they're saying to be truthful.Folks like Terry Lovelace (EP4) have told their story with deep conviction so many times now without a single contradiction or stumble on the detailed timeline of alleged events. Either it happened, or the former Assistant Attorney General of Vermont (yes, Terry was the Asst. AG) retired only to apparently throw away his credibility by confessing about his encounter with the unknown.This will be polarising, and that's fine. I consider myself a true skeptic, where I find these topics interesting and worthy of discussion, but won't assert extraordinary claims without the required evidence. Until that evidence comes, such stories and conversation make for great, thought-provoking entertainment.",False
10,1,Perfect if you like lectures and boredom,qzxrfzq,n/a,16/08/2025,"Instead addressing mysteries it's lectures on social justice especially the Myrtle's. It frequently turns into a word salad of all the buzz words of the social woes of the south.Beyond that it drags, ideas are repeated frequently. Each episode has enough content to occupy about 5 minutes that they stretch into 40 minutes.Lots of TikTok videos about the focus of the episode. Is that your source? Because we all know social media is the go to source for accurate and verified information.Also, the Lake Lanier episode does as great job of lumping all of us Natives into one homogenous group who only have one thought, one speak and one voice. Tired of the same old trope of Indian deaths produce ghost stories. Ridiculous. Insulting. Garbage.",False
11,1,It's always Southern folk!!,timlittman3506,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is presented as a serious 'documentary' but I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. Hillbillies get abducted by aliens. It's always hillbillies!!!!! There is zero evidence presented. It is utter fantasy. If you wear a tin foil hat and believe the world is run by shape shifting lizards and own every book David Icke has ever written, then this is a show for you. If you believe the earth is flat and the moon is a hologram, this show is for you. Personally, I'd rather be water-boarded than watch any more of this garbage. I cannot stress how ridiculous the cases presented are. You have been warned.",True
12,3,"Another meager attempt at the ""unexplained"" genre with regurgitation of past failed attempts like haunted and unsolved mysteries reboot. Netflix has to do better.",tresm87,n/a,16/08/2025,The unexplained subject is not hard to delve into in show form . Unsolved mysteries with Robert Stack and more recently the unexplained series with William Shatner prove that. Those shows are on a level of their own with intriguing hosts that hold the whole thing together and amazing lot detailed accounts and research. The interviews feel real and not staged by paid actors. This show feels like it's a bunch of paid average joes recounting their dull recounts of unexplained phenomena with even more uninteresting lack of research and attention holding content . This show is like watching paint dry.,False
13,1,Hokey Nonsense,TomatoesareRotten,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a sad day when Netflux commissions garbage such as this ?! Take the first episode Pascagoula Alien Abduction... it would have been easier on my mentality had it been entitled Hick From Missouri Drinks Moonshine And Is Abducted By Aliens ! ( Forgive the pun ) but what in the earthly is this ? Nothing is explained properly , for photographs of the victims they include painted representations of the faces ? Experts thad probably couldn't tie their shoelaces without assistance . I'm seriously reconsidering my subscription, if this is what the deem interesting and/or enlightening material . Total Mickey Mouse.",False
14,1,If you're a beginner or very slow this is for you,npapcun-48588,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLook, I get it, not everyone is really up on current UFO information.If you frequent the Weaponized podcast or have seen Unacknowledged or Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind, don't waste your time with this. Hell, if you regularly listen to Last Podcast on the Left this is probably too remedial for you. The show doesn't even use UAP instead of UFO, so it already comes across as a 90s or 00s era recording even though it's supposedly from 2024.I think you'd be better off with the above list or just searching Iraq Jellyfish UAP for something from the last decade or a much deeper dive into things.",True
15,10,Unsolved Mysteries of Earth,sulemansaeeed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Files Of The UnexplainedThis series shows some of the great mysteries in history, like UFOs, Myrtles Plantation where it's believed that those plants and trees and the house there, are haunted and some astray spirits are haunting that place.I believe that maybe there Are some intelligent life in this universe other than us. Maybe, just maybe. Because we can't see them because light takes a lot of time to travel to such farthest distances like hundreds and thousands of years minimum, so maybe there are some intelligent aliens out there and they want to see us to know how are we and what are we, how do we look, how do we do anything.Anyway, this series is about that, usually all series which are like a documentary are great, the information is concise and feels complete and comprehensive and the episodes are more or less not more than a half an hour long.This series is available on Netflix and has 8 episodes in total. Go watch it if you like mysteries and UFO kinda stuff.",False
16,5,Skeptic or Believer?,chipraker,n/a,16/08/2025,"I need some backstory on the person that is telling their story about their experience at that location or event. Did their Mother die Monday? Father died Tuesday? Brother died Wednesday? Sister died Thursday? Wife and children died Friday! Person went to mount Shasta or wherever, to ask for help from the spirits or unknown entities of the mountain or whatever it is? If they didn't get help within a certain time frame, they would kill themselves? Did They drink 1.75 liters of vodka that day? Did they smoke 2 joints? Do 5 lines of cocaine? Do heroin? Meth? Are they medicated on mental health meds or other? Taking their meds or not? Schizophrenic?I need to know the details of the person telling the story, in order to Believe the story. And that goes for all storyteller's of the paranormal and Unexplained. Once I can believe the authenticity of the storyteller's STATE IS MIND, then I WON'T BELIEVE THE STORY.

17,5,Oh the young guy hates that he's white,jaywelsh-45525,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a joke half of episode 2 is feels like I'm watching something on msnbc or CNN and then the journalistsl from England and the tic tok slavery specialists that have no idea or never do research that slaves in America were sold by their own people in Africa who were surprise surprise BLACK AFRICANS too ü§îü§îü§î but guessbthey want reparations too. I couldn't stop laughing how that ""white savior"" thats probably 20 years old and doesn't do research and hates that he's white and somehow he's gonna save them and help people be aware of the slavery that happen there and he's so butthurt.

1,10,Smart and delicious,robinlterrell-77363,n/a,15/08/2025,"The show is so well written and the host is smart, direct and curious. I was entertained while learning amazing things about the world.The theme that soul food is survival food has such truth and gives the show the entire world to explore.Having a host of color brings a different perspective in speaking with chefs from other parts of the world and the U. S. When the show is in Appalachia they intentionally seek out Black Appalachians who might have remained hidden otherwise.I love the way the show highlights diversity in food, like the different parts of the world that contributed to Neopolitan pizza.More please.",False

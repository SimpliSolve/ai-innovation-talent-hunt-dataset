1,8,Know the background before judging,QUeEnReDd,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are some bad reviews here, but I think from those that don't know the background. Also... Eugene Levy is Canadian, not an American. Eugene truly does hate to travel and why he was chosen for this show. He was recently on the Smartless podcast with Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes... which is where I heard about this show. He talks about why he almost turned this project down and how truly reluctant he was to do this. He is not any of the things the negative reviews say he is. In his 70's, he is facing his fears and getting uncomfortable and it's such a joy to see Eugene Levy as himself.",False
2,8,Levy Travels in Style and Observes...and Observes,EUyeshima,n/a,16/08/2025,"We know Eugene Levy is comic gold, even though this eight-episode 2023 series felt like a cross between a more jaundiced ""Somebody Feed Phil"" and Jack Whitehall's ""Travels with My Father"". His observations are less cynical than Whitehall Sr.'s and more dryly relatable except perhaps for his lifelong aversion to sushi. I think having a diametrically opposite travel companion like his son Daniel, or more ideally, Catherine O'Hara, could've made this series less one-note as we rely solely on Levy for his comments which remain consistent no matter the locale or how many exotic travel experiences he has.",False
3,8,Thousands of miles from Canada/Schitt's Creek,dfloro,n/a,16/08/2025,"By now, we should all have come to realize and acknowledge the comic genius of Eugene Levy. From that prototypical, Canadian sketch comedy show, SCTV, that also gave us the late, great John Candy and also the equally incomparable Catherine O'Hara, to the faux-documentaries he co-wrote with Christopher Guest (I refuse to call anything a ""mockumentary,"" even Spinal Tap dang it!), to his very own production company that he created so he and his equally hilarious son, Dan, could co-star (w/Catherine, of course) in the aptly named Schitt's Creek. So I am not sure who initially thought to take a home-body and confirmed curmudgeon like Eugene, who'd done surprisingly little travel (surprising to me, as somebody whose first million would be spent exclusively on it), and plop him into the widest range of cultural, geographical & gastronomical situations one could've imagined and then just trail his every move to see what happened. But it's a solid idea for comedy gold-so long as it's a lone, anxious, fish-out-of-water Eugene Levy. I think it helps if the viewer loves travel; hence, being astonished that our protagonist doesn't.",False
4,9,Joyous,heatherjillsmyth,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't think I've ever enjoyed a 'celebrity' travel programme as much as this one. Eugene Levy's droll wit and self-deprecating humour are what elevate The Reluctant Traveler. Despite Levy's trepidation, he tries activities many of us will never actually get to do, and he does them with a marvellously funny perspective. I laughed out loud many times, whilst learning interesting things about a different way of life. The people he meets are fascinating and full of warmth. In today's age of depressing politics, war, climate crises etc, this televisual delight is a breath of fresh air. Sign Mr Levy up for Season Two now! Just joyous.",False
5,10,Loving This,Snarkysteff,n/a,16/08/2025,"Back in 2015, I went nomad for a long time and travelled cheaply, nonstop for a few years.So, I love travel. But...Some angry-at-the-world chump below slammed this series as some huge entitlement thing. Whatever. You do you, man.But here's the thing: Not everyone likes travel. In fact, it's downright terrifying to some folks.Because if you've got anxiety, travelling is number one with a bullet for triggering that stuff.And Eugene Levy is a man who's made an entire career out of his anxiety. It's a huge part of his comedy and persona, and it's not a schtick. He doesn't like travelling. He likes to stay home or go to restaurants or play golf.He's a boring guy because boring works GREAT for anxiety.This series, however, is one that Apple aggressively pursued him to make. He did so as a realization that he was 75 and staring at ending life with a lot of regrets and questions about whether he could have lived more.As someone who now sees travel as a part of who I am, I loved seeing this guy starting ""getting"" what travel is about.And yes, it's world-class luxury, as a nod to Schitt's Creek, but every time Levy has a potentially lifechanging ""aha"" travel moment, it's doing stuff that's accessible to every income level - it's meeting the local people without agendas. It's experiencing the simple moments.If this series shows anyone that there is more to travel than getting off a plane to see the known sites and visit all the popular neighbourhoods, I will be delighted.As for Levy, he is self-deprecating, charming, droll, open, and even vulnerable as he narrates and hosts the entire show.I love the series and plan to finish the final three episodes RIGHT NOW.But if you want a lighthearted, fun, BEAUTIFULLY-shot travel series, despite the posh locales, you won't find any pretensions here. Just curiosity from a guy who's lived an entire life dictated by his fears of everything around him... and, for once, confronting those fears to see what it does for him.It's a show as much about growth and anxiety as it is about travel, with a lot of good humour along the way.",False
6,6,Entertaining to some degree,majidalturki,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spectacular cinematography and really magical locations, I'll give it that. It's like ""An Idiot Abroad"" but Eugene just isn't as funny as Karl. I get that they're trying to get him out of his comfort zone and I respect him for doing so at 75. He really seems to be experiencing things that he'd rather not, hence the reluctant in the title. I think that element, which is the highlight of the show, is sometimes its weakest one. It gets overly repetitive and annoying at some point that it takes away from the magic of the locations he's in. Hearing someone complain the entire time on a trip is my biggest caveat, so maybe that's why I couldn't fully enjoy this show and Eugene's commentary as it is.",False
7,10,"Beautifully photographed, Interesting and Surprisingly Wholesome :)",collageart,n/a,16/08/2025,"So glad we found this show. The photography is stunning, Eugene Levy is hilarious but at the same time humble and respectful as a tourist. The show seems to have no other agenda other than taking the viewer to beautiful and interesting places in the world. What a refreshing break from the political agenda that has ruined a lot of shows.Levy's acting and narration really do a great job of making us feel like we are there with him, out of his comfort zone, in the elements, eating foreign cuisine, and doing many things that scare him.If you want to watch something that elevates your spirit and curiosity instead of making you feel like you are the scourge of planet earth and the source of all its problems LOL, watch this! Highly recommended.",False
8,n/a,Hilariously Masterful!!!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Considering the plethora of highly rated, award winning movies and series available to watch, I NEVER thought I would prefer to watch a travel series on Apple TV! Eugene Levy shares his travel experience as only he can and that is what makes this show MAGICAL! His wry sense of humor and ALWAYS well delivered cynical communication style is nothing less than addictive! I have had many laughs with my family while watching this entertaining and educational show! I think this is a must watch and is perfect entertainment for anyone who thinks a travel show on Apple TV is the last thing they would ever want to watch. Hilarious! Culturally astute! Perfectly done!",False
9,7,A good show ruined by trendy editors,sjmills1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who doesn't like Eugene Levy? He's funny, witty, and has some great suits (if those are really his). Travelogues have been a film and TV staple since the days of James A. FitzPatrick's ""Travel Talks"" were shown in theaters (and now on TCM). Having Eugene show us around is as good a way as any to see the world. Better him than me.There are only two drawbacks that I've seen.1. The ""I don't want to do this"" attitude does start to wear on you after so many episodes.2. This is by far the worst part about the show: The speed ramp editing used often and with no good reason. We get it. It's probably a button on their software that zooms the speed of the video up, compressing time into a split second, then slows it back down, and always accompanied by the same ""whoosh"" sound effect. Stop it. Just stop it. Just @$&#ing stop it! I doubt if they can go a full minute without using this stupid, annoying, trendy, lazy effect. Seriously, never ever use this in any video.",False
10,9,"Eugene- humble, hilarious and huggable",shirinki,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching eugene's apprehensive way of moving thru the world but overcoming these feelings was so encouraging, he articulates what some of us may be thinking during our travels but too shy to express... his physical and facial comedy is hilarious and i barely laugh outloud but did several times during the watching of this show... he is also very respectful of local cultures and a pleasure to watch, i hope there's a season 2. I particularly liked to see the maldives episodes (knowing this is a country under threat and attention needs to be brought to it), i also liked his take on the wildlife of costa rica and his half-hearted sloth sighting (again can relate)... 'yeaaaah, i saw it' (said in a muted voice).",False
11,6,"Great locations, distracting premise.",hnmcxcq,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'll begin by saying that I have long admired Eugene Levy in so many of his roles, and find him an otherwise enjoyable host for this travelogue, were it not for the show's fundamental conceit, his nervous hesitancy about nearly every aspect of travel. It grows old, quickly. After a few episodes two things become brutally clear, Levy is essentially whining about being in some of the most privileged (and expensive) surroundings on earth, places the rest of us could never afford to even dream about visiting, while often allowing his litany of neurosis to prevent a full experience of the place itself. I realize Levy's multiple anxieties are the central trope of the show, but it begins to make him seem spoiled and loutish after a while. I think it's an unfortunate misuse of his natural self-deprication. The places visited by the show are glorious and unique and really deserve a thorough exploration by someone who appreciates what they have to offer, not someone who can barely tolerate a bit of sightseeing because he hates travel. It often feels like his anxieties are too scripted as well. The places are fascinating, but I feel like the show could be done better.",False
12,10,"Beautiful man, beautiful show",ellerwat,n/a,16/08/2025,"This travel show is not only hilarious, but beautiful and heart-felt, thanks to Eugene Levy' who is a rare gem in this dark world. The Utah show -- Mylo's inspirational chat with Eugene was particularly touching. There are not many shows out there these days that covers travelling in a way that really moves the soul. Would love to see endless series but I get Eugene might be getting old and just wants to settle down and relax in one place.All the places visited were unique and spectacular -- and I sit on the edge of my seat riveted by the ""storyline"". Thank you Eugene. Thank you producers. This show should win an Oscar! (Or something)",False
13,6,Pampered traveler,Valid_ID,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing new here: there are many traveling shows like ""The reluctant traveler"".The travel show with Karl Pilkington, called ""An idiot abroad"", is by far funnier. It has a tiny budget too, since Karl stayed at hostels, rather than the world's posh hotels like Eugene Levy did.For a couple of episodes I found Eugene's reluctant traveler character entertaining enough, but his monologue is REPETITIVE. He can appear to be reluctant only so much when he stays in the world's most expensive hotels ($10,000USD/night!), eats food prepared by top-notch chefs, and participate in luxurious activities where he's the only guest.The photography is absolutely stunning, and I could watch places where I know I'll never afford to go, such as the private, tiny island in the Maldives.As an avid traveler myself, I can tell you that almost every destination in the world is overcrowded nowadays.In order to avoid the mobs, rich people travel like Eugene Levy in this series: by helicopter, private plane, or luxury car, to isolated resorts, and private islands. That's not something most of us can afford to do, and it's ridiculous on the part of Eugene Levy to act as if it's a chore.",False
14,3,Grumpy Canadian doesn't enjoy anything he's being paid to do,dandiego-15496,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ugh, this had so much potential...but they picked the completely wrong guy for this. He seems put off all the time. He's not gracious or thankful or impressed....just painful to watch.We get the schtick....but it isn't something normal people want to see. He's flown to far-off exotic locales, introduced to interesting people and given the opportunity to experience things many will never be able to see...and he poo poos it all.If this series is to continue, perhaps the producers can find a better person for this. Until then, this mess is just tough to watch.Note: I like Eugene Levy-I think he's a talented, funny actor-and I love travel. This was just a poorly conceived concept.",False
15,10,Breathtaking and beautiful,richardyyc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Please continue as you have my wife and I hooked as we turned your show on tonight and watched every episode. Thank you Mr. Levy, It is a big world with lots to see and hope you show us many more places for when we retire and can experience a little of what you have shown us. We are from Calgary and the breathtaking Rocky Mountains and love the world and it's beauty. We love your sincerity and honesty while presenting this to us. Thank you Sir. We loved the show you and your children made in Ontario and have watched you for many years. Mr. Eugene Levy you make Canadians proud to be from Canada. Keep it up and show us the world.",False
16,9,The best and most addictive travel documentary ever,seffar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I recently watched the ""Reluctant Traveler"" documentary and was blown away by the incredible storytelling and stunning visuals of Eugene Levy. The documentary follows a Eugene Levy who initially has no interest in traveling, but through his journey, he discovers a new perspective on the world.The documentary is expertly crafted, with beautiful cinematography and a well-paced narrative that kept me engaged from start to finish. The interviews with locals and travelers alike provide a unique and insightful look into the different cultures and traditions of each location.One of the things I appreciated most about ""Reluctant Traveler"" was its ability to inspire a sense of wanderlust and adventure. The character's transformation and newfound love for travel were truly inspiring, and I found myself wanting to pack my bags and explore the world myself.Overall, ""Reluctant Traveler"" is a must-see documentary for anyone who loves to travel or is looking for inspiration to embark on their own journey. It's a beautiful and thought-provoking exploration of the transformative power of travel. Five stars, without a doubt.",False
17,7,Kind of Schtick-y with the faux curmudgeon act but a fun show.,strykoutk,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a huge fan of Eugene Levy. Even as a kid, he was my favorite SCTV actor and I coukdn't get enough of him in Splash as Dr. Kornbleauth. Schitt's Creek was one of my favorite shows and he is always kind of the glue that holds things together without being center stage as a main character. He steals the show as Jim's Dad in American Pie in only a few scenes. In this show, he is front and center as the main attraction.While he is affable and dryly funny, the producers of the show focus too much on constantly broadcasting this theme that he is reluctant to travel. I get its the theme of the show ... but they go overboard to script him leaving poor Eugene seeming to play a characterized version of himself. This character is somewhere between Larry David's crusty nebbish on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Bill Murray's hypochondriac in 'What About Bob?'. While Levy is a master of the Jack Benny style reaction, it feels schitcky and forced.Despite having to force belief that Levy is actually often worried about things like Venice being built on stilts and sinking, the show's cinematography is visually beautiful. It is very similar to the instagram-like photography of Stanley Tucci's show Finding Italy, although this show utilizes zoom in drone shots and ultra zooming techniques. Wherever they film, you want to be. We noticed that many of the episodes are filmed on grey sky or overcast days. This takes away from the 'perfect blue sky travel wish fulfilment' aspect of the show a bit.Speaking of comparisons ... where does Levy stack up against Stanley Tucci or even the gold standard of Anthony Bourdain? I've always found Tucci a bit smarmy and wooden. There's not much you can do with the reactions without getting annoying when eating a lot each episode. Tucci seems to do, 'Mmmmm. Come on! ...' or 'Ohhhh. That's fantastic' a dozen times each episode, which annoys us to no end. Levy does show reverence to his server but we respect him making dry jokes as a reaction vs. The obligatory contented grunt and eye roll. Case in point when he does his suspicious curmudgeon act over a piece of salt cod in Venice before taking a bite and telling his host, 'That's actually good. I expected it to taste like cat food.'Levy doesn't bite off as much in each setting as Bourdain or Tucci ... some of the things he does seem forced and overly dramatic. I'll leave the elephant thing alone ... but plunging into ice cold waters or retrieving floating breakfasts from an infinity pool. Eh. The producers make sure he seems skittish about being in the water while taking any sort of boat ... milk any kind of fear out of flying or swimming ... and even script the staff he speaks to. Such as when the director of a $7,000 per night luxury resort in the Maldives makes it a point to mention to the wide-eyed Levy the sharks that occasionally swim past their coral reef or the guest whose ear was bit off by a trigger fish.It's hard not to be jealous of someone being paid to stay in a $1,000 per night resort and be pampered. As Anthony Bourdain showed us, the grass isn't always greener and this IS work, afterall. I'm not going to be jealous of Levy and his crew. Rather, I do enjoy seeing some of the 'other half' living it up knowing that a few of their spots are carefully selected by local fixers and you better believe I am going to try them when I am in that location. Bottom line is its hard not to enjoy the scenery and cinematography of this show and as far as travel shows go, Levy is a natural host. I just had hoped for a little less scripting ... the show seems too forced. The opposite is true of Tucci. In season 1, he was so wooden and boring the producers hired joke writers to jazz it up. Levy doesn't need that as his personality shine through but a little less forced by the producers would be nice. We get it ... he's reluctant.",False
18,10,Inspirational and Entertaining,elangkau,n/a,16/08/2025,"I actually made an account just to review this show. This show is entertaining, educational, and shows the best parts of the human experience. Connection, trying new things, family, and culture/traditions. I love Eugene's honesty in his experience and his guts (or sisu) to get out of his comfort zone at his age. Not only is he hilarious, he is an inspiration. I'm in my 20s and I hope to be as adventurous as him at his age. He grabs agism by the throat and chucks it aside. You won't believe some of the things he does! He taught me that getting old is really only a frame of mind. Your body may age, but you don't have to get old.I hope to see more of this show and more like this on Apple TV.",False
19,6,Above Average,coles_notes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hosted by Eugene Levy, this travel program features said host reluctantly traveling to some of the most gorgeous spots on the planet and staying in equally beautiful 5 star hotels each place he goes. What often feels more as an excuse for Eugene to get some free vacations, if you're a big fan of his dry, apathetic humour, then yeah, you'll like this a good bit. The locations are cool, although each episode spends more time in the fancy resorts or resort amenities than I would have liked, and less time exploring the actual locations, but I understand this series is again grandiose in emphasizing its luxurious experiences, which were neat even if not that relatable. Only 8 short episodes, if you like travel shows and you like Eugene, yeah go for it, was decent.",False
20,10,The Reluctant Traveller Makes a Great Host,kq999,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew the series was going to be top-notch as soon as I saw Eugene Levy's name connected to the show. Such a classy guy with the offbeat sense of humour I love. No one could have done better.It seems a lot of thought went into the eight destinations that were chosen. Fresh new ideas and presentation coupled with interesting locations. None of the same old London, Paris etc that appear in other travel shows.This is not a complaint...the only thing I would have hoped for was a bit more info/background on some of the areas that were visited. But...you can only do so much in a half an hour and when editing was done one can see we were given the best they had.Excellent Host! Excellent Show! Well done Mr. Levy! Fingers crossed for another season.",False
21,7,Mostly great except,kathrynjans,n/a,16/08/2025,Fun and funny. Beautiful filming. The episode with people of the Navajo Nation was well done. This was not true for Lisbon. There was no mention that it was the center of slave trade. There was mention of the poaching of rhinos in South Africa. There was the focus on the negative experiences that people of the Navajo Nation and how they gave them to the slot canyons and how the next generation is keeping the rituals and customs alive. In Japan he mentions the history 400 years ago. He talks with a woman who mentioned the oldest temple in Tokyo and praying out of respect to the ancestors. He could have said historically Lisbon was the center for slave trade.,False
22,10,Doesn't Get Any Better Than This!!!,gmak-70756,n/a,16/08/2025,"Eugene Levy, we love you! We love your borderline sarcastic sense of humor, yet you are remarkably professional and compassionate. I love how you are always petting an animal.Now on to the show. This is HILARIOUS!!! This is the best comedy I have seen in years, and I had to stop and wipe my eyes numerous times from the tears streaming down my face in laughter. I guess I can relate to the travel issues - too hot, too cold, which may make the humor more relatable, not to mention I am a Canadian. Thank you for bringing humor back because we've all become a little too serious lately.PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE make another season or two or ten and what would be great if Daniel would pop in on a few of the episodes, although you have it licked all by yourself.I'm pacing myself because I know there aren't that many episodes left.Thank you Eugene Levy for making my day!!!",False
23,3,Very annoying,cbanmdr,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, a famous actor gets paid a fortune to see wonderful places, stay in the finest hotels and resorts, eat in the finest restaurants. He is picked up by limousine, flown first class, all of it organised by the production crew so he only has to go and experience the wonderful.Did I mention he's gets paid a fortune for the privilege? And all he does is complain and act reluctantly. Why?If it is just an act it is in poor taste. If this is indeed Eugene's character, and they thought it would be amusing to send somebody who was truly ""reluctant "", I am sorely disappointed. I would love to do it.",False
24,10,A gem,robatkinsong,n/a,16/08/2025,"Eugene goes to some totally amazing places and brings his bushy eyebrows in that Graucho Marx look and demeanour to this excellent show. Don a pair of Apple Max headphones and you get a truly spatial feel to the audio.He travels to various off the beaten track places, like the Utah desert and the Maldives to show how the very rich live,but whilst also exploring the human side of the rich and poorer folk alike. The funniest episode is when he travelled to Finland and gained insight into why the Finnish people are so happy with their lot. Taking cold dips in a dry suit! He's no risk taker, but then now in his seventies,he likes life in the safe lane.Well worth watching IMHO. I'm in my mid sixties and can attest to how well this show is put together. Excellent production, stunning shots of places most of us can only dream of visiting. And all brought to life through the lenses of his thick rimmed glasses and slanting eyebrows. Epic.",False
25,10,Eugene's travels light a fire under us!,wvgdqksk,n/a,16/08/2025,"We absolutely loved this series. We've traveled in Europe but have not seen the sights tucked away that Eugene finds. This show makes us want to return and visit all these sights. We never tire of seeing those raised eyebrows. They just make us laugh. We hope you show us more new places all around the world. The photographers capture the amazing beauty of each country with stunning aerial vistas. Tha backstreet views and relationships that Eugene develops are heart warming and insightful about the culture that he's visiting. We love his sense of adventure. As people of similar age, we admire his outlook and disagree that he's reluctant!",False

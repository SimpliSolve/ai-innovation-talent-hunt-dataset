1,6,Wasted potential,bfontoura,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unfortunately, huge potential wasted.With emotional and memorable moments, some outstanding footage on the consequences of the pandemic on the lives of ordinary people and doctors, the director doesn't succeed on the montage and to give the film a satisfying entirity. It's a shame, because the potential of making an eternal film with those recordings exactly in the city where everything started, during a lockdown, was wasted.Anyway, if you are looking for interesting footage of varied situations in Wuhan during the lockdown it's worth it. There's a nice part with an elder lady and her son talking a little bit about the politics of China as well.If you're looking for a good film, it's not the case.",False

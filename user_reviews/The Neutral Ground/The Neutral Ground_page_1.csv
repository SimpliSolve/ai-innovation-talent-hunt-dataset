1,10,Moment of history,annb-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"From Charleston the Charlottesville and beyond, a journey C. J. Hunt takes for himself, bringing us along as he confronts the honesty with which he needs to face the racism the US fights so hard not to face. Starting after the massacre in Charleston inspired a new (but not, I think, the first) effort in New Orleans to remove monuments to the Confederacy and its leaders, with many voices and sides seen and heard from, before Hunt begins to focus himself and our journey on new paths. Familiar history, historical lies, and the beginnings of telling more history, some as it happens. Humor, tragedy, anger, triumph; hope. Masterfully done, a journey I am glad to have taken.",False
2,10,This is the Daily Show Calling!!!,chiztina,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well.I'm black and I don't think I'm angry. Well....not about this.I actually can't believe that this history had been successful hidden in plain sight from me as an American in the American school system.That bothers me. I guess I'm not as smart as I thought I was.I Didn't realize the subliminal message of privilege silently attached its message to me That I strive for that privilege. I couldn't get it because its a fantasy.I like the funny,""sorry not sorry"", journey into neutral ground. It's very entertaining and surprisingly deep. Don't drown!!!But wade in as far you can.With your favorite nut.",False

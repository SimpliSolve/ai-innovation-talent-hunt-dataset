1,8,Irritating narrator,chiararutadiva,n/a,15/08/2025,"Did the casting director actually listen to this narrator's audition tape? (The first series with Derek Jacobi was superb - a voice with gravitas, befitting a serious topic.)",False
2,8,"Great Documentary, Horrible Narration",mackenziehayes94,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wonderful documentary with great footage and a must see, however the narration is almost unbearable. Even after a few hours of watching it you will still not get used to it. But the doc itself is awesome. K.",False
3,8,Vibrant Glimpses into History,pchs0114,n/a,15/08/2025,"This TV series is a vivid and engrossing exploration of WWII. Through the lens of detailed commentary and captivating historical footage, it covers the war's major turning points with depth and clarity. The application of colourisation techniques serves to elevate the series further, infusing the archival footage with an extra layer of engagement.Although it's not without its critics, who have highlighted some historical inaccuracies and a perceived US-centric bias, the series shines in its broad coverage of key global events. This aspect, in my view, constitutes its most significant strength, offering viewers a sweeping overview of this monumental period.Despite these noted imperfections, the series holds immense appeal for anyone interested in WWII. The successful blend of educational insight and compelling storytelling it offers makes it a rich and rewarding viewing experience, delivering both knowledge and entertainment in equal measure.",False
4,9,Excellent!,bigham69,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a near 10 in terms of docu-series. The videos, interviews, and stories are all top notch. My only gripe here would have to be the atrocious narration. The previous docu-series ""Greatest WW2 Events in Color"" had a MUCH better narration. That one deserved a 10/10. It's a shame they didn't go with the same because this could've been just as good.",False
5,9,Many precious footages,Jimmy_JimJim,n/a,15/08/2025,"This series contains many precious footages, and the best part is, they are all in color. It doesn't bore you with too much details regarding the background of the events and operations, so this is best enjoyed with some basic knowledge of the war. I find this highly educational and that it adds another dimension to my understanding of this critical event. The episodes are fast paced and the soundtrack is energetic.",False
6,10,Everyone Should Watch,LetsMeetAtQuarks,n/a,15/08/2025,"The color is great! There are no shortages of WW2 docs but this one everybody should see. The color and expert commentary make it entertaining and one of the best. But most of all the lessons to be learned are as important today as ever. Every generation since the war, fewer and fewer people remember these lessons. We must be diligent and learn from our mistakes or we'll be doomed to repeat this awful period of history.",False
7,9,Appreciated this series,shaunalee-577-765354,n/a,15/08/2025,"Found out I enjoy history. I know there are lots of peoples and events left out but it was helpful to me to give an idea of WW II and how events transpired. I visited the Iwo Jima Memorial in DC and the loss of life and horrendous numbers brought me to tears. Life lost in WW II are horrific 70 - 85 million, military deaths 21 - 25 million. More people should watch how to see how horrific war is.",False
8,9,Brilliant series,subbi1954,n/a,15/08/2025,"Series brilliantly wired. No human being is left without tears(Infact we sobbed at the terrible destruction in battles fought and conditions at buchenwald). The greed,hunger for power,superiority of colour and race shows its ugly claws even to this day in Ukraine causing great pain and sorrow for we Indians. It is to be understood that religions too played spoiltsport with countries in diff continents. Most of the western hemisphere suffers from lack of proper religious doctrine thus using great inventions in science becoming democles sword on common innocent people.beleving in rebirth may help;good deeds give good life next.",False
9,6,Needs better narration,andy_c_les,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whoever is narrating sounds like they are a radio DJ smiling as they speak, which doesn't really fit when they are describing Nazi atrocities. They need to get someone like Brian Cox to do it, that would be a great improvement.",False
10,8,Missing Info,joncarb,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed the overall coverage. However, being made by a country outside of America, I was very disappointed about missing Information about the ground units that did the dirty work to finally get to the Eagles Nest and found Hitler's body. Zero mention about the Infantry or Rangers beach landings or at pointe-Du-Hoc. No mention of the Airborne Infantry, not only the disaster of the drop, but the urban warfare. The enemy defeated in the mountains of Italy. Sure, Planes and tanks were extremely important for collator damage and psychological warfare. The Grunts on the ground living with what they had, see death in close up, and gaining ground one town at a time. They patrol where mechanized vehicles can't go.",True
11,6,Oustanding Series Terrible Voice for Narration,coltjessica,n/a,15/08/2025,Just finished the riveting WWII in Colour with a distinguished voice the whole time. The basic narrative voice we're all used to for many a year in these serious docs. I turn this one on rearing to go and I am immediately am so annoyed I had to turn it off for a moment. I'm sitting here listening to this feminine mans nasally SSSSSSSssssssss lisp and is raking my nerves. This is a voice for Top Model or some kind of dumb reality show. This voice is a man who seems to be the complete opposite voice I connect to this MANLY serious topic. Sounds like hes smiling and having a great narrating something he knows nothing about. Bad move. Terrible move. I took a 10 down to 6 for this. Ooppss this was a woman's voice I just looked her up. Well. I still hear it the same way.,False
12,2,Awful narrator,dantelives-22142,n/a,15/08/2025,Did you guys tell the narrator he was narrating the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade or a WWII documentary? Was really looking forward to watching but it's just unwatchable in its current state.,False
13,8,The Point of War,albertval-69560,n/a,15/08/2025,"This useful documentary provides the average guy with important bits of history that perhaps he's not aware of. Examples are the greatest dogfight, the greatest tank battle. It also shares with the viewer monumental miscalculations that lose decisive battles, the folly of man, and the grim, steely determination of nations to win a war no matter the cost in human life.There are vivid footages that drive home the futility and senselessness of conflict. A case in point is the pointless destruction of a 6th century cultural treasure in central Italy, the kamikaze pilots and the young ill-trained German defenders of bombed-out Berlin.The resource persons also explain, in hindsight, the questionable motives of invading Iwo Jima and Italy.In the end, the biggest war in human history is the gravest loss to humanity.This is an engaging film. It examines the great events from both sides of the conflict. Is it wistful thinking to say that we should learn not to repeat it?",False
14,10,The amount of good quality trivia here is amazing. More!,eldare-859-355670,n/a,15/08/2025,"I missed this kind if shows that tell us new angles of ww2. I discovered new and interesting stuff. Good research. And the coloring is amazing, you forget you're watching black and white film from 80 years ago.",False
15,8,It's good and the narration is better now,raupj,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is weird, I started this series on 12/28 and the narration was bad. Kind of a nasally British male voice that was very grating. I resumed it on 12/29 and now it's a British woman and it's much better. Not sure what happened, but perhaps they listened to reviews.Overall it's a very good documentary that dives deeper into some of the more ""less talked about"" battles.",False
16,8,Wrong flag,tkocik-41874,n/a,15/08/2025,"Enjoyable documentary. However, in the opening credits where you show the Marines raising the flag atop Mount Suribachi, it shows 50 stars not the 48. Tsk,tsk.",False
17,8,Good,wendypullen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Someone else has commented on the narration. He sounds like he is reading a child a bedtime story. Otherwise contributors generally effective. Michael Lynch particularly good, empathetic and articulate.",False
18,10,I've not even watched it fully but know it will be amazing.,rem_kid,n/a,15/08/2025,"So, why have they changed the narrator? The start of ""ww2 in colour"" is legendary. ""Now rarely seen archives from around the world, expertly restored and brought to life in full HD colour, tell the story of........"". Literally made the whole series with that opening line. Just the way it was smoothly slipped into the narrative.",False
19,6,Watchable,tav44,n/a,15/08/2025,Did you guys forget to record your final V/O? Sounds like one of your researchers from a temp edit.Overall not to bad otherwise. Not as good as the original but standard fare for another WWII documentary.,False
20,8,Another great WW2 doc,ndemars24-202-251807,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love that they went with Freeza as the narrator. Overall, very good docuseries, similar to the other ones on netflix. This one is in the format of real video driven by historians and narration; no reenactments. Focuses on specific events rather than the full scope of the war from start to finish.",False
21,7,Outstanding piece of History with a awful narration,duncanstarrenburg,n/a,15/08/2025,"Historians wanted it, they got it! Netflix's WWII in Color: Road to Victory is a docuseries which dives into the world of WWII. The episode of Dunkirk makes sure that every little detail of Operation Dynamo comes to the surface. It starts with some of the British governments problems when fighting the war. With Neville Chamberlain retiring as prime minister and Winston Churchill becoming the new prime minister, the British government has to deal with a prime minister who wants to have a new approach regarding the war. Churchill wants to fight until the end while the government wants to have peace negotiations. When the BEF is stuck in France there is only one option: fight at Dunkirk. At D-Day this so called Operation Dynamo gets its hold. Early in the morning the British troops arrive at Dunkirk and try to invade France, with succes! Road to Victory: Dunkirk is the first episode of the series and sets the tone. A great historical docu series with outstanding sorts of images and videos and nonetheless, experts who light up all the key moments. However, the narrator brings the level of the series down, his voice is the one you would hear on a unserious radio platform or podcast, with this kind of a subject there can be much better narrators. However, the visuality and storyline is amazing. After watching any episode of the serie you are keen to watch every other episode. If you are interested in history and most of all WWII, I highly recommend this serie. WWII in Color: Road to Victory has everything you need to know about all the major events of the Second World War.",False
22,1,The narrator makes this unwatchable,jeffmc113,n/a,15/08/2025,The narrator is so awful that I'm taking the time to write my first review on IMDb.I couldn't get past 5 minutes.What were they thinking. It's like a coy Stewie Griffen with a lisp describing one of the greatest and horrific wars in history.,False
23,8,This is actually very good work - IN FRENCH,felixthefelix,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of the most bizarre narrator choices I ever heard. Intensely irritating and horrifically inappropriate, like the man were voicing a discount supermarket advert - all plummy with a lisp, cheerily singing about thouthandth dying in the Atlantic or the thythtematic murder of the jewth. Mind-bendingly bad, and completely intolerable.But the writing is in fact very good, as you will discover if you set the audio language to French and put on subtitles. There are many dumbed-down documentaries in the genre, this isn't one of them. I can hardly imagine, we're this my work, how horrified I would be by the end result. So few will be able to sit through the narration to find out if it's any good. It badly needs to be re-recorded.",False
24,6,Narrator ruined it.,jimperce-26992,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow, I didn't realize how many other viewers were unhappy with the choice of narrator. After binge watching the 2019, 10 episode Greatest Events of WW2, I was very eager to jump into this 10 episode series. I was too has to turn off the first episode and come back to it as I was so put off with the sound of the narrators voice. Like mentioned already in other reviews, it does not do justice to the serious/ horrific subject matter of there series episodes. A very different viewing experience between the previously mentioned Greatest Events of WW2 and this series. Would definitely rate this a bit higher if a different choice of narrator was used.",False
25,7,Still interesting despite the narration,ycmkcnw,n/a,15/08/2025,"I almost had to stop watching because of the narrator. Sounds like something from Big Brother, Eurovision Song Contest or another light piece of content. Weird choice.",False

1,5,Somewhat entertaining.,karaq,n/a,16/08/2025,"Okay, so no way do I believe this is a real representation of selling multi million dollar homes. It's somewhat entertaining in that it's fun to see inside the homes. All the agents bicker and argue too much for this to be realistic. I'm not even sure they are actual agents, but possibly wannabe actors with a license to sell real estate and trust me there's a huge difference! Peggy is plain ANNOYING!!! Everyone else is nice enough I'm just not convinced they sell real estate which makes them bad actors or lousy agents, not sure which one ðŸ¤”. I would tune in if bored to see the houses but not invested enough to care about the made up drama! 5 ðŸŒŸ's for the house tours and Gino!",False
2,1,Far from Reality,johnson-17305,n/a,16/08/2025,This is an unfortunate and unrealistic portrayal of the real estate market and broker representation in the Hamptons. The agency involved is a sell out and should be embarrassed.,False
3,1,"""Repetitive & Simply Boring""",carmenjulianna,n/a,16/08/2025,"The worst property selling series Ever..! The agents are soooo unattractive...yuk...
Their introduction of inventory seem far fetched and insincere...!!!I mean, the one, (I've forgotten her name) which wore the black and white dress, was absolutely body..ugh ridiculously unattractive and she didn't seem to know what she was talking about. Her dress repeatedly kept blowing up and down, revealing her whole body..ugh...Couldn't sell fish in a fish market..:(:(:(
She didn't look good at all...
If they're the best the Hamptons have to offer, then we're all OK.. :)
The male agents look like street fighters, ('The Hulk' springs to mind) Oh my word, soooo unattractive too...:(:(:(.I watched the first part of the 1st episode, and I knew I had had enough...No More Series...
Sorry, but this is definitely a No No...Believe Me..!!!Hopefully, they're not going to use tv as a upscalling profile for earnings above and beyond...
Amateur at its Best..
Compare this to ""Selling New York"" no comparison what-so-ever..",False
4,1,Dirty finger prints on the Porsche,dvgkbnxw,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you know how to edit a show then you won't show dirty fingerprints on a Porsche. Awful show with fake smiles and ridiculous drama. You're selling a house not a dramatic show. Get with the program and sell the houses in style without the drama. Make it real and something that people actually want to watch and may learn something from this show. Make it raw, edgy, and sophisticated. You're putting $100,00 into a $35 million dollar home for an evening!? Hahaha spend a million on the home and then come talk to me. I don't have it but to spend $100,00 in an evening is really easy and for most who have it they are going to spend it without question.",False
5,1,Vapid vanity.,bootsplus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting and entertaining with one character dragging the show into the abyss. You can find out who yourself but she needs a stylist and is usually in clothes two (generous) sizes too small. A makeup artist since her face (lacquers on) fails to match her skin tone from her chin down. Her vanity showing is paid for on the back of a nefarious father is supposedly to be interesting? She is condescending, rude and a scene crasher. The first season was so much better without her and the oddly Janna-esque, dark glasses on cameo boss who is a characteristic ""I'm he that shall be obeyed"". My sympathy to the other cast members returning to be humiliated and degraded. Every sitcom / reality show seems to require the one person who's girth matches their outstretched ego and do I am not ""fat shaming"" I am plot and character shaming.",False
6,10,Surprisingly good for a reality show,greg-310,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch a lot of real estate related reality shows and most of them are so damn annoying with all the fake drama.This one feels more ""real"" and so far seems to be keeping the fake drama to a minimum.Kenny in particular feels the most genuine and most likeable. I especially like the interactions between Kenny and Gina.",False
7,10,I love it,glovermjg,n/a,16/08/2025,Not sure what this other person watched. I love the show and think it's great entertainment and fun to see the Hamptons that most people will never experience.,False
8,10,Fun show,richerat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fueled By buyers with unlimited money , I find the show very difficult to turn off. Especially the interaction between Peggy , Kenny And Gina. Kenny Is my personal favorite. He is so chill and I love his personality. ""Seriously Peggy"" I replayed that over and over. A lot of Gina , I didn't mind it, especially looking at her and her passive aggressive comments. Mia, nice outfits. Michael, it's too much of a crybaby. Bianca , has she actually sold anything? The other agents should leave Peggy alone, I do agree with Peggy that there's some jealousy there. And I think it's going to be on HGTV. I'm looking forward to the final episode.",False
9,10,Amazing Overall .. Sad it's Over,frobayo,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the amazing Mansions in the Hamptons, to the upbeat drama and beautiful people... this show was amazing and really binge worthy. Really wish the season was twice as long because it was one of my favorite shows to watch on Discovery +. This has been a top 5 for me as it was an easy watch, while also keeping you on your toes.",False

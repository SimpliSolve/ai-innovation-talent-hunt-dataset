1,10,A must for fans of The Exorcist!,valeriargh,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA great new documentary with some really interesting interviews. I particularly enjoyed the interviews with Ellen Burstyn and Eileen Dietz, the extra footage of Pazuzu was also very interesting. I also loved hearing from William O'Malley, always a pleasure! It was also great to see period interviews with Max Von Sydow, it never fails to impress me when I see just how young he was during filming. Excellent make up!We all know by now how Friedkin liked to mess with people on set and it never gets old hearing about it. Over all this was a really interesting documentary that is well worth a watch for any fan of The Exorcist.",True
2,10,"Well done, insightful and well rounded.",pigbird2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved the authentic dialogue from everyone involved with The Exorcist. Never knew about the injury Ellen Burstyn experienced on set! Also loved hearing about Dick Smiths influences, upbringing and taking a peak into his mind. I was also lucky enough to meet the director in person. In chatting with him, I see his passion and love for the film pouring into the work. Unlike some other documentaries this felt like a casual chat with all of those involved. There was nothing contrived or forced about their stories. They were asked some great questions because they seemed genuinely interested in discussing th topics and a lot of it was new to me as a fan. Great work!",False
3,9,A must for Exorcist fans!,simonbeaumont-64966,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cracking new documentary about the greatest horror film ever made. Some great exclusive interviews with many of the cast and crew, Ellen Burstyn, Eileen Dietz, Owen Roizman, William O'Malley. Unfortunately we don't get Friedkin input but we do get some classic stories about how crazy he was on set. Also we get to see some behind fantastic the scenes footage, lots I've never seen before.You can tell it has been made by a true fan of the film. It's only one hour long and I could have watched another 2 hours. Give this documentary a go if you are a fan of this Friedkin masterpiece, you will not be disappointed.",False
4,10,The Exorcist Reunion,Army_Of_Dorkness,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am a fan of the original the Fear Of God documentary with Mark Kermode from 1998.I'm always in search of any new (unreveiled) information that fans have not seen yet released from a/the vault as I call it.This served as a fresh retrospective and shared some new (to me) behind-the-scenes footage and stories that satisfied some curiosities.If anyone is reading this I wish they would come out with a book/movie of The Exorcist Log. Like the Jaws Log if any of you have read that.This documentary served as kind of a walk down memory lane as it were and left me wantinng more, like all The Exorcist documentaries make me do.P. S. I also loved the included Dick Smith tribute.",True

1,7,"Whaling in the 21st century: ""A lot of stuff fighting against us""",evening1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAn intimate visit with hunters at the top of the world.On a little-known Alaskan island closer to Russia than the American mainland, the Yupik hunt as their ancestors did eons ago, showing beyond-belief grit against the fiercest of elements and courage in speedboating after whale, walrus, and seal.One bowhead whale can fill the freezers of everyone in Gambrell town, but a local 16-year-old caught hell several years ago for harpooning one of the behemoths and getting it to shore.Teenager Chris was traumatized by tens of thousands of hate emails and texts, including death threats, for being a hero to his fellow First People. How ignorant of us to judge!The documentary introduces a bevy of interesting characters, including the high-school principal, a non-native teacher (I wish they'd told us how he got there!), and Chris's older sister, who wanted nothing more than to flee for better opportunities, which she found 600 miles away in the big city, Anchorage.We're treated here to visits to a native song and dance celebration, a high-school basketball game -- check out the polar-bear pelt on a wall -- and a supermarket where everything costs multiples of what we pay in the Lower 48.The treeless environment is experiencing drastic effects of climate change, because mammals of the deep tend to migrate with the ice, and, in recent years, far less of it floats off-shore.There is much to ponder here. Long live, and thrive, the people of the whale!",True

1,6,Nothing new,serbanpaun,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary neither solves a mistery, nor brings something new. Maybe only for those born after 1990. But what one can say is that it brings in the foreground the image of nostalgic people who are - according to what they believe on their own person - wiser and wiser, deep thinkers (almost philosophical) and always right. Such a tragic outing of some people still anchored in an ambiguous past, but which seems (to them) very clear, close and bright, trying to convince us that everything was better during those times. Even education was better - that in direct contrast even with their own wrongly used words, grammar errors and such others like these.",False
2,5,"Interesting, but also confusing and predictable",vacaton,n/a,16/08/2025,"The subject of the documentary is profoundly interesting, but it is presented in a way that is at the same time confusing and predictable.Confusing, because the conclusion the documentary tries to push doesn't align with the testimonies shared by the interviewees. The documentary ends by saying that those who feel nostalgic about (certain aspects of) Romanian communism do so because they have forgotten the negative parts. However, many interviewees discussed in detail the hardships of life under communism, so they are obviously capable of remembering.To be clear, I believe that communist regimes deserve criticism. My concern is that the creators of this documentary seem unable to apply the same level of scrutiny to capitalism. If someone has spent part of their life under a system of organization different from capitalism and is now unhappy with certain aspects of capitalism, it is only natural for them to explain their dissatisfaction by making comparisons with that other system. It's quite shortsighted to dismiss their criticism of capitalism as mere ""misplaced nostalgia"" because they use communism as a frame of reference.My characterization of this documentary as predictable stems from this point: it merely reproduces the dominant narrative about the communism/capitalism dichotomy that we all absorb simply by growing up in the Western world. We already know how bad communism was, no popular assumption is challenged, and we're not learning significant insights about the Romanian experience here. Furthermore, the film is unable or unwilling to allow any substantial criticism of capitalism (and the opportunities to do so come organically, given the nature of the discussion.) This is ironic when highlighting the abhorrent indoctrination, conformity, and uniformity of though imposed under communism.",False
3,8,Ceausescu n-a murit,lilianaoana,n/a,16/08/2025,"The title says it all really.It explains really well the mechanisms for it and how life was for Romanians under Communism. And why some of those same Romanians (and new ones paradoxically) would become nostalgic for something they view through rose-tinted glasses and selective memory.Funnily enough, it also anticipates in 2020 some of the social and political convulsions we have been experiencing for over a year now.I don't know what foreigners would make of this, how much they would understand, but for sure it would be educational and informative for them if they concentrate a little.Ada Milea rules!",False

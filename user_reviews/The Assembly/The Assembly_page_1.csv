1,8,"Fantastic, brilliant format to interview celebrities",cotta002-318-865119,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw the tv advert for this show and it looked very interesting, so I thought give it a go, I was not disappointed.The interview occurs in a high rise building in the centre of London, a celebrity is brought in to a group of people sitting in a circle.The young people are the interviewers, the difference is not only that lots of them take a turn in asking a question but that all are are autistic, downs syndrome Asperger's or spectrum people.This is where the magic is, the questions are brilliant, forthright and sometimes blunt.No average questions , no mundane usual stuff, these questions come from all angles and often take the celebrity off guard.The talent these young people have is so impressive, quoting poems or Shakespeare without prompting.The celebrities appear more open to the questions and become relaxed quickly, we see the real them.So warm, friendly and funny, it really raises the point that we often judge but shouldn't.I hope this format goes around the world it's truly amazing.",False
2,10,Loved it.,natalieemmaj,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed the assembly. The questions, while occasionally unpredictable, were entertaining, and some offered considerable depth. It was heartwarming to witness the vulnerability of the celebrities being interviewed, particularly Danny Dyer, who surprised me with his emotional depth. It was truly lovely. The ending of each show is fantastic, with the cast's performances radiating pure joy; it is incredibly upbeat. Julice possesses a beautiful voice, and there were some truly exceptional dancers, including a young Black gentleman, as well as a performance by, I believe, Jamal. I hope there will be a second series.",False

1,9,All-time core comedy,haqan38,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before I start, a little background info; The Hababam series were (are) repeated so many times on television that it has become known to everyone in Turkey. In fact, the comedy's from the 70's made a major impact in the following Turkish comedy history.Shortly the movie is about a class of slackers, all boys who don't study and are constantly trying to do all kinds of pranks or trying to escape out of the dormitory etc. In this Hababam the whole class actually fails the exams, and the school is threatened to be closed.Compared to western standards this movie can be seen as a normal family comedy, but the thing what makes it really good is the individual contribution/improvisation of the various actors (whom became one of the greatest of the Turkish comedy history). There is given some decent amount of freedom to the actors to give their own flavor to it. And I think the actors did an excellent job doing this, especially Kemal Sunal and Sener Sen, because of this there are a lot of small very funny scenes throughout the whole movie, which made the movie very enjoyable, rich and therefore re-watchable.This movie in particular has something special to it, not only because most people watched this movie over and over since their childhood, but also because of the jokes and it also gets a bit more serious in the end. I think this movie is rooted deep to a lot of people, and each time when you watch it this movie brings back nice memories.",False

3,10,A legend in Turkish movie history,mindblitz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hababam Sinifi is basically a movie based on the novel by Rifat Ilgaz, telling the story about a class of lazy high school pranksters. The movie just presents the most entertaining moments of high school years; which we have all been there once, and feel deep down a nostalgia for the days when life was fun and we were teenagers, going only after fun and entertainment. Cheating in Literature exams, smoking in the mens room, playing hookey from school for a football game; those were the best days of our lives. While the movie is brilliantly and incredibly funny; it contains some heart breaking emotional moments as well.I can easily say that this movie is by far the best movie ever made in Turkey, and it is a must-see for everyone who has been to high school and now a middle-ager. While it contains some local cultural jokes here and there, the story told is highly universal, as was ""Cidade de Deus"" or, say, ""Trainspotting"". And although it is 30 years old, it is a story that never gets old.All in all, THIS movie is the greatest movie of all times. And if you ever get a chance to see it, do not miss it. Or ask some Turkish friend about it, and you'll find out that everybody knows it, has seen it zillions of times, knows every scene by heart, and just plain loves it. 9,3 overall IMDb rating is no mistake.My rating: 10/10",False
4,n/a,Hababam failed..,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie of a literature class in a high school that has over aged students.The friendship and sharing between them,cheating methods at the exams and the funny lessons will not let them pass that class again and again.They do not study to examinations but work hard for the ways to escape from the dormitory.They can always cancel the exams for any reason but can not miss Fenerbahce soccer games.Although it is forbidden to smoke there must be found a way for 20 to 30 people, even it is in the ceiling or in the basement, no matter.There is only one fear for them, the Administrator Mahmut.Football is forbidden at the front garden,no jokes to instructors,no kidding with the girls if any..If you do act as a child,his punishment will be childish and shameful:raise your foot.The classic Turkish comedy for the every time entertainment makes it's job again.Still,it can be hard to understand some of its cultural parts and jokes.",False

6,6,Hababam Sinifi: Sinifta Kaldi - A Nostalgic Yet Familiar Classroom Comedy,chera_khalid,n/a,15/08/2025,"Hababam Sinifi: Sinifta Kaldi (2006) is the latest installment in the Hababam Sinifi series, a beloved Turkish comedy franchise that has been entertaining audiences for decades with its quirky humor and memorable characters. With a rating of 6/10, this film strikes a balance between nostalgia and repetition, offering fans of the series a familiar, albeit less impactful, experience.The Hababam Sinifi films are iconic in Turkish cinema, known for their amusing portrayal of high school life and the antics of a group of mischievous, rebellious students. The series' charm lies in its ability to blend humor with a sense of innocence, capturing the carefree spirit of youth while poking fun at the rigidity of the educational system. Hababam Sinifi: Sinifta Kaldi sticks to these traditions, following the familiar antics of the beloved group of students. However, this particular film lacks the spark of earlier installments, perhaps due to the passage of time and the over-reliance on familiar formulas.The plot centers around the misfit students as they navigate another school year, dealing with exams, teachers, and, of course, their endless pranks. The humor is very much in line with what fans have come to expect from the Hababam series: slapstick comedy, light-hearted mischief, and a bit of heartwarming camaraderie between the characters. However, while these elements continue to entertain, the film struggles to introduce anything new or particularly fresh, making it feel somewhat predictable.The performances are decent, with the cast returning to their iconic roles. However, many of the characters, particularly the older students, seem to be going through the motions. The younger actors, who join the ensemble, bring some new energy to the screen, but their efforts aren't enough to elevate the film to the level of its predecessors. While the acting is still warm and lighthearted, the character development is minimal, and some of the jokes feel recycled, lacking the originality that made the earlier films stand out.The cinematography is functional but uninspired. The visuals reflect the typical school setting and slapstick humor of the series, with little in terms of creative shots or stylistic choices. The film sticks to a formulaic approach, relying on quick cuts, broad comedic moments, and exaggerated expressions to convey humor. While this may please longtime fans, it doesn't necessarily push the boundaries of what the Hababam films could achieve visually.The soundtrack is familiar and reminiscent of the classic Hababam music, which adds to the nostalgic feel. While it doesn't bring anything new to the table, it evokes a sense of comfort and familiarity for audiences who have grown up with the series.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to tap into nostalgia. The humor, while not groundbreaking, is comforting in its familiarity, and there's a certain charm in watching the characters you've come to love over the years continue to get into trouble. The movie occasionally touches on themes of friendship, loyalty, and not taking life too seriously, resonating with the audience and providing moments of emotional warmth amid the chaos.In conclusion, Hababam Sinifi: Sinifta Kaldi is a fun but predictable continuation of the beloved franchise. It doesn't offer anything particularly new or groundbreaking, and while it provides some laughs and heartwarming moments, it ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to reignite the magic of the original films. For fans, it's a pleasant enough ride down memory lane, but for newcomers or those hoping for a fresh take, it might fall short.",False

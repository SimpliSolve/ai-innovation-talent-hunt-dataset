1,6,Important reminder,emariager-27119,n/a,15/08/2025,I watched this documentary during the CPH:DOX festival in Copenhagen. To me this was an important reminder of how we need to be the change so urgently required from all of us.,False
2,10,Mind opening documentary,nikhildesonnay,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary really illustrates perfectly what's going on in the world, injustice, climate change, brainwashing, poverty, war, immigration but also hope. It's the story of young activists that each try to change things in their communities for a better world. It's really inspiring actually, it makes us rethink about our life, our career, what we want to do in this world, do we want to be just a random person doing an average job or do we want to contribute to something bigger, something that really matters ? It also shows us the inactivity of our politicians, most of us are disconnected from what's going on. We see those forest fires and floods on TV with people losing their houses and it's becoming more and more frequent but most of us just see it as something happening far away from us and that it could not happen to us, but with time it will happen to more and more people with climate change. This documentary is really worth it, I definitely recommend it if someone has the opportunity to watch it.",False

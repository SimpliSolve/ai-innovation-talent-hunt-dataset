1,8,Very well done documentary for fans of TV and Movie exec Garry marshall,justin-fencsak,n/a,16/08/2025,"When Garry Marshall died four years ago, a legend of tv and movie work went to heaven. This documentary, composed mostly of interviews with him and his coworkers and family as well as clips from tv shows and movies, tells how he became a big rich guy with full potential.",False
2,7,This guy made some pretty classic comedies!,imseeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"Happy Days. Anyone growing in up the seventies knew that series. I was a kid back then and we watched it every week. It was sweet, hilarious and warmhearted. The director was a guy named Garry Marshall and he had a gift for simple minded, warmhearted feel good comedies that the masses LOVED.This documentary focusses in the first part on the many television super hits he has made in the seventies, another one being Mork&Mindy, which launched the carreer of Robin Williams, whose first role was an alien in Happy Days, but because of that smash hit episode, Robin Williams immediately got his own show, directed by Garry Marshall of course.The second part of this hommage to Garry Marshall is about his filmcarreer. He made the same style of simpleminded comedies as he did on television. And they were (partly) succesful, part failure.The biggest hit he made was Pretty Woman, which launched Julia Roberts carreer.We get to see an endless line of actors who ALL adore Garry Marshall for being a great director, a great spirit and a wonderful family man.Starring in a Garry Marshall picture was like being part of family full of love and fun. Just like his greatest succeses were...",False
3,6,network doc,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a network TV doc of the late legendary TV and movie creator. The stars of his shows and films sing his praises. There is a sprinkling of behind the scenes. Mostly, it is the most Garry Marshall documentary of Garry Marshall. It is nice. It's a little fun. It's nostalgic which is very good for pandemic watching. It's empty calories. There is nothing to be learned other than that he's a super nice guy. I think we knew that already.",False

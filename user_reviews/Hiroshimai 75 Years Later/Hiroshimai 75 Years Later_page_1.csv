1,10,"Sobering, full of footage & interviews",Vetteman07,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is entirely composed of actual footage, some of which is previously unreleased, and all audio but some very light voiceover is from interviews from the period with the people who were part of the Manhattan project and the visits to Japan afterwards. It covers everything from the development of the bombs up through the effects on the survivors in Japan. It is a stark reminder of what fear was felt at the time, and what happened with the response. More documentaries should contain so much actual footage/photos and audio, but hopefully more do not need to be made on subjects such as this.",True

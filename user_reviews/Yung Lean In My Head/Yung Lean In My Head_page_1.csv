1,7,Solid documentary,Addicted-Critic,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no idea who Yung Lean was before watching this, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The documentary is interesting and well done, and the cinematography is great. The music isn't bad; it's relatable but not the best. The movie also didn't deserve the outrageous NC-17 rating that it received. Language throughout and some drug abuse. The drug use is never graphic and mostly just smoking. The language isn't excessive. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is familiar with this artist and especially to those who consider themselves fans. 89 cents to rent on Amazon prime was well worth the price.",False
2,10,The best music doc I have seen in a while,timoryhanenart,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary showed that Young leans music is quite honest and deep inside their songs is a very touching inner force and expression.
Like every great band or musician has had in the past. Something serious that music often lacks on this internet age.
Seeing this, made me appreciate that openness and beauty that computer made music can have if it is made in a truthful way.I especially liked the part where Yung Sherman demanded to get some meth before it is too late. Young musicians should be free to live that rocknroll life before they get too old for it. The fact that he collects antique and also sells it proves that he has some right values in his life.Of course tragedy is part of life, and the way sad boys survived it made them seem like they are here to stay. Bands very often break up in similar conditions.Wish them Boys a better future, wider audience and hopefully a bigger career in America too.( x)>",True

4,10,Very emotional and inspirational,barcasqweb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this movie. From the beginning to the end, I really felt as a part of the movie. The movie really caught me hard in the middle, had to hold tears back. The end was very refreshing. I love the fact, that you get behind Sad Boys and Drain Gang, as you get to hear conversations between the boys. MUST WATCH.",False
5,1,Puh-lease. Enough already.,jake_fantom,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are mysteries in life. How this pudgy, vacant-eyed, misogynist, virtually talentless Swede became a rap icon is one of them. While I can't in good conscience recommend this film to anyone of even room temperature IQ, I am happy to tell you that the feeling when it ends is similar to that moment when you stop hitting yourself over the head with a steel mallet. So there's that. The film also has a great deal of filler footage to help you while away the time -- trees seen from the window of a moving car, out-of-focus hand-held shots (make that interminable out-of-focus hand-held shots) of things like scraggly glassy-eyed musicians trying to stand upright, stupefied, wobbly fans enjoying music that sounds more appropriate for extracting CIA terrorist confessions, psychedelic images that make the lava lamps of days gone by seem fascinating. I could go on but what's the point really? Eventually, indiscriminate use of drugs catches up with the enterprise -- whoa, imagine that! Then the tone of the documentary changes from naked worship of a genre-busting genius... to a caring, compassionate portrait of a troubled soul with... bipolar disorder! So you've really got the trifecta of terrible documentaries here, folks - a boring subject, crappy music, and editing designed to stretch a 5-minute cautionary tale into 90 minutes of total misery.",True

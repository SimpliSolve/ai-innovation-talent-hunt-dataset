1,10,So Spiritual and Uplifting,trenybiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"The second that I started watching it put me in a true captivation. The bonds of friendship and trust that were created defines what humanity needs to be. The innocence of the people versus the guilt of the highest point on Mother Earth made me feel like a micro-spec of a person yet it made me feel so powerful knowing that dreams, goals and Quests can be achieved. I have done many things in this weird little bubble that we call life. But to be on my couch and actually feel like I was on that journey made me a better man.Cheers to the Crew of this brilliant film. It is the perfect template to make one's soul smile. It is the perfect yarn.",False
2,10,Not your average climbing documentary,warnercaleb,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI was looking for something to watch and stumbled upon this gem on amazon prime. It was a lot different than most climbing films I had seen. It focused a lot more on the culture of the people of Nepal rather than the climb itself. It goes into detail about what led the mountaineer to Everest and his backstory which I very much enjoyed. Obviously towards the end you actually get the amazing climbing footage from the climb but it is a very limited part of the film. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys climbing documentaries. I'm glad I happened to have found it and have recommended it to many friends who have also enjoyed it.,True

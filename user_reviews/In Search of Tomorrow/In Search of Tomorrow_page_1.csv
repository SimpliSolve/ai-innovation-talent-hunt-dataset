2,9,Must watch for any sci-fi fan -and/or movie buff,colmjr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellently structured, brilliantly paced and very very thorough at over 5 hours long, and what a fantastic documentary it is.To go through each year and go from movie to movie per year just fills the whole documentary with so much content, and it's amazing to see and hear from so many talented people that not only worked on these films, but many people who were inspired by these films.It's a deep dive into all aspects of what made 80's sci-fi so amazing, so captivating, so memorable and how a lot of the ideas of the technologies have even come into existence in every day life today.I grew up with so many of these movies that I still watch today and this documentary gives a great insight into the making of these films, the ideas that came together to get these films made and how they inspired many aspects of not only the making of future films but how the technologies have been developed from these ideas.The documentary doesn't just go through each year with some of the most important films per year, it also goes over the scores, the heroes/villains/anti-heros, the development of the special effects, the science behind the movies, and so much more.My review can't do this documentary any justice so I can only say, if you haven't watched it yet, watch it. It's a must see for Sci-fi fans and movie buffs alike.Highly recommended.",False
3,9,Experience sci-fi again,brant-02042,n/a,16/08/2025,"Associate backer here. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire documentary. Structure wise, it's edited well, music is great, interviews and stories are fun.Content was great for me as well, even though I pretty much already knew every single thing they showed or mentioned and could probably recite nearly every scene that they featured.My only gripe was it being a bit too heavy on the global warming preaching. It doesn't fit for the genre of that time in the first place, as the social commentary of sci-fi in the 70's and 80's was about nuclear war, population issues, etc. And even if it had been on point, we just don't need preaching in a nostalgia documentary. Mentioning it once or twice, sure, but it was far too recurring in the whole show and detracted from the overall enjoyment, even brought you out of the immersion a bit. Seriously, we get enough of ""climate change"" and ""evil corporations"" stuff in every single second of life today in all forms of media, we don't need it in this as well.Other than that gripe, which is a small one, this is the movie to watch for some real sci-fi nostalgia.While it's not possible to re-watch your favorite sci-fi movies from your childhood for the first time, this is as close as you can get to doing that.",False
4,10,Biased And Enjoyably So,forsakenstars,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is it perfect? No, but it comes pretty damned close. At five hours you could easily binge this if it was on your favorite streaming service. Own this, there is still time at the writing of this review, and you can take your time, savor it and watch an hour a day for a week. Fair warning though, if you do break up your watching, you will definitely find yourself wanting them to spend more time on your favorite movies! There are only a handful of movies touched on that I hadn't heard of or have avoided for one reason or another, and now I have some motivation to hunt those down. I also really enjoy how they connect many of the films to the events of their day, and how and why some of the films resonate more so today, how prescient so many of them were. In many ways those were simpler times, in others more difficult or close-minded, but fortunately for us, there were some hopeful storytellers, and much of what they created inspired so many of the people making our lives better today and for years to come.",False
5,10,Metric Ton of 80s Nostalgic,webbox-893-551949,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hello friend,if you are reading this, you are stumbeling back in time. Searching for an on point analysis of classic, mainstream and niche, 80s scifi movies, you will find it right here. Bits and pieces of beloved memories from your cinema and TV past, as well as new details you may never have heard before. Interviews with legends (Hi, Clancy Brown!), well edited snippets of so many movies and covers, as well as the pure essence of the most enjoyable soundtracks.Am I biased toward this movie? Sure I am... since I watched the first Star Wars as a kid.Only downside... its taking nearly 5 hours of your lifetime! And thank god for every minute of it!",False
6,6,"Nostalgic and sorta interesting, but could've used more insightful interviewees",palle-47036,n/a,16/08/2025,"Less than 5 minutes in and a young hipster-looking guy says ""a lot of these films are warning about global warming,.."" as if climate change was a thing in the 70's and before. It wasn't. 'Limits To Growth', one of the classic books of the environmental movement in the 70's, has not one mention of global warming or climate change or anything resembling it. Back then it was all about overpopulation, pollution of the seas and running out of resources. Global warming or climate change hadn't been invented and popularized yet. I'm not sure the thoughts of the said interviewees warrant the running time, but maybe nostalgia is enough to entertain you.",False
7,10,Told by the People that brought us the 80's Sci-fi features!,larry-geraghty,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is more of a Thank-you letter than strictly a review. I was always intrigued by the concept of this feature, but to finally see this masterpiece, I was amazed by the magic they so brilliantly brought back for me and my sons.The irony is not just hearing from those individuals who discuss their role in film history but them actually discuss the films that changed them as well. It is 5 hours but like the best features, it goes by so fast and believe me you'll want a lot more! There are many highlights, I was touched hearing Ivan Reitman speak so kindly of his role, productions and his love for his favourite composer.I'm sure everyone will have their faves, but it a wide range of reviewed titles from iconic to cult.I look forward to watching it again and again to see which detail I may have missed.It's a fantastic investment, and it bonus gift is reawakening the passion for this decade of these films will do to the viewer. (My sons and I have at least two watchlists).The quality of the behind the scenes, trailers and film stock is second to none, absolutely amazing care and craft went into this production.",False
8,7,Nostalgic feel good documentary. But 10/10 is too much.,jishubd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching the documentary brought back a whole lot of memories. It was a good trip down memory lane. Nostalgic & yes, was feeling amazing. Have to watch few movies which I have not seen before.",False
9,9,5 delightful hours of excellent interviews and great supporting footage,bpstein-80555,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't imagine a better documentary about 80s science fiction movies than In Search of Tomorrow. Superb interviews, top-notch production and use of film footage. The producers were able to get interviews with lots of key people involved in making these films as well as top-notch commentators. They were not the top figures, such as George Lucas or James Cameron, but still included many big stars such as Billy Dee Williams and many lesser known figures who nonetheless had A-level insights. I was very happy to see interviews with people such as Nicholas Meyer, Peter Hyams, Joe Dante, Kerry O'Quinn, Peter Weller and Alex North. I gained a lot of appreciation for them and all of the films that were featured. I learned a lot and enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who loves 80s science fiction. I was a backer of the film on Indiegogo and am extremely happy with the results.",False
10,9,A Beautiful Tribute To The Golden Era Of Sci-Fi,cartrektccom,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary comes in at a very weighty 5 hours long. However, every second is filled with amazing and poignant insights from more than 70 sci-fi legends. Not an ounce of it seems bloated or filled with fluff. Indeed, at the end of the 5 hours, I found myself wanting more. Perhaps a part II will be on the cards at some point? (like the Creator VC team did with their similarly styled ""In Search of Darkness"" series)David Weiner both wrote and directed this epic tribute to 80's science fiction. It is very evident that he loves this era deeply and this came through very clearly in how he managed to pull his audience in. The overarching theme presented by Weiner was that the 1980's really represented the golden era of science fiction. I cannot disagree with that assessment.""In Search of Tomorrow"" starts by laying the groundwork of some classic sci-fi themes and painting the backdrop for the main decade. Year by year, important sci-fi movies were covered. With in depth interviews of directors, script writers, actors, composers, special effects artists and more the tale is told. We learn about the social background and context of each of the movies as well as why they succeeded (or in some cases fell flat). Obviously, well known classics such as ""Back to The Future"", ""E. T."", ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Aliens"" were covered in detail. However, I particularly liked that lesser known movies (but equally important from a historical standpoint) were also addressed such as ""Saturn 3"", ""Megaforce"", ""Buckaroo Bonzai"" and ""Earth Girls Are Easy"". Another thing I enjoyed about the documentary was how the interviewees were not just discussing movies they were involved with but also encouraged to offer up their opinions and love of other classics in the sci-fi genre. Thus, we get to see a rich tapestry of how these legends all influenced and drew upon each other's work and performances.Other than the year by year focus on some of the iconic sci-fi movies of the decade, there were periodic in depth focuses on important themes across the entire genre. For instance, how the special effects industry evolved from practical effects to CGI, women roles models, the effect of the Challenger disaster, advertising and product placement, music / soundtracks and more.""In Search of Tomorrow"" was not perfect of course. However, it was as close to perfect as I think reasonable to expect from ANY documentary. Certainly, there is nothing else like this that I have seen out there in the wild and I watch a LOT of science fiction. Indeed, I would say the content that Creator VC put together is leagues better than most of the special features and supplemental content that is typically found on DVDs. My only real gripes were minor at best. First, I would have enjoyed slightly more focus on the lesser known classics rather than the mainstream entries. Secondly, as the interviewees were captioned on screen, their role was listed. For instance ""Director"", ""Special Effects Artist"", ""Futurist"", ""Film Critic"" etc. All the actors were similarly listed as ""Actor"". However, I feel it would have better served the audience if, instead of the generic word ""Actor"", the character was listed that they played. For example, ""Newt"" for Carrie Henn in Aliens or ""Clarence Boddicker"" for Kurtwood Smith in Robocop. Certainly, I think the audience would have been smart enough, given the context, to conclude that this interviewee was an actor. I think it would have helped to fill in a lot of background context, particularly for adults who were child actors at the time or those who were wearing prosthetics. Regardless, this is a minor gripe and did not detract from my immense enjoyment of this riveting documentary.In summary, I think, without hyperbole, that this was the absolute best science fiction documentary I have ever experienced. From start to finish it never lost me and that is a phenomenal feat to achieve for something that is 5 hours long. The time passed quickly with so much information and nostalgia for those who grew up with this deeply rich period of science fiction. The editing and visual effects were phenomenal and the atmospheric synthesizer sound track was spot on.Whether you lived through the 80s and want an amazing trip down memory lane, or are new to sci-fi and want a great primer and springing off point, ""In Search of Tomorrow"" is a phenomenal slice of history not to be missed.""May the Force Be With You"", ""Live Long and Prosper"" and above all ""Party on Dudes!""",False
11,4,So you needed to pad it out with Will Wheaton?,jhmplopps,n/a,16/08/2025,"The director must be a fan or friend of will wheaton because they used him WAY too much. It actually too away time from people who worked on the film just to hear another diatribe . They did the same with Alex Winter who is completely detached from the film being discussed and the audience.That's on the director and editor.At 5 hours, this movie is a slog. The actual discussion of the films takes a back seat to nonsense comments from non-affiliated d-list celebrities. Then, you get a breath of fresh air from people like Dee Wallace or Adrianne Barbeau when they talk about the set.A 10/10 is not realistic. It's overlong and it deviates too much to be above a 4. I saw these issues with in search of Darkness 2 and that's just sad. I'm done crowdfunding these projects.",False
12,10,We indeed find that Tomorrow in 80's scifi,cydonia-04544,n/a,16/08/2025,"What can you say after 5 hour of watching journey through whole 80's scifi. I can say that I Love it whole 5 hours, you could be child/teen again and enjoy how awesome whole 80's scifi was. What CreatorVC have always been great of is that even all these documentaries have always been mega long ones, but they entertain every minute. Go watch this and other documentaries about horror and action movies, you might find bunch of new movies and some childhood favourites. Just enjoy the ride.",False
13,10,A love story to Sci-Fi that all can appreciate,danrich-52541,n/a,16/08/2025,I have loved Sci-Fi all my life and this documentary nails the experience of the 80's Sci-Fi experience on the head. So much nostalgia and fond memories from most of the films showed and the commentary/interviews were top notch from some Sci-Fi legends. If you ever watched and enjoyed a Sci-Fi movie are a massive fan or have never really seen any but have thought about watching some this documentary is for you!!!!,False
14,10,Wow!,dan36124,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many amazing films I grew up. So many incredible stories! Love it! It's very long but hey there are far too many awesome 80's movies to cover. Incredible job by everybody involved. I can't even imagine how much work this took! Thank you to all the actors, producers, directors, FX people, etc who participated!",False
15,9,A prescient age returns in epic retrospective,robmdyson,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, as a proud backer of previous CreatorVC productions, including 'In Search of Darkness' (its 80s horror doc series), I had no doubts this film would be another absolute labour of love - and there was no disappointment here. David A. Weiner, and Robin Block and team are dedicated to the fans of these beloved movies; and this is a vital distinction from lesser 80s movies docs (like the awful Netflix ones). There is no sneering narration, or fun-poking presenter; CreatorCV *know* how much these movies mean to us. The viewer is immediately enveloped in the love and lore; amongst friends, back in our bedrooms and living rooms with a stack of VHS movies, some snacks, and a Genesis or NES console to hand.All of the talking heads are so generous with their time, their anecdotes, and their passion - from production, FX and VX, to directors, actors and critics, themselves growing up on these movies.Also - crucially - there is another fantastic score from musicians and producers working in the synthwave genre (I immediately spotted a Droid Bishop track as the credits rolled). This is meaningful too, as these again are ""kids"" who grew up steeped in the culture of the 80s, their tracks lend an authenticitic nostalgia to the film.Finally, it was insightful to get the geopolitical context in which pretty much all these movies were made; the Cold War (from missiles in Weird Science, to apocalyptic scenarios in Mad Max, to nuclear annihilation in Miracle Mile, and a sidestep into plutonium-fuelled terrorism in Back to The Future). I mean... here we are again, folks....The *only* thing which makes it a 9 not a 10 for me (and I am asking the implausible here) is if they could have scored a Spielberg, or a Hamill, or a Schwarzenegger... but then in retrospect that may have detracted from the rich cast we have on display.Because of a bout of Covid, I actually watched all five hours twice in 48 hours - and I could watch it all again right now! Huge applause and plaudits to CreatorVC once again. Thank you so much for making it.",False
16,10,A Love Letter to 80s Sci-Fi Cinema,spacheco,n/a,16/08/2025,"Over the past decade or so, a nostalgia-hungry public has been gifted with a number of retrospective documentaries about 80s genre cinema. While many of these have been quite enjoyable and entertaining in their own right, none of them have had the depth or comprehensiveness that the documentary series from CreatorVC have. Following up on the success of their immensely enjoyable 80s horror retrospective series ""In Search of Darkness,"" the crew, led by director David Weiner, have delivered the DEFINITIVE documentary on 80s sci-fi cinema. Utilizing the same winning format used in the ""Darkness"" series, ""In Search of Tomorrow"" highlights some of the most well-known sci-fi films of the decade, such as The Terminator, Aliens, E. T., Back to the Future, and The Empire Strikes Back, while also showcasing some hidden gems that may be unknown to even the most ardent fans of the genre. Another killer synth soundtrack perfectly compliments interviews with some of the biggest contributors to the genre as they discuss both the various films and multiple thought-provoking topics within the genre. The crew at CreatorVC are clearly fans of 80s sci-fi cinema and it shows with their selection of films and their commitment to thoroughly covering the decade over the course of 5 breezy hours. Nothing short of a masterpiece of nostalgia, every single fan of 80s sci-fi owes it to themselves to watch this love letter to the films many of us grew up with or are just discovering for the first time. ""In Search of Tomorrow"" achieves what so many others only aspire to.",False

18,10,5 Hours Of Pure 80's Sci-Fi Imagination!,domino1003,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn Search Of Tomorrow is 5 hours of 80's Sci-Fi. Covering the epic decade, we see how Science Fiction films not only affected the viewer with stunning visuals and effects that capture the 80's vibe, but shows how future generations used their love of the films to inspire films of today.Loaded with commentary from Wil Wheaton, Peter Weller, Barry Bostwick (Who talks about being stoned while doing Megaforce) and so many others. Some of the interviews are bittersweet such as Ivan Reitman talking about Ghostbusters, knowing that he just recently passed away this year.For the die-hard Sci-Fi fan, or the newbie who wants to dip their foot into the water.",True

25,10,An amazingly comprehensive documentary of 80s Sci Fi movies,cm-34399,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a backer I knew this would a tremendous outpouring of analysis of 80s Sci Fi movies. It is another tribute to how much passion Robin Block, David Weiner and the entire CreatorVc teams has foe 80s Sci Fi movies. Because of the two In Search of Darkness documentary films, I knew to expect a well crafted documentary. It went well over those expectations. With an over 4 hour running time, it is very comprehensive in its presentation of the films. The documentary structure of the film makes it easy to take in and absorb. It is in very watchable chunks set up year by year and divided with side information. The extras which are interviews with CreatorVc really bring to life how much CreatorVc truly cares about 80s Sci fi.",False

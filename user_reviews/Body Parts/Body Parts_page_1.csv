1,7,"Interesting Look On Female Nudity, Representation & Vulnerability & What Role The Film Industry Has Played In Our Perception Of Female Sexuality",Foutainoflife,n/a,15/08/2025,"Currently, men are giving this an average rating of 5.8 while women are averaging an 8.3. I guess it's not unfair to say that women are more likely to find this interesting than men. To be honest, the 5.8 average rating from men is likely due to the fact that they get to see a lot of eye candy BUT it finds solid footing in the threatening topic of equalizing the power of sexual desire from a woman's stand point.The history of how women have been used to fulfill the ideals of male sexual fantasy and expectation as opposed to the realities of intimacy and sex are no big secret but this documentary was enlightening none-the-less. It also stresses the uncomfortable nature, contractual liabilities and how intimacy coordinators come into play when shooting sex scenes.It discusses the pursuit of physical perfection through the use of body doubles, image manipulation, props and makeup and how some industry professionals have reservations with these techniques due to the impact it has on realistic expectations. It also addresses representation among the physical desirability among people with disabilities, different sexual orientations and races.I found it quite interesting and learned a few things. It was worth the watch for me.",False
2,8,A terrific look behind the scenes of sex in the movies - 8.5/10,j-pudwill,n/a,15/08/2025,"A real education for mature film buffs. Who knew so much went into creating sex scenes in movies?Who knew there were sex scene choreographers and rehearsals?Who knew body doubles were used so very extensively (one actress sounds like she's been the body double for about a dozen A-listers)?Who knew how much legal, contractual protection is now provided to insure women are no longer abused (and good god, it's a lot of protection!)?Who knew actresses can now contract for what they will do and won't do - and precisely how much they will and won't show?Who knew how some sex acts can be so plausibly faked?Who knew actresses will have agents on-set to insure their rights are protected?Who knew about all the different cosmetic appliances used in sex scenes?You'll never look at a sex scene the same way again.",False

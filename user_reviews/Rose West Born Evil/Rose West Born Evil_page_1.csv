1,7,I doubt she was born evil,josephloveys,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting look into the life and actions of Rose West. Horrific upbringing, sick father. Are any of these killers raised in a loving home? Probably not. When she met Fred West the horrors began. Two sick people working together, can be so much worse than what either might do solo. I thought this doc was all right and interesting enough.",False
2,7,Appropriately Clinical,thalassafischer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do not like documentaries that glorify or romanticize serial killers, and there was none of that here. In fact, Rose West: Born Evil? Is carefully discussed almost to the point of being clinical. When I first learned about the Wests and their unbelievable shocking decades of rape, torture and murder as a married couple, it made me feel sick. The case is one of the most grotesque I have ever heard simply because the actions committed by this couple together were so depraved and so utterly amoral that it truly beggars all belief. Especially that they shared this essentially as part of their sex life. AND they had like...5 or 6 kids together??!! Huge family, the sort of people who you'd think wouldn't want to be bothered by a large family, the sort of people who you might think wouldn't bother with children at all had this big huge family. 8 kids in total counting Fred's children from his first marriage.Rose West: Born Evil? Does not address the severity and enormity of the West's crimes. In one way I appreciate that they did not attempt to exploit the case as salacious gossip, but on the other hand they could have emphasized just a bit more on how maniacally evil these two individuals were and how ...bizarrely out of touch with reality both parties were, a rather ugly, dumpy-looking couple if you ask me exhibiting this level of sexual narcissism is shocking in and of itself. Especially with all of the ""trophy children"" they bred and clearly did not have the capacity to actually love. Two of their very own children were murdered by the parents, including one step-child and one daughter they shared together.This documentary is best for people who want to know more about how this possibly could have even happened, and yes, when you learn about their collective childhoods that in and of itself is a jaw-dropping affair. However, the documentary does appropriately show the layers of brain damage, lack of empathy, low IQ or learning disabilities, severe child abuse and mental illness that come together in a perfect storm to create serial killers.",False
3,2,Jumbled Mess,ondreadelo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet me begin by saying everything about Rose West's life is extremely interesting from a true crime standpoint. So to take such a wealth of information, including an interview with someone who lived with them for years while they were committing these murders, and present it in such a confusing and unwatchable way is a shame. The timeline is all over the place, jumping back and forth between decades and talking about a killing as it was happening then showing news stories from 20years later when they were discovered. It's so confusing to tell what order things were happening in. They made awful editing decisions such as the audio would say they killed 6 women then show a picture of 10 women. Overall very difficult to watch, felt like a bad Christopher Nolan true crime spinoff.",True
4,3,Timeline?,laurencita,n/a,16/08/2025,What could be a good story ends up a confusing mess because the timeline jumps all over the place.,False
5,3,Really,Headturner1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou could do so many stories/ books inside of books, stories, etc. Just the story about Rose and her father, just Freds story, the many weaving stories of the couple. Dungeon, Rose's sex work, the children and whom they were fathered by. The transients that stayed in the house. But no.. This goes back and forth and back again. Nothing exciting. The one interviewer is a little too excited ( and not in a good way) while telling sickening things about Rose( you can tell he may be obsessed. I wish someone would gather information and make a good series. How come we never hear from the siblings of Fred and Rose, friends, people close , the children who survived? Idk but I think someone who could tell a good story about it all would have a goldmine. But I've never seen a complete story on the complexity that is Fred and Rose...",True

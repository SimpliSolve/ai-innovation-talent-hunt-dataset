1,10,this is great...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBritish true crime tv production, that depict the harrowing rush to nab the suspect, nesting up all the evidence to make a decision to prosecute, within(in my mind the indespicably short )24 hours...no commas nor full stops, 24 hours blank...the usual british crime story evaporates into the dust of ''no comments'' interviews, all from the smallest of petty crimes to massmurder, and thats for the audience not too entertaining. But this series have made a stunning tilt, showing police work at the very ground level, with punches and judies all over the surface, really a breakneck way to tell their tales, not the hudlum fable this time.Make or break for a grumpy old man, wanna have a good night of real crime, and well done police work do watch ''suspect no.1'' he say...",True

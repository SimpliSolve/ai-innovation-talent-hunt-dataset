1,5,Garbage police work,bt698nhj,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is evident that the police did not work hard at solving this. Of course it is possible that the documentary is just shallow and incomplete. But if we believe the documentary, nobody really pressed any potential involved parties. Potential leads were not pursued hard. Justice was not a top priority. It seems like a failed investigation.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",False
2,6,Did anyone offer fries?,michaelRokeefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA very interesting documentary focusing on an incident that took place in Speedway, Indiana in 1978. On a cold November night, four young employees of the popular Burger Chef restaurant went missing. A fellow employee dropped by after closing time just to hang out and discovered the assistant manager and three other employees were gone; the restaurant was totally empty, the safe was wide open and the back door left open.Police originally thought it was a petty robbery, without signs of a struggle. Also came thoughts of the missing money being used to support a night of partying with drugs. Within days, all four bodies were found over 20 miles away, still wearing Burger Chef uniforms. Money and watches were found on the bodies leading to authorities thinking along the lines of a botched restaurant robbery. Multiple investigations have yet to solve the burger joint murders.",True
3,2,Nothing Great,billcr12,n/a,16/08/2025,I finished a book(The Burger Chef Murders) on this case today and watched the documentary for further information. Some of the people mentioned in the book are interviewed and they add nothing new to the forty year investigation.A retired cop regrets not having solved the bewildering crime for so long and a pair of podcasters are as clueless as the cop. The current trend of crime programs seems to feel the need for the inclusion of podcasters. It is a totally meaningless use of investigative resources.One particular interview subject looks like Rip Van Winkle and his supposed eyewitness testimony feels about as credible as someone offering the sale of the Brooklyn Bridge.I was not impressed by either the book or this film about the unsolved murders.,False
4,3,"Weaker ""Unsolved Mysteries.""",bombersflyup,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMurders at the Burger Joint is basically an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries,"" without the spooky music and any sort of reenactment.The death of four youths working the night shift, mixed up with shady characters and involved in drugs. I don't see the point of the documentary, two people bringing it to everyone's attention and discussing it, but nothing comes of it, nor is it necessarily a mystery. Pretty crazy that the burger joint would open for business the next day, with money taken and those people not contactable. There was no evidence of violence at the location however, later found elsewhere.",True
5,3,Pod Caster should stick to the mic,sarahew88,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately we will never run out of true crime stories. Even with DNA and surveillance cams, crime is still happening.This particular story is interesting and sad. But repackaging it and rehashing it via podcasters is annoying. Its obvious they bought trench coats to wear for their filmed packages. Popped the collars and everything. Looked like a detective costume. Ridiculous. Leave true crime to Dateline. Please.",False

1,10,CHECK THIS OUT,zachhbzmedia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Our Friend Jon was truly inspiring. Watching the first 10 minutes of the film, I was not only drawn in, but trying to keep my composure. Being a fellow filmmaker, it was amazing to see the stories we have potential to bring to life. Especially seeing someone from Waltham doing it at this level. There are laughs and cries throughout the whole video. Nothing is impossible when you are dedicated and do it with heart. An amazing tribute and experience top to bottom. A really well-done underdog story.-Zach (HBZ Media)",False
2,10,"No Pity, No Heroes, Just Us",billoberstjr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm an actor and I've been in an Edward Payson film. Not this one. A horror film. That's what Edward Payson is known for: making horror films.Which makes ""Our Friend Jon"" all the more striking.A blessing to the parched soul (and I say that with no hyperbole,) ""Our Friend Jon"" cannot help but be spiritual refreshment to anyone who sees it and really settles in with the story; with Garrett, with Brandon, with Nick, with the moms, with the friends.With Jon.The film is moving in some weird, quiet way. I struggled for a word to describe the sensation, and finding none, created one: humanness. There's no attempt here to manipulate emotion or to make anyone a hero or (despite circumstances) a victim. There's just friendship. Friendship as it actually exists in the private lives we all actually live. It's like being in someone else's home and finding that it is somehow your home, too.Watch Our Friend Jon. It validates the quiet nobility of our messy, ordinary lives. It makes you long for what is lost, and remember that there is always a future. You'll want to hug somebody. And not a red-carpet hug either. The real kind.This doc will last.",False
3,10,"Authentic, heartfelt tragedy turned into triumph!",Ryderarley,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary doesn't have to try and give you feels, it just does it. Our Friend Jon makes you take a step back and question your own personal issues and makes you ask yourself, ""is my issue really THAT big?"" From start to finish it will have you appreciating life on another level!",False
4,10,"Unique, Touching and Inspiring Film",Cjhazelnut,n/a,16/08/2025,"A heartfelt and inspiring documentary, ""Our Friend Jon"" touches all the right notes while entertaining its audiences. The filmmaker Edward Payson lets the story unfold through the voices of a group of lifelong friends as they work toward a common goal. Right away the audience feels compassion and empathy for these young men as they band together to make their best friends dream become a reality. At times both hilarious and touching, the audience rises and falls with the emotions of the young filmmakers. Audiences are treated to an unflinching look at what it took for a group of aspiring young horror movie producers to overcome obstacles that would stop many filmmakers in their tracks. An inspirational, never give up on your dreams, message is persistent throughout the film. Payson does an excellent job of not patronizing his subjects, he rather elevates these young men to rock star like status, proving that everyone can succeed with hard work. A must watch film!",False
5,10,Fantastic Film and an Important Story,NeverBrokenDMB,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Our Friend Jon"" is a true story that has really resonant themes about friendship, not accepting limitations and it challenges the general public perception of what's possible for people with disabilities to accomplish. It's very touching, extremely funny and ultimately inspiring. Anyone would be lucky to have friends as dedicated and true as Jon's are, and anyone will be better off spending a couple hours with them through this film. Highest recommendation.",False
6,10,Beautiful story,halleck-56006,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is beautiful and touching story, well-told, about friendship, illness, and DIY filmmaking. I saw it at a film festival (where it won best doc!) and everyone n the audience was quite moved.",False
7,10,So powerful!,jesse_stlouis,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was blown away by the powerful message of this film. I feel so cliche saying this, but REALLY... I laughed, I cried and became more motivated to live my life as full as possible. I'm getting misty eyed writing this review because all I can think about is what a powerful example that Jon and his friends are. One of the best movies I've seen this year!",False
8,10,Optimistic,stephenobana,n/a,16/08/2025,"An unfiltered, unscripted depiction of the human condition from the under represented perspective of special needs. Not a typical happy ending but an optimistic one nonetheless.",False
9,10,"Sweet, Inspiring and full of life.",soymanny,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful, inspiring doc about friends, family and over coming adversity. You'll laugh, cheer, might shed a tear and you'll be reminded to stop making excuses, stop wasting time and get out there and follow your dreams.",False
10,10,A Story Of True Friends,paul-louis-harrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a really emotional film about true friends which all have a disability they are living with. The story of Jon's life as someone who has limited time to live, made choices to live life to the fullest. To think of all of us who are completely healthy... we get lost from realizing how lucky we are. This film is a humbling and touching human experience that I recommend for everyone. The jokes and comradery of these gentlemen finishing the film their fallen friend Jon laid out for them really sticks with you. Bravo.",False
11,9,Dreams don't die: a lesson in love and living on.,imfilmbuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"A thoroughly engaging film about the transcending power of storytelling and dreams, Payson's documentary tells the story of young man whose body succumbs to sickle cell anemia, but whose dreams live on as his friends come together to make the movie he wrote before dying. It's a well-told, inspiring tale of friendship, community and honoring dreams--in the face of disability and even death.",False
12,9,Friendship lasts forever,craigofilm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw Our Friend Jon at the Goldenstate Film Festival last night and was very moved. The film is indeed an emotional rollercoaster. Everyone in the film are likeable, loveable and determined. It is clear how much love the friends (and even strangers) felt for Jon, and the film they create in his honor (which he wrote) is a joy to watch. I found myself crying, moved and laughing throughout. It is a good reminder of love, friendship, and that we only have so much time -- so lets make the most of it and let nothing stop you from your dreams.",False

15,10,Our Friend Jon breaks your heart and gets you excited about film all at the same time.,dpkronmiller-767-283998,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw Our Friend Jon last night at the Valley Film Festival here in Los Angeles in the valley. Just a terrific documentary about the making of a movie written by a Jon Hernandez who passed from Sickle cell anemia before the film could be made. The filmmakers of the film within the doc all have special needs or disabilities which don't seem to get in the way of their passion about making Jon's horror film come to life. It was inspiring to see, as my step father had spina bifida which one of the filmmakers, the director of the doc's brother, Garret Payson also has and to see him over come his disability and finish the film is truly inspiring. And a close relative of mine is autistic and my wife has worked with kids with special needs for years - so it was wonderful to see a film highlight the talents of people who often get over looked in our society.I went into the screening not knowing anything about the movie. The last time I did that was my friend's doc, Dear Zachary, and the result was me being a blubbering mess as I cried my eyes out at the twists and turns of that documentary. Our Friend Jon did the same to me last night although I am happy to say the film has an optimistic ending that should inspire any burgeoning filmmaker.I highly recommend the film.",False
16,10,Movie with a big HEART,pcondit,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a heartfelt love letter to Jon, his friends, and all teens with developmental issues. It shows how the power of love can propel kids to extraordinary achievements - in this case making the film Jon wrote before his death despite having no training what so ever. Just imagine a feel good movie with slasher kills and blood and you have Our Friend Jon.",False
17,10,The emotions will sneak up on you .....,MartinPierron,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI more or less went blindly into this. I went with some other horror movie friends, knowing the film makers were horror fans and the movie had some connection to horror film making. Little did I know it was such an emotional doc about the last dying wish of a young man to have his horror short film made, and his friends who had no prior film making experience with limited money and resources, they set out to complete the short in his honor.
I attended one of the screenings in North Hollywood and there was a Q and A after. The film makers said they did NOT step in with advice or expertise unless they were absolutely asked to. In the end you get to see the finishes project. It truly is an emotional journey, because the friends making the short are also special needs or are living with illness, which makes the production complicated but you also feel for them.",True
18,10,Pulling those heart strings,chadaddison2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Solid documentary. Engaged from start to finish, following these best friends and their love for one another. Loved the concept & the execution. Highly recommend.",False
19,10,Touching and charming documentary,christinamarieleonard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I recently saw Our Friend Jon and I have to say I was really moved by it. Following the journey of these young men as they paid tribute to their friend was amazing and to see what they were able to accomplish by making his movie with no previous knowledge of filmmaking was really cool and inspiring. I thought the movie would be very sad of course because it begins with the death of someone loved by many, and I did cry during it, because I did get emotional, but I truly felt all the emotions; there was so much humor and joy in the film as well and it was extremely well done and fun to watch. I definitely recommend it. Ten stars!",False
20,10,Beautifully well done,nick_fury17,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very heart warming and touching documentary. One of the best documentaries out there. Hands down.

Well done and congrats to director Edward Payson. This is a masterpiece everyone needs to see. Check it out when it becomes available.",False

22,10,"Heartfelt, Inspiring, Friendship",jeff_gaetano-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew I wanted to see this documentary for some time and knew it was going to be moving and heartfelt. I was really moved by Jon's close friends and the fun and excitement they all had for this project. Our Friend Jon, not only showed us that dreams can be passed on to others, but also showed us that making a movie is not as easy as some may think, and if you have the desire and are surrounded by others with that desire, your dream or in this case Jon's dream can become a reality. Payson's directing showed us he doesn't just have an incredible talent behind the camera, he has a heart and desire that anyone would love to have part of their project. Great work all that put in such tremendous effort on this documentary . Salute!!!!",False

You can do anything you put your mind to, and these guys sure did it! They got to honor their friend, while finding themselves in the process! Now I want to make a movie!!! Thanks for the inspiration!",False
25,10,"Beautiful, poignant and inspiring!",nandini-bapat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Our Friend Jon is a beautiful documentary that shows everyone that anyone can achieve their biggest dreams, despite the obstacles in their way. It is a touching masterpiece that reflects on how society treats the disabled and encourages us to expand our view of what the differently abled community is capable of. I walked away from this film with so much to reflect about and was inspired by the bravery of these young men. I encourage you to watch it and consider donating to help find a cure for sickle cell anemia!",False

1,8,"Gritty, raw and frustrating",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.""Union"" is an insightful, gritty and frustrating documentary about the struggles Amazon workers having to go through with Unions and the conflicts and troubles behind Amazon as a corporation. Filmmakers Stephen T. Maing and Brett Story provide a strong gripping story with good atmospheres and interesting conversations and explores the characters and lives thoroughly with an open-minded perspective.It was pretty depressing to see workers trying to make the best of their lives but struggling due to the issues they encounter with Amazon and the labor union not being perfect. Especially with recent events with Amazon laying off many employees, it's pretty disheartening to see the struggles and conflicts. The documentary is well-presented with good sound designs, structures and good emotional cores explored throughout.Many of the participants provided honest realities of their situations and remained interest. There are some slow pacing moments I wished could be better but as a whole, it is nice to see pro-union cinema coming back again.",False
2,8,"Clocking In, Fighting Back",pinkmanboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brett Story and Stephen Maing deliver a raw and deeply human portrait of the union struggle within Amazon in ""Union"", turning what could have been just another documentary about labor organizing into a gripping narrative of resistance, sacrifice, and persistence. By choosing an observational approach without traditional interviews, the directors throw us straight into the heat of the conflict, capturing the daily interactions, the company's relentless union-busting tactics, and the sheer determination of grassroots organizers challenging one of the biggest corporations in the world.Right from the start, ""Union"" sets the stage for the clash with sharp, deliberate editing. The juxtaposition of footage showing Jeff Bezos blasting off into space with exhausted workers trudging through the gates of the JFK8 warehouse hits hard, quietly yet powerfully exposing the contradictions of modern capitalism. The film unfolds with the tension of a thriller, where every roadblock thrown by Amazon against unionization efforts feels like another battle in a never-ending war of attrition.Shot over three years, the film doesn't shy away from showing the human cost of this movement. The working conditions inside Amazon are portrayed with an almost claustrophobic intensity-constant surveillance, unattainable quotas, high injury rates, and relentless psychological pressure. These elements aren't just mentioned; they are felt, with the camera closely following workers, capturing their exhausted yet hopeful expressions every step of the way.One of the standout aspects of ""Union"" is how it explores the internal tensions within the movement itself. The film avoids the trap of turning Chris Smalls, one of the leading figures of the Amazon Labor Union (ALU), into a lone hero. While his charisma and inspiring personal journey are central to the narrative, Story and Maing carefully highlight the collective dynamics and the disagreements that arise within the organization. The tension between Smalls and other organizers, like Natalie and Maddie, underscores that while the common goal is clear, the path to achieving it is anything but smooth.The documentary's strength lies in its honesty about the challenges that follow the historic union vote. Far from offering a triumphant conclusion, ""Union"" makes it clear that the real fight begins after the ballots are counted. Amazon's relentless refusal to recognize the ALU and negotiate a contract puts the future struggles into perspective, leaving the audience with a bittersweet sense of accomplishment mixed with the weight of the battles still to come.Another key strength of the film is its ability to capture authentic moments of camaraderie among the workers. Despite the hardships, there's a genuine sense of solidarity and hope in their interactions. Small gestures-like sharing meals or heated discussions about strategy-add a deeply human touch to the narrative, reinforcing the importance of collective action.Visually, ""Union"" steers clear of the typical protest documentary clich√©s, opting instead for cinematography that emphasizes the grueling routine of warehouse life and the impersonal industrial landscape. The recurring shots of cargo ships opening and closing the film serve as a stark reminder of the brutal mechanization of modern labor and the invisible role these workers play in keeping the global economy running.Overall, ""Union"" is more than just a chronicle of a labor campaign; it's a powerful reminder of human resilience in a system designed to wear it down. Story and Maing masterfully balance social critique with an engaging narrative, resulting in a documentary that doesn't just inform but inspires. It's an essential watch for anyone looking to understand the contemporary labor movement and a compelling testament to what it means to resist in a world dominated by seemingly unstoppable corporations.",False

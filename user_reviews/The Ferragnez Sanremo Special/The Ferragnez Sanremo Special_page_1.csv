1,10,Emotional and profound,fra_panfy,n/a,15/08/2025,"This episode really shows fears, insecurities and obstacles that get overcome thanks to hard work and team work, both professionally and personally. It makes you understand we all have the same doubts about ourselves, our partner, our relationship, our work, and the way Chiara gets to manage it all is simplyg inspiring. She's really an example and puts all herself in everything she does, being it for her family or her work. I cried with her trough out the entire episode because I felt her feelings! She's so humble and kind with everyone in her life and she deserves all her success! Absolutely loved it!",False

4,10,Really emotional,yjnymmbd,n/a,15/08/2025,"This episode is the centre of everything, it show the entire Chiara's view and her feelings... happiness, fear, anxiety, a lot of courage and how fierce she is about herself.We can't see everything from a device so watching her life and seeing who really she is, what she think, how she lives her life is amazing, how much she loves very single person in her life.I really like Chiara, she is a strong woman, she was able to create a empire from nothing and step by step she is arrived here: an important imagine in the fashion's world, she ad an own enterprise, she has milion of people who are inspired by her.She has all my admiration.",False
5,10,Inspiring,maryann-16312,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's just like a real journey in this experience, Chiara doing her best as always but this time we can see the behind the scenes which proves once again she's just like us, and we shouldn't let fear stop us but achieve the best we can achieve. It is all done nicely, the interviews, the storytelling, the scenes from the production following her. Fedez's mental difficulties that happened in that period are not being told in this episode, but if I'm not wrong, another one should be released.The mood is the same as her documentary (which is wonderful and my favourite of her tv programs) and the previews series of the Ferragnez, but shows more her focus and the way she prepares and handles her family in a big project. Loved it.",True

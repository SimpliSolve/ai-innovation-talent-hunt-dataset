1,7,From Roger Moore with Love,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"...or maybe from Roger with Moore love? If you saw the recent ""Mad About the Boy"" documentary on Sir NoÃ«l Coward, you'll recall the use of a voice actor to impersonate the subject of the story as he narrates it. Well that's the technique used here as the late Sir Roger takes us on a whistle stop tour of his own ninety year life. This film benefits from him being of a generation where the archive is a little more readily available as he rises to stardom, marries a few times, makes his name in the ""Saint"" (after a bit of tonsil hockey with Lana Turner in 1956) before he takes over from Connery as ""007"" and the rest, as they say. It appears he was himself an avid film maker so there are plenty of home movies as he entertained the great and good at his Swiss home, and with contributions from his children and a few closer to him than the usual panoply of talking-head movie journalists, this is quite an interesting look at a man who made a career from being a bit of a chauvinist, but who actually comes across as really anything but. Aside from one Golden Globe in 1980, more in the heartthrob category, his industry never really recognised that glint in his eye nor that eyebrow above it with a mind of it's own, so it's nice to reflect on a star who oozed charisma on screen small and large, was under no illusions about his own foibles and certainly didn't take him self seriously at all.",False
2,6,From Roger Moore with Love,henry8-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Documentary charting the life and screen success of Roger Moore using a lot of unseen footage taken by Moore himself, at home and on set. Rather like the recent excellent documentary 'The Life and Deaths of Christopher Lee' it also uses an accomplished actor - here Steve Coogan - doing a near perfect impression of Moore narrating the story and this works really well.Whilst it clearly took him quite a while to hit success with The Saint and James Bond, he very obviously enjoyed life and was deeply loved by family and his many friends. He remained self deprecating throughout his life and also very blatantly ensured that he and everyone near to him had a comfortable existence. He may have had a little difficulty with his various romantic entanglements and wives - in fact he seemed pretty much incapable of nailing that until the end, selecting women as his partners that didn't seem to fit his persona, but hey ho. My only disappointment was how little is mentioned of the 50+ movies he made other than Bond. You can't have everything I guess and most of them were perhaps a bit meh, but a mention of his excellent turn in 'The Man Who Haunted Himself' which he was rightly proud of, is a serious omission.",False

4,7,From Roger Moore with Love,jboothmillard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was delighted when I read about this documentary film in the Radio Times, as it was broadcast on Boxing Day. I was lucky enough to meet and get the autograph of the actor during a signing in 2012 for his book, Bond on Bond: The Ultimate Book on Over 50 Years of 007. Basically, narrated by Steve Coogan, doing an impression of him reading the words from his autobiographies, this is the story of the life and career of Sir Roger Moore. Moore was born on 14 October 1927 in Stockwell, London. His earlier career started in the 1950s as a model for knitwear print advertisements before he studied to be an actor, eventually starring in television period dramas. In March 1954, MGM signed Moore to a seven-year contract, and he starred in films alongside Elizabeth Taylor, David Niven and George Sanders, but the failure of these films meant his contract ended after two years. Moving into television, Moore achieved success with his starring role in the adventure series Ivanhoe, followed by his casting in the successful western series Maverick. Moore achieved worldwide stardom in the 1960s playing spy Simon Templar in the hit show The Saint, produced by Lew Grade, which ran for seven years and over one hundred episodes. Moore worked with Grade again for the next successful series, starring alongside Tony Curtis in The Persuaders throughout the early 1970s. During these years, Moore found himself developing a character during interviews, although he was self-deprecating and often attention was drawn to his eyebrows. Of course, Moore's fame and fortune would increase when he was cast by producers Albert R. 'Cubby' Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as the most well-known secret agent, James Bond 007, in Live and Let Die. The film was financially successful, although critics were unsure about the replacement for Sean Connery. This was not helped by The Man with the Golden Gun not doing as well. Thankfully, The Spy Who Loved Me went on to be the biggest Bond movie, and proved that the films adding more humour does work. Moore went on to do a further four films before retiring the role in 1985 in A View to a Kill, at the age of 57. Moore had smaller acting roles in later years, concentrating more on his charity and humanitarian work, alongside Audrey Hepburn, as an ambassador for UNICEF. He was knighted by the Queen in 1999 for his charity work. Throughout his life, Moore was married four times and had a few children, and had lifelong friendships (as seen through home footage) and acquainted with some of the biggest stars of the time, including Maud Adams, Richard Attenborough, David Attenborough, The Beatles (Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr), Michael Caine, Kirk Douglas, Elton John, Burt Reynolds, Frank Sinatra, Dorothy Squires, Lana Turner and many more. Sadly, Moore passed away from cancer in May 2017, but he will always be remembered as a great star of the big and small screen, especially as the charming, debonair superspy in seven films. With contributions from Steven Berkoff, Barbara Broccoli (James Bond producer and Albert's daughter), Pierce Brosnan, Dick Cavett, Dame Joan Collins, Ernie Dunstall (family friend), John Glen, Gloria Hendry, Christian Moore (Roger's son), Deborah Moore (Roger's daughter), Nanette Newman, Stefanie Powers, Jane Seymour, Emily Squires (Dorothy's niece), Shaun van Steyn (Roger's stepson), Christopher Walken, David Walliams, and Michael G. Wilson (James Bond producer). Moore has an interesting story, both personally and professionally, and the character he presented was always funny and charming; the narration from Coogan adds to the chronological story, it is edited well, and the previously unseen archive footage and personal videos are nice to see, it is a most watchable biographical documentary. Very good!",True
5,9,Wonderful Documentary,derek-e-coster,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw Roger Moore aged 16 on my first day working at Pinewood Studios in 1977 and he looked exactly as you would expect. Just like James Bond or any other part he played. This is a film made by those who loved and liked him but it's none the worse for that. Steve Coogan does a great job voicing him in a straight forward telling of his life. He seemed to enjoy his life and career and not take himself too seriously. All his kids seemed to really love him, even a stepson from an early relationship. As someone else mentions, it would have been good had they mentioned The Man Who Haunted Himself. Still, that doesn't detract from a very entertaining film about a legend of the UK entertainment industry.",False

7,5,From Roger Moore with Love,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"I stumbed upon this documentary film about the life of Roger Moore, and wasn't really expecting to stick with it for the entirity, but it hooked me in.I did think the idea of Steve Coogan voicing Moore from 'beyond the grave' might end up sounding a bit ghoulish, but it managed to stay on the right side of the line.Moore is presented as being a bit of a scamp, a bit of a lad, who loved well and never took himself too seriously. If this were a TV drama he might have presented in a darker light, but I appreciated that this opted to keep the skeletons in the closet.With some worthy talking heads filling the silences, this was better than I thought it would be.",False
8,5,A poor tribute to a likeable star,ShadeGrenade,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary went out on BBC-2 on Christmas Day, 2024 and covers the life of the popular British actor, who never found critical acclaim but who was loved by the public; first as 'The Saint' which ran from 1962 - 68, then in 'The Persuaders!' which aired in 1971, to the James Bond series, a role he played from 1973 to 1985. This documentary was a disappointment. No Michael Caine, for thing ( they were great friends ). No mention of 'The Man Who Haunted Himself' ( which even Moore's harshest critics admit he was good in ). The reading out of Moore's love letters was wrong. They were never intended for public consumption. Steve Coogan's schoolboy impersonation was another blunder.We can but wonder how the Bond series would have fared with a different leading man, such as Burt Reynolds ( yes, he was considered for 007 ). Moore got the role precisely because he was familiar to American audiences. And it worked out well. He played 007 seven times, and his movies are among the most profitable ever made.Whoever takes the role in Amazon's proposed Bond project has a lot of big shoes to fill. After the glum Daniel Craig run, it badly needs to change direction.",True

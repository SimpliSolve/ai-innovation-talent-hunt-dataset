1,8,Speaking Eyes,billion_mucks,n/a,15/08/2025,"""El Secreto de sus Ojos"" hit me with unspeakable strength. I didn't expect to like it so much, so I owe a review to those in analysis measures before seeing it or those interested in some opinion.First off, Campanella works with flawless effort all of the technical aspects of the film. It even starts with a double exposure effect, mixed with some sad shots of a beautiful Buenos Aires that hints the spectacle ahead of us. One shot especially, from a chopper in a soccer field edited with a crane shot is breathtaking. Nothing to envy from Hollywood upper class.But the main strength of the movie comes from the powerful narrative dominion Director Campanella has over characters, spaces and silences. Many moments are coldly tense, scary and very, very intense. This crossover from genres by Campanella couldn't have been better. Crime stories often fall in common places, this one relies on the fragile psychological state of the audience to draw all of it's intense dialog, acting and scenes.I cannot stop recommending it, Argentina can open it's market with movies such as this. It has many, many memorable moments, it interwines comedy perfectly and it is doubtful you will instantly forget it, as it is so well constructed. See it if you can!",False
2,9,Extraordinary Film,bicgus1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Last night I went to watch this flick, and I must say that all in all, I ended up quite surprised because of it's impressive quality. Taking into account that I was already expecting superior film, indeed, it came out to be even more outstanding than I thought, mainly because of the rare combination of noir genre with very precise and measured funny moments and especially an incredibly faithful description of the Argentine system of justice and the characters that compose it. This last element is just perfect. The movie keeps your attention all the time -no decays at all- and the set design is also great, to such extent that it left me wondering what the tricks of the trade employed to achieve such similarity are. Foreign watchers might not fully understand some great details that are mainly local, but anyway they will surely enjoy the thrilling aspects of the film. It would be enough for them to say that almost all this locale's are just true, no matter how incredible they might look.",False
3,9,The secret of Juan José,jpschapira,n/a,15/08/2025,"In my country, Juan José Campanella is synonym of 'cinema of the highest order'. The director works in USA and from time to time he brings a new film. We know, dramatically, what we're going to watch: Ricardo Darín in an important role, a lot of sentimentalism, references to the country's past, a love story. And technically, if it's the highest order, there won't be any complaints. When the film ended, the people in the movie theater started clapping.""El secreto de sus ojos"" tells the story of Benjamín Esposito (Darín) and his need to tell the story of a case that wasn't completely solved 25 years ago and had an important impact in his life. A woman raped and killed and a husband with the surname Morales (Pablo Rago) who went every day to every train station in Buenos Aires to see if he could find the killer. ""You have to see his eyes; they are in a state of pure love"", Benjamín professes in front of Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil); his boss and the woman he loves.There are things we never forget, Campanella knows well, and that might be the film's most important declaration. We expect from the director a powerful love that grows with the years, as we saw with Darín and Villamil in ""El mismo amor, la misma lluvia""; we expect characters with inner ghosts, things to hide and things to hold on to; we expect total control over the language of the environment (in ""El mismo amor..."" it was a magazine staff, in ""Luna de Avellaneda"" the neighborhood club), a knowledge of the customs and the way of speaking of characters that makes for day-to-day comedy. In this aspect, the casting of Guillermo Francella as Pablo Sandoval is crucial. Taking the place of the best friend role always in charge of Fernando Blanco, the comedian plays a drunk with a lot of respect for friendship. His change of look, the measurement of his composition and how he enlightens it with comic touches make for one of the year's best performances.That's about everything we can expect. The fact is ""El secreto de sus ojos"" is a very good movie because there are things we don't see coming. The film contains a treatment of a police investigation that hasn't been seen in our cinema for years. In his riskiest picture, Campanella flirts with thriller, mystery and real action (handy-cam included); he acquires true tension and a sequence in a soccer stadium is the best example of it. He understands when silence is required and when the loneliness of the characters –each of them with a rich, mysterious private and inner world- must be seen fully. It's quite embarrassing in fact, because Darín as a director tried to achieve something like that with ""La señal"". Even though it's obvious Campanella took no inspiration from that film, everything that went wrong there can be seen here, improved. And Soledad Villamil is no femme fatale. I take a risk, however, and defy you to tell me if, because of image and makeup resemblance, and disposition of images and voice in off, the movie towards the finish line doesn't take direct inspiration from Chris Nolan's ""The Prestige"". It's quoting it somehow, at least.It's very moving to watch excellent performances from recognized actors. We've seen them on screen so much, we know what they do, we admire them and respect them and, as with Campanella, we tend to know what to expect. However, sometimes they enchant us with every face in every frame, with every word in every conversation. I'm trying to explain to you the feeling of what Villamil and Darín do in this film: it's enchanting and contagious, purely human (as it occurred in ""El mismo amor...""), but at the same time moving, simply because they're not unprofessional actors that fit in the look of the film, or young actors with expressive faces, or newcomers that take our breath away: they are Ricardo Darín and Soledad Villamil. Campanella has a lot to do with this, because he knows how to make them work together and he made an effort so they would not repeat what they had given us in the other film I've mentioned.The fact that Fernando Castets didn't write the film calls our attention; the script was written by the director and Eduardo Sacheri. It also calls our attention that Campanella himself edited the movie. Is this film-making of the highest order? I believe so, in our country, and speaking of something commercially successful too. It's the only movie seen by many people that can generate interest in revising the director's previous work and, who knows, maybe other national pieces.",False
4,10,A masterpiece,torrelodones49,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is quite frankly an astonishing film. One that fills your entire array of senses and sensitivities, and the praise from Argentine reviewers here is 100 percent justified. Ricardo Darín turns in another majestic performance as a Buenos Aires court employee who is fiercely affected by the rape and murder of a young girl in 1974, a tragedy that dominates his life. Overlapping this theme is the powerfully sensual but never physical relationship between Darín and his superior, the investigating judge played by the superb Soledad Villamil. The connection between the two is electric. It's a pity this film cannot easily transcend the language barrier, if it was an English-language film of the same quality it would already be hailed as a masterpiece. The blending of tragedy, love, violence and humour is brilliant, and the comedy dialogue fantastic. One scene where Ricardo Darín is balled out for having searched an old lady's house is priceless in terms of comic timing and delivery. A wonderful performance also from Guillermo Francella as the court clerk with a drinking problem, in fact the secondary acting is all first-class. The camera-work is impressive, especially the swoop down into the football stadium and the closeups, and the script is also superb. Argentina has nominated the film as its candidate for best foreign film at the Oscar's, it deserves to walk it.",True
5,10,as good as anything out there,tjdinvt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Simply put, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I don't exaggerate when it comes to talking about movies -- but everything about this one, from the acting to the writing, to the camera work, to the directorial decisions, is grade A. The story deals with deep matters, and it does so one step at a time, with a plot that moves steadily forward, gathering force, substance and intensity, not settling for easy answers or plot points, not cutting corners. The characters are complicated, interesting, believable, flawed, funny, tragic and deeply human.I prefer not to get specific about what happens -- I mostly want to try to get across the quality of this bugger. So I'll say it again: it's one of the best films I've ever seen, as good as anything out there. If there's any justice, a lot of people will see it.",False
6,10,This is what movies should always be,sanarg,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is it. A film that you can't get your eyes off until lights are back on... and then it's still difficult to stand up. A thriller, with lovable main characters, that makes you smile and think. A movie about a crime and a love. It has one of best chase scenes I've ever seen, involving what seems to be real complex camera work, something that could've been part of a Lord of the Rings movie maybe (at least that is what it looked like from my seat). Simply amazing. The acting is perfect. The pace is perfect. The ending couldn't be better (and we have seen so many great films that spoil it all at the end!).Just go see it and enjoy what cinema should always be. It's a 10 out of 10.",False
7,10,A Story of Passion and Commitment,Hitchcoc,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't add a lot to what has been written. The direction and cinematography aside (which is magnificent), this is an incredible psychological study, involving a group of the most complex of characters. Esposito finds himself in love with two people: the woman who was once his boss and because of inaction, left him heartbroken, and, secondly, a beautiful young rape/murder victim. Over a twenty-five year period, these forces never leave him. The rapist is his Moby Dick to his Captain Ahab. Since we don't see a lot of what happens in the intervening time, we must wonder how empty and fruitless his life has been until he has his epiphany. Mixed in all this are the politics of Argentina and the vengeance of a horrible man. Also, in the middle is the messed friend, an alcoholic, who can be a true talent, but is submerged in his problems, spending his time in bars. If we look to literature we might consider him the Sydney Carton of this film. When you see what happens to him, you will see why I choose this character as a reference. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen. It has it all.",False
8,10,"Absolutely impeccable, great film!",casch0101,n/a,15/08/2025,"I agree with SanFava. I am a follower of Campanella's and Darin. I have seen all previous three films. However, this one surpasses them all!. This is a great script, top-notch acting by everyone, partly thanks to the excellent casting. Superb cinematography. The film basically explores what ""passion"" is to the human being. A great passion (on various areas) is involved in almost all characters. You have suspense, a clever detective story, some surprising twists, etc. Darin has an ""aura"" (paraphrasing the the title of the film he worked in, ""The Aura"") that illuminates the whole screen. His presence is as powerful in the screen as that of Gene Hackman, Pacino, DeNiro or Hoffman (the top, great ones). I sincerely hope this movie gets his due awards (Oscar included), because it deserves so!).",False

10,n/a,What the eyes can tell... without needing a word,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm Argentinian, but I generally don't like Argentinian movies. And it's not because there isn't any good actor/actress in the country. The fact is that there are a lot of excellent actors... what happens is that normally the movie scripts just suck.In this case the movie blew me away... the plot, the performances, well... everything. A special thing that I really loved was the beautiful close-ups, the little expressions in the faces of everybody, the wrinkles, the words not said with the mouths, but with the eyes, every desire, every single detail of the number of emotions that everyone has.""El hijo de la novia"", ""Luna de Avellaneda"", ""El secreto de sus ojos""... it's not a coincidence that all these movies have Campanella and Darín working in tandem.This is the way more Argentinian movies should be: actors+SCRIPT.",True
11,7,Intriguing but Sloppy,kenjha,n/a,15/08/2025,"A retired Argentinian federal agent writes a book based on his recollections of a 25-year old unsolved murder case. Darin and Villamil give good performances as government co-workers whose relationship is fraught with unconsummated sexual tension. It is an intriguing story, but the execution is sloppy. There are too many loose ends and the plot elements pertaining to the murder suspect are so ludicrously contrived in terms of how he is targeted, caught, and convicted that it's hard to take this film seriously. Furthermore, after all the buildup, the conclusion is rather underwhelming. It's not a bad film by any means, but it falls far short of its lofty reputation.",False
12,10,A Masterpiece...,somkaviraj,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a big movie aficionado and watch a lot of movies. I guess you can say movies are my passion. After watching The Secret in their Eyes, though I confess I had my reservations as the movie was in a foreign language and I felt I won't be able to enjoy much as the real emotions and feelings mostly can't be conveyed in translations. Thus with such thoughts I proceeded to watch the movie.Initially, the plot and the character build up seemed nothing out of the ordinary but then gradually as the movie progressed it held me in rapt attention.Then it was simply impossible to let go, I was entirely swathed in this marvelous and sublime creation. The story line, the direction,the acting, editing, background music etc. simply sublime.This is the kind of movie which mesmerizes you, captivates you and simply won't let go. The human emotions expressed and portrayed are bound to touch the viewer regardless of the region he belongs to.This is the kind of movie which exemplifies that cinema has no boundaries and has an universal appeal. A must see for all movie aficionados and movie well deserving the Oscar.This movie ought to go in Top 250 movies of all times and Hall of fame.",False
13,6,Take a cold shower folks - unbelievable praise....,mallaverack,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat's this - ten stars for a movie in which the most vital turning point appears completely out of left field!? Gomez rapes and murders a young woman in the most brutal and sadistic way imaginable but because he is useful to the political regime as an informer, he is released!!! For non-Argentinian viewers, the time (1970s) in which this horrendous crime was committed was barely touched upon thereby providing no context for the later release of the prisoner. This is a HUGE weakness in an other wise well-produced movie. For me, from this glaringly incredulous stage of the plot, I struggled to maintain interest.I must also say that the evasive romantic links between the two major characters seemed a bit trite. Do normal adults behave so? Very wimpish and immature was how their attempts at expressing their feelings came across to me.Hardly worthy of an Oscar nomination let alone being declared the winner.",True
14,3,What am I missing?,ddelamaide,n/a,15/08/2025,"The over-the-top praise for this film is mystifying. The characters and their motivations range from juvenile to incredible, the pace is tendentious, the writing is banal. The actors do as good a job as they can with a poor script and the cinematography is certainly watchable, though I have no sense of having been to Buenos Aires.It's simply not possible to suspend your disbelief to the point where you can accept the premises or characters in this film. The trouble Esposito and Irene have communicating with each other is something most people overcome by junior high school, even given that class distinctions in Argentina in that period are probably stricter than here. The reaction of the husband, Morales, from beginning to end is close to fantasy, and as for the way Esposito and Sandoval track down the suspected perp -- preposterous.So this won an Academy Award and an 8.3 rating at IMDb? What an example of groupthink.",False
15,8,Deserves the Acclaim It Has Received,FilmRap,n/a,15/08/2025,"When Juan Jose Campanella is not directing episodes of Law and Order, CSI or the like, he periodically returns to Argentina make a movie. In this case he directed and co-wrote the screenplay of The Secret in Their Eyes. Thus far it is the most successful movie in Argentina in the past thirty-five years and now in just few days after we saw it, we will find out if this Academy Award nominated movie for the Best Foreign Film will win an Oscar. It reminds us of the French movie, Tell No One, one of our all time favorites, as it is also a sophisticated detective story with an easy flowing but yet a complicated plot that keeps you thinking and guessing throughout the story. It is in Spanish, of course, with good subtitles. This movie is not only a mystery, crime movie but it is also a subtle romantic film which is has very good comedic moments. There is the use of a narrative technique that allows you to see the story through the imagination and the memory of the main character Benjamin Esposito played by well-known Argentine actor Ricardo Darin. There are skillfully done movements, which go back and forth in time as well as shifting the point of view, which on a few occasions took a few moments for us to orient ourselves. The acting, directing and photography were superb with great realism and therefore it surprised us to learn that the budget was only two million dollars. As required for all good movies of this genre, there is a strong ending, which will hold your interest and encourage further reflection.",False
16,10,"In 21st century, eyes still speak",drgrozozo,n/a,15/08/2025,"OK, frankly, I didn't expect much of this.I'm not familiar with Argentinian cinema, so this was my first acquaintance with director, writer and actors.Boy, what a surprise this movie made. It's beautifully filmed, it has lovely slow parts where director and actors narrate emotions through silence, this feature is almost vanquished from modern cinema where any frame that doesn't contain action is considered boring.I thoroughly enjoyed directing, but acting left me pining for Spanish classes. Impressive portrayal of characters if self-evident, with Soledad Villamil's performance shining out as an example of true actress. Unfortunately, we Spanish-impaired people can only sense the beauty lying within spoken lines and rhythm of the language that subtitles just cannot convey.As for violence and nudity they are used in glimpses, not more than necessary and in meaningful places, I spent good part of the movie fearing that it must eventually get ruined with some trendy shocker effect. But it doesn't, it flows it's own way beautifully to the end.If one can use small court office and a rape case to tell a love story in such subtle and profound manner it leaves me wandering what Argentinian cinema has for us for the future. I'll jump on digging through it's past right away, and I hope anyone wondering if this movie is worth their time can be swayed to yes side by my humble recommendation.",False
17,9,How to Live an Empty Life?,claudio_carvalho,n/a,15/08/2025,"The retired justice officer Benjamín Espósito (Ricardo Darin) decides to write a novel based on the Morales Case of twenty-five years ago and has difficulties to find the right beginning. He visits his former chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings (Soledad Villamil) in the tribunal to show his draft. In the 70's, Benjamín has an unrequited love for his new-hired chief Irene that belongs to an upper-class. Benjamin is assigned to investigate the murder of Liliana Coloto (Carla Quevedo), a beautiful woman recently married with Ricardo Morales (Pablo Rago) that had been brutally raped and murdered. Benjamin and his alcoholic partner Pablo Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) feel touched with the grief of Ricardo and go further in their investigation. Benjamin observes that a man named Isidoro Gómez (Javier Godino) is staring Liliana in many pictures and he becomes the prime-suspect. Meanwhile the tension between Ricardo and Irene increases along the days but Ricardo does not understand the signs of her eyes. Twenty five years later, Ricardo is still haunted by his love for Irene and for the unsatisfactory resolution of the Morales Case.""El Secreto de Sus Ojos"" is a film awarded with the Oscar of Best Foreign Language Film of the Year with a dramatic story that perfectly entwines crime, thriller and a subtle romance in an adequate pace. The direction of Juan José Campanella is tight and the screenplay is wonderful, unfolding two lead stories – the brutal murder of a young woman and the repressed love of a subaltern for his chief – with many subplots. The acting is top-notch, with excellent dialogs and many funny lines but never vulgar. The cinematography and the camera work are magnificent and there is one specific scene very impressive with the camera approaching to the stadium in the middle of a soccer game between Huracán and Racing. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Segredo dos Seus Olhos"" (""The Secret of Your Eyes"")",False
18,10,"""How do you live a life full of nothing?""",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is only the second Argentinian movie I've seen, both within the past week (the other was ""Wild Tales""), and so far I'm batting a thousand by picking two immensely satisfying films. I was reading some of the negative reviews and I had to laugh, more than one stated that the ending was completely predictable. Yeah right, like anyone could foresee that Morales would kidnap the guy who murdered his wife and keep him a prisoner for twenty five years. Come on, nobody could see that coming.At least not ahead of time. After the fact, when you start putting two and two together, along with the picture's title, one is able to come to grips with the idea that Morales wouldn't let things go the way the corrupt district Judge Romano (Mariano Argento) did, and would relentlessly pursue his side of the case, in the same manner legal counselor Benjamin Esposito (Ricardo Darin) did on his. So much of the story depended on the concept that 'The eyes speak', and in more ways than one. It's what trapped the killer and what gave away the feelings between Esposito and his supervisor Irene Hastings (Soledad Villamil), even though that relationship went unrequited for more than two decades.The scene that really floored me was when Irene and Esposito began interrogating Isidoro Gomez (Javier Godino). I'm not entirely convinced that what Ms. Hastings did was ethical or not, but the way she demeaned Gomez to make him crack was truly inspired. The man would have to have been deranged to expose himself like that in a law office, so you had a pretty good idea right there that the guy wasn't playing with a full deck. The fact that he was released upon executive order is one of those things that makes one see red in any kind of movie, and inspires that much more contempt of the justice system.All the while of course, one wonders why Esposito could never reveal his true feelings and intentions with Ms. Hastings. He came close a couple of times, and it looked like she was willing to reciprocate, but those frustrating moments dissolved into just another distraction. I was ready to give it up for lost until the very last scene when Irene told Benjamin that 'it would be difficult'. It leaves the viewer a bit conflicted because the woman had a husband and family that she was going to compromise, something that she and Esposito had done for the last twenty five years.",True
19,10,you really don't need another review,A_Different_Drummer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not often I come to an IMDb review page and think what can I possibly add to all the comments that came before? The movie is staggering in its ability to engage and while engaging to constantly fiddle with the expectations of the viewer. It is the rarest of movies, a slow movie that is never boring and one you never want it to end.I want to ask aloud why Hollywood feels the psychotic compulsion to remake every decent foreign film whether it needs remaking or not? I remember that one of the best horror films I have ever seen was about an undead girl in a climate so cold that the thought of living there was scarier than the story (LET ME IN.) It was a foreign film and the Hollywood remake took place in ... Mexico.Some people will never get it.Highly recommended. But you already knew that.",False
20,10,Smells like a masterpiece!,bahadir_sarsilmaz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow what a great movie really! It began like a simple crime story but the wonderful use of subjects, symbols and strong references turned it in to a masterpiece. Details about Eva Peron's Argentina and questioning of the terms of law and justice. My interest is increasing for Latin American Cinema when I watch such beautiful works. By the way I watched this movie in It's original language. Subtitles were translated into English. I think by using ""Google Translate"" which sucks.

21,n/a,"You Eyes, Your Love, Your Passion",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a truly lovely film that has potential to change lives. I will consider it for my ""list of fours,"" when I report it.You may simply fall into the rather soft world it builds, one in which love can be redeemed as a matter of earnest justice. It is a simple coloring of the by now familiar Spanish-language model of anti-noir. In noir, the on screen characters are buffeted by events and laws in a world designed by the act of us watching. In the Spanish-language model, the on-screen characters imagine a world that bobs and weaves around the world we want to impose on the movie.Sometimes this is called ""magical realism,"" and I suppose that concept makes sense in novels where everything is internal. Here in cinema we see, we live in worlds.As with the best of these films, there is careful structuring. Underlying all this — I'll call it mirroring here — is the effort of a man to change reality. Plot-wise, he needs to recapture a lost love with a colleague. This is mirrored in his need to revisit justice for a violent murder that terminated the most passionate love he knows. He follows his own passion, amidst a speech by his assistant about the inevitability of passion that is mirrored in how the murderer is captured.I'll take a moment away from mirroring to remark that this capture scene is in a packed soccer stadium. It is in a continuous take that seems physically impossible and has the edgiest cinematic tension I know.This is literally two movies spliced together. To begin, we know it as a police procedural, with a love story under. It morphs about halfway into the dual: a love story with a detective story under, and the detective story now is of a different kind.That ""different kind"" has to do with the mirroring of time. The early mystery is who committed the murder and how to catch him. The later mystery about what happened after the in-story watchers let him free. He folds these together by writing the past while we watch him struggle with the future. He literally writes half of the film and his creation may well be fiction. We see him struggling in the first scenes. When his love reads the novel she asks if that is how it was because she wants to know the world she will inhabit. She is pleased, saying that things will be complicated.Even this is mirrored. Where our detective creates a world by narrating it, the bad guy ends up in a limbo where he gets no story, literally.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",True
22,10,An excellent piece of art!,dimuthu44,n/a,15/08/2025,"Well..I don't write reviews. I often vote for the movies I watch, but usually not jump in to reviews, and I have to mention that I don't understand Spanish, I watched it using subtitles with original language spoken (which I don't like at all, but just watched it anyway because it had some good ratings here) I'm writing this because this one deserves it.Just watched it. From the very beginning I forgot that I can't understand a single word they speaking. The movie glued me into it so that I can't get my eyes out of it. At first, I thought its a same old story a person looking for his wife's murderer 30 years later. Sooner the movie turned in to a masterpiece by attaching romance, humour and mystery/thriller into it.The plot is well executed, casting was excellent, camera angles were directed 100% accurately to express the sadness, humor, fear and romance of different situations of characters. Every single frame constructed towards the final decision of the movie, as in missing a frame would result in a loss of information, and I think that final result beats the endings of Shawshank Redemption, The Usual Suspects which I liked most. Also I think this still underrated at 8.5.If you still didn't watch it due to the language problem or any other concern, please watch it immediately. It's an excellent piece of art!",False

Quick!Now we have him in custody, let's get a confession out of him, we have 6 minutes. Done deal! Next!The relationships between the protagonists are frankly juvenile.

I think one of the greatest things of the movie is the dialogs, with or without swearing, it is very local and this might be the only flaw of the movie.",False

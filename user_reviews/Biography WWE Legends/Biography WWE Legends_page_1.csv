1,9,"Informative, entertaining, educational memory bio series of super wrestling stars!",blanbrn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being a kid growing up in the golden years of the 80's I loved ""WWF"" Wrestling as it began it's exposure on cable TV with many shows. Many of my favorites were Rowdy Roddy, Randy Savage, Ultimate Warrior, and Bret Hart. As I loved their ways good or bad as the matches they did made memories, as with this A&E series ""Biography: WWE Legends"" it shows vintage footage interviews and match clips that I enjoyed from the good old days! The series in 8 parts with 2 hour docs, is a feast a joy for any old ""WWF"" Wrestling fan. The episodes also give personal info on each grappler showing each's humble starts from home to bodybuilding, to breaking in the regional circuits, interviews are given with friends and stars like Hulk Hogan, Brother Love, and owner and company CEO Mr. Vince. Also revealing and heartbreaking is the tragic downfall and early passing of many wrestling superstars, among my favorites of this series were Randy Savage, Rowdy Roddy, Ultimate Warrior and Brett Hart. Overall a must watch for any wrestling fan and pop culture ""WWF"" historian buff.",False
2,7,"Great, but slightly biased.",ethanbenfield,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall really entertaining and Informative. However, because its WWE, things are sometimes omitted, exaggerated or spun to fit thier narrative. History is written by the winners after all.",False
3,9,The UK Misses Out,GoldenGooner04,n/a,16/08/2025,"In the UK, we don't get to see this Great Powerful Sad Series.But there are ways, and I have just finished watching season 4.I'm in my 60s, was at Summerslam 92, grew up with these Heroes of mine,
What I have taken from this series, I have learnt a lot from the stories, about so many stars.I only saw the Wrestlers on TV and Yes of course I worshipped the Bulldogs, but watching his story the pain he was suffering the drugs, that so many took.We build these stars up to be Gods, we wear their names on our backs, we feed their ego's. And a lot can't handle that fame and worship, they turn to drugs, booze, ego-manics.Some turn to pills because of pain of injuries.I think this series is the best I have ever seen done on the WWF, WWE stars, Vince as we now know is a monster but in the wrestling world, he was also a genius.It must be so difficult for someone like Taker who Vince gave him everything really, now he is scared to even mention his name.And that HOF Ring is like climbing a mountain, it's being given flowers by your peers, it means so much to them. As Jake says ""I have it you don't"", it's something that AEW can never equal. Every wrestler who got one on these doc's is so proud of it.For me the standout episodes are, mainly because I learned so much about these stars which I never knew are:
I don't know how they decide to do a few for 45Mins and others for 90mins? Someone like DDP and Davey Smith deserved 90mins.The Roman Reigns one surprised me, I was a doubter, and felt it was all because of Heyman, but boy was I wrong, it's Roman who drives the train, his idea for the Brock tractor, his idea for Sami to join, his idea for Jey to be his own man. I don't know if he is in character in this or not, but he really believes he is taking the company to new heights and is the Tribal Chief that wearing the Uni Fabi round his neck does mean he is the ""leader"" makes you think if he was dead against Cody taking the belt? It was his idea to bring in Solo. But what really surprised me, the past greats like: Hogan, Flair, Taker. Austin, HBK, all believe he is simply the top man and will be for many years. Do they rate him better than them? Does Flair think Roman is better than he was?Eddie broke my heart, from his 1st words ""enjoy the ride, as you don't know when it will end"" it's why me a bloke of 62 still does crazy mental trips, driving from UK to Athens in a Mustang and now going to drive to Malta because you don't know when the ride will end.Watching the Steamboat one, I think Vince would have been happy to behead someone if it was ""best for business"" He could have died after that attack by Nexus and I wonder how the wrestlers in Nexus felt knowing that for 3 weeks Ricky was near to death, did Vince give a dam?The Mike Miz one had me crying with laughter, his skit on Raw with the Divas, ""Oh my god"" I'm sure I watched that when it happened, it's just brilliant. And wtf is ""hoorah"" he was banned from the locker-room, had to go to the toilets with the audience, that ""bullying"" would not be allowed today. Mike might have ""small balls"" but he has Massive Mental Balls. Talking Smack was real, there is real hate between Mike and Bryan, why? I wonder if Rock and Cena feel the same way with Bryan as they talk about on here with Mike? Seth and Foley, and now he is a leader.Paul Heyman should have been 90mins easy, I never thought I would shed tears watching this, but what he said about his mother hit home. Some people who escaped Germany before the war, felt guilty they got out. I know of someone who hide her whole life from her husband and son for 60 years plus. Only when she passed over did they find out the truth. Maybe she was scared or felt guilty I don't know, but this episode hit hard. For his Mum to survive 3 camps
Paul is a Genius, never looking back, never standing still. But they never mentioned his wife, mentioned the kids a lot. But never mentioned Punk at all. Was surprised by that even more so that he is back in the WWE. Is their bad blood outside the ring? Does Paul feel that Punk dumped on his when he left the WWE?Rowdy Piper

5,10,Best documentaries I've watched in a LONG time!,Amazing_Wizard,n/a,16/08/2025,"In each of the eight bio-docs, we explore a particular Wrestling superstar. Because these are written and funded by the WWE, they have interview with everyone involved at every level. This includes all the wrestlers and staff (included AEW and TNA) and celebrities like Mr. T. Vince McMahon is also interviewed. They have footage from all there matches in almost every promotion to use and this makes for a very colourful and varied story from lots of angles. Add to that the high production values, HD quality cameras and sound. Its just fun to watch.However the flip side is that WWE can do no wrong. Certain controversial topics may be discussed; but its entirely the performers fault and WWE accept no blame. Even when we know from watching other docs like Dark Side of the Ring they had a hand in it, here they only say ""nice thing"" (quoting Vince McMahon from the episode about Rowdy Piper) outright admitting he was refusing to talk about the uglier stuff.Having said that, the stories they give from the individual performers are fantastic. The journeys were well-picked for having substance to them making great documentaries.Hopefully they will explore others that haven't had the spotlight yet in series 2 that I think have rather interesting stories to tell like: MVP, Lita, Kevin Nash, Scotty 2 Hotty, Shane Helms. Kane, Jake the Snake, Big Boss Man. Davey Boy Smith.",False
6,10,One Of The Best Bio Series I've Ever Come Across,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm going to keep this short because it is a bit difficult to sum up four seasons of individual WWE biographies. But I have to say this about ""WWE Legends"": it is hands-down the best biography series I've ever stumbled across. Not just for professional wrestling--but for any topic.This isn't just a bland formula that each story is grafted upon. Instead, every figure is given in-depth treatment and a personalized approach. Though of course featuring the in-ring and even out-of-ring stories that wrestling junkies will eat up, the emotional factor is what really garnered every episode no lower than 8/10 stars from me. As a child, these figures were my sporting heroes, yet at that time I of course had no idea the types of personal and physical sacrifices they were going through for my entertainment. On multiple occasions--almost every one, if I'm being honest--I was brought to tears by the tales of tragedy and triumph in equal measure.Though of course a series like ""WWE Legends"" is going to most effortlessly appeal to 80s/90s wrestling fanatics like myself, I also think it can be enjoyed by a wider audience. The stories here are easily compelling enough to draw in even casual bio fans. As far as that genre goes, this is about as good as it gets across any subject.",False
7,10,I want MORE,user-601-78794,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis series is amazing. I only wish that they had more episodes like on Ricky the Dragon or Sgt. Slaughter.,True
8,8,Well made,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVolume 1:controlling history, these WWE Legends docs are actually pretty fun. Seeing as how Dark Side of the Ring had their own episode about Randy Savage, WWE decided to go all in on the more sensational sides of the life story of the Macho Man, somehow out scummy-ing - that's a word, trust me - Dark Side at their own scummy and often bleak for the sake of bleakness game.Now you can have that doc, as well as ""Rowdy"" Piper, ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and Booker T all on one disk from Lionsgate and A&E. Sadly, WWE are discontinuing their physical media after the end of this year, so getting more releases like this probably won't happen.There's some real quality here, as Savage's was produced by Billy Corben and Alfred Spellman (Screwball), Piper's was directed by Emmy and Peabody Award-winner Joe Lavine (who has directed for ESPNs 30 for 30 series), Stone Cold's was produced by Jason Hehir (The Last Dance, Andre the Giant) and the Booker T doc was directed by Emmy and Peabody Award-winner George Roy (The Curse of the Bambino).If you want to know more about these great legends, this is a great place to get started. And these sets are pretty inexpensive and easy to find on Amazon.Volume 2: The second volume of Lionsgate and A&Es WWE collection of Biography features Shawn Michaels (directed by Joe Lavine, who did the ESPN 30 for 30 ""Playing for the Mob and the documentary Namath for HBO), Ultimate Warrior (directed by Daniel Amigone (Chain of Command, The Circus: Inside the Greatest Political Show on Earth), Mick Foley (directed by Thomas Odelfelt, who made the HBO 24/7 Mayweather-Marquez) and Bret ""The HItman"" Hart (directed by George Roy, who made Mantle for HBO).It's great to see these movies made by actual sports documentarians instead of presented as jokes. Sure, the Warrior doc has some of the dirt that you expect, but that came after WWE realized that they would truly be competing with Dark Side of the Ring.You also get. To hear from the actual stars themselves -- when possible -- and the people they told these amazing stories with. If you're a wrestling fan -- or know one -- this inexpensive set (and Volume 1 as well) are a great deal.",True
9,10,A Very Good Biography Series,xoshimautaxo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile all of the biographies have been solid, the one I wan to focus on is that of The Bella Twins. I loved how honest it all came across and how Nikki and Brie weren't afraid to get so personal. Brie disclosing how she had been sexually assaulted not once, but twice really hit me hard. Same for her disclosure of when she suffered from severe depression.I love that they regularly gave nods of thanks for the support of other women from the Divas era (Brie mentioning how Victoria took really good care of her during her debut match, the emphasis on the tag team match with Emma and Paige that started the #GiveDivasAChance movement on social media rather than pretending it was just the Bellas who started the womens revolution. The likely pretty problematic mention of how they checked in with AJ Lee on if a match angle where Brie kissed AJ was ok with AJ. The reflection of selling out an arena with just women for the Evolution pay per view etc etc).I love that they highlighted the feud between the Bellas and Stephanie McMahon. That feud was easily the most interesting for the women in close to a decade at the time and it doesn't get nearly the credit it deserves for how incredible it was.",True
10,10,"Best there is, best there was, best there ever will be...",ahoque-113-485509,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every wrestling fan, young and especially old, will love this series. It Offers all the nostalgia and insight into the sacrifices made by wrestlers we loved watching and provides some background information we weren't privy to until now. Great contributions from family, friends and fellow pros. Lots of unseen footage adds to the stories. A must watch for wrestling fans from any era or even if you were never into wrestling too because at the heart of these documentaries lies a unique human story anyone can relate to. Heel or baby face it doesn't matter, you will get the good the bad and the ugly!",False
11,5,Some revealing footage but unfortunately tainted with the WWE narrative,anthonyjames18,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although well produced and some interesting behind the scenes footage, overall a big let down as it history from Vince McMahon and his backroom staff.To paint Randy Savage in such a negative light who was constant professional while Ultimate Warrior is painted as a hero who had ""faults"" tells you all you need to know in this series.A real shame as it had a lot of potential.",False
12,1,Trashing legends for the sake of it.,upsidedownbj,n/a,16/08/2025,"These A & E things are garbage. They trash people who are dead and who can't speak for themselves. They get biter exes and people who have nothing to do with them to trash the guys for ratings. Do not buy this! Terrible, and A & E should be stopped.",False

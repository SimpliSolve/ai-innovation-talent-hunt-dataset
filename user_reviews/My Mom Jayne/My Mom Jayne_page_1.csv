1,9,Jaw dropping documentary,scruz71895,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went into this documentary with low expectations, but by the end, I had chills. There's so much passion and thought put into this film. Although Jayne Mansfield's life was tragically short, this documentary proves her legacy is still very much alive. I learned things about Jayne that genuinely surprised me-in a good way. She had so many hidden talents, and it's incredible how much she accomplished by the age of 34. This is easily one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time. Jayne would be so proud of her daughter for honoring her story and sharing her journey to becoming a Hollywood icon.",False
2,9,A story that will touch many people.,avatarkerstin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was surprised about how much this story about I was surprised about how much this story about Jane Mansfield's career, partners and children before and after her stardom and death, would move me emotionally. The directors approach to the unfolding of it all, telling it from her point of view and her personal struggles - and at the same time with the uttermost respect for anyone involved and around her, gripped me especially. I believe people all over the world will be able to relate to her life journey. Because this story has the ability to connect people from many walks of life, heal wounds and push them to continue their own journey with more understanding and love for others. This is an emotionally intelligent movie with high ethical awareness. Actually the kind that gives me hope for the future of the film industry in general. Well done director!",False
3,8,Very well done,SStephenson2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellently made documentary about Jayne Mansfield and her family. It is heartwarming, dramatic, and empowering. Definitely a must see. The documentary details Hollywood life in the 50s and 60s for female actors. It shows the struggles Jayne went through to be famous but also be there for her family. Mariska Hargitay's entire family is interviewed and shares their viewpoint on what it was like growing up with an iconic actress as their mother. The documentary is easy to follow, lots of video clips and pictures to really help visualize what the narrator was describing. I highly recommend this documentary to everyone.",False
4,10,Incredibly Moving,Hazellnation,n/a,16/08/2025,So well done. Poignant and touching. Many surprises that I never knew. So glad they touched on how intelligent Jayne was. I had no idea she was such a talented musician. So amazing to see that Mariska is doing what her mom wish she had transitioned to. A fantastic dramatic actress. I know Jayne is proud. Many moments had me crying but also some humorous moments.Glad she shared some very secretive things about her life and was honestly shocked that no one knew. Especially with social media.Touched by her siblings recounts of their memories of their mother. The end for me got me in the feels.Just beautifully done.,False
5,10,Absolutely amazing. Mariska is a remarkable human.,diamonddax,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching this documentary and I'm writing this - trying to see my phone screen - with eyes full of tears. All I can say is - Absolutely AMAZING!Mariska didn't have to allow us into this part of her life. The raw emotion. The everyday clothing. It was like we were ""at home"" with her. Such a special way to invite us all in. She got to tell her story - her way. When she was ready. You have to love her for it. I love her for it.I don't want to type any spoilers - I will just say it again. This documentary was absolutely amazing and I hope Mariska gets an Oscar in the documentary category for it. She deserves it.Mariska has allowed all of us to be part of her life for the last 26 years on SVU. How many other actors have held the same character this long? Not only that, we want to continue watching her week after week. We don't want it to end. An actor in a role this long is unheard of. How many people have kept any job this many years? That shows you her work ethic and how talented of an actress Mariska is. When I turn on my television every Thursday night, I see someone in law enforcement. I don't see an actress. She is where she is due to her incredible acting ability. Something her mother wanted so badly. To be appreciated for her (many) talents and not just her figure. I'm so proud of Mariska. Doing things on her terms.With the way Mariska grew up, she could have turned out very differently and blamed it on her childhood. Instead, she rose up and has always carried herself with class. She is highly respected in the industry. A role model. In spite of it all and prior to this documentary - we only knew half of her story.This documentary humanizes Mariska and how she came to be here. It showed what Jayne went through as a mother trying to make it as a serious actress in the industry. My heart hurt for her. I cried with her. I laughed with her. I grew up without parents after the age of 12, I could feel the void in her heart. I know that void. I want to say so much more but don't want to have spoilers.I do have to close with this:
To this person who left the review before this one that gave a 3/10 because they felt the documentary wasn't about Jayne, but more about Mariska - you obviously cannot read and should revise your rating. Shame on you. The title of the documentary is very clear. It states ""My MOM, Jayne"" - ""Mariska Hargitay's journey to understand and embrace the public and privacy legacy of her mother, Hollywood icon Jayne Mansfield. Mariska delves into her mother's story for the first time - searching for the mother she never knew almost six decades after the Hollywood legends tragic death.""
Did this reviewer miss what the documentary was about? It is too bad that I can't respond directly to it. The scathing review was not warranted at all. You misunderstood what the documentary was about and the ratings shouldn't suffer because of your misunderstanding.The story IS about Mariska and her MOM. The mom Jayne was.The ending was a love letter from Mariska to her mother - after many, many years of hurt - and it was beautiful.Thank you, Mariska - for sharing your life with us all of these years. We love you and we are so proud of the woman that you became in spite of it all.",False
6,10,A beautiful journey,hjschoors,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mariska Hargitay directed this complicated but clear and concise timeline of her mother's career, relationships, and family life. It was so beautifully executed. I won't give too much away because it needs to be experienced to understand the nuances. It left me in tears, for Mariska, for her family, and for the true and deep love they have for one another. Thank you Mariska for sharing this beautiful journey with us. It's one I will never forget. God bless Jayne who lived so much life in her short time on earth, and God bless Mickey for showing the kind of unconditional love that is not of this earth.",False
7,10,I did not think I could love Mariska Hargitay more,Film_Diva,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've admired Mariska Hargitay and enjoyed her work as an actress for a long time. Now I'm even more impressed with the courage it took to share her complicated life story.There is so much tragedy involved, but it makes me happy to know that as much tragedy as there was, there was even more love. And I'm glad that, to some degree, people were able to admit their mistakes and apologize for them.It's rather head-spinning to think about the identity questions and issues involved and how it plays out over the years of secrecy and mystery. I hope this documentary receives the recognition it deserves.",False
8,10,The most moving documentary I have ever seen,frank-tortorici,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just finished watching one of the most moving documentaries I have ever seen, the brand new My Mom, Jayne. It is written and directed by her daughter, Mariska Hargitay of Law and Order SVU fame-that's a show that I never watched. But I know of the legacy and fuzzy reputation of Jayne Mansfield and the fact that she wanted to be a serious actress but ended up like a second rate Marilyn Monroe. The film examines her entire life, including the tragic 1967 car crash that took Jayne's life-the crash her children survived in the back seat and that ended her career quest to be a serious actress. If you love the '60s or if you are a part of a blended family in any way (there is a paternity secret revealed), seek this out NOW on HBO/MAX.",False
9,10,Amazing documentary,imdbfan-495733,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never leave reviews, but this doc was amazing. This documentary flowed so well from beginning to end. The interviews with her family really added depth and dimension to who Jayne was behind the scenes and it was fun to see Mariska's dynamics with them. The story and history in general, was interesting and so personal.I lost my parent as a kid as well, and this got me in my feels. There's so much you really do forget overtime, or in Mariska's case don't remember at all. I'm happy she decided to make this doc and share her journey on this, and damn did she kill it. This is honestly her best work yet.",False
10,n/a,An amazing story... so movingly told,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mariska Hargitay's documentary about her mother, screen legend Jayne Mansfield, is probably the most poignant movie of this genre I've ever seen.Though Jayne died when Mariska was only three years old, and she has no real memories of her, the familial connection adds to the almost mystery story of searching for the truth about the icon to produce many unbearably tearful moments for the viewer.A great secret, untold for decades is revealed here, but Mariska structures the film so that that secret does not dominate. Instead, with the aid of her siblings she opens up a hidden treasure trove of powerful connections. Ken Burns couldn't have done a better job, and the personal nature of the subject matter adds immeasurably to the power of this work.Thank you Mariska, for sharing your family's life and Jayne's lifeforce with us.",False
11,7,Jayne Mansfield - Piece of Her Heart,akoaytao1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"My Mom Jayne is more about Mariska just trying to piece the last moments of her mom - practically from the birth of her eldest siblings towards the fatal end AND her life discovering more about her true self.This reminds me of that HBO Pam Doc. It is just full of love and admiration. Mansfield is quite a complicated character AND together with her tightly wounded history of dalliances - there is a sense of apprehension that really surrounds her with her children.The now full grown kids of Mansfield and the remaining people who knows her tries to remember the good times but there is a sense of complication about her that permeates in the screen. They really try their hardest to define the good in her.Compared to Pam's Doc, It is not as in-depth. It seems like most of Mansfield's story will be hidden away in history. Little is left of Mansfield in writing (or from her words) - as much of her ""belongings"" apparently was sold. So a larger of definite fact of the film actually focuses on the infamous car accident and Mariska's actual paternal parentage (?). Most of the nitty gritty details are shied away until that end section AND it never really go into full details on why and how things came to be.Its picked to strays far away from the salacious life of Mansfield and mostly covers her difficulty as female star stuck with the last end of the stick of the 'dumb blonde' 50s stereotype AND the changing tides that happened when 60s rolled in AND the more liberal politics of the era. I respect the decision to tell it this way but it leaves you empty after watching it. There are more questions left unturned.Recommended. A bit surface level but a good doc.",False
12,10,Fascinating insight to an Hollywood icon,NielsPSolberg_4,n/a,16/08/2025,"An absolute fantastic documentary about one of 1950's Hollywoods icon, Jayne Mansfield, her Incredible children and family. As an film historian and with great interest in many years for Jayne Mansfield this was an powerful watch. In many ways emotional draining, but the ending was so uplifting and gave the career and life of Jayne Mansfield a new dimension.The 1950's Hollywood was coming to an end when Mansfield plunged into the business. But she was a woman ahead of her times. She managed her film career as a single mother in Hollywood, conquered Broadway and went back to Hollywood a star. To say Mansfield tried to copy Monroe is only true in the sense that she created a Monroe like character for her role as Rita Marlow on Broadway in «Will success spoil Rock Hunter?». A character she created so brilliantly that Hollywood and 20th Century Fox wanted more of just that. Jayne Mansfield was the ultimate comedienne and should have been given much more credit for her talents and drive to make it in show business. Her films were few, some Incredible entertaining and the later ones that were exploitive to her sex-symbol image were not worthy her talents, but they were never boring to watch because Jayne Mansfield loved her work and did it 100%. She was inventive, gave the audience what they came to see. The fans kept loyal and were always appreciated by Jayne. She was after all an entertainer with a great personality, sense of humor and love for people from all walks of life. But the entertainment business is a tough life to survive, constantly changing, new challenges few for icons stuck in the image they had portrayed for years. Jayne Mansfield died young and left stories untold for those close to her, her children and the man who stayed lovingly loyal to her no matter how challenged he was.Mariska Hargitay manages to create an documentary about her mother that takes us on an amazing journey. A story with twists and turns, frankly and honestly told. The family had kept silent in public about Jayne for years. Sensing to us on the outside that the traffic accident that caused their mothers death, which also involved three of the children, was a traumatic emotional experience difficult to talk about. Mariska was also distancing herself from her mothers famous cartoon type ultimate dumb blonde character from «The girl cant help it». The iconic film role that kept her mothers image alive for years as she herself was becoming an serious actress. Half truth books written about Mansfield made notorious stories of her life with titles like «Hollywood Babylon», «The tragic life....» etc. The downfall of a former movie star kept the books coming and casting a mysterious veil of whom Mansfield really was.The merits of «My mom Jayne» is the human compassion the entire family comes to term with when talking of their mother. Jayne Mansfield love for her children lived on and made an impression that strenghten them to survive the aftermath of loosing her. It was a great gift for all of us that has been fans of Jayne that the family shared such great personal insight to a fascinating but difficult story. Mariska Hargitay and her family has given her mother the greatest gift of all, a loving portrait to better understand the story behind her life. Is not an easy story, but by facing it honestly and brave they learned that the gift of love from their mother was eternal years after she was gone.After so many years, now looking back, one can only be amazed by Jayne Mansfield. Her talent and incredible energy to combine her busy Hollywood career and raising a family. She stood her ground in a man oriented business while trailblazing around the world doing night club acts and entertaing soldiers in war. A merit she deserves much praise for. When the Hollywood studioes were coming to an end of their «Golden age» Mansfield went independent like many of her contemporaries, and extended her film career in Europe. Jayne Mansfield was ahead of her times and managed to become an icon still entertaining us with her movies, music and thousands of glamorous publicity photos. None like her since.",False
13,7,VIEWS ON FILM review of My Mom Jayne,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJayne Mansfield died in a car accident circa 1967 in ""The City that Care Forgot"" (New Orleans, LA). But she is remembered as a bombshell Hollywood legend, appearing in over two dozen films and getting her Star on the Walk of Fame. 2025's My Mom Jayne is about the closed book of Mansfield, with heeded direction by her daughter and distribution by the always docu reliable, HBO. ""The public pays to see me a certain way"". Yeah they do Jayne, or should I say did.So yeah, I've never viewed a Jayne Mansfield flick but I've taken in plenty of her youngest offspring killing it on the TV show Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (that would be Mariska Hargitay). Hargitay, well she helms ""Jayne"" in an intimate, sort of experiential way, interspersing archives with present-day revelations and interviews from her siblings about their siren momma who only lived to be a young 34-years-old.My Mom Jayne, yeah it shows Mariska to be a rookie born filmmaker when you look at its continuity determinants, its streamlined look, its camera that's always peeking in, and its ability to have Vera Jayne Palmer be a haunting, wistful presence long after her sudden demise.It's only in the last twenty minutes or so that the pic loses its focused footing, exposing the forked, Mansfield family tree the same way Natasha Gregson Wagner did with her nurturer in 2020's Natalie Wood: What Remains Behind (paging Dr. Povich, Dr. Povich). I mean think of your momma bear as a celebration of life Mariska, not some mild, personal resentment brought on by your tough-nosed, Olivia Benson persona.Overall ""Jayne"" is a solid piece of dewy-eyed commemoration, an evocative documentary that tries its darndest to veer away from the throes of vainglory and one's own exorcising of brood demons. Alpha ""mom"".",True
14,10,Guts and Honesty.,susanmnorth,n/a,16/08/2025,"From shame to love. Bravo Mariska Hargitay and your siblings for giving us the gift of your hearts and souls as you share not only Jayne's story but the depth of how her choices and life impacted you. It's rare to be exposed to this kind of raw honesty. To see the footage and photos of all of you was deeply moving. Tanks also to your stepmom, your biological father and his daughters (your half sisters). That scene when your biological dad says he wished something (I won't spoil it for others) and his daughters response - that will be with me forever. Not for 'what' was said, but for the pure joy and laughter you all shared together. Thank you for this remarkable gift.",False

I gained significant insights into your family, its complexity, and the love shared by your mother and father(s). The bond among your siblings was profoundly moving.Prior to watching, I had limited knowledge of you or your mother. However, as an avid viewer of documentaries, my curiosity led me to explore further. The emotions expressed were deeply felt.Your mother exhibited remarkable strength and determination. It is understandable that she sought a father figure after the loss of her own, which must have been incredibly traumatic. It is astonishing that both of you experienced the loss of a parent at the same age, both due to automobile accidents in each other's presence.The revelation that all of you children were in the vehicle during the accident was devastating. It is miraculous that you all survived. It was heart-wrenching to hear about your entrapment. Your brother's concern for you when voicing your absence in the rescue car was extraordinary.Your biological father's consideration in not disrupting your life after your mother's passing was genuinely touching, emphasizing your wellbeing. Mickey similarly prioritized your well-being.One point of curiosity was your exclusion from the European summer trips with your siblings and father. Initially, this is understandable, but I wondered why it remained unchanged afterward. Based on the documentary, his interactions with you did not reflect any form of division.Thank you, Mariska, for sharing this documentary with the world. Your siblings are exceptional individuals. It was delightful to observe their affection for you. The humor shared by your sister regarding your biological father being 89 and soon able to apologize to your dad was relatable.Moreover, it was pleasing to see the piano in your possession. Thank you for sharing your life story; it was truly beautiful.",True
16,8,Very moving portrait of lifelong heartache,generic230-1,n/a,16/08/2025,It's not showy or glitzy or particularly dramatic despite the surprising revelations in this documentary. It's quiet and thoughtful. The siblings are kind and have deep affection for each other.They were all different ages so each story they tell is different. But the message is the same: they were loved and they loved their mother.We learn what we always learn about young women in show business. They're told their only value is as a sex symbol. It brings them fame and fortune but not respect. And their struggle to break free from the false front that pays the bills always ends in tragedy.,False
17,10,Outstanding Documentary,justscott-89754,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautifully crafted, mesmerizing, and so very moving. I learned so much, not just about Mariska Hargitay but also about Jayne Mansfield. The pain felt by this family was so palpable, especially after learning about the secrets that were kept. Every family has them, some more than others - and I'd imagine the weight of these particular secrets had to be unbearable at times. However, where there's love, there's forgiveness, and where there's strength, there's resilience. I was already a fan of Ms. Hargitay, but her bravery in telling this particular story to the world is compelling and heartfelt.",False
18,10,Will change your perceptions!,MsRachelMo03,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have looked forward to this movie since Mariska hinted at a major project she was working on over a year ago. It did not let me down. I was riveted from beginning to end. All I knew about Jayne Mansfield is she was a B List Marilyn Monroe who died tragically in a horrible car accident. As I became a mega fan of Mariska, I learned all about where she came from, and therefore learned more about Jayne. But, I never knew everything this movie taught us. The story was so beautifully told, and the emotions were authentic. A lot of times, when a celebrity does a documentary, it seems acted, or scripted. You don't always feel like the reactions and emotions are real. This was not like that at all. Being a fan of Mariska, I know when she's really feeling her emotions. Her tears, and her joys, were all real. And her family's emotions were all very real as well. This movie will make you cry, think, laugh, and just really appreciate both Jayne, and her children. It's a must see.",False
19,10,A masterpiece,loml25,n/a,16/08/2025,"""My Mom Jayne"" is truly one of the most beautiful documentaries/movies I've ever seen. Mariska Hargitay tells and unfolds the story of her mother, as well as her own life, masterfully, and every single moment on screen has a purpose. Hargitay has directed before (several episodes of her long-running hit series ""Law and Order: SVU""), and while she has produced a previous documentary (""I Am Evidence""), this is her first time directing a feature. You'd never tell. The vision is there and it's executed beautifully. This movie will make you cry, it will make you angry, it will make you gasp, and it will make you laugh. Also, the relationship between Hargitay and her siblings is gorgeous; you can tell there is so much love there. There's no way you'll walk away from this movie and not think about your own family.",False
20,n/a,Extraordinary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe film is a complete masterpiece. Mariska really went on a hunt to discover her real mother. The archival footage was so meticulously place. The dates. It really told the complete story of Jayne. Jayne was more than a sex symbol. She was an intelligent woman that played violin and piano. She spoke 4 languages. I loved the part when Mariska interviewed her biological father. Nelson did the right thing by not trying to claim Mariska. He did not rip her away from Mickey and her siblings. Mickey did not have any bad blood towards Nelson. Jayne really left Mariska to clean up the mess she made :(,True
21,10,Wow,sdpinsocali,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI wasn't expecting this to move me the it did. For Mariska to share something so deeply personal was so, I don't even know the words to describe it honestly. I was crying like a baby. This was beautifully done. Even if you're not familiar with Mariska or her career, her story is one that will touch your heart. I can't imagine what it would be like for a little girl to grow up in the shadow of someone like Jayne Mansfield. A cultural icon that despite her fame, was a stranger to her youngest child. Listening to Mariska ask her siblings about their memories of their mother because she had none of her own. It was a raw look into a Hollywood story that we thought we knew.",True
22,7,"Good, But Maybe Not For Everyone",Mike_Yike,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am 74 years-old. I just watched My Mom Jayne. I actually remember Jayne Mansfield. My most vivid memory is that of a lunchtime movie shown in the auditorium of my junior high school, a movie that featured Jayne Mansfield. One's appreciation of My Mom Jayne hinges on the viewer's need and/or interest in lineage and family history. I went through something similar to Mariska Hargitay, that is, discovering in adulthood who a parent was. It weighed on me for about a day or two, not long enough to feel the need to make a movie or write a book about it. I figured I am me, the person I've known my whole life and unless my father was a squirrel or Joseph Stalin, it really didn't matter who he was. But if such things do matter to you, or you find them interesting, then My Mom Jayne will appeal to you. It appealed to me to about a 7-star rating, which isn't bad.",False
23,8,Two Journeys Captured in a Daughter's Look Back at a Mother She Didn't Know,EUyeshima,n/a,16/08/2025,"This engaging 2025 documentary is actually two films in one. The first is a more traditional look at the mid-century Hollywood sex goddess Jayne Mansfield, a self-manufactured movie star whose intentionally vacuous persona hid an unexpected intelligence, a strong maternal instinct, and a haunting private life. The perspective is from her daughter Mariska Hargitay, who was just three years old when Mansfield died horrifically in a car accident in 1967. Now a respected actress at 61 and the longtime star of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"", she not only leads her own journey into her past but directs the film as well. Much like her own series, or more accurately, ""Unsolved Mysteries"", the film changes from a search for a long gone mother to a deeper probe into her own identity. The second part of the film switches gears when she discovered in her twenties that Mickey Hargitay was not her biological father. After decades of disassociating herself from her professionally disrespected mother, she had only recently met her real father and his own family, which explains the sense of estrangement felt during the interviews with her siblings. While the result was quite moving, it also felt a tad cursory in the rather expeditious acceptance of this welcome resolution. Clearly there was more to this fascinating journey that could've been shared like the confrontational revelation shared during the interview with Mansfield's press agent.",False

Her acting is of a strong woman and now showing her truth on the screen , shares the whole world we should go deeper in the truth.It is time to look for the truth on the new as other interests shows lies and puts many ones in pain.Tears of joy will come out when you watch this documentary.

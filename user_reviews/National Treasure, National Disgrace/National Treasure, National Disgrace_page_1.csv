1,2,Pathetic attempt at self insert politics.,lucasphillips-18682,n/a,16/08/2025,"TL;DR: Narration is atrocious
Turned it off after 5 minutes. Can't stand a woman whose had an entire career in television and entertainment sitting there trying to shift the blame of why Savile got away with his crimes as "" oh it was a world for men"" completely ignoring the fact she's had a Queen rule the country her entire life. Tell me, what part of the "" world for men"" had them working their fingers to the bone in the mines whilst you sat doing narration for Dr Who? Honestly, the lack of self awareness by these troglodytes is actually astonishing. If you think that Jimmy Saviles abuse of children was because ' the world was for men"" then you have a child's understanding of power which coincidentally, Jimmy Savile would of loved. He got away with the half century of abuse because he had politicians, executives and even the ROYAL FAMILY under his thumb, not because men thought "" oh well shagging a child is just normal"" Honestly, if you're that biased and stupid that you think that Jimmy Savile was jus ignored, you should be kept as far away from this project as possible.",False

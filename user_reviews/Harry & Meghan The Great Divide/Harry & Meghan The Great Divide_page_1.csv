1,1,Poorly produced,reikimaster-49426,n/a,16/08/2025,Overall lacks true quality of development of a theory and certainly doesn't appear to be based on facts. At the end you're confused why this is on air. This picture lacks (among other things) focus and only repeats information over and over for length. Does not mention Harry's tell all book which has stated that his relationship with his brother was never close as a narrator attempts to insist on. It does focus on Oprah's interview which the narrator seems to have a personal issue with as it is said over and over again (because there is no original thought) was devastating to a country completely ignoring the real issues of discrimination that Meghan and Harry were testifying to.,False
2,2,Ginger and Nutmeg make a Mocumentary,mherrity,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched the Great Divide just shortly before the infamous NYC car chase that was so heavily covered by the media in May 2023. I gave this mockermentary a low score because like most I read , its a flasse narrative, its fake. So their faux chase didn't work. I saw a video on IG via a German news agency that bought some footage from BackGrid (the paps Meghan called to be there) and it shows NO chase at all. In fact, it shows exactly what the NYPD said - the SUSSEX team were the ones causing any issues and there was no chase. Their team blocked an entire street with their SUVs parked at a 45 degree angle blocking NYC traffic which is illegal. The cops were called by one of my fellow NYers & they came to tell them to move and out comes one of their team getting in the face of the cops (not a wise move in NYC) trying to tell them some invented drama & the cops aren't buying it & tell them it's illegal to block the street, there was nobody following them & the photographers Meghan called were on the sidewalk filming it. Nobody was paying attention to them, nobody cared, nobody followed them. It was THEM that created the drama & tried to spin a false narrative to say they're in danger or being stalked so they could try for IPP status where all taxpayers pay for their security. Everyone in NYC knew the story was fake because it's physically & logistically impossible to have a chase in NYC.",False
3,1,A gratuitous public relations effort - They just failed at everything,teewilly-00347,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was very disappointed at the speakers in it as all they did was try to explain the Harry and Meghan saga as some sort of ""misunderstanding."" Harry and Meghan left the UK for dubious and self serving reasons.The queen reportedly thought they were both balmy for requesting to be part-time royals at all. This is likely because they would lose whatever security they had in the UK and abroad, for essentially nothing. They thought they could do speaking engagements, start a nonprofit foundation and create media projects. The problem is that they lacked the necessary skills to be able to pull it off. There is also the issue of lying in the Oprah interview and their docuseries regarding the events in the UK.H & M finally arrived in America and tried to tell others what to do, what to think and how to live. They spoke without reason or authority and were roasted in both the UK and American press for it. This doc is a thinly veiled propaganda piece about the role race played in their exit and how Meghan's opinions were of controversy when they were not.An excellent example is her word salad speech regarding women losing jobs during the pandemic. How a pep talk from the participants in 40 x 40 would reopen a business that closed because it was effected by Covid is anyone's guess.They didn't possess knowledge of the things they deign to speak about, lied about the actions of others but still expect someone to believe it was a misunderstanding not bad actions that lead to the family rift. Two huge thumbs down for this tone-deaf effort to whitewash bad acts.",True
4,2,Dreadful Attempt at Propaganda,luluflannery,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't waste your time. Life is too short to watch this dishonest and poorly researched drivel.Seems to ignore any real events, facts, and opinions. Goes on and on about how hard things were for H&M and how badly they've been treated, without any useful facts or reflections on actual events.I can only imagine someone well known to the Harkles, rather like Scobie, has put this together. And we've seen how much he waffles, and tells blatant lies.There's no balanced reporting, or any decent reporting at all. Just a bunch of people telling a get vague narrative, trying to persuade you that Harry & Meghan are amazing, and the world, has been constantly and unrelentingly mean to them.In summary, it was highly cringeworthy, and yet another whiney, poor victim version of their 'truth'.Dreadful.",False

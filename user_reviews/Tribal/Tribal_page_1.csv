1,10,Great perspective of what our vets are going through,forgiven1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a meticulously crafted and intellectually stimulating portrayal of the psychological and physical challenges encountered by our courageous soldiers who valiantly fight to preserve our freedom. It offers a candid and unflinching depiction of the sacrifices they make and the profound impact their service has on their lives.The cessation of hostilities does not signify the end of their struggles. While numerous documentaries have shed light on their experiences during deployment, this film uniquely focuses on their challenges upon returning home.Regrettably, it appears that we collectively neglect these individuals once they return to civilian life. As a nation, we must enhance our efforts to facilitate their successful reintegration into society. These men and women deserve our unwavering love, appreciation, and recognition that their lives retain value and purpose.This film poignantly illustrates the enduring memories that haunt these individuals.I strongly recommend this film to all individuals. It serves as a powerful and essential reminder of the immense gratitude we owe to those who selflessly serve our country.Our sincere appreciation goes to the individuals who selflessly invested their personal resources to bring this film to fruition. Its acquisition is a worthwhile investment.I unreservedly bestow upon this film the highest possible rating.",False
2,10,"A powerful, life changing experience",ryanelmiger,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect. Right out of the gate, hearing stories from combat veterans, their experiences on the battlefield, the unwavering brotherhood bond, and heartfelt (at times crushing) struggles upon returning home. A film that everyone should watch before they go to the ballot box. These people need our support, our lifelong commitment to help them integrate back into civilian life. These people are why we have our freedoms today. These people are true heroes.Watch it, you won't regret it. And don't just watch...use this as motivation to make a difference in their lives, as they have done for YOU and OUR COUNTRY.",False
3,10,If you were there - but more important if you were not!,dwnybktz,n/a,16/08/2025,If you were not there this will show you the true cost of war. Freedom is not free. What an amazing and high quality film. America loves its veterans and this documentary will only strengthen that love and bond. This film makes clear the burden we have as a nation to do all for those warriors that come home and struggle.Our warriors cannot walk off the plane onto American soil and just turn off the switch. Some of them need more support from all of us and our state and national systems. This film shows all of us the pain and hurt some of our warfighters carry when they return.Congratulations to Mark Kershaw and the heroes that told their stories. A must watch for every American!,False
4,10,Can't get enough awareness of veteran mental health challenges,geoff-773-955251,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was deeply moved by the three stories told by these brave men who sacrificed so much for our country. Each story is remarkable in its own way. The courage, bravery, horror, and pain is hard to imagine. I thank the producer, Mark Kershaw, for his part in making this film. We need more awareness of these PTSD issues with our veterans. As discussed in the film, our military is really good at training our soldiers how to kill, but not so good at integrating them back into a non-wartime society. The demons they bring home with them don't sleep, don't rest, don't stop. They wait until the soldier is alone, isolated, depressed. It's not a fair fight. We need to help these warriors. Spread the word!",False
5,10,A Must See!,lb-81168,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely love watching documentaries & this one did not disappoint. If you haven't seen it yet, then you're missing out! Amazing!This documentary features 3 United States Veterans and gives each one a chance to tell their own stories in their own words.It's captivating, intense, and awe inspiring.To hear what these vets have gone through and how they have overcome such difficult obstacles is just, WOW!This is definitely a must see!We need more vets talking openly about their experiences without judgment or shame. Talking gets you through it and gets you the support you need. Everyone should have someone to talk to. More communication, less veteran suicides!",False
6,10,Simply heartfelt and awareness to war and what you come home with.,lapki-44572,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this movie last night, and it's one of the best I've seen in awhile. The bravery of the men, that tells a personal story of their own that changed the course of their lives, is truly amazing. I suggest everyone should see it. It brings you to a place as if you were right next to them in combat. It also teaches us that no matter how strong and brave they are physically, they are still people that gives their own lives so we may walk free. It brings attention to how these soldiers come home and don't get the help they need. We all MUST pay attention to them, and help where we can. As in PTSD.",False
7,10,2 Thumbs Up!!,ryan-35725,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you, Mark Kershaw!! What a powerful way to bring more awareness to what Combat Warriors face daily with PTSD. Combat veterans normally hide away their war time experiences. It's not easy to share these experiences with civilians, even including our closest relatives, due to the lack of personal ability to relate without the experience. Sustaining daily fears from the insanity of battles have created permanent scars that will last us a lifetime. The torn-up emotions of warriors, the lifelong imprint left upon us not just by the cataclysm of war but by the relationship with our fellow warriors - the loyalty and love, the complex code of liberation and guilt at having survived our combat tours. Knowing this, we must create a safe community for our combat veterans! If you're a Combat Veteran, I ask that you share this documentary with your community and provide your honest feedback in a review. I personally appreciate all of your support in advance!""Our Stories Shall Never Go Untold""

8,10,It's the most honest documentary I've ever viewed.,philwilliams-26352,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tribal details the story of three combat veterans and their experiences during and after their military service. Their portrayal of danger, loss, and sacrifice hooked me immediately. The stories are well-told and the editing and cinematography is excellent, but it's the second half of the film that delivers the gut punch.These men talk about what is forbidden. Culturally forbidden. Forbidden by the media. Forbidden by their own tribe. Each day veterans struggle with mental health, and their suicide rate is far above the general public. This documentary and these men courageously shine a light on a problem that nobody wants to touch with a ten-foot-pole.It's the most honest documentary I've ever viewed.",False
9,10,Truly one of the best military movies I've seen!,joeswaney,n/a,16/08/2025,"I served four years in the United States Army, and I've seen a lot of military movies/documentaries that are aimed at Veteran suicide prevention, and this is by far one of the best I've seen.I'm actually really close friends with Gomez and he has been there for me more times than I deserve. I was one of those Veterans that got out of the military and did very well for myself financially, until one day I lost it all. I had a problem with alcohol and after losing my 2 1/2 month old daughter in 2022, I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I've called the suicide hotline for Veterans where I literally got pretty much downgraded by the person on the other end of the phone for even considering that outcome, not want any Veteran wants to hear when they are in that position.This movie literally opened my eyes to the thought of a support system when the VA isn't there how we need them to be. I hope this is one of many movies produced by you guys and I hope this somehow turns into a series where it is a new set of Veterans each time. So many people out there like these guys, just waiting to tell their story!",False

11,10,Relevance,ntttesun,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think that this is a very unique documentary, I can think of only one other documentary I've seen that tackle some of the more difficult topics of discussion, i.e. The suicide epidemic involving veterans from GWOT.I thought this was very well made and enjoyed actually hearing from the people who actually experienced combat first hand. There's enough Hollywood ""hero glory"" propaganda bs from the celebrities. Americans need to see the reality of the consequences of sending Americans to war. I hope more people take the time to listen to the stories in this film because it's very relevant to what's going on right now with most Military branches failing to meet their numbers.",False
12,10,Must see / must share!,darylseenath,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you haven't seen this then go see it. It's so worth it. It's available on Vudu, Prime Video, Apple+ and I believe a few others. Multiple touching stories that many can relate to! Simple, effective and straight to the point. Share it. It may save a life! The people being interviewed are speaking from real world and first hand experiences. Not only does these men need to be recognized for the hero's they are for what they have done in the past, but they also need to be recognized for the hero's they are for fighting forward for their brothers and sisters in arms. Look up the definition for ""Hero"" and all these men will have that meaning besides their name. Share it. It may save a life!",False
13,10,"Powerful, Truthful stories, a movement to be heard.",goneforlong,n/a,16/08/2025,"I attended a showing in Washington DC of this documentary. 3 powerful stories, put together by an Army Veteran who was sick of having veterans fall to suicide. There is only truth in this documentary, no Hollywood fluff. Raw stories, feelings, memories, hurt, pain. And the message is clear, we lose too many to veteran suicide. Support the film, the messages, the courage for these veterans to tell their stories like they have here. It's not easy talking, it's even harder to put it out for the world to see. Don't skip this movie, give it a purchase, give it some credit, give it the views and reviews it deserves.",False
14,10,True testimonies,jayhernandez-17080,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's always an honor to be represented in the most respectable way possible. Not how most films romanticize combat or being in an actual conflict, but to hear a true testimonies of how the modern day warrior processes their trials and their ability to overcome. I've been anticipating this film and I am pleased with it's outcome and the effort that was put into it's production. This is truly a Great film. May many more true accounts be recognized, and may the value in the lessons that we learn from these experiences stretch into the future for our warriors to come. I'm proud of you Wade, FREAKEN good job! Sempre Fidelis.",False
15,10,Tribal is a Must See,michaeljoeblair,n/a,16/08/2025,"An impressive documentary made and funded by Army veteran Mark Kershaw. The film tells the true stories of three combat veterans and their transitions to civilian life. This is a must see film for everyone, not just the veteran community. The film does an excellent job capturing the complexity surrounding veteran mental health. The story tellers demonstrate an enormous amount of sincerity, vulnerability, and bravery opening up on screen in a way that stays with you much longer than most films. Kershaw and team should be extremely proud of their contribution to the mission of ending veteran suicide. Help spread the word of this important film!",False
16,10,Unbelievable Film,hsoghigian,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was one of the most unbelievable and eye-opening documentaries I have ever seen in my life. It takes you through the aspects of war that most people don't see or even understand, which is the aftermath of war, what our soldiers go through when they come home and the struggles that they face when they return back to normal life. Some people can't relate, because they may not have friends or family members that served in the military. This documentary will show you the reality and the truth of what it is actually like. In 2007 I lost a close family friend to suicide after he returned back from his tour in Iraq. He was discharged after his vehicle was hit by an IED and was badly injured. He was never the same after and struggled with coping back to reality. This documentary really hit home for me and my brother. I highly recommend this documentary to anyone and everyone.",False
17,10,Truly Remarkable,mcguirebennett,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a fantastic documentary that sheds light on the PTSD fight of the post-9/11 veterans. In a war where everyone volunteers, the fight does not stop when they come home. Tribal is a must-watch! Having served under the leadership of Omar Hernandez and Mark Kershaw, the documentary made me come to grips with leaving the military myself; when you see your former leaders and fellow warfighters suffering alone, it's hard not to think about the more simple times.It's hard to explain what happens in combat. The four men highlighted in this documentary bring it to light. They say the quite part out load, which is the hardest part of all. Could not recommend this documentary enough.",False
18,10,Amazing Film Shedding Light on ALL Veteran Related Issues,scbrjq,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was by far one of the better documentaries about war and the struggles Veterans go through post separation. This film really hit home because it not only shows the perspectives of combat, but even dealing with going back to ""normal"" or ""civilian"" life which is the hardest issue Veterans go through, combat related or not.If you are a veteran yourself or know someone who is, I would highly encourage you to reach out and check in on them. You never know how much impact just a call or text could have with someone dealing with trauma. The hardest part for us is asking for help and just because on the surface everything looks ok, the real battle is fought internally.",False
19,10,Great perspectives of the veteran struggle,wadejspann,n/a,16/08/2025,An impactful film regarding the trials of veterans coming home from combat. This movie brought me to tears to watch these veterans struggle to find meaning from the horrors of war. The director did a fantastic job getting the audiences attention. Omar's story showed the meaning of sacrifice and the lengths these veterans go to show loyalty to those who fight beside them regardless of nationality. More friends of veterans and family members could benefit from watching this film. The raw emotions shown by all three was evident in this film. For those who have borne the brunt of the fighting these veterans have been impressive since serve. Thai should be a required viewing for active duty transitioning out of service.,False

21,10,Eye-opening masterpiece,rymullaney,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredibly well done documentary. Mark Kershaw and team demonstrated the strength and grit of three men by sharing their experiences in Afghanistan. Those same men shared their battle with PTSD and the assimilation back into civilian life. The things endured by these men were nothing short of miraculous.This documentary certainly provides an immediate perspective of the trials faced by the soldiers that leave home to protect us.

23,10,Powerful stories and powerful messages,adambouffard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have a lot of friends who are veterans and it's tough watching them deal with the effects of returning to civilian life. I thought this film did a great job capturing powerful stories, powerful reflections, and most importantly powerful feelings that those like me who have never done it will never understand. Everyone should view this movie to gain a true perspective on the sacrifices that are made and a window into what it's like to still be affected by those sacrifices.

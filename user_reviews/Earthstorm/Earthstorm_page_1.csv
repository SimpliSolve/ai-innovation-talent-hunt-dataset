1,7,Mother Nature at her Scary Finest.,destiny_west,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI binged watched this four part series in one day. I was absolutely mesmerized.Each episode tackles on of Mother Nature's weapons.Tornados, Volcanos, Earthquakes and Hurricanes.Each episode shows real footage from storm chasers and journalists who put themselves in harms way to document Mother Nature in her full force.Each episode was extremely informative and I discovered things that I did not know.Having experienced a category 5 cyclone ( hurricane) I could relate to how terrifying the weather can be. Thankfully I was living in an area where housing is built to with stand these forces.For the life of me I can not imagine why people would choose to live in locations that are ticking time bombs. They are stronger than what I am. I would be living on my nerves at all times.Credit goes to the survivors of these natural disasters and the people that get out there and film the incidents. This is another great series on Netflix.Definitely worth the watch.",True
2,7,Incredible Natural Disaster Footage,jarmste2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Each episode literally made my jaw drop a few times with various disaster footage. I only wish they could cover more stories and occurrences. I'd watch an entire season just on tornadoes, hurricanes, volcanos, earthquakes, etc.Love the narrator's voice and the balance of education and entertainment.With anything nature related these days, of course there are a lot of mentions of ""climate change"" and it comes off a bit ""doomy"" at times, but I still thought it was worth the watch. It'd be nice to just examine Mother Nature without always going off on how it's OUR fault when these events have been occurring for thousands, if not millions of years.",False
3,8,The Earth is Alive and Terrifying,terrelldavidc,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAmazing how small we really are on Earth. Great photography and good at getting recent documentation of geological phenomena... except for the last installment, hurricane. That might have been the best of the 4 episodes if it focused on more than one hurricane. Volcano was the most mesmerizing to me. Very nice to learn Massaya produces more CO2 in 1 week than all the cars in the US combined in 1 year. Exacerbate that and you can see Earth's atmosphere is changing dramatically, along with the landscape, with or without human involvement. Some of the other figures on increase in devastating events should be noted. A figure of more expensive damage from major events continues to rise... no kidding... everything becomes more expensive over time. That's my only negative comments. Overall I'd say a must watch for aficionados of Earth Science.",True
4,9,Hurricane episode review: very informative and attention-grabbing.,kateverity-46727,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEarthstorm is a docuseries produced by Netflix. It has four episodes that each focus on a different natural disaster that took place: tornadoes, volcanoes, earthquakes, and hurricanes, respectively. The fourth episode, titled ""Hurricane,"" focuses on Hurricane Ida.In 2021, Hurricane Ida struck Houma, Louisiana, a town fifty miles southwest of New Orleans. It hit as a Category Four storm on August 29, 2021- fifteen years to the day after Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc on New Orleans and devastated much of Louisiana.This forty-three-minute episode gave us several different perspectives of people impacted by Ida. One of the main storylines was that of Gabe Cox and Jeff Magnum. Cox and Magnum are ""storm chasers"" in a sense, but they consider themselves to be more like ""storm journalists."" They do not measure any of the storms or utilize any meteorology equipment. Rather, they simply collect media- photos, videos, and audio- in order to properly give their audience an idea of what the storm is like.The episode also included interviews and clips of press conferences from New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell. This was a very touching inclusion because it showed the emotions and impacts left behind by Hurricane Katrina. Part of the reason that Katrina resulted in so many fatalities was because of the mandatory evacuation that was put in place. It was called the day before the hurricane made landfall, and many people were sitting ducks on interstates when they would have been safer in their homes. Cantrell said that New Orleans would require at least 72 hours to safely and successfully implement a mandatory evacuation. They did not have that kind of time with Katrina, and they would not have it with Ida either. Rather than try and force the evacuation anyways, Cantrell ordered the residents of New Orleans to shelter in place. Naturally, some people would still try and leave the city, but this would help minimize interstate congestion and hopefully lower the likelihood of great fatalities.""Hurricane"" also did a great job of being educational and informative. For one, it explained how hurricanes are made. It used graphics to show that warm ocean water weighs less than cold ocean water, so it rises. Wind helps whip it up into a rotating vacuum, which creates the main structure of the hurricane. It also explains how warm water strengthens hurricanes, and used this as a good lead in to talk about climate change.Climate change is a very important topic to discuss when making a documentary episode about a very powerful hurricane such as Ida. It explains that hurricanes are not increasing in frequency as a whole, but that the number of powerful category four and five storms is what has been increasing. It also explained that in the last three decades, the number of category four and five hurricanes has almost doubled, which to a viewer like me, is a clear indication that something in the climate is amiss. It also used Ida to explain how these strong storms are able to push further inland, but cities far from the southeastern coast are not built to withstand hurricanes. Ida pushed all the way through New York City before it truly dissipated. Although it was not nearly as lethal to the Big Apple as Hurricane Sandy was in 2012, it still flooded the subway system. It was actually the largest amount of rainfall in one hour that NYC had ever recorded.All in all, this was a very well-rounded and informative documentary. It held my attention the whole time without losing my interest, but it also proved to be incredibly informative and up to date on its climate change information. There are so many interesting facts and statistics that it gave that I cannot even include in this review. I highly recommend watching it.",True
5,10,"Spectacular, Jaw-dropping and Informative",alkinamerica,n/a,16/08/2025,"The calming voice of the narrator underscores the devastation that each natural disaster causes on this planet. This show makes you feel so insignificant and helpless on this tiny planet. Some of them - volcanos for example, are so beautiful and breathtaking but so scary to watch too.It's also extremely informative, and watching the geologists and scientists show you the history of these events and also how we can maybe protect ourselves and/or possibly slow down some of these events (climate change/global warming) is so interesting AND necessary to watch.This is such an amazing show and an absolute must watch.",False
6,9,Disasters Shape Our World,nqmedia,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you've ever wanted to learn about natural disasters then this is the documentary series for you. Each episode focuses on a different natural disaster and goes all over the world documenting tons of real world events. There is also tons of archival footage as well as the series tries to show how our world was crafted and changed by natural disasters. This is a very good educational series. From volcanoes to tsunamis each episode delves into a different natural disaster and how they impact the environment and the people. Tragedy and devastation, but there are also good elements as well. The series in only 4 episodes only scratches the surface.",False
7,4,Classic lightweight Netflix documentary,pbwtswnn,n/a,16/08/2025,"The power of the experiences of people who lived through the events is diluted by the tedious and over dramatic stories of storm chasers and the like. It's light on information and science and heavy on meandering and contrived storytelling. Its laden with earnest voices and a ploddingly doom-laden soundtrack that leaves you thinking that the only point of this is some kind of voyeuristic peep show on all the ways the earth can kill people. There's a huge reliance on impressive footage but precious little explanation of anything except 'wow, this was astonishingly awful'. It's classic Netflix fare when it comes to factual programming, simply not worth the time to watch.",False
8,5,Disappointed they couldn't work in a climate change angle for Volcanos and Earthquakes,mojotre,n/a,16/08/2025,"Volcano was perhaps the best in a toss-up with Earthquake (bolstered by tsunamis). Admittedly they have little to do with storms but they were required because Tornado and Hurricane left a lot to be desired. When I began watching this I wanted to learn more about tornadoes (I did) but it seems there is a lot left out that would be interesting. The series ends on hurricanes, which I expected because it is the one we should have the most information about, therefore the most interesting. It wasn't.Volcano was enjoyable and informative *spoiler* we are all going to die in a few hundred thousand years. Earthquake was similar to Volcano but I live nowhere I am too concerned. Tornado is a rehash of what we know but still worth the watch. It has been done better before. Hurricane should have been called Climate Change (why not? Volcanoes and Earthquakes are not storms) because they pointed to it at every opportunity. I will admit, the Climate Change angle was not as in your face until the last episode. If I rated each episode it would be 7/6/5/3.",False
9,3,Disaster documentary with a pinch of propaganda,stormcleanest,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI haven't watched more than an hour of television since 2019 because everything is one or more types of propaganda now. My husband and I used to love going to the movies and watching Netflix together every night after dinner. I'm sad we can't bond this way any longer. My husband seen this and thought I'd like it since I enjoy following all the storm chasers on YouTube. I really enjoyed most of the first episode until the narrative changed to the modern day ""narrative"" if you know what I mean. Climate Change is most likely a part of the natural cycle on earth. It's known that the most deadly tornado in modern history happened in the early 1900's. Of the 10 most destructive and deadly tornado's, only one has occured in the 21st century. The living creatures of North America have survived tornadoes for *at least* hundreds of years. There is no evidence that tornadoes are happening more frequently. This movie was filmed beautifully, but I recommend getting your tornado fix on YouTube or other social media if you prefer to watch without the propaganda.",True
10,4,Pushing climate change,Michele7169,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWatching natural storms was interesting and actually incredible. Watching people survive and through these disasters was incredible. I am just disappointed this series pushed climate change on the watcher not telling the truth that for instance 1914 was one of strongest hurricanes ever.. they claimed hurricanes are stronger now because of "" climate change "" it's a lie and leftist push.. like EVERYTHING we watch now. Annoying. Again.. seeing the disasters ( natural) was very fascinating.. humans are incredible. The will to survive is incredible.. just tell those stories please.. leave ideology out!!!",True
11,1,It is not staying truth.. why??,ardnael,n/a,16/08/2025,"I made it almost through the first episode when they boldly stated Kentucky NEVER gets tornadoes. As someone who has lived there and has family and friends there, tornadoes are VERY common. Severe tornadoes such as the one in eastern Ky they are talking about is completely NORMAL. Saying there's never tornadoes there and implying this was a rare instance is a total fabrication to hype up a political agenda. Super disappointing that they didn't stick with facts. Lost all interest that anything is the truth. Fabricated documentary. Should have talked about the one in Tennessee a few years prior. They are much less prone to tornadoes than Kentucky.",False

1,7,This Is What A Real 'COLD WAR' is! Brave Men Let Down By A Megolamaniac And His Cowardly High Ranking Advisors,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very well made documentary of the fate of more German soldiers fighting in a living hell situation and, stabbed in the back by Hitler and his military cowardly advisors. We all know that they should never have been there but these men were abandoned - like the men at Stalingrad - and but for their Kriegsmarine (the German Navy) many thousands more would have died in a pointless campaign. Its ideal for those wanting insight into WW2 historical facts (I abhor war but I think I have seen just about everything that tells of events, battles and all the important factors etc, etc) but, unfortunately the whole story of the fate of the German soldiers is not told.Russia won this fight only by the sheer numbers fact. Their gutless leader, STALIN, made men and boys forcefully fight, or be shot as traitors if they refused. Thus millions of untrained males were put in the front battle-lines - many without weapons until another soldier died and they took his rifle etc and died in huge numbers as a result. The human tragedy did not end there however! Over 3,060,000 German soldiers ended up as Russian prisoners, and were sent back to Russia to work in slave labour camps. They were beaten and maltreated etc by low life (as it was back in 1945 etc) Russian guards - who were no more than animal like vicious peasant thugs; killing many German 'POW' prisoners as payback!According to Soviet records 381,067 German Wehrmacht POWs died in NKVD camps (356,700 German nationals and 24,367 from other nations)
Some post war information will tell you that but it well suspected that they were lying as, 700,000 German soldiers were listed as MIA (missing in action). It is said of the 35,000 plus soldiers taken prisoner at Stalingrad, only 5,000 ever saw their homeland of Germany again.The saddest part of this life info is that humanity just ignores all the horror of past wars and keeps creating new ones...and all out of utter GREED!",False
2,8,well seamed together,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"For the novise on 2nd world war history, this documentary about the german leningrad front, the northwest front, gives a comprehensine insight and look at warfare at its worst, military and humanly speaking. its also the tale of the russian defence failure in the start, and how patriotism to save mother russia overturned the german aggresion till the leningrad siege ended april 1944. ihave seen loads of visual archive material over the years and some used here are commonly used. but there are some uniqe passages of new found material so its well worth a look even for the wellinformed historian. its a recommend from the grumpy old man",False

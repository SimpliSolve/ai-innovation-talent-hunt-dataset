Joaquín Gutiérrez Acha directs a very good documentary providing a spectacular trip to the beautiful region of Southwest Spain , a real natural paradise . An environment full of trees , wildlife and some canyons. The Dehesa is a type of Mediterranean forest ideal for pastures for intensive livestock, it is a unique ecosystem in the world located in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. In the Dehesa we can see two treasures of our nature, the landscapes of olive trees, holm oaks and cork oaks and the most endangered feline in the world, the Iberian lynx , which's really threatened due to its possible extiction.Behind the project is once again the documentary filmmaker Joaquín Gutiérrez Acha, perhaps one of the people who cares the most about his projects, which usually take more than two years to get off the ground, because he spends two springs to get the best images of the area where he is filming. In the Dehesa he shows us wild bulls, otters, rabbits, imperial eagles, Iberian storks and of course the great protagonist, the Iberian lynx. The documentary is very similar to the type of cinema that we are used to seeing, especially on television from the great Felix Rodriguez de la Fuente . Its staging is once again breathtaking , with aerial images recorded with a drone, which shows us the wonders of the terrain and spectacular outdoors . More than 100,000 spectators have gone through the theatrical cinema to see this marvel that reveals to us the range the Dehesas hide. A magical place resulting to be one of the main European places and a last refuge of a large number of animals . A kingdom of forests and animals and where fantasy and reality walk together . The Dehesa is a magical and mysterious place where many of its corners are yet to be discovered ; however , being threatened by pests and global warming .The shots , the frames , are flawless and really impressive . It is the kingdom of the forests, marvellously photographed by cameraman/directorJoaquín Gutiérrez Acha , showing the domain of wild animals , the land where the Iberian Lynx lives, the place where fantasy and reality walk together. A wild territory that is still forgotten and that the world must know .A documentary about a unique type of forest, the ""dehesa"", it is the perfect place to hide a large number of animals and other forms of life that have lived here since time immemorial . We observe a variety of creatures , both large and small , as in this magnificent documentary appearing here and there the following animals : otter, fawns (cervatos) , wildcat, deer with their usual bellowing, ermine (armiño) , genet (Gineta) , dormouse (Lirón Careto), with special mention for Iberian boar that fed on acorns gives rise to the famous Iberian ham .And birds : Birds: black crane (Grulla) , partridge (perdiz) , black stork, jais (arrrendajos) , plover (chover), starling (estornino) , hoopoe, eagle, black vulture , griffon vulture.

And vegetable life with impressive Dehesa forests including trees as cork oak, holm oak. Furthermore , showing up transhumance and how the ranchers shear the sheep . And it is precisely the fabulous animal, the Iberian Lynx , one of which the producers have chosen to conduct this film .The Spanish filmmaker Joaquín Gutiérrez Acha carries out a stunning and brilliant film . With this work, the filmmaker closes a trilogy, which began with ""Guadalquivir"", where he showed us the different species that traveled the river from its source to its mouth . Then came his next project ""Cantábrico""¨ or ¨Cantábrico , the domains of the brown bear¨, it is the territory of one of the most formidable creatures in the northern hemisphere: the Cantabrian brown bear. Joaquin was the complete responsible to shoot this stunning documentary that took two years of filming to complete the movie with a script by Carlos de Hita and music by Victoria de la Vega, which is very well integrated into the development of the story. The film has been recorded in 4K and that is very important today, because it allows us to see details that are otherwise very difficult to see with the human eye. This type of work should be compulsory in all schools, so that students get to know our heritage and our great variety of nature.

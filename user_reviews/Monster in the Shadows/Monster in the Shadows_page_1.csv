1,7,Another White Woman Goes Missing Case,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDon't get me wrong, I care about any child, no matter the color or the family they are born into, but I do get annoyed at the massive amplification when they missing person is a young attractive white female.What about the not so attractive? Young males? Children and women and men of color? They matter too.People whining about the media and ""fake news"" don't realize they have themselves to blame. The media caters to YOU. That's right - YOU! -created the monster.Plus, you can't claim the media got it right when it's want you want to hear and then scream fake news! When it reports what you don't like.The stories about attractive white females sell, because that's what draws your attention, so don't blame the media, take a look in the mirror.If this was a missing child of color, would you care? Would their story be told? And if you admit, probably not, who is to blame as to what and how the media reports crime?The entire family is sketchy. Unfortunately, they fit the stereotype of backwoods criminality and child sexual abuse. The mother is also accused of such. I don't know if she was guilty or not, I actually liked her; however, there was no way she was not aware of the sexual abuse in that family, so that makes her suspect.She withheld information that might have helped early on. The first thing she should have said after one of the relatives killed himself was to tell the police of the incest in that family. She knew and feigned ignorance.She knew her daughter was a sexual assault victim. Why not say that from the jump?She finally said something, but only after her arrest, that she had sex with either him or one of the other pieces of scum and her description matches the child victim who was included in that sexual encounter. I believe she did assault a child.Whether that POS died at his own hands or of another's, he obviously knew and did something and momma hasn't been completely transparent. How was she trying to find her daughter without revealing family secrets?This is generational abuse and she knew it, the entire community knew it. They are disgusting. People on here have their heads in the sand, because these people are white, so instead of being disgusted with them, commenters are complaining about the detective on the case and the media. Neither the detective nor the media did any of this, it's all on that disgusting family and the community that surely know.The victims are the children, not the adults.",True
2,6,Not the best made doco,gallagherkellie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe story is heartbreaking and horrendous!! I can't comprehend how an entire family can be involved. But the actual documentary wasn't the best, it was a bit confusing at times and needed to start at the beginning and explain more. I do feel for the mum and hope she's never been involved in any way.",True
3,10,A jaw-dropping account of a horrific set of events,francisofashdown,n/a,16/08/2025,"As I watched the account unfold over the course of this three-part documentary I was as shocked and astonished as I was disturbed to see and hear the details surrounding Brittany's disappearance.The manipulation of evidence and testimony further complicates the underlying sinister set of occurrences, and this documentary lays bare some very serious questions.My heart goes out to the mother, and the friends and family affected by this heartbreaking tragedy.",False
4,4,"Crazy story, but the production quality is poor.",math-robs,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poorly produced documentary which deserved far better.Disjointed, it feels like its just one big trailer - constantly jumping between scenes, interviews etc.And the same music loop all the way through.",False
5,10,"Gripping, but it made my blood boil",pvcsyxdm,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhere to start- this was intense but gripping. I watch true crime incessantly and rarely does a show catch my attention like this case. As a psychologist, I am struck by the ignorance and naivety of the detective. The one thing I really liked that he acknowledged is the fact that no one wanted to take ownership of the missing person portion of this case. I found Chessie's police interview to be genuine shock and disgust at the thought of sexual contact with a child. The facts provided by the documentary, particularly by the detective, leads me to strongly believe that her brother was also falsely accused. The testimony of the detective absolutely reeked of the confirmation bias- he decided that the brother was guilty so he interpreted the facts to fit his preconceived belief. And if the son was truly 18 when he offended against a minor despite the fact that he was a victim himself from the age of 5 or 6 and already likely had sexual contact with that minor previously when he himself was a minor, it is horrible to think he is labeled a sex offender for life. Regardless of all this, even if Chessie, her brother, and her son are all guilty, the police and the DA had a duty to conduct a thorough investigation into the disappearance of Brittany. The message implied is that if you yourself, a member of the public, go missing, it is only worth finding out what happened to you if you have a ""good"" family that is judged as ""deserving"" of help. What does that say about our system and our society? Brittany deserves to be found and deserves justice, even if she had no friends or family. Let's not judge someone based on the family they were born into. The injustice suffered by this family and especially by Brittany is profound, disgusting, and very disturbing.",True
6,2,This documentary stigmatizes victims,penny-j-adrian,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a survivor of father-daughter sexual abuse, and this documentary perpetuates the lie that victims become perpetrators.The vast majority of CSA victims do NOT go on to become abusers. Also, we don't all ""love"" our abusers as one fool in this documentary stated. One of the happiest days in my life was when my father dropped dead of a cocaine induced heart attack.Victims pretend to love their abusers because we desperately seek acceptance and approval from others. We tell people what they want to hear. In reality, we usually do NOT become abusers and we usually HATE our abusers. But ""nice girls"" don't hate, so we pretend otherwise.",False
7,10,Gripping,spmspmqd,n/a,16/08/2025,This is one of the most gripping documentaries I have seen. Twists and turns throughout and well paced.,False
8,n/a,"Interesting Story, Bad Storytelling, Victims Deserve Better",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"How is it possible for the final broadcast cut of this documentary to have so many grammatical errors?!?!I feel like the victims in this documentary deserve a better storyteller. It feels very disjointed...And the reporter they interviewed should be ashamed of the way he's so entertained by the details of this very serious, sad tragedy. He should really show more respect for the victims and their families.",False
9,5,Could be better,cinmiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMy biggest complaint, which makes me very skeptical of the entire production.... THEY DID NOT MENTION THE BABY POSSIBLY BEING DONNIE'S CHILD!!!!I paused on a frame of one of the letters in episode 2. Someone from prison stated that ""Chessie knew all along that Donnie was the baby's father. And she was pissed that Brittney and Donnie wouldn't cease having sex""
They didn't say anything about where the baby is now.This is such a sad, captivating case. The writing was poor. Like another reviewer stated ""it feels like a trailer"" is spot on. They didn't do a good enough job at starting from the beginning.I would love to see another production take a shot at this story.",True
10,9,Great story,qbertan,n/a,16/08/2025,Great look at the story outside of the media . Shows the lies told by the media and police. #JusticeforBrittney.,False
11,1,Too hard to follow,rizo-30500,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure how to start...the doco is all over the place and very hard to follow. I ave to constantly pause and go online to clarify or get a better explanation, and i had to do that through all the episodes. I think peacock messed it up pointing to more.questions than answers.. First they jump all over the place and never fully go into details. They do not explained how some people were connected except that they were arrasted. I enventully gave up and watch videos about the case on youtube, which i should have done from the get go. Way more info and deph ,peacock did not do us a favour at all..",False
12,10,Breathtaking!!,kimberlyhouseknecht,n/a,16/08/2025,"This three part documentary explains it all. It's the best docuseries I've ever seen. It explains it all. It clears some things and brings light to alot of other details the media and police officers lied about. I feel this documentary will help bring Brittney home. Someone, somewhere knows something!",False
13,5,Viewer discretion is advised!,malinbelle,n/a,16/08/2025,The story behind this documentary is really beyond disturbing and horrible.I would have preferred to see more warnings before watching it.(I watched it on Cmore where they didn't have that much info about the story or warnings which I think they should have had.)Keep this in mind before watching!,False
14,10,Detective is a complete idiot.,rednercaske-00158,n/a,16/08/2025,"The media does not fare much better. Especially this talking head they chose to include? I hope they chose to interview him as an example of what NOT to do. Total scumbag. However, no one is as bad as the detective. How did this green, inept, and barely-out-of-training-wheels ""cop"" get a case of such magnitude? All you need to do is listen to this loser talk for two minutes and you know he's not qualified to manage a Burger King, let alone lead a missing persons investigation. The investigators, media, and social media trolls should feel NOTHING but deep shame and feelings of inadequacy, because they are trash.",False
15,10,I think the police got it wrong!,missdardenjessica,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't believe the mom Chassie or the Uncle Scott had anything to do with Brittney's disappearance. She repeatedly said in the interview I didn't do anything with Donnie. Then the police said she did but where is that footage? And why would the uncle turn them in to have sex with the child so they claimed, that he didn't have legal rights too. I think the police got annoyed with the mother causing too much attention and wanted to take her down. At this point they probably figured everyone had something to do with it. It's just my opinion of what I saw.",False

2,10,This is a real documentary about politics,mentally-backward,n/a,16/08/2025,"All elements of the genre are present, the materials are carefully selected, there are good explanations about corruption schemes, understandable even for a person who is not very familiar with political affairs. The beginning of the film is intriguing, there is also a dramatic climax, the ending is in the author's style. Nevertheless, it should be said that the film is really designed for those who live in Russia, and it will be quite difficult for foreigners to understand what kind of personalities are presented in the materials. I give this film the highest rating, as it is more than a documentary - it is the political reality of Russia, visible right here and now, developing under the influence of our common decisions and actions. All these documentary materials will go down in history, they will also serve as evidence in trials of both international institutions and Russian courts, but only if the people of Russia achieve their freedom.",False
3,10,True colors of Putin,saske-33989,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely fantastic documentary, it will go down in history. If you wish to know who Vladimir Putin truly is, this documentary is definitely for you. This is not just about unprecedented corruption in Russian government, this is about dismantling the facade of a strong Russian leader whose primary goal and motivation is to serve his own country, this investigation reveals his true colors of greed.",False

7,10,Great job,evollaevik,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's amazing how much such a small group of people can do. How much became clear, the puzzles came together.

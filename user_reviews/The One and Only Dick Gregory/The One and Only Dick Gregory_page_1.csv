1,8,You're in for a Rollercoaster of a Ride with this Movie,johnfineberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was fortunate enough to see Dick Gregory perform live, once in my life. I don't remember where (though I feel like it was in San Francisco). I don't remember when it was (but it was probably in the '60s or '70s). All I know for sure is that it was a great experience.Beyond the career as a comedian, I knew he'd become an activist, who deserved our respect. But I didn't know all that much about his life, post-comedy. This film filled in a lot of those gaps. Thank you for that!",False
2,10,Educational and thought provoking,nrgigaba,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've only seen Dick Gregory on The Breakfast Show before watching this documentary. How one man can live a thousand lives in a lifetime is just amazing. This was an amazing documentary, the best to be released in 2021.",False

4,10,An Amazing Documentary,cgmovie85,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've heard of Dick Grgoey, but watching this documentary superseded all the stories about him. What an amazing soul, leader, activisit, comedian, and human being.The storytelling is phenomenal, and I was constantly on the edge wondering what was next in his story. Peoplelike Dick Gregory, who are willing to sacrifice their comfort for the social movements that impact communities they love should be championed more.The One and Only!",False
5,10,"A well told story comedian, activist, icon Dick Gregory -- highly recommended!",Sasha_Lauren,n/a,16/08/2025,"""I'd rather die trying to be free than be a fool slave."" ~ Dick Gregory""The true test of a rich man is, you strip him of his wealth and see how much he's worth."" ~ Lillian GregoryDick Gregory was on a mission. After growing up poor and then finally making it in comedy, he became a fearless leader in the civil rights movement in the 1960s. He was called by friends Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King, Jr. To go down to events in advance to aggravate and stir up people. In turn, Gregory called on Mohammad Ali to help. Ali heeded that call.Dick Gregory was profoundly impacted by the 1963 Birmingham Church bombing in Alabama. Once he saw his celebrity could help raise awareness to the injustices in the world, he was all in. His dedication to human rights resulted in the loss of his fortune. He was arrested at protests over one hundred times, got death threats, and was under surveillance by government watchdogs.Dick Gregory is an icon. A write-in presidential candidate for the Freedom and Peace Party against Nixon, Gregory ran long distances and fasted extensively to draw attention to civil rights, protest the war in Vietnam, and more. He was a supporter of women's rights and dedicated to changing the food industry.I appreciate this film about Dick Gregory, a remarkable person who was married to an extraordinary person, his wife Lily, who took care of their ten kids and gave him the emotional support he needed so he could serve the greater good.News coverage, comedy, TV and film clips, interviews with his wife, children, civil rights activists, comedians, and interviews of Gregory himself tell his story well.Dick Gregory had early onset Alzheimer's and became cantankerous in later years, yet he remained true to his principles. He continued to speak out about issues that matter and make people laugh until his death in 2017.",False

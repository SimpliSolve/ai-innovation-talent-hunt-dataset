1,5,Decent movie with one really big minus,hendrasteve-70192,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe concept of found footage was mixed with classic cinema here works quite well to bring out the horror atmosphere.One thing I find very annoying that gives this movie it's minus point is the character bayu who is supposedly the cousin of the possession victim. The mistake is either from the script or the actor playing bayu. As everytime he interacts with his cousin it feels very sexual. The incestuous sexual tension is very disturbing and disgusting to be honest.Other than that, the cinematography gets an A for a horror movie. The play on lighting and colour works well to immerse the audience in the eerieness and scare of the movie.",True
2,4,"Watchable, but somewhat mundane...",paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the chance to watch the 2024 Indonesian horror movie ""Jurnal Risa by Risa Saraswati"" here in 2025, and of course I so, as it combines two of my favorite things; that being Asian cinema and horror cinema. Sure, I had never heard about the movie prior to watching it, but that hardly mattered.The movie had a watchable enough storyline, though it suffered from being somewhat slow paced and without much scary contents, and that made for a bit of a bland viewing experience. Writer Lele Laila just didn't pile on enough layers of horror, nor amp up the dread, though it was much needed. I sure could have wished for way more scary contents and a faster paced narrative. And the fact that it fell into the 'found footage' genre wasn't exactly flattering for the movie in my opinion. Yeah, I detest the 'found footage' style of movies with a passion.I was not familiar with the cast ensemble in the movie, but the acting performances were good.Visually, then you're not in for an outstanding movie. Not that the effects weren't good, but the movie just didn't really make use of a lot of special effects.""Jurnal Risa by Risa Saraswati"" was watchable, but hardly a noteworthy foray into the Indonesian horror cinema. And it is not a movie that warrants more than just a single viewing.While the movie fitted into the laughable 'found footage' genre of movies, it was actually one of the more enjoyable and well-made of the kind.My rating of director Rizal Mantovani's 2024 movie ""Jurnal Risa by Risa Saraswati"" lands on a four out of ten stars.",False
3,1,"""Better as a YouTube Story, Not a Film: 'Journal Risa' Disappoints""",basusenound,n/a,16/08/2025,"Review of ""Journal Risa""""Journal Risa,"" adapted from Risa Saraswati's supernatural experiences, unfortunately falls short of expectations for horror enthusiasts. Despite having a promising premise about a supernatural adventure, the film feels bland and lacks the tension one would hope for. The plot progresses slowly and aimlessly, with many scenes feeling forced and serving merely as fillers. Instead of creating a chilling atmosphere, the horror elements come across as clich√© and ineffective, making the viewing experience dull and forgettable.The characters also fail to leave a lasting impact. The performances feel flat, with dialogues that are shallow and often awkward. The relationships between characters are underdeveloped, making it hard for the audience to connect with the story. Even Risa, the central figure who should be the film's main draw, does not evoke sympathy or interest due to her poorly developed character arc.From a technical perspective, the cinematography and special effects are underwhelming. The sound design, which should have been a key element in building suspense, ends up being excessive and distracting. Overall, ""Journal Risa"" delivers an unsatisfying viewing experience. With a weak plot, unconvincing characters, and subpar technical execution, this film is hard to recommend. It truly deserves only one star.",False

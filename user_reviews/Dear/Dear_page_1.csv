Who's is your target audience? I guess you want to be as successful in TV as with the iPhone, well, there is no mass appeal with this one, take note from Netflix's Last Dance, a world wide Icon.If you were thinking about targeted audience in the USA, then my badI would love to see you do wonders and magic in TV, like with most of your products, a long way to go.Buy Disney, you have plenty of cash",False

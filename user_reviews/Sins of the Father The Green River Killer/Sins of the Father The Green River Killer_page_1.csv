1,6,"Not bad, Tubi TV",Alpharoll,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was my first time watching a Tubi TV original documentary, and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.Although, not quite the same level of quality, as Netflix documentaries, for example, I think they did pretty well, dipping their toes into true crime. I did not care much for the narrator, as he sounds like the voice of every narrator in 80s & 90s horror movie trailers, and I just found his voice and manner of speaking very annoying.This is definitely a good watch for any true crime fan, and especially those who also listen to true crime podcasts, as they have few hosts of population pods as commentators in the program.I hope Tubi TV keeps doing more of these, and perhaps they'll keep refining them into higher quality content, as they go.",False
2,7,Well Done,billcr12,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Green River Killer was in the news for almost twenty years before his capture. Because the victims were, for the most part, prostitutes, little concern was given, when compared with Ted Bundy, who killed a good number of ""innocent"" college co-eds. Ted makes an obligatory appearance as he volunteered his advice on catching the killer. One of his predictions was hauntingly accurate. No serial killer doc would be complete without the Tedster. The reenactments are, as usual, overdone, but the final portion with Ridgway interviews are the highlight of the documentary. Interviews with his third and final wife are bizarre. Overall, a very entertaining film.",False
3,7,What can you say about a despicable killer?,stormyweather_keeps_raining,n/a,16/08/2025,I noticed that the judge said 'You have so little disregard.......'. He should have said 'You have so little regard.....'How this killer perceived his victims was shocking.,False
4,9,superb...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Storytelling about one of the most indespicable serial killer of our generation, if not say history. Its a well known ''fairytail'' for seasoned true crime tv enthusiasts, but this tubi production really adds some more aspects to the riddle of gary ridgeway, ''the green river killer''.To newbies to this story there are loads of material about this man on the net, in books and in motion pictures, but this edition of his crimelife gives you a comphrehensive start. Just have in mind that this is true crimes that have really happened.Everytime i, the grumpy old man, hear about the green river killer, my stomac turns upside down and a big lump of angst fills my chest, and i live 12000 km from the crimespots, therefore save a little prayer to the victims and their families, actually they are the main cast in every documentary made on the case.. may they all rest in peace.",False
5,4,Nothing New,adaohneck,n/a,16/08/2025,"You have the actual detectives explaining the situation, then cut to a tiktok host, that doesn't know anything other than what she read or watched. I want to her the detective speak. Not all these people from the media.Overall it's a decent documentary. Feel like people were added to boost their fame in the murder media industry. I would have given a much higher rating of these people were not in the documentary. You had interviews with people that were actually there. Why would you cut halfway threw while he's speaking, the man that actually caught this killer, to a tiktok host literally nobody care about. I found that extremely annoying.No new facts were mentioned. I've seen all of this before. All you did was add people in the murder media industry.",False
6,5,The so-many'th documentary on the Green River Killer,Erik_Surewaard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have already seen so many documentaries on this killer, that I hoped to learn something new from this one.But unfortunately it was not the case. It was just the basics of the story that was already told in other videos.It is even so that very important facts were not told: e.g. How they got an initial DNA comparison from his son.I often ask myself why they keep making so many documentaries about the same murderer. Why don't they take a murderer that has not yet have a documentary?!",False
7,3,If you've run out of true crime,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat would it be like to grow up as the child of one of the most prolific serial killers in U. S. history? This Tubi original documentary explores what that's like for the son of Gary Ridgway, the infamous Green River Killer.Directed by Victoria Duley (who produced several other Tubi exclusives like Famously Haunted: Amityville and Scariest Monsters in America) and written by Chip Selby, this film explores the life and murders of Gary Ridgway, who is currently serving 49 consecutive life sentences for the murder of 49 women through the 80s and 90s.Beyond interviewing Ridgeway, his son Matthew, ex-wife and neighbors, this also features the lead detective on the case Dave Reichert, former commander of the Green River Task Force Frank Adamson, Seattle reporter Olivia LaVoice, former co-worker Diane LaPointe, The Crime Weekly Podcast podcaster Stephanie Harlowe and forensic psychotherapist Michael Drane. There are also dramatizations to show what it was like to be part of Ridgeway's life.While this may not have the budget of a Dateline or other network true crime show, it does have plenty to tell you about the case. Then again, if you're watching this, chances are you already know all about the Green River Killer and you'll see this as another generic take on true crime. You certainly have plenty of options of what to watch when it comes to murder porn, right?",True

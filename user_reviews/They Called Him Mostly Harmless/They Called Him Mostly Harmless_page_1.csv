1,7,Interesting subject with toxic side characters,Last-Call,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis is an interesting look into someone who wanted to disappear and the lengths they went to in order to stay anonymous. What ruins the documentary is the drama between the internet sleuths. Namely Christine. An unlikable person who claims she wants to help and only she knows how to do it. What we see is a sad person who uses this real life scenario to be the center of attention and tell people what to do.She actually thinks she solved the case. The crowd sourced DNA testing solved the case. She merely dipped her pole back in the water when it was properly chummed. At that point the identification was inevitable. Her Facebook group just happened to get the message.This documentary does show the damage the amateurs can do to real families. It's gross. Christine's personality is gross. Because of that I wouldn't watch this again.,True
2,6,"A fascinating doc, but you need to know what you're getting",comradecupcake,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan of various YouTube mystery and crime channels, I recall the tale of Mostly Harmless popping up from time to time. Eventually it was ""solved"" but the strange, sad and lonely tale retained its interest. If you'd like to hear more about that, I recommend checking out channels on YouTube like Scary Mysteries or Barely Sociable.What THIS particular documentary represents is the story around the mystery. It's about the toxic and fannish world of True Crime aficionados, the infighting, the clashes, the betrayals and the often sad lives of the people behind the reddit accounts. Yes, the story of Mostly. Harmless is explored, but it's on the periphery.If you go in knowing what you're getting, that this is as much or more about the amateur forum posters attempting to solve the mystery and give a name to the enigmatic hiker, then you're in for a very fascinating documentary.But if you're already familiar with the case and looking for a break down or, worse, just looking for a proper investigative mystery, then you will probably come away disappointed and feeling a bit cheated.",False
3,6,"Mostly good, except for one person",sterekevr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI very much enjoyed this documentary, many interviewees who were dedicated to finding out who ""mostly harmless"" really shows that the hiking community is a hodgepodge of people. As per Max, the film had amazing scenes and shots of nature, and they don't show any graphic photos of Mostly Harmless's dead body. However, the main person who really started the whole internet fascination (Christie) seemed so hypocritical and holds a superiority complex that carries throughout the entire film. From being extremely controlling to flat out cyber bullying someone just because she saw them as a competitor in solving Vance's death, Christie almost ruined the entire documentary for me.Christie gets very emotional when she thought she found who Mostly Harmless was, and puts up a ""poor me"" act after she basically organized an entire group to harass the moderator of Christie's previous Facebook group. The rest of the documentary is basically her weeping about poor ol' Vance and her dedication to his case while completely ignoring her own abusiveness towards those who wouldn't let her have full control of them and/or Vance's case.Another thing to note that others have pointed out, several of the people interviewed were in such disbelief that this warm, soft spoken hiker was actually an abuser that they all but disregarded the evidence to mourn the death of someone they thought they knew from a few interactions. Christie herself states that Vance's death absolutely was not a suicide, nor did he abuse his previous girlfriends.Internet sleuths themselves are extremely invasive towards people who they think are somehow related to whatever it is they are investigating, and Max's documentary shows that very well. ""They Called Him Mostly Harmless"" is definitely worth a watch if you can get passed how cringe Christie is. I'd certainly recommend it to friends in the future.",True
4,7,"The good, the bad, and the sometimes extremely ugly world of Internet sleuthing",Curt-Rowlett,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was living in Naples, Florida when the news was first reported that a man had been found deceased inside a tent in the woods of the nearby Big Cypress reserve area. And I remember that the angle of the story was one of mystery as to just how the man had died and that his identity remained undetermined. The case was in the news for a few days, then it essentially vanished and we, the public, moved onto other things.So I was genuinely a bit surprised to learn that the search to find out just who the person was and how he died had become such a massive undertaking by those people on the Internet who style themselves as amateur sleuths.This documentary is an interesting look at how those Internet communities, along with law enforcement and the assistance of a sophisticated DNA lab, were finally able to determine who the deceased man, known by his trail hiking name as ""Mostly Harmless,"" actually was, and just what his backstory consisted of.And the final reveal definitely included some real surprises, once the actual truth is discovered.Like all of these kind of modern documentaries that look at the world of amateur sleuths who immerse themselves in true crime and other similar unsolved mysteries, there is good and bad and even some extremely ugly aspects to what people will allow themselves to devolve into so far as their emotional investment in a case is concerned.Worth a watch if you enjoy this particular genre.",False
5,6,Sad story of one man's death & a whole bunch of ego driven online sleuths,LilyWai,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI do enjoy watching true crime documentaries so assumed this one would be another in-depth look at the back story behind a body found on a remote trail, how the Police identified the body & what caused his death. This doco started out promising but very quickly it devolved into a vicious online war between specific women all vying for the notoriety & kudos of being the No.1 sleuth who by identified 'Mostly Harmless' (the deceased's trail name).There was a lot of the content that centred around the online sleuthing component so for those that were hoping for a more professional aspect to the mystery or a focus on expertise from those trained in the field you could be disappointed. A very large part in the middle of the doco is solely about the one upping that went on between two particular woman who ran competing Facebook groups devoted to identifying this deceased hiker. What made it hard to watch was not only the inane nature of these groups content & the scattered approach they took to idenfication but the romanticised way these women viewed this unidentified dead man. You almost got the feeling that these women's lives were lonely & lacking in companionship so the camaraderie of the group along with the imaginative projection so many of them assigned to this man based purely on a range of photos taken of him on the trail & some brief limited interactions he had with a handful of people who were also hiking. Of course it didn't hurt that the man had conventionally good looks too.There was one particular 'sleuther' who made this documentary VERY hard to watch, Christie was a round, middle aged plain woman who was a dry cleaner delivery worker by day & an online missing persons searcher by night. This woman was pretty hard to watch given her level of arrogance & egotism. I did wince a little when she said she would have gone into the FBI Behavioural Profiling Unit had it not been for a family drama because considering her need for major control over others and her intolerance for any opinions or actions outside of her own she struck me as someone that would have been psychologically weeded out of the first round in initial FBI candidate selection. She also kept getting hurt/annoyed/exhausted by the process and opting out of the search project only to head back in over and over. Such was her need to be THE ONE who cracked the case - not it seemed for closure for the family or to help law enforcement but rather to hold the mantle of ""I was the one who solved it"". This felt like the antithesis of what should be the motivation behind operating in these civilian online groups.There is a character who offers some sanity & rationality to the search and that is Nicholas Thompson, a journalist who at the time was writing for Wired magazine. Thank goodness for his contribution because rather than the (as the lead Detective called it) Days Of Our Lives level of content Thompson did what journalists do and took a systematic approach by writing a piece for his magazine which reached many more eyeballs than the random Facebook approach. After listening to the 'she said, no she said' battles between the two hotheaded Facebook group moderators it was a relief just to hear someone not only keeping it professional but also also sticking to the known facts not day dreamed theories.The documentary finally, after digressing down several off shoots, reaches a conclusion that I'm sure in their romantic hearts none of the sleuths were hoping for. It turns out Mostly Harmless was a man who had chosen to vanish. He had paid up his apartment for 6 months, left all his identifiable belongings behind and walked out into the wilds. He had also just broken up with his latest girlfriend, one of many women who he had abused in horrible cruel ways. So poof, just like that the romantic notion these women had created & held on to for years evaporated & Mostly Harmless turned out to be very harmful indeed, or at least he was if you were female.It just goes to show that the police know what they are doing by keeping Missing Person searches professional, strategic & removed from emotion. For the civilian sleuth staring at a photograph of someone for endless hours & then inventing a life around them based on their appearance is a pointless exercise & only leads you to conclusions that have no basis in reality or fact.",True
6,2,"Possibly the dumbest ""true crime documentary"" I've ever seen",kaideneve,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe poor guy who is the supposed topic of this nonsense production is probably spinning in his grave. I say he is the supposed topic, because a large part of the runtime is spent on the personal drama of a couple of conspiracy theorist ladies bickering back and forth via their Facebook group.At the end they basically throw him under the bus (the journalist uses profanity to describe him) based on anecdotes from a couple of ex girlfriends, then pick apart his life and mental health. Let me be more specific... those same boomer ladies and a tech ""journalist"" speculate on his mental health based on cursory evidence that is presented almost as an afterthought after over an hour of runtime.No mental health professionals appear in this entire documentary. This is ironic as almost every person being interviewed seem like the ones in need of mental help. There are no crimes committed. His actual cause of death is not revealed. This is by far the worst thing I've watched on HBO. DO NOT waste your time.",True
7,6,Interesting to true crime enthusiasts,stekos-95319,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only thing that I'm really taking away from this documentary is what a loathsome narcissistic P. O. S. Christie is. She doesn't really seem to care at all about the case, she just wants to be the one to solve it. I know exactly what kind of person she is; she gets off on power, on being in charge. Basically, an entitled Karen. The one comment that defined her, made after she shot her mouth off about 'cracking the case', wasn't anything to do with any kind of regret about making a mistake in identifying the hiker, it was about how the mistake would make her look. What an awful human being. Christie, I hope you're reading this. Do better. Be better.",False
8,4,90 minutes,pdc15725,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is what happens when a story can be told in one hour, yet the filmmakers need to fill 90 minutes. The whole background of the Facebook group members and their drama was such obvious filler that it ended up taking away from the finished product. The officer originally investigating the case had it right when he said that he skips the drama part when reading the Facebook tips that were coming in. If only we were so lucky.Apparently reviews have to be stupidly long now so, much like the documentary, it's necessary for me to add a lot of filler in here in order to make the required length. See how annoying it is?",False
9,n/a,Hike more...eat less???,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI remember the story, I like true crime so wondered about the story at the time but moved on...This documentary is absolutely ridiculous, it's more about Mostly Narcissistic Self Important Attention ""w#ore$"" that had no life (The dry cleaner mole, eyeliner chick especially) who lived in a motel (seriously) and thought she was the only one who solved it or cared). This doco focuses on crazy majorly overweight people (not that that mattered) that are supposedly avid (except dry cleaner mole woman) hikers or canoe-ers even though they weigh 300 pounds, don't wear bras that thought this nice, quiet dude they met once on a trail was a really neat guy.At the start our first thought was he went on purpose to possibly that a forever dirt nap since he had food and money, the interesting part was that he had a dysfunctional childhood history so was estranged from his family (don't most of us), had already tried to un-alive himself before, abused his girlfriends in secret, was smart and created game code and no one knew or cared he had disappeared. These people did NOT know him, but acted like they did...obsessed crazies that must have been paid to do this or just needed to be on TV.Unfortunately these documentaries are getting really heavy on talkers/speculators and light on the mystery and what happened to him, this needs to stop, make documentaries good again . Skip it unless you want to watch self absorbed pretentious annoying people that made it about them, not him. A DNA company that didn't just do it to help or interest but had to crowd source money to do it, really? He ended up being a @$$h0le, oh and Train Angel...w t f??? An interesting story that turned into a clown show. No just no!",True
10,6,"a sad, tragic story",debbystardust,n/a,16/08/2025,"Max seems to play on Netflix's documentary style in this sad tale. There's even a slim, hyper man who keeps reminding us ""I'm a journalist,"" but he isn't nearly as kooky as Netflix's self-described ""aviation journalist."" (As a kooky, semi-successful writer, I can relate.)The story follows the tale of a John Doe found dead in a tent. Along the way, we learn about Appalachian trail culture, internet sleuths (and trolls), and, finally, the rather disappointing ending. When the previously mentioned journalist hyped about ""a bad, bad man"" in the trailer, I was expecting a serial killer or something to emerge. The truth is much sadder.One wonders if Max isn't a bit condescending to its interviewees. Why show us the saddest geriatric square dance ever performed? Why linger on petty squabbles amongst internet sleuths? What was the point of a camera shot of a ceiling fan and then a Mr. Coffee machine? I still love Max, but I might choose a documentary about something historical next time.",False
11,4,Where did they find these people,dancinqueen-38603,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe group of people they interviewed were all so random... the entire film is speculation... no answers are given at the end. They only find the name of the guy ""mostly harmless"" and apparently he beat up girls before he kills himself on the trail by starving himself... that's basically summed up what happened in 90 minutes. No one they interviewed really
Knew him but they all were obsessed with him which was weird ... they all seemed like they were just doing it for attention. It was a boring documentary. I don't know it didn't need to be as long as it was so I'd just good an article and read about it instead of wasting time.",True

No cast listed on imdb, but there are a few captions showing who is currently speaking. The telling of a story from 2018. And it took another two years to identify the dude. He had no cell phone, totally off the grid. Many folks had seen him along the appalachian trail, but no-one new much about him. Because he told a different story each time he met someone. They start a crowdfunding account to pay for dna testing, which got them to the right part of the united states. Facebook helped to track him down. Apparently, he was not a nice person.

13,7,"well, indeed...",ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA job well done, is the first thought that rams my mind, and also the thought of people engaging and uniting themselves together on the social media as socalled ''web-sleuths'' really amazes me. So again , job well done.I live in norway were society is more transparent and easier to control and survey, where john doe's usually are foreign citizens or illegal immigrants thats not implemented in our registers, so practizing sleuthing on the internet over here would be a boring task. Had i been an american ....ai mait bi a sluth tu.Its merely a documantary story about a hiker found dead in a tent, which lighted a flame of enthusiasm among other trailers, bear hivers(the sleuths) media and police investigatorrs. Dna sampled the truth in the end, even though foundraising was needed, it found the answer.Im a dog on the trail myself after breaking my back 6 years ago, taking the task of reflecting the trails with pieces of reflective material (reflexes) for the purpose of life saving, but most of all for the fun of walking the trails in the dark using head lamp, i call it ''a trail of hope and reflextion'' and rehabilitation of a grumpy old man.Well worth your time to watch.",True
14,2,Wow... What a waste of time!,shailosweetkittycat,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStarted off very intriguing, I had never heard of this story, so I was all in. Then they bring in these old, crying, sad women who have nothing going on with their lives other than to fight over the internet about who this guy was.It became boring, pointless and ultimately there was no real close to the story other than he was found to be ""a bad guy, that abused women and had mental illness""... No real conclusion from the autopsy other than, ""we think we starved himself""...Super disappointing to start out intrigued and very curious to then be immediately let down by lackluster reporting, armature sleuthing, catty old ladies and no closure to the mystery.Do not bother to watch this, just Google it to find out who he was and what little they found out about him, the end!",True
15,6,True crime documentary about true crime communities,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""They Called Him Mostly Harmless"" (2024 release; 89 min.) opens, it is ""July 23, 2018"", and someone calls 911 to report they found a dead body on a trail in southwest Florida. No name, no credit card, no photo ID. Who is this person? In a parallel story, we are introduced to Christie, who loves to do some internet sleuthing in these types of missing John or Jane Doe cases... At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from documentarian Patricia Gillespie (""The Fire That Took Her""). Here she reassesses the strange case that is the disappearance of someone nicknamed ""Mostly Harmless"" on the Appalachian Trail. But in fact, the documentary is just as much about the digital sleuthing communities that are out there to ""help"" solve unsolved cases like this one. Let me just say that it ain't a pretty picture: petty infighting, name calling, (in)competence, you name, they have it. A reporter from Wired Magazine also gets involved, and the contrast between the reporter and the sleuthing communities couldn't be starker. At just an hour and a half, this documentary clips by in no time.""They Called Him Mostly Harmless"" premiered on HBO several weeks ago, and is also streaming on Max, where I caught it the other night. If you are a fan of true crime documentaries, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
16,6,Had its moments,greatandimproving,n/a,16/08/2025,"The internet sleuthing dimension got in the way of a really compelling story imo. I don't mind that they talked about the search and the communities cultivated online (emphasis on ""cult""). But I wish the producers didn't focus so much on those elements. A nice tight one-hour doc about a man whose isolation led him permanently into the wilderness- and whose identity was only discovered through new technology, crowdfunding and the will of strangers- would have been solid. Instead, too much time was spent on the strangers. The more ""serious"" it got the more I laughed, and the film lost its punch in the process.I still think it's worth watching, tho. I won't jump on the hate bandwagon lol. For one, I had never heard anything about his story before and it left me with plenty of food for thought. While this man did something very few (if any) of us would ever do, his life was still surprisingly relatable. How much of that has to do with what you know about him, and how much of it has to do with what you don't?I thought the quote the producers found from Adams' book was a gem, and really captured the central theme of the project: ""Let the past hold on to itself and let the present move forward into the future."" Such a pointed reminder for everyone involved: be it those of us watching at home; characters who participated *from home; and maybe most notably ""Mr. Harmless"" himself, who could never find his way home at all.",False
17,4,Not the sleuths,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot with these internet sleuths, they are ridiculous, sitting at their computers, harassing real people and only thinly doing good things. Then they try to lay claim to discoveries that they are loosely connected to uncovering. Centering a documentary around these people gives them notoriety that they simply do not deserve. The story itself is interesting if you're willing to weed through the self-centered commentary by the sleuths and focus on the mystery. The ending is pretty good, but mostly goes to show how off kilter many of the tangents the ""facebook group"" took were, just doing too much.",False
18,6,Mostly interesting,avindugunasinghe,n/a,16/08/2025,Vances are born unfortunately into chaos they make chaos and leave chaos behind if unfound. This story strip away the myth of connectedness in modern world and introduce the lonely lives that exists in shadows. Retrospectively the sleuths of whom most are falling into the aforesaid shadow realm put up a wholesome collective effort that gives a John doe a name that he himself wanted the world to forget. It's sad yet a mysterious venture of social detective work. A story told well methodically and cleverly. Rather than making a regular true crime doc this sleuthing odyssey is a unique and an inspiring social commentary.,False

The main dumpster fire of the doc character was this extremely sad individual, Christy Harris. Shes a very sad narcissist. She cries at the end because she really thinks shes some sort of hero. HUGE WASTE OF TIME. DO NOT BOTHER. Unless you want to be annoyed for an hour and a half. I never care to write reviews but that lady had my blood boiling.

There isn't.A big part of the video is self-proclaimed 'internet sleuths' complaining about how they were treated online. This is NOT a 'true crime' documentary and never should've been marketed as such.The real story was about an unidentified hiker that was found dead from starvation. The video gives the impression that once they discover the identity of the hiker a great mystery, possibly a murder, will be solved. There is no great mystery. It's just a guy who came from a badly dysfunctional family who had some abusive relationships with women and then decided to drop off the grid. That's it.I can see no reason why anyone would think this story was worth the time, effort and money to make a documentary.

23,7,Intriguing but too long,marthacrone,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed this documentary, which had two layers. One was a mystery about the identity of a reclusive hiker who died on the Appalachian Trail, apparently of starvation. The other was a character study of the very strange people who are obsessed with amateur internet sleuthing. The two layers intersect through the puzzling obsession of two women who never met the deceased but for some strange reason they spend inordinate amounts of time trying to figure out who he was. One of those women lives in an extended stay hotel, which made me wonder whether she could have afforded rent if she spent her time working a paying second job instead of spending all her time moderating a group of internet ""sleuths."" Apparently a lot of people wish they worked in law enforcement. The people were very odd, some likable and some not. I thought the film was well done, with good structure that kept my attention despite being overly long. I'm not sure where reviewers got the idea this was true crime because it was not advertised like that.",True
24,5,"It's Not HBO, It's just TV",Ohscissormetimbers,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis starts out like a yesteryear HBO production but quickly devolves into something you would see on a daytime true crime network. It's difficult to recommend this to really anyone at all, because it lacks so many of the components that used to make HBO stand out amongst its peers. What you end up with in this documentary has very little to do with what you are pitched in the trailer. This is 30 minutes of mystery regarding the identity of this nameless hiker followed by an hour of several embittered older women fighting with one another over moderator status on Facebook groups.What is actually alarming about the movie is not the content, but how far people will go to make sure there is no privacy in this world at all. Yes, the subjects of this movie find out who ""Mostly Harmless"" is at the end, but at a cost. I call these internet sleuths ""subjects"" because the director clearly deviated paths at some point during this production. What started as a documentary on a dead hiker turned into a lazy character study on several older women who had little to live for other than this story. Thus, the ""subjects"" of the movie were the women who helped find out who this gentlemen was, while engaging in a virtual slap fight in the process. I am loathe to discuss that part of this film because it gives these women more of an audience than they really deserve. But it's what the director ultimately settled on to stretch this from an hour to an hour and a half. Show or movie. That was the dilemma. He made a movie, which meant filling that thirty minutes. As a show, this could have worked. As a movie, it did not.Of note, we do learn who ""Mostly Harmless"" is and we also learn that he has a troubled past and apparently felt he had a troubled future. All signs point to him having starved himself to death as a means to end his own life. This was despite having several apparently meaningful interactions during a year+ hike on the Appalachian trail. Several of the people he interacted with ended up being interviewed for the documentary, but none proved helpful in ascertaining who he was. It was ultimately a DNA study and subsequent pamphleting of his Louisiana town that uncovered his identify.In the end, this movie begs an important and very sad question. The man in this movie did everything he could to go off the grid and to die, alone and unknown, on his own terms. What he got instead was the exact opposite. Thousands of people rallied together to identify him and then, after his death, several other people claimed he was a terrible person. Of course, those people only came out of the woodwork once the story was known and notoriety was to be had, but even taken as true, one has to wonder what purpose this story served. This gentlemen clearly wanted nothing more than to fade into the abyss. Instead, he got sleuthed by a bunch of people who were more worried about Facebook moderator status than anything else. And then, in death, his entire life was unearthed and made public. That unearthing showed a guy who struggled with mental health for 41 years and sought to end his own life, maybe as penance and maybe as something else. It's truly none of our business, and it pains me to have watched this documentary and realized that my viewership was part of what this man sought to avoid.This film is certainly ""documentary"" in nature in the sense that it tells a story. But the story is not what one expects, nor is it anything most people would care about. Had the focus been on ""Mostly Harmless"" and not on the women who could only be described as absolutely harmful, it could have been good. But, alas, this is the new HBO. And the new HBO is quantity over quality. There is plenty of quantity here, but the quality is not what it once was.Shame on you HBO for phoning this one in. Perhaps a show would have been better than a movie this time around.",True

1,6,"I'm a fan of the guy, so had to watch...",jd-97226,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are definitely much better documentaries out there on either Einstein or the bomb, but combining both is really not practical. Einstein's miracle year was in 1905, way before the A-bomb. He wrote his four papers. The first one gave him the Noble Prize and opened the door to Quantum Mechanics (QM). The forth gave us E=MC^2; at the time he had no idea where this would lead to. The problem with the documentary is that there is no Einstein and the Bomb; there's plenty of Einstein and QM (Photoelectric Effect), Einstein and LASER, Einstein and Gravity, Einstein and Differential Geometry. As for the bombs' development and use, there's Oppenheimer and the Bomb or Politicians, Their Decisions and the Bomb. Other than that, it's a good watch if you're a fan of the guy.",False
2,7,That's actually not bad.. but not that good,CrankyGoose,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is quite interesting and in fact, I learned a lot of new things for me. I found out that Einstein actually played on fiddle, that he has never liked interviews, that such a popular and influential person was hiding in the village in Big Britain, in some small house and etc. The film is really informative and you can learn a lot about his biography and the years when he was hiding from the scary and insane murder Nazi dictator Adolf H#tler. The only minuses of this movie is that it is short and actors are really not very well played. In a person who played Einstein it was not visible to the naked eye that he was wearing a wig and make-up. That's all what I didn't like. Everything else was very informative and interesting. I recommend this movie to watch.",False
3,5,Netflix wanted a slice of Oppenheimer success and failed by doing the right thing for the wrong cause,thomas-leitha,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf one expects having Einstein's role in the Manhattan Project revealed, the title has mislead him. The real drama of this story is summarized in Einstein's conclusion:
""Organized force can only be opposed by organized force.""
This must have been devastating for a die-hard pacefist communicating with Ghandi, Russell and others. This could have been of outmost relevance in our times of wars in the Ukraine and Gaza where ""killing for peace"" is fiercely debated and remains morally as unsolvable today as it was for Einstein and his times.Telling a story of frustrated pacifism using Einstein's bio would have been of greater relevance than this far fetched junctim between Einstein and the bomb.Another annoying feature of the piece, as with many cheap digital productions nowadays, are over-used green screen and post-production effects. And I have seen most of the used historical footage in much better quality the the used clips here (eg Hitler's speeches) which didn't add to the overall impression of this production.",True
4,n/a,What About Switzerland?,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Einstein and the Bomb"" was clearly meant to piggyback on the success of ""Oppenheimer"". But in terms of journalism and content, it is a failure. Far too much time was spent focusing on Hitler-Germany and Einstein's Jewish background, and far too little time on Einstein's work and personal life. There was also too much focus on his time in England, without a word being spoken about his time in Switzerland, which was far more important. It was in Bern where Einstein wrote his Special Theory of Relativity. There was even a major international event in Bern to mark the 100th anniversary of the Special Theory that drew eminent scientists from all over the world. (I reported on it for Swiss Radio International).Einstein described his life in the Swiss capital as the happiest and most productive period of his career. His apartment on Kramgasse in Bern's old town near The Bear Pit is a popular museum, visited by people from all over the world. Einstein was also a Swiss citizen. But not one second of the story was devoted to this. There was only a brief pan-shot of Zurich (not Bern) without any label or explanation. Totally out of context. This is bad journalism and inexcusable.If you are interested in more about Einstein in Bern, you'll find it under that title.",False
5,6,"Lacks depth, Somewhat rushed in but a good watch",samabc-31952,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb, I would not have taken part in opening that Pandora's box."" - Albert Einstein
Einstein was a vocal advocate for peace. He was a pacifist. But when he received a letter from Leo Szilard ( who not only proposed the idea of chain reaction but also conducted the experiment) alerting Einstein about German scientists working on fission (based on the famous E= mc squared by Einstein) which could result into Hitler having the A-bomb before the allied could develop it. Einstein forwarded that letter to FDR and urging him to hasten the development of an A-bomb by saying "" I do not believe that civilization will be wiped out in a war fought with the atomic bomb. Perhaps two thirds of the people of the earth might be killed, but enough men capable of thinking, and enough books, would be left to start again, and civilization could be restored.""
Very few would know that U. S. Army Intelligence office denied Einstein the security clearance needed to work on the Manhattan Project!!!!This documentary is a part essay, part revisiting the chapters of his life. It combines archival footage with dramatizations. The movie starts with his living room in his Princeton home with Mahatma Gandhi's photo on a night stand and ends with his famous quote "" the war is won but the peace is not"". He was so right. The unleashed power of atom as he said once would change everything in the years to come as the human race would gradually drift towards the unfathomable fears of catastrophe ... when the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6 1945, Einstein sighed and said ""Woe is me.""
Einstein showed measurement. Measurement is a possibility on which the science depends..but did you know that Heisenberg who gave an uncertainty principle failed at Diffusion equation?i or really? Did he pretend that he failed so that Nazis could not have the bomb!!!!! He as a matter of fact told Otto Hahn, the German nuclear scientist later how the little boy worked after Hiroshima was bombed!!!!This documentary is not a biopic like Oppenheimer nor a play like Copenhagen. But it does explore one of the greatest scientist's own conflicted emotions..a human's great discovery falls into demonic hands aka of humans!! The movie feels rushed in the second half and fails to capture the depth of Einstein's dilemma. But still a good watch!""I do not know with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."" - Einstein.",False
6,7,"Good docuseries complement to ""Oppenheimer""...",mdw0526,n/a,15/08/2025,"Have you seen ""Oppenheimer"" yet? It helps to have seen it before this docuseries. It's a commitment of time (3 hours), but worth it, with amazing performances all around and a whole bunch of new knowledge learned.This new docudrama on Netflix is a good complement to the movie, and in a trim 1h15m, dives into more detail about Einstein and his place in the firmament of history with regard to the invention of the atomic bomb. Of course, it's not going to paint the entire picture in a short time, but does add some good color about Einstein's conflicted conscience on what he helped unleash, however small his role may have been.",False
7,7,"Einstein's life in his own words, little about the bomb",jansouverein,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary combines archive footage and acted scenes to show parts of Albert Einstein's life and thinking, using his own words. This is the part I liked most about this film: in the acted scenes and the voice-overs, exclusively verbatim quotes by Einstein are being used. No invented dramatizations. The documentary does a good job in using Einstein's quotes to show his beautiful and exceptionally intelligent mind and to paint a coherent image of the his pacifist and internationalist convictions.However, you might be disappointed if you are expecting more insights into Einstein's connection to the development of the atomic bomb. Contrary to what the title promises, there is very little content on that matter, beyond a reference to the Einstein-Szilard letter, his motives for signing said letter and his posterior regrets. Actually, only the last third of the film even touches upon these questions. For the larger part, it shows Einstein's life in the 20s and 30s, interlaced with the rise of the Nazis and World War II. It does not contain more insights on the development of the atomic bomb and Manhattan Project than does Oppenheimer and it does not show his private life in the way season 1 of Genius does.The acted scenes mostly take part in Roughton, Norfolk, where Einstein was offered refuge in September 1933 by MP Oliver Locker-Lampson after fleeing Germany. The reason for focusing on that relatively minor episode of his life may be that this is a British production which wished to highlight the one relevant connection of Einstein with the UK.In some scenes, Einstein seems oddly mute, which presumably has to do with the decision to only use documented quotes, so no small talk is possible. As in other documentaries, such as in Genius, the producers (annoyingly) decided to let the acted Einstein speak only English (with German accent), even when he speaks to other Germans, rather than have him also speak his native German language.The film ends on a strong note, with two message to us contemporary viewers. ""The fate of mankind hinges entirely on man's moral development."" - ""Dear posterity, if you have not become more just or peaceful and generally more rational than we are or were, then may the devil take you.""",False
8,6,"More Than Just Science: A Review of ""Einstein and the Bomb""",PedroReviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"Imagine stepping into the shoes of Albert Einstein, the iconic physicist, during the tumultuous years leading up to World War II. That's what ""Einstein and the Bomb"" offers, promising a glimpse into the man behind the genius. While it might not be a deep historical dive for some, it delivers a unique and thought-provoking journey through a pivotal moment in human history.From the very first scene, the series pulls you in with its immersive atmosphere. The music, while not the starring attraction, deserves recognition for its powerful and evocative melodies that perfectly complement the narrative's emotional weight. Aiden McArdle's portrayal of Einstein is also a worth mention, capturing the essence of the scientist with nuance. The supporting cast also adds depth and believability to the historical figures portrayed.But what truly sets ""Einstein and the Bomb"" apart is its storytelling approach. Weaving in Einstein's actual words through letters, speeches, and recordings, the miniseries creates an intimacy that traditional narration often lacks. We're not just observers; we're invited directly into Einstein's mind, experiencing his complex inner world firsthand. This unique perspective adds a layer of emotional resonance that makes the historical events all the more impactful.While not an exhaustive historical analysis, the show effectively connects the dots, offering viewers a clear understanding of the complex events leading up to the development of the Atomic Bomb. It might not satisfy history buffs seeking a deep dive, but for those open to a more personal and emotional exploration, ""Einstein and the Bomb"" succeeds.Ultimately, the verdict depends on what you're looking for. If you seek a purely academic examination of historical events, this might not be your top choice. However, if you're open to an immersive and emotive exploration of Einstein's life and beliefs, with a captivating atmosphere and strong performances, ""Einstein and the Bomb"" offers a valuable and thought-provoking journey. It's a symphony of history and humanity, conducted by the unique voice of Albert Einstein himself.",False
9,4,You can skip it,benntune,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was average at best. I wouldn't call it a documentary. It was a drama with some documentary film added in to try and give it some clout. Made to try and capitalise off the renewed interest in the subject thanks to Oppenheimer, you can tell Netflix rushed out to create anything it could with predictable results. The bomb isn't even mentioned until about 30mins remaining and nothing new or interesting is depicted. Letters are portrayed in person just to try and dramatise the exchange. If the purpose of this was to inform and/or entertain, it did neither. So as far as I'm concerned it's not worth watching.",False
10,6,"Awesome historical footage, messy narration",leo-ingson,n/a,15/08/2025,"Most of us are aware of the theoretical pathways that led to Hitler's rise. This collection of footage offers a tangible, step-by-step journey into that historical period, providing a profound understanding of the events. It's also fascinating to delve into Albert Einstein's thought processes. Beyond his scientific genius, Einstein demonstrated worldly acumen, such as his timely escape from Germany and his advisory role to Oppenheimer, showcasing his ability to blend intellectual prowess with practical wisdom. His foresight and strategic thinking were remarkable, revealing a man who was much more than just a ""science nerd.""",False
11,3,Not worth watching,ben-slimane-ahmed,n/a,15/08/2025,"Netflix is trying to make a drama out of Einstein's history, a bomb that he has no direct relation to, or maybe they are trying to ride on the success of Oppenheimer.No scientific proof that Einstein was involved with the bomb, some weird letters and ideas are not developed behind. No mention of Oppenheimer. I lost my time watching it.I Do not suggest to watch it... it's neither a documentary nor a movie.If you are looking for something similar to Oppenheimer, this is not it. A big chunck of it talks about his early life, and few mention of his relativity theiries, but no deep explanation or whatsoever.",False
12,8,Well worth watching,billmaxey-81806,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a long retired scientist old enough to have lived through most of einstein's last two decades, i found this docudrama to capture the man and his times very effectively. The scientific principles underlying this biography are presented accurately and in ways the layman can understood. The cultural milieu of the period of time depicted is, as far as I can tell, spot on. The history presented is real and not made up to suit some specific point of view. The man himself is depicted accurately and as I recall him at the time and from other readings about his background. While this movie may n ot be everyone's cup of tea, i found it worthwhile.",False
13,4,Very disappointing,rickfinn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although I'm very familiar with the history and the physics, I was still excited to see the make a great Netflix documentary and see how they plan to together his only slight relationship with the Manhattan project, and maybe more bio before, and after producing general and specific theories of relativity.But my largest complaint aside from Netflix, not doing the above is that this piece is completely all over the place, jumping timelines out of order going from one date to the other any linear storytelling and more over, I don't think they knew what they wanted here. What you get are bits and pieces of Einstein's history, bits and pieces of the rise of national socialism and the Nazi movement bits and pieces of where Einstein went and some of what he spoke about but only some; and very much a fractured history lesson on the persecution of Jews on the holocaust. Any of these would've made a fine documentary if they stuck to something and showed at Einstein had something to do with any of it or how he was affected by it, but this was trying to be everything at once and not being many bad mini documentaries. Also, I totally agree with some other comments that it seemed rushed.",False
14,2,BAD BAD BAD,ellispk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like really, really bad. I was looking for a documentary thinking I may learn something about the A-bomb and Einstein (which I thought were relatively disconnected subjects). Turns out I was right ... What is presented is half historical footage and half HORRENDOUSLY acted historical fiction. The accents attempted by the third rate actors aren't even on par with what you might find at a frat party around 3 in the morning. The cursory timeline presentation is jumbled and makes little sense in relation to the subject of the film. I always wonder when something like this is finished and the creators watch it for the first time what their impression might be. Nobody can watch this and think that it has any historical or current relevance. I'm sorry for the hour and 16 minutes of my life that is gone. SKIP THIS ONE!!",False
15,n/a,Nonsensical,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerVirtually nothing to see. This whole production is a paradox. If you know ""anything"" about Einstein there is nothing to pick up, if you don't - there are far better better offerings with regard to understanding the Great Mind. As other viewers have eloquently stated; it is a mind blowingly poor production - one that, maybe, found it's roots in a board room rather than in a passion for the great man.The whole escapade can, pretty much be summarised in a couple of sentences...
Einstein presented the physics that, amoung other ""things"" proved the link between matter and energy. In so doing he facilitated the development of the nuclear bomb. Einstein had mixed feelings with regard to this achievement. His desire to put an end to Nazi-Germany by beating them in the race for nuclear capability won ""the internal battle"" over his pacifist ideology.Later in life, especially when it turned out that Germany lost the war ""anyhow"" and the acquired nuclear capacity was used on a large civilian Japanese population... he felt guilty.That, in essence, is what is covered In Einstein and the Bomb - and it is done so pretty poorly.",True
16,3,Nothing New,aqswdeft-91733,n/a,15/08/2025,"The viewer who has seen countless WWII documentaries will initially have an interest in this docu about one of the most brilliant people who have ever lived - Einstein.However, as the viewer watches this supposed docu, reality starts setting in.....This docu is really pathetic. It does inform a 'little' about Einstein's life, but the overall impact is very shallow - it does not go into the detail that is required for such a historically important person.Also - the intelligent American will get the distinct feeling that this docu has a very strong smell of left wing when clips of the bomb explode in Japan and victims are shown etc.Japan deserves zero empathy for Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan killed millions of people in WWII all over the world, and very heavy in China which for whatever reason, American schools do not teach.Some of the Japanese citizens DO deserve empathy - those who opposed Japan's war initiatives, etc. - but especially the innocent of Japan - the children, infants, etc.Overall - this docu is practically WORTHLESS. An in-depth docu of Einstein would actually have value. Again, there is a strong stench of typical netflix social programming left wing propaganda. Hey netflix - you can't fool the smart American. Ever.",False
17,10,Incredible film everyone should watch,yuriybilous,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stupid people write stupid reviews. In their own world they believe they are superstars of reason and logic. While in reality they seem to be like children, who didn't like the colour of a new candybar.This said, I believe that everyone who gave this fantastic film a bad review, simply had no concern for the life and future of humanity.If you need hardcore science - you should go to libraries, and not to Netflix.This film is about the humanity and about the great human achievement in scientific domain. This film is about morality and the important questions that surveys scientists must ask themselves when they make a major scientific discovery.After all, this film is about the actual person behind there name of Einstein. This is not the film about either science, or politics, or personal life.Yes, i do wish it was extended, let's say to 3 series, and not one. Because it looks like humanity still haven't learned much from history and prefer to stick to fast food culture, which doesn't require any reflection.Everyone should watch this film.",False
18,5,Einstein and the Bomb?,MackQb,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHow strange that ""Einstein and the Bomb"" never addressed the issue of Einstein and the Bomb. There was a fifteen year quick overview of the rise and fall of Hitler's Germany. It was broken up by archival footage of Albert Einstein during those years and some dramatization to fill in some gaps.What I was expecting was An understanding of Albert Einstein after he moved to the United States. Did he have any role in the development of the atomic bomb? Did he speak out in favor of or against the atomic bomb. What was his reaction to the bomb's destruction of Hiroshima? Did his opinion change after a bomb was dropped on Nagasaki? And then the Cold War and the race for Mutually Assured Destruction?",True

20,5,"As an admirer of Einstein's scientific work, a good watch. But an admirer of History might frown down upon this.",chickenkheemalasagna,n/a,15/08/2025,"It would be an understatement to proclaim that Dr Albert Einstein is one of the greatest scientists of all time. His contributions to scientific milestones and mankind are numerous. This docu-drama unravels delicate details of the life of this exceptional persona through his lesser-exposed notes and footage.Being born into a Jewish family, following Hitler's rise to power and tyranny due to the crippling German economy, Einstein is forced to flee the country and take refuge in Europe. He is familiar with being bombarded with supporters and haters alike. Despite his fame and influence along with his deeply rooted sense of anti-fascism, he refrains from making public statements against Hitler for the fear of possible consequences that his Jewish brethren might face. The instances portrayed in the documentary reveal his humility and intense compassion for humankind.""Silence would have made me feel guilty of complicity.""When the nationalistic tendencies in Germany hit peak violence, Einstein decides to make a stand. When there arises a suspicion that the Nazis are attempting to create an atomic bomb, he is forced to make decisions with far-reaching consequences, which in his own words 'harasses him with an equal feeling of responsibility and guilt.'""One can only hope that the present crisis will lead to a better world.""Einstein is blazoned as the father of atomic energy, an unsought title. Despite how he was regarded as a security risk, his urgency had fuelled the success of the Manhattan Project. Today, the remnants of the destructive forces that took down Hiroshima and its innocent residents still haunt humanity. World peace is a fantasy.The Hiroshima tragedy remains one of the worst ones in the entire history. A docu-drama about the incident highlighting everything that led to Einstein's role in it, the so-called father of atomic energy and the first victim, could have done more justice to the parties. The documentary aspect of it is rather drowned out by the dramatic and cinematic elements that have been cherished throughout the production. History has to be presented as it is, but this piece of work fails to bring out any previously untold chronicle. However, due to my views about Einstein and my admiration towards him, I found it rather moving to witness once again, a narrative of this catastrophe with a hint of his personal touch.",False
21,5,History with guilt,True_Reviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought this would be interesting to watch, but the theme turned out to be as expected. I would pass on this show. This movie tries to blame Einstein or find fault as to who developed the Atom Bomb. It is basically a guilt trip for the viewers. Yes, War is terrible. While this so-called documentary mentioned the reason for the development was to beat Germany to creating this awful weapon, it glosses over the fact that no one knew the Nazis had failed in developing the Atomic bomb, and then ignores the reason it was used to end World War 2. Allied casualties were 7,000 a week. The invasion of Japan would have required hundreds of thousands of soldiers both American and British. The anticipated casualties were estimated to be almost 200,000 men, the same number used to invade Normandy. And if the fighting lasted longer more lives on both sides would be lost. So, what would one do? But of course this was more about Einstein and laying a guilt trip on the viewer.",False

It tells some facts and anecdotes on the life of Albert Einstein, mostly focused in his life in England and its tangential relation with the atom bomb.The problem is that the narration is messy and quite boring, the science is mostly absent (as the overrated Oppenheimer by Nolan, they decided to follow the path of sensationalism and personal portrait, considering the viewers are not interested in science); furthermore, the actors are not really doing a great job, in part because they are acting like in those recreations occassionaly used in documentaries.The film actually does not decides if it is a documentary or a partial biopic. It is kind of a mix.On the merits side, they documented everything very well, the use of real footage, and that all dialogues of Einstein are his real words, using his writings and recordings as reference.So, at least for this last feature, it worths a watch.",False

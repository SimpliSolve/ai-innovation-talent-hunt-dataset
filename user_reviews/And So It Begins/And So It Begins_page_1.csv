1,10,To fight a good fight,codykoh-80368,n/a,16/08/2025,"She may have lost the election but she sparked a revolution. Doubts of her loss maybe due to Duterte's machinations and Marcos Jr.'s money influence have been contested until this very day.Her Vice presidency may have ended but the spirit and gravity of her works are very much relevant until this very moment.This movie may be not that holliwood level great but it is a testament to everyone who have awoken, stood up, and demand a better goverment in the Philippines. This is history. The spark that could start everything.'Ang namulat ay di na pipikit pa' (those who have their eyes opened will never close again).",False
2,10,The Reflection of People's Campaign.,Clfairy,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary showed the Filipino's hope for the better government from the past regime. It is also not easy to fought along enemies with their own machineries in politics but she have the people supporting her back. The whole world knew this. She may have lost the election, still, there was no regret in campaigning for her. Hence, this just showed the true unity among all Filipinos. The country lost for having a good leader to boost our economy.It was not an easy journey but our country will have a long run before we reach a much better country. Hope the people would realize who they vote first.",False
3,5,"Important subject, unfortunately, formulaic and not good execution",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.Filmmaker Ramona S. Diaz creates an interesting topic of a documentary about the political aspects and the unrest happening in the country of Philippines which are interesting topics. Diaz's previous movie ""A Thousand Cuts"" was ambitious and strong but unfortunately, this one, while does offer some interesting political discussions and topics explored, it felt sloppy and poorly executed.Many of the interesting themes of politics, corruption, campaigns, and political unrest are explored and there are some interesting moments that I did found ambitious. But the problems lie on that half of the themes and topics felt unfulfilling, unfocused and felt as if the filmmaker wasn't sure how to approach the topics. With the editing style, sound design and camerawork being solid, there were some editing moments and color presentations that felt degraded and a bit poor.The formulaic approach causes some of the pacing to really drag. It's a shame because having known of Philippines politics, there are so many aspects that could have been explored well but unfortunately, this documentary wasn't really informative and I didn't really get an impact from seeing this.Not a bad watch but it was disappointing.",False

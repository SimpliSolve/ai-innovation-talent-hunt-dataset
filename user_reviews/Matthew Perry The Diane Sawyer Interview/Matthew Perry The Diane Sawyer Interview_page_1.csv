1,10,Matthew Perry -- The Diane Sawyer Interview,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"Matthew Perry is one of my favourite actors, and there's no denying that while the man has had massive success in his acting career, the demons he has experienced have followed him around too.With the publication of his autobiography recently this interview came at a timely moment, and while it does not in the slightest make for easy viewing, it is an insight we have not been granted before, and does shed a light into what he has been through.You will come away with a new perspective on the man himself, and the struggles that he has been through.Will it make us all watched 'Friends' any differently? Probably not, but this interview does make us aware that there is more to Matthew Perry than just Chandler.",False

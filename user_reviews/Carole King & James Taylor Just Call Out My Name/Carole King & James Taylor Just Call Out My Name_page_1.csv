1,9,1970 lives,tomjc-13095,n/a,16/08/2025,I might be biased but these people are my age and still sound like they did 50 years ago. This is what music should sound like. In the 70s these were at the top of the charts. There is no aging of the music or the songs. May they live forever. Bravo.,False
2,9,"Blast from, the past",drjgardner,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you enjoyed them then, you'll enjoy them now. It's amazing how well they continue to sing, though maybe not 100% of who they were, but whom of us is. Enjoy watching the other musicians and singers too.",False
3,9,Autotunegate,hogberto-39809,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show is mainly a massive, warm comfort blanket, full of love, friendship & great songs. Taylor & King are true legends of popular music -as well as being thoroughly decent people - & it is great that they are still with us & were able at the time of the 2010 concert footage to put on a superb show.The band was awesome too. Leland Sklar was an unexpected bonus.No expert in autotune, but it becomes a bit obvious on King's voice midway through the show, mainly on her sustained notes. No obvious stepping to my ears, just a nasty metallic quality, betraying the presence of digital manipulation. Once you notice it you can't unhear it & there is a lesser hint of it in Taylor's vocals. I suspect it wasn't musically necessary - no real sense that King was struggling to hit the notes - so I'd put it down to poor judgement on the part of the musical director.",False
4,10,They still have it- and know how to use it,robert-50216,n/a,16/08/2025,The blend of James and Carole is as inspiring as it was when I got to see them together in 1971 in college. Their talents mesh perfectly and they are having as much fun at what they do now as ever. They remind me why I fell in love with their style of music decades ago- and never got tired of it!,False
5,10,Interesting comments about the autotune,rbronews2,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I was watching this, I suspected that the sound had been doctored a bit, which is the case with most concert films nowadays. I wasn't familiar with autotune technology until now.Having said that, the music in this film sounds really good. Not just the singing of Carole and James, but the guitar and bass playing and drumming and the additional vocalists.It's interesting that Carole King has a history of being reluctant to do live performances, but this film offers no evidence to support this; she seemed really into it.",False
6,n/a,Painful autotune,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love both their music. I've seen James Taylor live (Carole is still bucket list) but my god the autotune was way too heavy. Part of why I love 70s music so much is that raw, intimate, natural and imperfect sound of the singer-songwriter's voice. There is something so close and intimate about it. It touches my soul.I know autotune has become the norm for post-2000 musical artists, but hearing that sound applied to James' and Carole's music was disappointing. No one wants to hear the ""Glee"" tv show version of their music.",False
7,9,Reliving great music,mhottrax,n/a,16/08/2025,"Missed the original Troubedour shows, but had seen them solo many times each. When I heard they were planning a tour 40 years later I jumped right on it. Was lucky enough to see them at the Hollywood Bowl. So of course when I heard this Doc was coming out I couldn't wait to see it. I was not disappointed. A great representation of two of the greatest. Loved how they edited some of the original performances into the new ones. Outstanding doucumentary.(And if they tour again, I'll be there)",False
8,4,Ruined by Autotune,jsmith-33585,n/a,16/08/2025,"The actual documentary parts were enjoyable, but all of the 2010 live performances were ruined by amateurish pitch correction on both of the vocals. Carole's voice was perfectly fine during that tour, but it's been edited so much that all of the humanity has been removed. It's one thing to clean up a live vocal for a movie like this, but this is just sloppy.",False

2,1,Disappointed,Billy-086,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm really confused by this coming from Generation Iron who put out some really great documentaries but this is so not what I've come to expect from them.This seems very much like an advertisement for a coaching entrepreneur. I felt like I was watching a timeshare sales presentationOf all the inspiring people in the world of bodybuilding and fitness , how they landed on this guy is beyond me.The story of diabetes... which I understand is a serious lifelong medical condition , it is also entirely manageable but from this perspective it's told like an unbelievable tale of woe and survival.If you want to be inspired this is not the one.I'm happy for anyone who builds a business or brand they're proud of, congrats on that but I don't think we need the documentary for it.I really hope this isn't an indication of the direction of generation iron.",False
3,1,As soon as they mentioned the troubles I was out,ajloney,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was a glorified sales ad for his business and another engagement grab of folk who still associate Northern Ireland with violence. Like hearing people younger than myself talk about the troubles is wild, it was well over by the time you were heading to grammar school. Between him and the blonde talking about giving army sweets, Lord help us. Hopefully folk don't assume that this doc gives a true representation of Northern Ireland and nothing more than a sales pitch for an industry based off a group of salesmen. Long gone are the true fitness professionals out there to help folk, now it is a rinse and repeat sales pitch.",False
4,1,I lost brain cells watching this,Claore-1,n/a,15/08/2025,Self indulgent drivel. I read some reviews and had good expectations but after watching and rereading the reviews I realise the positive comments are from a gang of sheep this guy coaches! Really disappointing from Generation Iron who usually cover great stories. Bored entirely by this.Using 'the troubles' of Northern Ireland as a backdrop to sell this story is crazy work. The whole thing seems like a sales pitch. So disingenuous and misleading.I wouldn't be surprised at all if this was funded by the guy they made it about. I suppose money talks but I'm definitely disappointed to have wasted mine watching this.,False
5,10,Great watch!,Kieran-824,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really great watch.I came across this after following Phil online for a while, and it was inspiring to see the incredible journey he's been on-not just in terms of his personal growth and dedication to bodybuilding, but also how he's taken that same passion and discipline and applied it to building a successful business.As a business owner myself, I found it especially insightful to hear his perspective on where the industry is heading, particularly with the rise of AI and its potential to reshape everything.I genuinely enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it to others, whether you own a business or are on your own fitness journey.",False
6,10,EXCELLENT,KieranS-653,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fitrepreneur isn't just a fitness story-it's about what it really takes to build something from scratch. Phil Graham's journey from dealing with Type 1 diabetes to running a global coaching brand is shown without the usual hype or nonsense.It's honest, practical, and actually relevant-especially if you're in the fitness industry or building your own business. The parts around tech and AI were spot on too.If you're tired of surface-level motivation and want something that gives real insight into the work behind success, this is worth your time.Inspirational story and an absolute MUST WATCH!",False
7,10,Brilliant,MatthewM-168,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great insights into building a successful life and business. Challenge drives growth.It gives some great info on the troubles in Ireland, and Phil using his past pain to his advantage to build a better future for himself.I'm currently in the process of building my business and i found this hugely inspiring and informative. Business can be lonely, and being around people who think bigger forces me to be a better person and business owner.He's straight talking and honest. If you don't like hearing the truth and personal development, you might not like this!I'd also recommend his spotify podcast!Thanks Phil! ðŸ‘Š",False
8,10,The best in the business,TheD-029,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved everything about this documentary and everything Phil stands for.Inspiring and game changing insights every time I watch and listen to Phil and his team speak.As a business owner, Phil has opened my eyes up to what is possible - regardless of where you are from and what you have been through, if you have enough drive, determination and skill you can achieve anything!The documentary itself was well produced and gave loads of valuable insights into the routines and habits that have contributed to Phil's success. AI is huge right now so the relevance of the topic made it even more appealing. Congrats and thank you!",False
9,10,Inspiring for every entrepreneur - well worth a watch.,DanielleB-219,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been following Phil for years now, often from a distance as I watched him globally dominate the fitness coaching space . The documentary was an opportunity to get to see the man behind the content, what drives him , what feeds his hunger and really who he is at heart and home. The documentary was fantastic , a must watch for any entrepreneur who wants to build a lifestyle via business and not just go through the motions. You can't help but be spurred on to level up after watching it . Highly recommend for those across all walks of life , but especially those who have a vision for their future that seems unattainable - Phil disproves it all.",False
10,10,Inspired,OwenP-65,n/a,15/08/2025,"Loved this! Fitpreneur shows the highs and lows of getting fit while building a business. Phil's journey is so relatable and honest-you see the grind, setbacks, and big wins. Super motivating and proves that with the right mindset and work ethic, you can completely change your life. 100% Worth a watch.",False
11,10,"Real , Raw and brilliant!",AndrewF-999,n/a,15/08/2025,"Excellent story showing how Phil overcame a serious diabetic challenge to becoming prolific in the fitness world .Business wise , building and adapting to the latest trends such as Ai was a good move .For the live events , you could feel Phil's energy as he engaged with his audience , this guy wants you to win.I think what separates Phil is that he has clearly systemised a business model in the fitness world that can be applied to BOTH fitness but also general business as well.Looking forward to seeing his progression and what targets he hits next in life !A great watch indeed . 100% Worth watching!",False
12,10,Great watch...inspiring...,JamesO-505,n/a,15/08/2025,"I never leave reviews but fell inspired to leave this one as I not only enjoyed the docco...but was super inspired by Phil.....To achieve what he has and how many people he has genuinely helped.....is staggering.And especially in these days where so many dodgy stories are coming out about people....he seems like a genuine guy, doing good in the world, and seems to have coached literally everyone not only in fitness but coaching too!So give it a watch, it's well worth it....not sure how some are giving it a 1 star.....that seems crazy.....maybe something weird going on as I think it's a solid watch!",False
13,10,Extremely Inspiring,vegardmikalsen-65783,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have watched all the generation iron films and this is by far the most inspiring.Being an online coach and having a lot of people around me in the online coaching business where I live in Norway, having a look at how Phil puts together his team and clients is so cool to see.It's on another level from what I've seen before.People are writing about it not being about AI, but I don't think they are the target group of this movie either. This does a great job at solving the fear many people in the service business has around AI.I think it's safe to say AI is not replacing the coaching business for the people who put in the correct work now.",False
14,10,Watched Fitrepreneur - Really Good,SeanM-601,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just finished this documentary about Phil Graham. Not gonna lie, it was way better than I expected.So Phil's this guy from Belfast who got diabetes as a kid. He was overweight, never worked out, basically had everything going against him. Now he runs this huge coaching business and has helped over 12,000 people. Pretty crazy.What I liked:It's real. No fake drama or trying too hard to be inspiringShows how he actually built his business day by dayHe was using AI stuff back in 2022 before everyone elseYou see his actual work routine - it's not fancy, just hard workI watched half last night and my mom (who usually hates this stuff) made me wait to finish it with her today. That never happens.The best part is that Phil doesn't act like he's special or had some secret. He just shows you what he did. Started from nothing, had health problems, came from a small town where people didn't expect much from him. Sound familiar?If you're trying to start a business or get in shape, definitely watch this. Even if you're not, it's still a good story about not letting bad stuff stop you.",False
15,10,Great watch for fitness entrepreneurs,AM-577,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great watch. Shows true grit, and response to life advertisity.

16,10,What a great watch,LukeJ-69,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just watched Phil Graham's new film with Generation Iron and honestly, it's something special. It's not just a fitness documentary; it's a reminder of what's possible when you refuse to let your circumstances define you. The message is powerful, the storytelling is raw, and the impact is real. Phil speaks with honesty and purpose, and you walk away feeling motivated to raise your standards in life. Even if you're not into bodybuilding, this film will hit home. It's about inner strength, resilience and taking full ownership of your journey. A must watch that will stick with you.Can't wait to watch the next generation iron film!",False
17,10,Inspiring,imdbfan-760164,n/a,15/08/2025,Have followed Phil for a few years but only know him for being a prominent figure in the fitness industry.Had no idea about the health issues he had and the way he was able to overcome then to become so successful in the bodybuilding world.I found the documentary really insightful and inspiring to anyone looking to make an impact in business and help others mirror the same success Phil has clearly had.He came across as very real and honest.It was refreshing to see him openly talk about his school experience and the impact it had for his personal growth and the mentality it helped him create.,False
18,10,A must watch,TheC-4330,n/a,15/08/2025,This was epic from start to finish. Some great work and insights Phil. Keep up the good work. What i like most about phil and this movie is what he has built when he came from a normal background to now smashing it on a daily basis. If you do not agree with how good the movie is maybe re watch it and pay attention next time around.,False
19,10,Great watch for any Fitpro!,AaronF-572,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great watch showing Phil's life, and how he came through the industry from the ground up, and built a multi million business by consistency, and vision.What he delivers on his mentorship's is far beyond what you even see here.You want the good stuff, simply follow him on socials and you'll know.(Have to repeat to hit minimum word count)Great watch showing Phil's life, and how he came through the industry from the ground up, and built a multi million business by consistency, and vision.What he delivers on his mentorship's is far beyond what you even see here.You want the good stuff, simply follow him on socials and you'll know.",False
20,10,Inspiring story on defying circumstance,ChrisB-2318,n/a,15/08/2025,"Refreshing to see a real story of a normal person really making life work for them and defying circumstance.Most fitness documentaries are about someone who has shot to hyper fame for something or other from a young age, the usual ups and downs etc...This is not another one of those.Much more relatable, especially if you are from a small town where people often don't want to see you win.100% worth watching for anyone interested in real-world personal growth, the intersection between fitness and business or just a good story of aspiration.I watched it in 2 parts with my Mum who is in her 60s and she wanted me to wait for her before recommencing so that's a good indicator of a decent documentary in today's world.",False
21,10,Inspiring!,DavidB-1055,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary showed a great insight into how Phil has overcome a chronic illness to fuel success both physically and financially through his businesses.He is one of the world's leading business coaches coming from a small part of the world, Northern Ireland and is highly regarded globally as the go to for building successful fitness businesses .

22,10,A great watch and very motivating,KevinB-316,n/a,15/08/2025,From someone who is in the fitness world. I found this very inspiring. What Phil went through and how to adopted and over came certain situations. He then used these situation to his advantage instead of disadvantage.To see what is achievable when the right action steps are taken and alined to your vision. Phil has been a leader in this industry for multiple years. Pushing the boundaries on what is achievable.It was also great to get an insight into some of Phil's daily actions that he still does today even with his success.If you are a business owner or in the fitness industry this is a must watch.,False
23,10,"Real, raw and ridiculously inspiring",imdbfan-715165,n/a,15/08/2025,"Phil Graham's story is unreal. Diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, overweight, never been near a gym...he said FK it, mastered his condition, built a bodybuilding career, dominated, then flipped that into a global business coaching empire.It was powerful to see the story, struggle, mindset, and strategy behind how Phil used his diabetes as fuel to coach something crazy like 12,000 entrepreneurs by age 35 and build a multi-million net worth, all while staying grounded and family-focused.You get full access to his life, mindset, team, and even how they built their own AI tool back in 2022 before anyone else was doing it. He took something that was meant to kill him and turned it into a mission.Tbh. I was skeptical at first, like most people are with these so-called experts, but Phil is 100 percent real. He's lived it, earned it, and now he's helping entrepreneurs in every industry build serious businesses. The film is solid. He's the real FKing deal. Pure beast.",False
24,10,Honest & Powerful watch. A masterpiece in Resilience and Reinvention,Conlon-965,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just finished Fitrepreneur. As a business owner and fitness enthusiast, I found it genuinely powerful from start to finish.It follows Phil Graham's story growing up in Belfast with Type 1 diabetes and how he used every challenge to shape something meaningful. There's nothing exaggerated or overpolished about it. You get a clear picture of what it really takes to build something solid when everything seems stacked against you.It's not just about business or fitness. It's about staying focused when life doesn't hand you the perfect setup. Phil didn't just change his own life. He helped reshape how people see the fitness industry. What used to be viewed as a backup plan is now a serious path because of the work he's done.In a time where things move fast and attention is scattered, this film cuts through the noise. It shows what real work and real leadership look like, without trying too hard to impress.If you're into business or fitness, or you just appreciate a story with depth and honesty, watch it. You'll walk away with a lot to think about.",False
25,10,Definitely worth a watch,Adam-1995,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have known ""of"" Phil Graham since his appearances in Muscle and Fitness magazine etc and also the early days of social media but I never really connected to him.It hasn't been until recently I have started to resonate and connect with his message...When I saw on social media that he is the subject of this production I thought I had to see what it was about.I was a little sceptical at the start and thought it may just be a lot of smoke blowing but I was wrong.What a journey he has had so far!If you want to be inspired by someone who has faced adversity not only from the area he lived, and also health conditions, and see someone come out not only on top but also rewrite the play book then you need to watch this.A great documentary and one I will be recommending to people.",False

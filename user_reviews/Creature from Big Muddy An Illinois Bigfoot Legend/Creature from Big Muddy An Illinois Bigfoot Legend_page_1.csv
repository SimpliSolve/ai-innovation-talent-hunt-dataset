1,9,Hometown,davidkdavidk,n/a,16/08/2025,I grew up in Murphysboro. I was there in the seventies when much of this went down. I knew the people involved and some of the locals featured. Southern Illinois is rugged country and has produced rugged people. I'd advise strangers not get too far off the worn paths. Go Red Devils.,False
2,10,The Big Muddy Monster Is Real!,heraty-leona,n/a,16/08/2025,I thoroughly enjoyed this fascinating documentary about the legend and sightings of the Big Muddy Monster. The witnesses who encountered the scary creature give credible statements and they are very believable. The scariest testimony is the final one from the tow truck driver and his friend who encountered the creature at his shop! It's enough to give me nightmares!,False
3,8,Surprisingly good,helicreature,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was quite obviously low budget at the start and I wasn't holding out much hope - but actually it was considered, intelligent, and had some fantastic eye witness accounts. Much better than a lot of the much higher budget Bigfoot documentaries I have seen.",False

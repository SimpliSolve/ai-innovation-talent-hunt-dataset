1,10,Absolutely stunning,Nombredemes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Karol G represents everything what's right about enforcement, self-belief, and courage. She has been through a lot and she never back down or gave up, proving to everyone (but most important, to herself) that she is able to fulfill her goals above anything that comes in her way. She has opened her heart and showed us a vulnerable and very personal part of her, fascinating us with her autenticity. Her struggle demonstrates that anyone can make it, no matter what. Her kind heart is what put her where she is; her love to what she loves to do and the loyalty to all the people who loves her back. Karol G is a living proof that if you fight and work hard for what you dream of, you're gonna be: UNSTOPPABLE.",False
2,2,Pointless,cintiasilva-83799,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narrative is all over the place, not much of a logical or chronological sequence to her story/biography.Scenes like the airplane one feel like the producers simply dumped and mixed random facts about her and not much context is added, even with her own comments it all sounds very vague and lacking proper context. Maybe because her life events are not that interesting?Tries to portrait women's rights in a very superficial way and feels forced. Like they had to humanise her to make her character somehow relatable...
An overall pointless documentary of almost 2h, not much depth or context to it, giving the idea that is just another revenue stream for the artist or made out of vanity.",False

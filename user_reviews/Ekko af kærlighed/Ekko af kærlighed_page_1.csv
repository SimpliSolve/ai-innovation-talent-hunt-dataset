1,10,"An ode to love, going straight to the heart!",richarddikkers,n/a,16/08/2025,"We saw this movie during the International Documentary Festival Amsterdam (IDFA) 2023, where it was selected as one the four audience favorites.Not knowing exactly what to expect, we encountered this beautifully directed documentary about several unrelated elderly Danish individuals who have in common all to have lost their loved one after decades long relations. The individuals are interviewed about their relations, the grieve, how they fell in love, etc.The camera close-ups during the interviews make it extremely intimate and real. The answers given by the lead characters are brutally honest, touching, open, funny and above all recognizable helping to understand your own relation with your partner, parents or any other person close to you.An ode to love!Go and watch it if you get the chance!",False

1,6,A Charles Shultz tribute? Yes and no.,Chris_Z6492,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a well tell documentary that uses the comedy and graphic style of Peanuts series. Nevertheless, the weird interpretation that some of the guests make about Shultz's work, forcing a relation with feminism, LGBT and racial issues, makes this documentary uncomfortable at some points. Especially taking in account that they deliberately cut all about his Christian faith. For example, they never talked about how the Christmas special ended with Jesus story and how that's the real meaning of Christmas.In summary, this is a documentary about Peanuts beginnings, their impact on society and how this could fits with some cultural agendas.",False
2,6,Good Grief,dleclair-3,n/a,16/08/2025,Who doesn't like Charlie Brown? I was hoping for a light-hearted informative biography on Charles' Schultz's life. I ended up with a politically-charged progressive woke film. I'm open minded and accept everyone but there were far reaches made in this doc that had nothing to do with the subject matter. Oh brother.,False
3,8,a blast from the past with intriguing background about the creation and nuances of Peanuts comic universe,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"A deeper look into an integral part of American childhood, Who Are You, Charlie Brown? Provides viewers with a blast from the past and some intriguing background information about the creation and nuances of the Peanuts comic universe.Packaged in documentary format, the show centers on Charles M. Schulz, the creator of Peanuts, and his life. Using animated vignettes from Charlie Brown, the viewer learns how Schulz's childhood and many parts of his own life plus the lives of those near and dear to him influenced several prominent characters and motifs in the award-winning Peanuts series. Some examples include the Little Red-Haired Girl, Franklin Armstrong, Lucy and Pig-Pen. Interviews with Schulz's widow, his close acquaintances, famous viewers and the people who brought Charlie Brown to life on-screen help paint an enthralling picture of the pensive and talented Schulz, as well as the context and subtext behind his legendary series.Who Are You, Charlie Brown? Is exactly what a biopic should be. Its length of about 50 minutes is perfect; its storytelling seamless; its animation immaculate. The interviews with people such as Drew Barrymore, a longtime Peanuts lover, and the archival footage and voiceovers of Mr. Schulz himself add great depth and emotion to the film. The sequence with Mr. Schulz, in his last days whilst battling cancer, describes his reaction to the overwhelming love he received for the Charlie Brown cartoons and will certainly make you tear up a bit.Who Are You, Charlie Brown? Has a clear mission - to answer the question posed in its title. This it does with efficiency, thoroughness and liveliness. However, a deeper message is posed in the framing of Schulz as a man who takes inspiration from both high points and low points in his life when creating art. For artists and non-artists, channeling elements of your life, whether happy or sad, positive or negative, to add poignant emotions to your work is an immensely powerful tool.I give Who Are You, Charlie Brown? 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 9 to 18, plus adults. Who Are You, Charlie Brown? Debuts globally Friday, June 25 on Apple TV+. Check it out!Reviewed by Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST.",False
4,6,Good Documentary But Sometimes Lacking Passion,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"'Who Are You, Charlie Brown?' is about the life of Peanuts creator, Charles ""Sparky"" Schulz. Overall its a good documentary, but I feel the animated segments are what holds this film back at times.I did not know a lot about Charles Schulz going into it, but this movie did a really good job at displaying and explaining Sparky's life and actions. I don't agree with some of the other reviewers here as I think that the documentary parts were pretty good for the most part as it showed how the Peanuts were impactful in so many different peoples lives and how they interpreted the characters. My only complaint for the interviews was that they seemed short and lacking passion at times.And maybe I'm biased but I found the animated story to be a good idea, but the animation itself seemed very ""corporate"" and a little out of touch than previous specials even from as recently as the early 2000's.In conclusion, this is a good but not great documentary. Great for those who have been impacted by Sparky and the Peanuts. Very inclusive and welcoming of all Peanuts fans! If you want to learn a little more about the creator of the Peanuts then give it a watch!",False
5,2,Ruined by Wokeism,steven512,n/a,16/08/2025,They went out of their way to push an agenda. Truly cringeworthy at times.,False
6,1,Could have been great but got ruined,OpinionGuy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary about charlie brown and his maker start out great. Then after the first 10min you start slowly to see where this is heading. Is it really impossible to honor anything from another time, without dragging in the lgbtq and feminist with their agenda?... dont waste your time watching this, stick to the old comics and catroon films. If anything get remaked avoid it as the pest.",False
7,5,Checkpoint Charlie,southdavid,n/a,16/08/2025,"In keeping up my record of watching all the movies on Apple TV, I landed on ""Who Are You, Charlie Brown?"" a documentary about Peanuts and its creator, Charles Schulz. Generally, I thought it was fine, but unlike other documentaries I couldn't overcome my disinterest in the subject matter to make the viewing worthwhile.Charlie Brown (Tyler James Nathan) is asked to produce a piece of homework, a 500-word essay on ""who he is"". Sent into an introspective funk, he asks his friends and schoolmates what they think of him. These animated sections are intercut with a documentary about Charles Schulz, utilising archive footage, with new talking head style interviews with his friends, family and pop culture fans to explore who he was.The biggest issue I had with this documentary was me. I know who the Peanuts characters are, and I've maybe seen that Halloween animated film a few times - but as Kevin Smith says ""Peanuts is ingrained into American Pop culture"" and I'm not American. What I'm saying is, I didn't approach this with much in built affection for his creation and, capable as though this documentary was, it never really inspired much within me.It's well made though. The conceit works, with the looping narrative of Charlie Brown exploring who he is, mixed in with the information we get about his creator. The talking heads are a mixed bag, some seeming like Peanuts had a genuine effect on their life and others, who I don't recognise, who seem prepared to say that they liked it and not much else. The insights from the family are best, and the footage of Schulz himself. It's quite emotional when he talks about giving up the strip as he's dying of colon cancer.It's an affectionate look at his life and work, mixed in with a new cartoon. Apart from the odd moment though, it's not honest or surprising enough to stick with me or convert me to an uberfan.",False

1,9,"Gives meaning to the phrase, save the best until last",TheLittleSongbird,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries.What stood out for me was not only the darkness of it, particularly the last thirty minutes or so which was a tad anti-climatic but very intense too and also Snape's death, but also the emotional impact. Gringotts(especially for the effects, the dragon being the standout), the moving Ressurrection stone sequence and Harry's final scene with Dumbedore were very well done, but my favourite was the Snape's memory sequence, which was beautifully done and quite poignant. Not only that, it's my favourite Harry Potter scene alongside the Three Brothers animated sequence and the Cave Scene. The 19 Years Later scene was quite affectionate as well, with the use of the original music and all.Once again, the production values are impeccable. The effects, apart from the odd ropey one in the Room of Requirement scene and Bellatrix's death, are excellent particularly at Gringotts, while the scenery and cinematography are magical with a touch of austerity too, and David Yates delivers his best directing job. There's also my favourite of Alexandre Desplat's scores, I loved his ones for Girl with a Pearl Earring and The King's Speech, the score was also one of the few good points about Twilight:New Moon and I found his score for the previous part very effective. What I loved though about this score was not just how beautiful, haunting and how incredibly melancholic it was, but also how much it enhanced the drama.The script is very good a vast majority of the time, doing a noble attempt to stick to the spirit of the book. The humour is less stilted and corny than I can find it to be, and when the tone is tense and poignant the writing does an above decent job reflecting that. The pacing is never dull, if deliberately less rushed(Goblet of Fire) or glacial(Deathly Hallows Part 1) as some of the other entries, and the storytelling is always interesting and compelling while never convoluted.The acting is very good. Rupert Grint is great as he consistently is, Emma Watson while not quite as good as she was in Deathly Hallows Part 1 gives one of her better performances of the series, Maggie Smith and John Hurt are always good value and while I didn't find him easy to warm to at first until Half-Blood Prince in his brief but relevant appearance Michael Gambon is also good. Helena Bonham-Carter, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane and Tom Felton while neither are at their best here bring a pleasing sheen to the film. Three actors in particular I found stood out and gave their best performances of the series. One is Daniel Radcliffe, at first I found him likable yet wooden with some questionable delivery, however overtime I think he's grown with more emotional range than usual. Two is Alan Rickman, while I have considered him one of the more consistent actors of this series him and the character of Snape really shine here, Rickman is especially good in the Snape's memory sequence. Three is Ralph Fiennes, I think it helps that like Snape Voldemort is given more scope here, that said Fiennes is appropriately sinister in the role and certainly looks the part.In conclusion, a wonderful film and for me the best of the series. And I still stand by my initial feeling that it was better filming the book as two movies, it would've have felt far too rushed as one. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",True
2,8,The series ends on a very strong note.,Pjtaylor-96-138044,n/a,15/08/2025,"The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10",False
3,9,An Exhilarating and Beautiful Conclusion to a Magnificent Saga.,theycallmemrglass,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw this at a preview screening in London.Deathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.If you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion.There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story.I have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing).Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.Oh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end.",False
4,n/a,End of an era... End of our childhoods... End of Harry Potter,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.Go see this movie!",False
5,10,The Endgame of 2011,yugteng,n/a,15/08/2025,One of the best series I've ever seen with an amazing conclusion.. A bit emotional saying goodbye to all the characters after 10 years.Wish I could forget the whole thing and watch it again for the first time. Would do anything to rewatch it in theatres.Recommended.,False
6,10,My childhood..,hjpog,n/a,15/08/2025,"At the start of J.K. Rowling, thank you for this wonderful series of books forever. I can tell you this current state of my childhood and my future. Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on. When the film ended up being a very big gap within you. Of course, you are a part of this world...",False
7,10,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II gets everything right to send off Harry on a cinematic high,Loving_Silence,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film.The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.",False
8,10,LIGHTNING HAS STRUCK,nogodnomasters,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPerhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.The direction of Chris Columbus was by far the best as well as the screen adaptations, which more closely followed the books. Starting with the third installment, the audience got short changed (There, I said it) especially those who didn't read the books...such as myself. This wasn't a bad thing as it led to a bonding with my niece who did read the books and I would take her to the films so she could explain them to me. Like Hermione, she is one of those ""insufferable know-it-alls"" who loves to let you know what she knows. (Good luck with that brain surgeon thing.)In this final episode, the gang of 3 go after the remaining Horcrux(s) which are now easier to locate than in the last 2 films. This one follows the later films in that it lacks the humor of the earlier ones.The movie, like the series drives home the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage. Goblins, spiders, troll, elves, death eaters, a dragon, and of course he who we do not speak. Personally, I would have done the ending differently, especially with Snape and Malfoy. But I don't want to discuss any possible plot spoilers.",True
9,7,Satisfying end to the series,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie continues right after the death of Dobby, and closes out the Harry Potter series. There is a lot of action in this one, and it closes out the series satisfactory.If there is any problem, it's that the ideas behind horcroxes are somewhat confusing. They never really explained it easily or clearly. It's a difficult subject that the passing movie goers would best served by reading the books. Even with the books, some aspects could still be murky. The need for explanations requires some slower sections. The pacing still goes well. It does a passable job. The most important part is the exciting battles. It's a thrilling end and a satisfying one for fans of the series.",True
10,10,"""It all ends"" well",cchip96,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come.",False
11,7,"Good Movie, But a Disappointing & Unsatisfying End to the series...",akash_sebastian,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOverall, it may be said that the movie was good. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.But, this isn't the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end. A movie which is supposed to mark the End of an Era could have been much better. With the expectations I had, I was a little disappointed. It DID NOT have the depth and the emotional impact WASN'T nearly as good as the book.I was pleased with Part 1 because it stuck very well to the book. That's what I was expecting with this too. But no... they had to spoil it. What's the use of making the movie in two parts if they can't do justice to the book? They should have made it a Trilogy (as all great movies are made, like 'The Godfather Trilogy', 'The LOTR Trilogy', original 'Star Wars Trilogy', The Bourne Trilogy', etc.) or they should have increased the length of the 2 parts. Who forced them to fit the whole thing within 2hrs.15mins. each. ??(Every part of LOTR is over 3&1/2 hrs. long. No one had an issue with it). . *** SPOILERS **THE GOOD :Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well.Throughout the series, Snape has been rather emotionless and monotonous. But, in the pensieve, we see a refreshingly new emotional side of him.Gringott's scene was nicely shown.They added the scene where Hermione & Ron destroy Hufflepuff's cup.They show the future (19 years later) scene. I thought it would be cut.THE BAD : (I have to mention these because I was disappointed as hell)My Biggest Disappointment - Snape's Memories. They showed the whole thing within a minute. They're some of the most interesting & touching scenes of the story. They just rushed through it, even excluding many of the memories.Fred's death. They don't even show it. Then later it was ridiculous to see Mrs. Weasley angry at Bellatrix when the latter was fighting Ginny.The battle was too short and didn't the magnitude and impact as in the book, with Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Spiders, Ghosts, etc.They don't show the Common Rooms. I always imagined it while reading the books. But I badly wanted to see them in the movie.They don't show Harry using the Cruciatus Curse on the one of the Carrows.They wasted time in Nagini's chase.They don't mention about Teddy Lupin and that Harry was his Godfather. They don't mention the names of Harry's other two kids.No mention about the significance of the horcruxes.No mention of Bloody Baron and his link with Ravenclaw's diadem.No mention about how the Invisibility Cloak came into the possession of the Potters, how Harry and Voldemort are related through the Peverell brothers.They don't show how Dumbledore communicated with Snape after he died.Harry doesn't even mend is wand. He directly snaps the Elder Wand into two pieces...In the future scene, all the funny and cheerful dialogues are excluded. Everyone's just smiling and staring at each other. And moreover, none of the them seemed in their late thirties. Didn't the film-makers have enough money to hire good make-up artists.THE UGLY :Dumbledore's Story. He's my most favourite character in the book. There's nothing about him in the movie. They just say he had secrets (what secrets??). They don't even tell the story of Dumbledore sister, Ariana. They don't show him getting emotional at King's Cross.The use of ridiculous one-liners and humourless jokes when the situation is so intense and sad.Harry & Voldemort had their final fight in the middle of nowhere. No one was even around to watch it. (In the book, they were in the middle of the whole crowd.)Bellatrix and Voldemort die bursting into confetti!ALL IN ALL, it wasn't the send-off the series deserved. Someone who has grown up reading the books and watching the movies in the series will understand my woes...",True
12,10,Epic End,ephoratus,n/a,15/08/2025,Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10,False
13,6,"Good, But Disappointing",DoctorBatmanPotter,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and was very pleased with how well it stuck to the book. Because of this, I had high expectations for Part 2. I mean, if you did so well in the first half, you have to do just as well in the second half, right? Right? Wrong.The movie started off very well, starting from exactly where it left off in Part 1 and staying faithful to the book all the way to when Harry and co break into Hogwarts. That's where it starts to go down hill.*Spoilers!*The good:Neville. He was perfectly perfect. I really wish they gave him more screen time because he was adorable.The Gringott's scene. Very well done.The emotion we are shown from Snape. Throughout the series, he's been rather monotonous and emotionless. In the pensieve, we see a different side of him and it is a refreshing change.The battle at Hogwarts. It was intense and wonderfully done.Helena Ravenclaw. It was very emotional and creepy. Although they did not tell us her back story with the Bloody Baron.Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe shirtless. That's certainly a plus.OK you know it's bad when I resort to writing about that.The bad:They completely took out the scene where Harry and Luna go into the Ravenclaw Common Room, where they are ambushed by one of the Carrows. It appeared as if they would show it, as I hope they would (I've always wanted to see the other common rooms), but then they don't. Hm.Fred's death scene. Gone. Yup. They show his body once at the end and don't even give you time to grieve before moving on to the next scene. This was an insult to his character's memory.Crabbe's disappeared. Gets replaced by Zabini, and replaced in a different way by Goyle.Snape's memories are rushed and they take out some of the most interesting memories. They just go through a few of them quickly. I've always enjoyed the memories, because you get to see life at Hogwarts through the eyes of someone else for a change, in a different time era.Hermione and Ron battle Nagini, and eventually Neville slays the snake. Eventually. It takes some time getting to that scene.There is not a single mention of Teddy Lupin. That is, until the end when Harry suddenly knows about Lupin's son. Weird, considering Harry was camping in a forest and hadn't heard of any of this.Collin Creevey is replaced by that random Nigel kid.The students are not sent home. No, the teachers think it's OK to just lock the Slytherins in the dungeons and let everybody else stay and fight.Still no mention of the significance of the horcruxes. Hufflepuff's cup is just a plain old cup that Voldy turned into a horcrux.Not enough interaction with characters other than the trio. Too much Harry. It's as if everybody else just have cameos.Random scene where they blow up one of the bridges (ignoring the fact that there are like 2 other bridges that would take them into the school).Voldemort's and Bellatrix's death = explosion into confetti!Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all (a reoccurring theme with Yates, don't you think?).Harry does not fix his old wand with the Elder Wand. No, instead he takes the Elder Wand and SNAPS IT IN HALF. Is that even possible? I didn't think so. So Harry breaks the wand and then chucks it into the abyss. Really Yates, really?All of the fun and cheerful dialogue from the future scene has been resorted to everybody staring and smiling at each other. No explanation once again. They don't even say who's who! Plus there is absolutely no chemistry between Dan and Albus Severus. And it was really awkward to see them all with old make up on.Goodbye Dumbledore's back story!Too many attempts at one-liners and humorless jokes.*End of Spoilers*All in all, all of the personality and charm of the series was zapped away in an attempts to make this final movie is action-packed as possible. It's a shame to see something that you've grown up with, learned to love, taken and twisted into somebody's 'vision.' I mean, why bother adding your own unimportant scenes to the movie, when there are perfectly good ones in the book that you did not bother using at all? There's no...bonding with the characters, no connection with them you felt in Part 1. I did not feel the love for this movie like I had with the book. There was just so much significance that was left out of that movie, and it is such a shame. It had such potential to be a fantastic movie, and it fell short all because of the changes that were unnecessarily made.See the movie, and I'm sure you'll form your own opinion of it. It's not a bad movie, just disappointing and unsatisfying for a die-hard fan who's been following the books for 10 years of their life.",True
14,3,David Yates managed to kill the end of the series,vane117,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSERIOUS SPOILERS INCLUDED ***************************** David Heyman, the Producer of the Harry Potter films, made the single biggest mistake of his career when he decided that the Director of each film would be offered the opportunity to direct the next. Chris Columbus did a great job working with the young inexperienced actors and actresses in the first 2 films. Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did good jobs with the next 2 (I wish Goblet of Fire had been split into 2 films to include many more subplots, but the primary emotional content was maintained). For various reason, each of these three directors stopped.Then David Yates entered the scene and proceeded to dramatically change the feel of the films. For lack of a better word, the ""magic"" was expunged and everything took on a more ""realistic"" look. Films 5 and 6 were terrible compared with the books. I initially blamed 5 on the fact that Steve Kloves did not write the screenplay, but I now know I was wrong.The film of Deathly Hallows, Part I was OK, but it was simply the setup for the emotional second half.I just saw Deathly Hallows, Part II this evening and I was speechless. In addition to adding useless parts to the narrative, critical emotional scenes were eliminated (e.g. final conversation with Dumbledore and the final conversation between Harry and Voldemort/Tom Riddle where Harry gave Voldemort on last chance to find remorse).Yates even managed to suck the life out of one of the most exciting moments in the book, where Molly Weasley intervenes to save Ginny from Bellatrix and yells ""Not my daughter, you bitch!"" In the film, Molly calmly makes this statement as if she is some western gunfighter.The final scene between the 3 main characters (not including the epilogue) had NO life at all.David Yates - shame on you.Thank goodness we will always have the books.",True
15,n/a,Huge expectations not met,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't even describe in words how much I was looking forward to this movie! Deathly Hallows is my favorite Harry Potter book, and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is my favorite Harry Potter movie. All of the trailers and featurettes and early reviews made the movie sound absolutely amazing. I try usually not to let hype get my expectations up too much, but in this case I couldn't help it. I was fully expecting the series to go out with a bangLet's start with my general, spoiler-free opinion. Were my high expectations met? Sadlyno. It was a big let-down, actually. It didn't feel like part of DH 1. It was more similar in tone to the Half-Blood Prince movie to me for some reason. It was too short and just felt chopped up. Like HBP, it seemed like a lot more was filmed, but then it was hacked in the editing room. And then I read that this was exactly the caseAll of the actors, practically, from the previous films are back- for mostly blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos. The battle was lackluster and anticlimactic. At points it felt rushed, at other points too slow. A lot of the dialogue was changed and didn't feel right. The relationships were handled awkwardly. This is just my purist side, but a lot was changed from the book. I didn't think it would be that way, after Part 1. It really let me down.Was it a terrible movie? By no means. The acting was good, the special effects were great (though I wouldn't pay the extra money for the 3D), and some of the scenes did hit the mark. I know I bashed it pretty hard up there, but, really, the majority of my complaints are based only on the changes from the book. I'm judging it not really for the movie it was but for the movie it could have been, the movie I wanted it to be. The hype definitely ruined things for me. I feel like I would have liked it better if I hadn't read the books. But then again, my brother, who has only seen the movies, was also let down. He was disappointed by the lack of a bit epic battle scene that he was expecting there to be.And now, to put in some spoilers:My main complaint is that the film was too rushed. It was the shortest in the series, yet it didn't need to be. This was the ending, so I feel like they could and should have taken all the time possible to make it perfect. A lot of the key points and characters from the book are in there, but for a split second! Hardly anything made much of an emotional impact on me because it was just BANG, move on to another scene without any time to digest anything. The moments that moved me the most were The Prince's Tale and The Forest Again, because they were slower pace. Like a lot of Part 1, they gave the scenes time to breathe so I could actually digest what was happening.I was so disappointed with the lack of the side characters. They were all brought back and there was all this build-up in the beginning leading the audience to believe that they would be featured in some epic battle scenes. But they weren't! We saw a couple cool shots of them getting ready for the battle and a couple seconds of them fighting, but that was it. Lupin and Tonks had one nice moment reaching their hands out to each other, but that was it before we see their dead bodies. We never learned about their son, so when Harry mentions it in The Forest Again, instead of being an emotional moment, it's just a head-scratcher. The same goes for Fred Weasley. The twins have a nice but waaay too brief scene on the roof and Fred's only line in the movie is ""yeah."" I was so mad we didn't get the wonderfully written, abrupt, and tragic death scene in the book- or at least have him featured in the movie a bit more! Lavender Brown is clearly brutally killed, but it's never mentioned again. Hagrid is mysteriously absent during the whole movie until he suddenly shows up as the Death Eaters' hostage in the forest. How did he get captured? What was he doing the whole time?My next big complaint also has to do with battling- namely, the handling of the Molly/Bellatrix and Harry/Voldemort duels. Where were the audiences during these scenes? Molly vs. Bellatrix is over in a second with no one watching. The intensity of the book scene is totally absent because it's over in a split second and it wasn't treated as as big of a deal. Mrs. Weasley just smiles in satisfaction to herself afterward, which I felt was totally out of character. Harry and Voldemort's duel, on the other hand is terribly drawn out to be made more ""cinematic."" I didn't really care to see them falling over the side of the castle or the Dragonball Z-esque drawn-out shot of their spells colliding. And then Voldemort just disintegrates once Neville kills the snake? Okay, I get that all his horcruxes are gone, but he still actually has to be killed! I never saw the spell actually hit him. And once again, like Molly and Bellatrix, no one is watching. And afterward- where's the reaction from everyone? They're all just chilling in the Great Hall waaay too casually. No cheers and whoops or sobbing and laughter? It was too toned down.Ah, my expectations were just way too high for this. The wonderful book and Part 1 just got my hopes up so much.

16,9,Better Ending,TourettesPersonal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.For me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not, you'll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series.",False
17,10,A 2021 opinion of someone who has not read the novel and watched the series at two different decades of his age,faaiisal-50256,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the beginning, I want to thank the author j.k. Rowling, even tho I didn't read her books but I saw it in this magnificent series of films
I didn't read it because English is not my native language and at that time I didn't learn it yet,so I didn't think the translated version will be as great as the original.But now after what I have seen in the series twice, I am considering reading it After I improved my English over the years.About the series, I saw it when I was younger nearly 10 and it was great but now when I saw it a second time while am 19 I understand it and appreciate it more it becomes greater, I wished I saw it in theater Yet None of its value has been lost by watching it on the tv.At third. As for the characters, there were great performances from all of them, but I loved the most harry and Hermione and comes second snape, Sirius, Hagrid, 2001's dumbledore, luna, Wesley.It's by far The largest number of great characters I've seen in one movie series.In the end. About this last part of the series, it created a perfect ending Any fan would seek for, I won't spoil by talking about details but I've experienced every emotion I have on it.It was really a masterpiece by all what it means.",False
18,10,Brilliant!,kjm92,n/a,15/08/2025,"I predict this will be the movie of the year.I was thoroughly immersed in this movie from start to finish and when leaving the cinema (twice in the last 24hours) I could only hear the endless chatter of comments like ""That was great"" and ""Brilliant way to end the series"".Though, in my opinion, some key factors were missing or needed more exploration I think you'll find it's easy to clue on whether you've read the novels or not. Some previously main characters were lucky to slip in a line or two whilst some of the more minor characters sneaked their way up to the top.The film was brilliantly directed. Music, lighting, script; everything was flawless. Some scenes had my skin crawling and heart racing for absolutely no reason other then the fact that it was utterly eerie, it was hard not to grip the armrests in anticipation.Dramatic musical build up mixed perfectly with lingering silences in all the right places. Spots that would usually host a soft violin were left with the honest and real quiet so that you could wrap your head around everything.My emotions were chewed up and spit out over and over, I didn't know whether to grieve, cheer, laugh or scream and neither did the audience I was with.By the end I couldn't even think of the fact that it was the end of an era, I couldn't even grasp everything that had happened which is why I'll be going to see it for the third time within this next week.You wont regret paying for the full experience with this one.",False
19,10,The Movie Of The Year,elie-fares16,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 2 also known as the movie that tore my heart and soul into oblivion. If you thought goosebumps was the criteria for a good scene, then mix those goosebumps with emotional upheaval, coupled with your hands almost shaking and this is Deathly Hallows part 2 in its entirety.Harry, Ron and Hermione are still on the pursuit to collect and destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. They believe the next one is hidden away in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in Gringotts, the wizarding bank. But going into the bank is near impossible – unless you know a goblin who worked there, which they do. And so a deal is stricken. At Gringotts, they are discovered to be impostors. Hearts will race as they try to escape with the horcrux and as Harry soon finds out the next one is hidden inside Hogwarts and it's something that belongs to another founder of the school. And it is to Hogwarts that he goes. But Hogwarts has changed. Snape is the new headmaster.But there are many things that Harry doesn't know, the ultimate secret being one that revolves around his every being. Things are never as it seems. People will show their true colors and they will come out as triumphant even after years of hatred.Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have done the impossible here. They are possibly the only set of actors that you have seen grow up on the big screen and as the actors grew up on a personal level, they added their maturity to their characters. It's very fascinating to watch them interact. Their acting is relentless, captivating and charming as it should be now that they have mastered the characters they're playing. You cannot imagine other actors portraying Harry and Ron or another actress to portray Hermione.Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith as Snape and Professor McGonagall respectively gave their all in this movie. You cannot help but be on the edge of your seat whenever any of these two actors are doing their thing. Rickman has a part of the movie entirely dedicated to his character's personal story. It is also one of my favorite parts of the book. The Prince's Tale is transferred so magnificently on screen that it WILL bring you to tears.Professor McGonagall takes a stand – several, actually – in Deathly Hallows as well. She stands up for a Harry and when she does, the whole theater will explode in applause. Maggie Smith fortifying Hogwarts and then cracking a joke to lighten up the mood Just the way I like it. You cannot but share the pain in Smith's eyes as she sees her beloved school crumbling around her, as she sees all the work that they've done go to wasteAnd what better actor to portray this generation's most bad-ass villain than Ralph Fiennes. He gives his character an extra dimension in this movie now that he has the room to spread his wings so to speak, seeing as he's one of the movie's main pillars. Lord Voldemort is all evil. But in this movie, another side of him shows up: anguish and misery. And yet, there's this subtlety to the nuances of the portrayal that make up the overall result to be very epic, indeed.Steve Kloves is the movie's screenwriter. He captured the movie's essence perfectly. He presented J.K. Rowling's work in such a brilliant way that even the slight deviations from the book (and they are very few) do not even matter anymore. He portrays the gravity of the situation to the letter: the deaths, the destruction, the revelations, the build-up. His version of the story is so well done that it would be incredible not to see an Oscar nod (and a win!) for him in the Screenplay category. He added his touch while keeping Rowling's magic. Some of the lines from the book are transferred to the movie as they are and for someone who has read the book over and over again, I was ecstatic to hear them on screen. ""Look atme."" Enough said.Director David Yates has helmed the last four Potter movies and while I had my doubts about him at first (Order of the Phoenix was not exactly great), he more than surpassed my wildest expectations in this. The pace he sets for the movie never dies down. It keeps on building up and up like a beautiful orchestral crescendo. He guides his actors and actresses with confidence. He's working with a marvelous script based on a terrific book. And he has the green light to give it all out. What do you expect from a very talented director with those options? Something not less than magical.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 provides you with a sense of catharsis as it ends. It lets your senses go. It lowers your inhibitions more than alcohol. You cannot help but see your hands automatically clap at some points in the movie. You shout in desperation without even controlling your voice and you root for your characters like they're really in front of you. Tears flow down your face without any power of you to stop them. There isn't any better way to end the epic series that was Harry Potter. If only it weren't ending",True
20,6,"2 Films for 1 Book, yet misses 1/4 of the story....",ruddaga,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't know what I was expecting... To be honest apart from the first HP movie... every single one of the following movies has left out major plot points, characters and story lines. I guess I figured that was mainly because the movies only have a certain length of time to tell the story. Thus it was natural for me to assume that with 5+ hours they would be able to include everything in the one book... I assumed wrongly.First off - Do not see this in 3D... The 3D is an after thought and literally added nothing to the experience. The only scene that was 3D that stands out in memory was the death of Voldemort and his confetti explosion.What did they get right? Well its hard to say really.. I was really disappointed with the pacing for the first half of the 2nd part. It felt slow and weird and anti-climatic the entire way. The bank scene and special effects seems average and low budget for a franchise with such high profits. The acting from everyone doesn't quite do the job. Snapes ""redemption"" scene was acted out really poorly by Alan Rickman.. which is a shame because I was really looking forward to it as it's one of the more moving parts in the series. The only scene that felt like it mirrored the book accurately was the Kings Cross section (apart from Harry having clothes on...) My main gripe with the movie is that they left out so much considering they had two movies to cover it. Harry telling Neville to kill the snake and thus Neville having and important role in the ending of the war <- This part was the ONE part I was looking forward to when Neville pulls the sword out of the hat and cuts Nagini in two... Yet they changed it to Hermione and Ron battling the snake and Neville coming in as an afterthought... The entire war at the end was missing - Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Aragog and just felt very anti-climatic and also have very poor CGI. The entire point of the Deathly Hallows is missed out with Harry not claiming ownership of the wand and reflecting Voldemorts death spell back onto him, and is replaced with a VERY tame action scene that went for about 10 minutes (its then mentioned as an afterthought by Harry post battle). The scene when Harry confronts Snape was also bizarre and seemed unnecessary... Overall the changes and missing scenes left me feeling very empty.My girlfriend hasn't read the books and she enjoyed it.. So I'm sitting here wondering if the knowledge of the books hampered my enjoyment of it. I have no doubt this film will be hailed a success and will make bazillon dollars, but I can't help but feel that another director/team could've handled this a lot truer to the books.",True
21,10,An exhilarating action-packed spectacle that delivers a magnificent finish to the beloved fantasy franchise,moviexclusive,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAn incredible journey that began a decade ago finally arrives at its close with David Yates' ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"", as 'The Boy Who Lived' comes face to face with 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' in an epic showdown between good and evil. And what a showdown it is- tense, thrilling, breathtaking, and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of.Whereas the first instalment of the 'Deathly Hallows' emphasised the profound sense of loss and isolation among Harry, Ron and Hermoine, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Yates leaves behind the moody atmosphere of the previous movie for newfound immediacy and urgency. This is all about that final battle where only one can live, and from start to finish- for once in a Harry Potter movie- the action is swift and relentless.Part II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.There is precious little time to waste, and the first we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione, they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their break-in settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film, as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuice-disguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first 'Harry Potter' movie in 3D, Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a roller-coaster ride through the vault, culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.But as readers of the book will tell you, the last stand happens back at Hogwarts, and true enough, after this thrilling early set-piece at Gringotts, the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be, and Harry's return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance.Fans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight- in particular, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic, and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic send-off they deserve.Yet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape's (Alan Rickman) vindication, long thought to be the Judas Iscariot-equivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape's true colours, and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an action-packed spectacle, it is to Yates' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling.Though brief, this revelation also works brilliantly as a catalyst that propels Harry to come to terms with the sacrifice he has to make. Harry's realization of this leads up perfectly to the ultimate duel between him and Voldemort, one that is fierce, ferocious and- thanks to Yates' imagination- more exhilarating than reading it off the page.The outcome of that battle shouldn't be a secret by now, and when the 'happily-ever-after' coda in Rowling's book set 19 years later is also faithfully adapted here, you can't quite help but be moved by how it so properly gives the series closure.They are of course no longer kids here- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson now young adults who have through the film series grown up right under our eyes. While Part I had greater emphasis on Ron and Hermoine, the focus here is squarely on Harry and Radcliffe truly shines in this instalment- his usual understated performance allowing his audience to appreciate the enormities of the challenge before Harry.That we can be so fully immersed in Harry's world is testament to the craft of each and every one of the technical team. Production designer Stuart Craig does a masterful job portraying the devastation around Hogwarts, complimented nicely by Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography and Mark Day's skillful editing. Alexandre Desplat's evocative score, which combines his own elegiac work with both the John Williams theme as well as Nicholas Hooper's mournful composition for the sixth movie, works magic with the visuals. And most deserving of credit is none other than director Yates himself, who has matured movie after movie to deliver a crowning achievement for the series.Pardon us if we have also taken this opportunity to extol the merits of the 'Harry Potter' franchise- it's really hard not to considering how this is the last time we will see the Potter-world in its current incarnation. It is this to which the movie is a farewell to, and it is as beautiful a farewell as it can be, packed with visual spectacle on a scale never before seen in any of the other films and fused with the same powerful emotion as Part I and the Yates films before. All good- even great- things have to come to an end, so there is really no better way to bid adieu than with this grand and glorious final chapter.",True
22,6,Felt Like I'd Been Hit With a Cruciatus Curse,cory-d-watson,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI was a late-comer to the Harry Potter series. I saw the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time right before the Half Blood Prince came out. Within a month of that first experience with the wizarding world, I saw all the films and read all the books thrice. I was hooked.The books are excellent in that they capture the innocence of youth and the pain of reality in a beautiful dichotomy that both kids and adults can relate with and enjoy. They are engaging, flow extremely well, and keep you on your toes the whole way through. They're as much mystery as fantasy, making the reader a part of the discovery process, and are a delight to read.The films, up to this point, portrayed those concepts brilliantly. The first two were bright, fun, and drew you in to a fascinating, surprising world. The middle three began to slowly grow darker, pulling you deeper into the emotions, fears, and relationships of the characters. The sixth and first half of the seventh saw the characters you had grown to love being forced to grow up quickly, confront their fears, and fight for their lives. It was with great excitement that I went into this final film...knowing that it was to house both the climax of the action and the final resolution.Following the movie, I walked out of the theater unsatisfied and annoyed. I'm not going to go on a tirade about what was left out that was in the books. That has been done exhaustively already. Instead, I will simply say that this movie ""missed it.""It missed the pain of the story. The physical pain of hot treasure in the vault was omitted. The emotional pain of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks' deaths seemed an afterthought, being given about 20 seconds. Where was the pain of Hagrid thinking Harry dead? Where was the pain of Helena Ravenclaw and her tragedy with the Bloody Baron? Where was Draco's pain, having lost two of his closest ""friends?"" The answer, there wasn't any. No pain at all.It missed the drama and emotion of the story. Aberforth had no emotion at all in his 10 second tirade on his brother (before Harry dismissed the conversation). The pensieve scenes were short, awkward, and didn't explain much of anything. Alan Rickman's tears while holding Lily were the only believable emotion in the entire film. And then there was Harry going to his death. Instead of him leaving the headmaster's office alone and walking straight to the forest, it saw him awkwardly informing Hermione of his plan, receiving an even more awkward hug, and then having an even more awkward talk with his parents, Serius, and Lupin (you'd think having only been able to talk to his parents for about 20 seconds during the priori incantatum in the graveyard in his life, that he'd at least look at his father more than once). Snape died in a boathouse instead of the symbolic shrieking shack where so many historical events had occurred. Neville's speech was embarrassing, and Voldemort's mannerisms after he thought Harry dead were laughable. The acting just seemed forced the entire way through. Emma and Rupert had no chemistry...seeming uncomfortable around each other. Overall, I wasn't drawn in, I was just watching things happen on a screen.It missed the action of the story. Yes, that's right. I don't care how many statues, giants, or dragon you have. I wanted to see Voldemort dueling three people at once. I wanted to see Kingsley Shacklebolt tearing into someone. I wanted to see Molly fight for more than 8 seconds with Bellatrix (and a little more passion in her cussing the woman who had just almost killed her daughter would have been nice). I wanted to see house elves stabbing people in the ankles with knives and centaur arrow wounds. Instead, I got a lot of giants with big sticks, a bridge exploding, and 3 minutes of chasing a snake around. The battles in the books were so good because real people whom you knew and really wanted to win fought them. This just looked like the fight scene at the end of Russell Crowe's Robin Hood with wands.Finally, it missed the closure of the story. Voldemort was not killed in a single, decisive moment. Instead, it consisted of 10 minutes of rolling, flying, physical punching (by the most powerful wizard in the world), and eventually a standoff where no words were spoken and Voldemort died by breaking into pieces and floating away. That might work in Transformers, but not the Potterverse. The bridge scene at the end with the disposal of the Elder Wand looked like they threw it in because they forgot to film anything else, and the epilogue was painfully awkward.While the movie had good special effects, it sadly played out more like a smash-fest Transformers than an emotionally charged Gladiator or Braveheart. It had some humor, but that was the closest thing to real emotion or drama you could find. Here's to Snape...the single redeeming factor in the entire film. I'm sorry to see the franchise go out this way. Maybe they'll release an extended edition that will redeem it somewhat. Here's to hoping.",True

24,6,"Explain, movie!! EXPLAIN!!!",nilanna999,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEverything that could have been said about this movie has probably been said.WHAT I LIKED: -I feel like I was the only one who really appreciated the use of humor in the movie, it was perfect. I loved the jokes and their timing. While this wasn't close to a comedy, it kept the charming humor of the previous Harry Potter movies and I appreciated that the movie didn't take itself TOO seriously.-Showing Hermione destroying the Horcrux. This was a scene I really hoped they'd show. In the book it was a brief mention. In the movie, they show the full scene. I also liked that, if they couldn't have Ron's comment defending the house elves as the reason Hermione kissed him, this was the next best reason.-Neville and Luna had larger roles in this movie. I was particularly pleased with Luna's larger role and that she had the guts to put Harry in his place.-The CGI was pretty good.-The acting is VERY good.-They change JK Rowling's plan in one minor way- by putting Neville and Luna together. TOO CUTE!! And just perfect!! -The original HP theme from the first movie at the end. It made me very emotional. I loved that they used John William's piece instead of making a new one. How sweet.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE -The timing was all wrong. The scene in which Mrs. Weasley kills Bellatrix Lestrange is just bizarrely placed, almost like they would have cut that scene if her one-liner hadn't become so famous.-Since when do people explode when they die? -Harry kills Voldemort without using his famous spell... it's just a random burst of red light from his wand. Not only that, Voldemort bursts into ashes. Random. An there's no dialog between them, just fighting. There's no one to see Harry finish him. A terrible way to change a great scene from the book.-There was NO explanation for ANYTHING!! I mean it, they set up Gridelwald's story... then never do anything with it. They never mention the third of the Deathly Hallows- the cloak. They never explain why Harry knows that Lupin has a son. They don't explain Dumbledore's back story, and so hinting to it is just frustrating. They never explain what happens to Harry's wand. They even don't explain why Harry isn't killed for real when Voldemort kills him. All in all, as a reader of the book, I understood it all but anyone who hadn't read it would be pretty lost.-Snape's flashbacks. They were okay but I hated the scenes of him crying over Lily's body in Godric's Hollow. EW!! It was creepy, never mentioned in the book, and almost seemed stalkerish. It didn't make me want to like Snape, it made me cringe!! Not only that, they never really explain that Snape was never Voldemort's after Lily's death.-Young Lily's eyes are very much BROWN in the flashbacks. They couldn't have put in some colored contacts? -No one looked 19 years older in the future scene. They looked weird. The prosthetic team failed miserably.-The future scene didn't show the kids much. Actually there was no dialog except between Harry and Albus. They couldn't have made the movie 5 minutes longer? All in all, they really should have explained more like in the last movie. It felt rushed. And confusing. Not the worst of the Potter movies (Goblet of Fire was worst) but not the best (Chamber of Secrets was best). So I gave it a 6. Pretty good. But not great.",True
25,4,Not half as good as expected,zin-splits,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler-CONTAINS SPOILERS-The Bad Sides:1. Lacked emotions. Seriously HP-7 lacked friendship, love everything. In one scene, when Harry walks to the Forbidden Forest to sacrifice himself...after ALL these times of being together, fighting together,..Hermione just cried and gave him a hug and did NOTHING. Ron was just standing there, saying nothing. What kind of friendship is this? They were supposed to be best friends! It got way away from the book.2. No real jokes.3. In one scene when Dumbledore's brother asked Harry where is Dobby, Harry answers so bluntly and quickly as if it doesn't matter at all - ""He's dead"".4. There were loop holes all around the place, no history about Ariana, Dumbledore, Horcruxes, and most horrible thing is that Harry breaks the elder wand whereas it was to be used to fix his real wand! And....etc.5. In the last scene, the boy who acted as Albus Severus...is a stupid child...they all sounded like ROBOTS. And no freaking jokes or punchlines! They totally ruined the ending.6. After killing Voldemort, OMG, no cheering no nothing? I was puzzled for a second if anybody knew that he really died or not...! It's awful.7. After Harry's 'dead' body was carried to the Hogwarts, except for Ginny everyone took it simply, I mean what the hell? You guys are all wooden characters!The only good side of this movie was when Harry got into Snape's memory, I cried again for Snape. :'(I'm really disappointed because Harry Potter series is my most favorite book series! I expected better.",True

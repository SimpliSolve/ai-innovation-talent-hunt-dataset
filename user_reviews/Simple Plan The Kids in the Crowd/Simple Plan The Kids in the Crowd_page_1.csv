1,8,Surprisingly emotional.,DUDE-I-DO-REVIEWS,n/a,16/08/2025,"In this documentary, we get to see how SIMPLE PLAN came to be and everything they went through to get to where they are today. It's packed with old footage and interviews with the band, other artists, family, and friends.I always love these kinds of documentaries, and THE KIDS IN THE CROWD is super fun, interesting, and surprisingly emotional. You can really feel the passion and heart come through the screen-especially during the interviews.The band-Pierre Bouvier, Chuck Comeau, Jeff Stinco, and SÃ©bastien Lefebvre-all seem like down-to-earth guys who just wanted to play music and have fun. It always came across in there music and love shows and it's front and center center in the documentary.It definitely has that nostalgia factor for me, since I was right there to see it all play out. I remember all the hate they got and how it wasn't really ""cool"" to be a SIMPLE PLAN fan back then. But being punk rock meant not caring what people thought and not following the norm-and that's exactly what they did. And it really worked out for them.I'm by no means a massive SIMPLE PLAN fan, but I truly am a fan. And this totally sparked a newfound interest in revisiting their discography.If you like the band, you'll love THE KIDS IN THE CROWD. And even if you're not really into them, there's still a lot here that might just win you over. Either way, it's a great story with tons of interviews, music, live performances, and throwbacks.Definitely worth checking out!They put in the work and deserve to be where they are today-and it's great to see that in the end... the world came around and gave them their due.",False

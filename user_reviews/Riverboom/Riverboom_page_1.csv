1,9,Amazing storytelling !,jaeger_anais,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story unfolds from the perspective of one of the three guys, who filmed their eventful road trip across Afghanistan on a camera he bought there. Seventeen years later, after losing track of the footage, he rediscovered it and decided to create a documentary.He narrates over these videos with a voice that draws us close, filled with humor, self-mockery, and genuine affection for his friends. His storytelling talent makes the 90-minute journey just as hilarious as it was touching, keeping me invested from the first to the last minute !Beyond the friendship and adventures, we get a rare look at Afghanistan in 2002. The flawless footage captures breathtaking landscapes, the scars of war, and the hope on people's faces.Watching this documentary felt like a journey itself. I left the theater feeling grateful to have witnessed this piece of art, and I'll be moved whenever it crosses my mind :))",False
2,10,An amazing and dangerous adventure,gerald-holt,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't really know what to expect when I went to see this movie. The title Riverboom is already quite mysterious (although there is finally an explanation), and one also wonders how they can release a documentary in 2024 that was filmed in 2002, especially in Afghanistan, where everything has once again changed since then.It turned out to be totally surprising and delightful. The fact that the video cassettes were lost for 20 years certainly made this a totally different movie than it would have been if it had been made quickly. The filmmaker was able to look upon the events with quirky detachment instead of finding everything dramatic and scary, which would have been the main impression immediately after the events. These guys almost got into serious trouble many times during their circle trip of the country.The inclusion of still photography, especially Afghan portraits, along with the video increased the impact as one tries to image what has become of these local people in the last 20 years. Some of them probably live in my neighbourhood, which is now called Little Kabul in Paris.",False

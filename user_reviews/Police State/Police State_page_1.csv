1,10,Don't believe everything you see and hear,cotyjburns-01051,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie does an outstanding job of showing the truth with evidence. Do your own research and you will not find a single false narrative throughout. Be carful the more you dog the more aware you will become. I challenge anyone to find something false in this movie and prove it. If you reference MAGA or FJB then you are the problem. We are all Americans first and untill we band together to open the eyes of others and our own politicians who work for us and not the other way around. We are nothing but a pay check to them and the DOJ has become an enforcement arm of the politicians. Why does the IRS need a swat unit?,False
2,10,Powerful and Terrifying,scottpainter-61600,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a must-watch film for every American. It will have you on the edge of your seat as it exposes the deep corruption that currently drives our government to target its own citizens. I can't recommend this film enough. The acting is incredible, and the true testimonies are powerful. It really opened my eyes to the great lengths that the US has gone to target its own people. This film succeeds in its goal to spread awareness about this issue, and I hope more Americans will realize the severity of the situation before our rights are taken away completely. Bring your friends and family and make a night out of it. You won't regret it and it will be a night to remember.",False
3,2,THE START...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler-signal for the presidential election 2024 has rung, introduced by the conservative right with this , rather conspirative pseudodocumantaric, propagandistic feature film called police state. Its pure and evil barrages of political heresays, a firestorm against the democratic party, secluded as a rise of nazism propaganda, that to some extent has ridden the united states since 9/11, a collective panic that set in all over the usa on terrorism and whatever worse...remember im an foreign bystander doing the fly on the wall watch what really is going on here, thank god wearnt that suspicious here in norway.This is political propaganda without documentation in the real world, at least not like it used to be in a free world., who financed this isnt much of a mystery, i just dont dare to say it cause im a grumpy old man.",True
4,10,Dinesh does it yet again!,toonarly,n/a,16/08/2025,"So glad a few real true and honest Americans are standing up against the idiocy going rampant in America today. This film should be required watching in all our schools, colleges, and especially universities. But even if we did, many would still scoff. What we really need is another 911 to wake everyone up again but it may have to be far worse to keep them awake this time, this movie basically tells of that ""beginning"" that is going on right now that will lead to a very real dystopian nightmare here if people do not wake up to it and stop it by getting involved and being concerned and doing something about it rather than sitting in comfort and being complacent. I hope this country can be turned around and soon, but this may not be the case. America is not mentioned in the Bible so we may not exist very shortly. Share this movie with all those you love that care about their dying country.",False
5,9,Must see TV,pensacolacomputer,n/a,16/08/2025,"No matter which side of the aisle you are on, this is a MUST SEE documentary. It is so sad that our country has come to this. I am almost 50 years old and never thought in million years our country would be in the situation that its in today. Growing up, you learned in History class that these types of things happened all over the world in other countries. And I felt so sorry for the people living in those countries. To have to be careful of what you say in your own country is not something I ever dreamed the United States of America would have to go through.Well, sadly those days are over. We should come together as a UNITED country and not let these things happen. I hope we can. The USA is the greatest country in the world, but our freedoms are under attack.9/10 - One of the best docs I have seen in a long time.",False
6,10,Watch this now!,carolynmholloran,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this film and I'm astounded at how far down the rabbit hole this country has gone. I thought the ideas presented made sense and were very compelling. So much so that I'm planning on buying a copy of the movie to share with friends and family. It's not my goal to convince anyone to change their ideals or political view, I just want others to watch it. Watch it and then do your own research. I promise you won't be disappointed. But, you if you are disappointed, why? How bad is ""bad enough"" for you? How bad is ""bad enough"" before we're forced to act? I have had enough and this film has opened my eyes to how controlling our government has become.",False
7,10,True documented events in the USA.,jlhotchkin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching this movie has nothing to do with politics but everything to do with the tyranny of unchecked power and corruption. I'm a Patriot born in 1956 and this is NOT the country I grew up in. Seeing actual historical events that are meant to intimidate and silence God fearing, law abiding US citizens is heartbreaking. One of the most powerful take always for this film for me is that I'm either watching actual video footage, listening to actual audio, or being provided the opportunity to read an undoctored transcript. There is no story telling or poetic license taken. Please watch and share, the future of America depends on it!",False
8,10,You can guarantee all of the 1 star votes are b0ts or they didn't watch the movie,scottkrants,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is extremely well made and highlights the problems we are having within America today. Dinesh D'Souza you can tell sincerely and truly loves this country and wants to see it succeed. Thanks God for him and the other interviewed within this movie for standing up for what is right. There are a series of interviews that will change most peoples view on what is going on with our government. Hopefully we will soon change course and progress to a better America by learning from the lessons of our past. This movie highlights the importance of all Americans of all race, gender, and age. Simply put, we should all treat each other better and hold our representative and protectors accountable.",False
9,9,A chilling reminder of history.,irivlin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must first state that I'm not a US citizen and don't have a "" dog in the race"". I am an avid historian and have studied totalitarianism for a long time.30 years ago, I would have probably associated myself with the Democrat philosophy, then the Clinton's came along and, in my opinion, turned the Democrat Party into a money making business. Somehow they co-opted the DOJ, so the media and the FBI. Then the ""lawfare"" began - ie, the user of the Department of Justice to further their aims. Once Whitewater was not pursued, it became obvious that the Democrat Party had made a Faustian deal with the security forces. America's fate was sealed at that point.One would have to be blind if they thought that justice is being equally applied in America at the current time.This movie tries to set out, logically and realistically, what is happening and sending out a warning to the world what will occur if we don't rein in this (literal) police state.I'm sure Democrats are either happy about what's going on, or are turning a blind eye to things. What they don't realise is that sooner or later, they will get voted out. - Then the reprisals will bite them on the ankles. All my older Democrat American friends are horrified about what's happening. They have seen the effects of Soviet politics. America is deadly close to this kind of oppressive regime.Watch this movie with an open mind and just keep asking yourselves ""Is this really happening?"" I honestly believe it is.Be afraid - not of other countries invading the United States but of the enemy within. The Barbarians are not AT the gate, they are already inside.This movie is scary, bold and revealing. Please watch it. It is very much a harbinger of the nightmare that may well occur - and sooner than you might think.",False
10,10,Thought Provoking and engaging,jsiplevtga,n/a,16/08/2025,"Scary but poignant film. A must see for those concerned about the state of USA. Watch with an open mind. Think about your family and close friends being spied on, set up, accused of crimes they most likely wouldn't commit or yourself for that matter. Let's put a stop to this type overreach and criminality by our own government. Biopics like this are needed to get the truth out and open the people's eyes. If this doesn't get you mad at the state of the affairs of our country then you been brainwashed by the looney left. Please get empowered, get knowledgeable, learn your rights, exercise your rights, protect yourself & your family. Pray for our country and it's people. God bless America. Bless your family.",False

1,1,VERY UNFUNNY,dfxmfyqkkx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amy Schumer is the least funniest person I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. The jokes were rubbish, reused and old. Honestly I don't understand why she is even given a platform unless it is to TORTURE the audience.Please do yourself an HUGE FAVOUR and don't waste your time. It's like poking needles in your eyes listening to her whine.Really really hope Netflix never gives her another show or I will really have to cancel my subscription.She should give it a rest and stop trying so hard to push this comedic career because it's genuinely awful and embarrassing.Running out of space. But don't watch it.",False
2,1,Snoozefest,omaticat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is she there on some sort of quota? One specifically for people called Amy Schumer? I don't understand how she keeps on creating these unfunny specials and keeps on getting gigs like life and beth. She has to be the most unfunny comedian out there and is literally somehow stealing opportunities from people who actually have some talent and are not a propped up character that people HAVE to find funny (rotten tomatoes has a 100% positive reviews for this torturous special). Probably shouldn't have watched it in the first place but oh god the 100% positive reviews thing got the better of me and I thought I could finally see what these media executives see in Amy and her wit, never again though can't put myself through her forced ""jokes"" and I hope media execs realise she is just a big name with nothing to show for it.",False
3,2,An Absolute Travesty,TerribleMovie,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've seen morgues with more energy than Amy. She looked bored and completely un-interested in performing on stage. It doesn't help that her material is mostly recycled from her previous specials: being fat, plastic surgery, having an autistic husband, and married life. She is a 40 year old woman who acts like she's 80. She talked to an audience member who's almost 30 like she was a toddler. The biggest problem is that Amy just doesn't have anything interesting to say. She tries to make up for boring topics by using quirky voices but ends up taking a dirt nap. I don't blame Amy for this turd, I blame Netflix for still paying this unfunny clown to stink up their platform. Throw this special to the dogs.",False
4,1,Where's the jokes?,MikeHunt1075,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was just Amy Schumar coming out to have a chat to the audience. You can hear the audience laugh, but, at what? I didn't manage to laugh, or even chuckle once, at anything she said during this under an hour, or an over the time limit, 30 minute failure.No, I'm not an Amy hater, but this stand-up is not worthy of being called one. The audience deserves their money back and the viewer can never get back that 50 mins of waiting to hear something funny, but instead, just Amy gloating about herself and shelling out filler after filler.This is where this review should end, but I need 22 more characters and ... oh, done!",False
5,n/a,"How many ways can I ask, how did she get a career in comedy.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amy was never funny. This movie should be banned from viewing, internationally. Why is Amy famous,? Why is Tina Fey famous? They are so unfunny, corny, and annoying. Please stop them from movies. The movie, It's a abomination. Her entire career is a abomination. If Any makes one more movie, I will pull my own hair out, by the roots. The people in the movie theater were saying how unfunny and kame the movie was. I went because my White friend wanted me to come. She's so nice and annoying, so I went. I should get her to give me my money back for the ticket into the movie. I work two jobs. So I slept about an half an hour, because the movie is a waste of time, money, and energy. Don't do it, you guys. Thank me later.",False
6,10,Enjoying every minute!,rognsoey,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Amy Schumer since day one. This may be my first and probably last review on IMDb since it is not something I do, but I have to come in and shake things up a bit; this is absolutely hilarious, Amy is keeping her level all the way through, making me laugh out loud throughout the whole show!! Don't listen to the Debbie Downers, this is pure pleasure and if anything way too short. I'm in eternal awe of Amy Schumer and the fun she has brought to my life, being funny is indeed a superpower, and these 50min absolutely made my day. Big love from someone who constantly enjoys humor via many styles, nationalities and media. Standup is my medicine. Go Amy!!",False
7,1,We tried,TPrez,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I are fans of Amy's from back in the day. Over the years her comedy got quite stale unfortunately. Eventually it seemed (to us) that Amy had left comedy to start a family. We figured good for her. She did very well for herself while in the limelight.Well... She's back.... with a special? We were curious, despite the large amount of distaste she has garnered for herself over the years with some of the biggest names in stand up. We gave it a try.Nothing relatable out of the gates. L. A. Plastic surgery material from a frumpy wanna-be funny mom? Hard pass. I feel like this was specifically for her friends and family, but thought it was good enough to make some cash from. I'm curious if she actually tried the material out more than a couple times outside her friends and family... This was NOT ""special"" material by any measure.Amy uses the exact same comedy beats that she used years ago. The jokes MIGHT be new, but the tired delivery was enough to turn us both off. We did chuckle a couple of times, but we might have just been attempting to find something funny.In the end we turn it off long before the closing bit. Not worth it at all.",False
8,1,Makes sense,bambahbambah,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show was absolutely devoid of any humor, even though I started it with a cup of coffee, I ended up dozing off multiple times. Mind you this doesn't happen even when I sit down 5 hours to write my thesis.Also I hope stakeholders put more thought into deciding who to support for such shows. It would be nicer to have such shows of people who actually get some giggles out of people.This makes you understand why Amy is so involved in speaking on political issues and being on the wrong side that supports the perishing of innocent civilians. I guess she's trying to escape these atrocities of ""entertainment"".",False
9,2,"Oh, Amy. This one wasn't ready.",crossinlanta,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a big Amy Schumer fan for a long time. Saw her onstage before Covid, before she had the family. She was already a star. And she was awesome. Sharp and full of smart jokes and energy.But she clearly stopped practicing her craft in the last few years. After ten minutes I stopped watching this. Because I saw an insecure, unpracticed comedienne using hackneyed jokes with lame delivery and amateurish tags. And then she went for a laugh by making a chipmunk face, and I just cringed. This is really disappointing. She was such a great joke writer and performer. But standup is clearly not her top priority anymore. But when that contract is still there, well....",False
10,2,"Better than the others, but also somehow worse",raccoonfan69,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't like Amy Schumer, I don't think she's very good at her job. However, I watch her specials in the way someone might watch a low budget B movie. I like gawking and cringing at a bad piece of media - who doesn't? Her leather special was so bad it almost came full circle around to being accidentally funny. This special doesn't come close to that. There's nothing interesting, funny, or noteworthy about this special, accidental or intended. This is the auditory equivalent of a saltine cracker without the salt. I've never heard a comedian with less energy on stage, with weaker delivery, or with a lack of jokes. This was like a live 50 minute (couldn't even make it an hour long!) podcast, rather than a standup comedy special.No laughs were had, nor smiles. There were a couple sighs and eye rolls but that was about it. At least the leather special was so gross and off-putting it brought a little emotion out of me, even if it was to cringe/laugh at how bad the jokes were instead of at the jokes themselves. This special elicits absolutely nothing. Some of the joke premises had potential but are immediately squandered by perhaps the worst delivery I've heard from a standup comedian. It's like a living AI onstage, operating under the prompt: ""be a female Louis CK"".This special is unbelievably dry, bland, drab, and has no rhythm or flow. She's just saying words. At least this time she's not talking about her bodily fluids the entire time, although that was the only thing that made the last specials interesting; otherwise this is nothing more than just dull, unfunny standup comedy.",False
11,2,Wait until you're ready,drjgardner,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're chronica;ly depressed and unhappy with your appearance and your life, why go on stage and show it to everyone. Of course, some people (Woody Allen, Joan Rivers) could do it and do it well, but it's really hard and that's nowhere in evidence than in this depressing demonstration. What's worse, if anything could be worse, she's not very funny. She got a few snickers and one or two laughs, but otherwise it seemed to be like listening to a boring person at a cocktail party drone on about their life. If you're not ready, why do it? Even the audience is only luke warm, which speaks volumes itself.",False
12,10,Very funny,lolipop_big,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a huge fan, I loved every bit of it. I'm not sure why people are so harsh on her and put so many bad reviews. She had so many health issues, and made so much fun about it! I am a doctor and I really appreciated that. Talking about different issues. For people who didn't like it, get a life! I think it was phenomenal. Worth watching. I really do like her and I wish her all the best. I think she looks good too. I like all her work. Very funny. The fact that she can't have kids again, make any woman sad. But she made fun of it. For all you haters, too bad you didn't like it. I'm not sure what would you like? !!",False
13,2,word salad mixed with f words,omotamm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amy's ""humour"" (duck duck ) is very simple: a lot of words salad mixed with cursing, f.. words and words borrowed from a gynecologist cabinet... and you are supposed to laugh at these special words and at cursing... and maybe you are laughing if you are missing something in the head... her appearances must be used as an interlude in the police interview rooms and i am very sure that even the worst offender will recognize and confesses every bad thing he did in his entire life..... there is not slightest hint of comedy in her work, there is only a miserable, unhappy and torned human being desperately seeking to pay her bills and disperate for some attention and consideration....",False
14,1,Was this supposed to be funny?,TheNiggardlyTimes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Schindler's List is a funnier movie and it's not a comedy. Seriously I can't imagine less funny individual to be headlining an actual comedy movie. I had to make an emergency contact after trying to watch this garbage, I had to change the channel. This trash is representative of how low Hollywood has sunk, trying to bully audiences into thinking pure drainage is funny when it is not. Amy Rachel Schumer is simply not funny. Not funny. Fat, but not funny. Boring but not funny. I wish I hadn't wasted time out of my life watching this total trash. Watching TikTok is way more fun and entertaining and has way more talent.",False
15,1,"I love the colors, red, white, black and...... green!",svvdrtsj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amy Schumer's ""Emergency Contact"" is a letdown, failing to capture the audience's interest. The plot is thin and meanders without a clear direction, making it difficult to stay engaged. Schumer's attempt at humor falls flat, with jokes that are either clichéd or poorly timed. The characters lack depth and relatability, resulting in a story that feels hollow and uninspired. Despite its potential, ""Emergency Contact"" doesn't offer the wit or charm expected from Schumer, leaving viewers disappointed. The dialogue is often awkward, further diminishing the overall impact of the film. It's a missed opportunity.",False

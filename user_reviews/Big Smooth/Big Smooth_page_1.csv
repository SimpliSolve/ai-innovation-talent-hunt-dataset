1,10,Superb tribute,leebrannan-17530,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just been to watch the premiere at the Gala theatre in Neil's hometown of Durham, the film was a brilliant tribute to a well remembered man, striking attention to detail with some brilliant interviews from some key people from Neil's sadly short but very fulfilled life.Can always remember seeing Neil in and around Durham back in the 90's / early 00's, especially in Cafe Rock with his mates drinking three bottles at a time!! Didn't realise just how much basketball he played in America and this film totally shows how well respected he was out there not just for his skills but also his kindness and big heartBravo to Paul and the team for giving us all an insight into big Neils life.",False
2,10,Giant heart of a documentary,mcneal-72589,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great film which reminds us that it's not about the size of your physical being, your wallet or your renown but the size of your heart and the way you impact positively on the lives of those you meet that means the most.Brings to light a local (Durham, UK) man who had a global impact and touched the lives of everyone he met; followed his dreams and could pivot when needed to whether that be to score hoops, a movie or to make someone smile.Watched the premiere with my family and my son said that Neil teaches us to believe in ourselves and that has to be a great take away for a 10 year old x.",False
3,10,Amazing story of a very good friend.,johnhopper-11467,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being best friends with Neil from a young age I expected to be biased or even critical of the documentary, but I had no reason to be any of these. Being either involved or part of Neil's life growing up and spending time together as mates whenever possible (between Neil's travels and work) I was apprehensive of how the film would portray Neil and the life he had. On watching the Premier I was blown away by the sett out and content that Paul Stainthorpe and the team have used and produced a great, true, funny and emotional documentary.Before the film started Paul Stainthorpe introduced everyone and stated ""if you feel like laughing, then laugh - If you feel like whooping, then whoop and if you feel like crying, then cry"". What he should of stated is ""when you laugh - when you whoop and when you cry"" because this is guaranteed when watching this true, funny and emotional film.Brilliant work and a must watch.",False
4,10,Heartwarming story,catherineditchburn,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHeartwarming, funny and poignant documentary about the life of Britain's tallest man Neil Fingleton who went from being an working class lad in the north east of England to a top class basketball player in Boston to a major role in Game of Thrones. Neil's story is told by his family, friends, coaches and colleagues and shows how he followed his dreams and achieved so much before his life was cruelly cut short. Beautifully shot with some really interesting footage of Neil's basketball career and behind the scenes filming, but it's the family interviews that made me smile the most. I laughed, cried and left the theatre feeling proud to have known such an amazing person. Brilliant film.",True
5,10,Incredible!!,kevinteasdale,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an brilliantly made documentary about Neil. My wife and I went to the Premiere at the Gala Theatre and we were blown away by how wonderfully made this was. From start to finish we were hooked and I would recommend this to anyone.Being someone who knew Neil and his family I thought this would be insightful, funny, thought provoking and inspirational but what has been created here was much more than that. A real look into the world of someone that didn't say much on the outside but let his actions do the talking for him.Congratulations to all involved that were able to bring Neil's story to the big screen.Sleep well Big Neil.",False
6,10,Inspirational and beautiful tribute,vickycowens,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to the premier of Big Smooth last night and didn't know what to expect. I found out about a man who went to my school in Durham, and played basketball with my husband in the 90's. I was amazed with the life Neil led and the person he clearly was. The way he touched people and made a difference to their lives is a real legacy and it's wonderful someone has memorialized him so well. It was amazing how much research, groundwork, and detail went into this piece of work. The interviews were awesome and the content had my attention and interest transfixed. Paul and Richard have created an impressive, professional and touching documentary film. I'm really pleased I went to watch it and would highly recommend.",False
7,10,A great piece of cinema!,sjmordue-33857,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've just attended the world premiere of Big Smooth and have to say it was a great piece of cinema - I thought the narrative that Paul Stainthorpe created was sensitive and uplifting with a great sense of the human spirit that is in us all. The weaving together of narrative from both sides of the atlantic worked well with some wonderful heartwarming stories.The story was in many ways a simple one but I felt the piece revealed the layers that sit below all of our lives through an exploration of Neil's ...Stainthorpe and the team behind this, and the participants, should be incredibly proud of this as a piece of art as well as a wonderful human story...I'm sure they are.",False

Sensitive storytelling at its best!We see the highs and lows all while being taken on an emotional journey of discovery with real attention to detail throughout. The transatlantic element really brings some great characters to the screen and the interviewees talk so passionately about Neil.

9,10,Fantastic Documentary,RacBut,n/a,16/08/2025,"Big Smooth is a great tribute to Neil and was such a heartwarming watch. It's a documentary that shows you can live your dreams and be successful yet above all else, family and kindness is the most important aspect of life.Watching this showed more insight into Neil's amazing life and showed what an amazing person he was! It was lovely to listen to so many people who knew him and had stories to tell and it was emotional for everyone in the theatre to see. The producers etc have obviously spent a great deal of time researching and gathering by information for this film and their hard work has paid off.A great production!",False
10,9,Great Documentary,MagicalMissJ,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to attend the premiere of this excellent documentary about Neil Fingleton, who found success in America playing basketball and later moved into acting. This was a touching story about someone who turned something that could have been a burden (his record height) into an asset and was the jumping off point for his success.The film is a good mixture of talking heads of Neil's family and those who knew him through his two fascinating careers and also archive footage of his basketball games. It is both funny and moving and provides a view of someone who was once the tallest man in Britain but was also so much more than that.",False
11,9,Lovely Film About A Lovely Man,alancorner-33319,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAn amazing story of how well Neil Fingleton coped with being well over 7 feet tall as a teenager, becoming a basketball star and then moving into acting roles. The film is beautifully put together, showing how he overcame so many challenges and wasn't afraid to take huge risks to move forwards in life. It is a moving documentary which will make you smile and leaves you with a tear in your eye.The film includes contributions from so many of his friends and family from both sides of the Atlantic. Neil clearly made a hugely positive impact on all those who met him, and we are left wondering what he would have achieved had he not been taken from us at such a young age.",True
12,9,Character is all with Basketball Setting,gillcorner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Touching documentary uniting America and the North East of England. Neil Fingleton was at one time England's tallest man. Without being too sentimental this film portrays Neil's life and character. From being a teenager he was determined to succeed wherever life took him and he did. Big time! Living successfully in America, far from home, as a teenager in the 1990s without the social technology we have today must have been challenging. The Big Smooth highlights that Neil used his height positively and although it did bring him difficulties he didn't dwell on them or use them as excuses. It recounts an interesting life lived to the full with humility.",False
13,10,"Exceptional, heart-moving, highly recommended!",Airlann_,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was fortunate to attend the fantastic premiere of #BigSmoothFilm at the Gala Theatre in Durham.

14,10,I feel like I know Neil,msantucci-13561,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a story! I This documentary portrayed the story of a man who against all odds became a legend. A story of courage, hope, humor and love. From following Neil throughout his journey, we see that perseverance, humility, and kindness goes a long way and the willingness to be helped and supported by others allows us to grow in unexpected directions. This was very easy to follow and you could feel the essence of who Neil was and still is for those he impacted. You find yourself thinking if I could be a bit more like Neil, what would that look like? I really feel like I knew Neil. Kudos to the cast, crew and producers for pulling this together. Bravo.",False
15,10,Inspirational Storytelling...,ricciardidiane,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was thoroughly overcome with emotion by the end of the tenderly made documentary: Big Smooth. This film was moving. It was intimate. It was equal parts exciting, funny and heartbreaking. But mostly, this film is inspirational.Director Paul Stainthorpe deftly illuminates Neil Fingleton's quiet manner, his remarkable strength of character, and the legacy of love that he left, wherever he went. The film follows Neil's extraordinary life journey: from his beginnings with his close-knit family and exceptional mother, in Durham, England, to the caring, working class community in Worcester, Massachusetts that embraced him as a teenager. As Neil's athletic talent catapults him on to bigger and more high stakes arenas, his tireless work ethic, his surprising humility, and his understated humor encourages long lasting and meaningful friendships with everyone he encounters.When Neil's basketball profession ultimately ends, he begins anew. In a remarkable ""plot twist"" he boldly embarks on an acting career! What is not surprising is how Neil builds this new career; he approaches it with the same intensity and discipline he brought to the basketball court. Neil's success in television and film roles are a testament to his positive self-awareness. He inspires us and encourages us all to be true to ourselves.Big Smooth is a beautiful portrait of a singular and memorable life, well lived.",False

17,10,Inspiring story with a great message!,simonjlowes,n/a,16/08/2025,"I got to see the first US screening of the documentary last night and it did not disappoint. It's a powerful story of hope, courage, kindness and a desire to look at potential challenges as opportunities...something we could all learn a little about. The pace of the documentary is perfect and has a host of great characters and stories, all centered around the main subject - Neil. Prepare to laugh, cry and be inspired.

18,10,"Very moving, compassionate documentary",barbarajoneskh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have recently watched The Big Smooth and was blown away by the quality of the film footage, the interviews, the music and the editing. The attention to detail was clear to see and came across so well I felt I knew Neil and his family. The love and warmth was in the room and at times there wasn't a dry eye in the house.

It's was a brilliant tribute to a local man, who I didn't get to meet, but feel I know well after watching. Very entertaining with all the laughs and a few tears along the way.

20,10,A touching and very well researched documentary film,ellie-bindman,n/a,16/08/2025,"We went to the premiere of Big Smooth at the Gala Theatre, Durham and were both blown away by the staggering amount of research and the massive endeavour of collating and editing all the interviews and footage on the life of Neil Fingleton,about whom we knew very little before this film. Neil was a talented basketball player and ultimately a film actor of note, from Durham. The interviews with key people in his life were very touching and insightful into the personality and character of this young man who was so well loved because he engendered both talent in basketball and acting but, importantly, in his kindness, and it's ultimately his kindness which made him stand out, not his height which even at over 6 feet 6inches, must take a supporting role in his life story. The man was a talent, but his kind spirit and the love of the man from all those interviewed, this is what we took away with us. A brilliant, intelligent, touching film, bravo to all involved.",False
21,10,Big Smooth is a Big Win,shaun-r-mcnamara,n/a,16/08/2025,"An intimate look at the truly unique life of one of the world's tallest people, the dearly missed, 7 ft 7 Neil Fingleton. Emotional and honest interviews with the people closest to Neil provide a backdrop to his amazing story as a newcomer to the United States from Durham, England, as he navigates life as a high school student and star basketball player. Archival footage of his basketball career and later his surprising pivot to successful actor in major Hollywood films and HBO's Game of Thrones provides Big Smooth with a genuinely compelling narrative. Well-told with a theme of overcoming challenges and finding ways to adapt - and thrive - in circumstances that may be out of your control.",False
22,9,Charming and emotional portrait of an amazing life,mark-77502,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI walked into this film entirely unaware of Neil's story, and found it amazing and emotional in equal measure. The film does a great job of painting a rounded portrait of an extraordinary person, through the ups and downs of his tragically short life. It's directed and edited superbly, with an excellent balance of footage and interviews accompanied by a great score. This is a warm, charming, funny and emotional story of a remarkable person who dared to live outside his comfort zone, and made the best out of whatever life threw at him. The film does a great job of communicating the stakes in the epic choices Neil had to make, and the affection everyone he met along the way had for him. If you know Neil's work this is a must watch, and if you don't you'll find an emotional but uplifting story of a man following his dreams.",True

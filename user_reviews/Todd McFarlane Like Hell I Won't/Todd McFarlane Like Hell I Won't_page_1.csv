1,6,This was actually good...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"This short documentary actually turned out to be nicely surprising and entertaining, and it does a good job of painting both a professional and personal reflection of Todd McFarlane, the creator of Spawn and one of the driving forces behind Image Comics.I was given the chance to sit down and watch it in August of 2020, and I must say that it was definitely a nice little piece of documentary entertainment. And it actually have appeal regardless of you being a fan of Spawn, a fan of McFarlane, or not being familiar with either.The documentary was nicely told narratively and offers some nice footage of Todd McFarlane, his way of working and his drawing style - of course - but also of his way of running a business and to some extend his personal life as well.However, this is hardly a documentary that sparks an interest strong enough to make you watch it again at a later time. It was good, but it just doesn't have the contents to support more than a single viewing.My rating of ""Todd McFarlane: Like Hell I Won't"" is a six out of ten stars, and I sat down to watch it as a fan of the Spawn comic book series.",False
2,5,Todd hits punching bag!,omega145,n/a,15/08/2025,"The title and scene of him hitting the punching bag sum up this entire documentary for me: cheesiness focusing on how great he is and hyping up Spawn 300 rather than making a good documentary about Todd McFarlane. He has absolutely shaped comics and toys but there wasn't enough focus on his career or what the events were that shaped his meteoric rise. I would have liked to see mentions of other people that he worked with and their thoughts on him but instead we get Todd hitting a punching bad in a fake tough guy way to showcase him as being someone who doesn't back down. For someone who is a comic book fan, this was a big disappointment.",False

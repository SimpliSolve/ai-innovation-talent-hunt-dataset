1,1,Terrible,Chingon_Official,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA total waste of time...A bunch of young spoiled brats which were totally unprofessional during the footages. A lot of launghter during the documentary, nothing was taken seriously.The skipper gave the most scientific details of the expedition. For all the other ones was just a paid turistic trip, no actual facts or conclusions were provided. A lot of unnecessary details about their meals and, by the looks of it, their spare time spent there.One of the worst documentary seen on Netflix, which is quite a shame, as the expectations were high. Unfortunately, the BE government seems to have spent a fortune for some wannabe scientists...",True
2,10,An excellent journey to the end of the world,communist-guy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beautifully shot, this documentary takes the audience on a journey with a group of dedicated and brave scientists to the Antarctica. Retracing the steps of a turn of the century Belgian expedition and using a sailboat, these new-age explorers make crucial observations about the environment and wildlife of this very remote part of the world. Beyond this, it looks at the lives of these scientists who have to life and work together under challenging circumstances. It's a very human story, told in a unique and intimate way that feels like you're a part of the team. Both moving and thought provoking.",False
3,3,Science is destructive,trout303,n/a,15/08/2025,"A documentary that clearly reveals the shared mono vision ego of scientists. Everything they touch, see and collect is referred back in some manner to climate change, even though there are repeated claims within the documentary that the part of the world they have travelled into and examine has had extremely little research to date.One of the scientists literally claims that it is the present generation of scientists that has woken up and knows the 'we' need to start caring for the planet. Yeah right, minimal research but suddenly they are masters of the universe.120 years ago the first Belgica expedition team most likely though they were the generation that had just woken up too.Science pretends to know something about something it has barely looked at.",False

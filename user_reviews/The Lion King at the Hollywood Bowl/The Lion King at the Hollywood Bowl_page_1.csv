1,8,Loved it all except...,sweetfla,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI grew up with the original lion King, and having not ever seen the Broadway lion King, this was such a cool treat to see the original songs and actors from there!Every single person on there was mega talented except North West. I was so confused as to why she was on there in the first place bc she was never in any of the movies I don't think. I really thought they should have a kid on there that could sing well. Maybe it was just nerves? Idk but it was awful. I had to mute her whole performance. I wouldn't let that 1 thing ruin the rest of the experience for me though.I loved seeing the og actors/ singers from the first movie! I was a kid when it came out and my friends and I loved this movie and songs. I even remember that in chorus class, we did the songs for our yearly concert. So many great memories attached to the lion King.",True
2,8,"Excellent, except for one performance",eurofox,n/a,16/08/2025,"The whole show's staging, performance, music was absolutely superb and a delight to watch - clearly put together by a hugely-talented cast and crew.Wonderful to see some of the original voice actors come together and perform with the same gusto of their original performances on the film.However North West's performance jarred with the otherwise excellent production and soured the experience. Whilst admirable to get up on a stage of that size at her age, her performance lacked timing, rhythm and any semblance of characterisation or personality. I've heard better performances of this piece in school productions and would've expected Disney to have found the best performer for this role given the otherwise superb cast of singers, dancers and musicians.",False
3,6,A good little show that could have goon even further than it did,mickeythechamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Still catching up on my 2025 watchlist before my mid-year review for my next podcast episode and this one was a quick hour production so I thought I would check it out.Look, if you are a ""Lion King""(1994) fan and fanatic I don´t need to tell you what I think, you have already watched and loved this and that is great. So many people have this deep connection to this movie and also the stage show, rather it be nostalgic or culturally and the original movie is a milestone in animation cinema. But I don´t have this deep rooted connection with this movie as I saw it way later in my life as an adult. Does that mean I don´t see the Lion King as a masterpiece? Far from it, it is one of the best animated movie I have ever seen, but I just don´t have the same deep roots as many. This show therefore doesn't really speak to my nostalgia, but even for people it does I Think will find the show a bit lacking in places and even skipping over things like the sequels and prequels only mentioning them fast. This should have been a granter celebration and a holistic one in my opinion but I sadly never really gets to that. This will please fans no doubt and I would have been ecstatic over this had I been a Disney kid of the 90s.A celebration of the music from "" The Lion King"" and its stage musical, 30 years after the original movie realised.What I will admire here is some of the absolute insane performances and stage shows here. It took me a little while to get into the show and I was never really fully engaged but it had some moments that are incredible. First of all, incredible and engaging crewed is always welcome to me. The amazing stage shows are so fun to see with the many lights, things from the stage musical I had never really seen performed before with the costumes and actors acting animals. And the insane performances by Jenifer Hudson that kills ""Cirkel of life"". Jeremy Irions killing sinning ""Be Prepared"" sadly not in costume. Heather Headly with my favourite performance of the show, what a voice! And the lovable Lebo M, who kills everything he is sinning and a wonderful soul that just brings so much joy and talent.The less good things were no doubt the lacking stage show at times. I get its more ballad focused songs that deserve the attention, but when you see so many great stage show things, you want that from all the songs. The performance of ""Just can´t wait to be king"" where nepotism sadly shine through and it overall hurts the celebration this trues to be. And the clear amount of people they could not have on stage due to; them not wanting to come/isn´t here anymore/are too old to perform, but some of it really hurt the show like the lack of Elton John that feels criminal and Beyonce that they even call out is not here. There is also some parts of it that seems less well planned like ""Hakuna Matata"" where the singers seem a bit off with the band and the insert of the new Timon from the remake movie(2019) There are things that could be better is all I am saying, and there are some aspects that feels more glossed over than the celebration it should be and it advertises itself to be. When you are missing core aspects you clearly wanted, why do the event at all? It doesn't hurt the overall experience but questions what they wanted with the show or if they just rushed it.The in-between bits with archival footage and interviews works find but feels tagged on no doubt. Only Lebo M´s interviews really got to me. It is interesting to hear about the cultural impact of the Lion King and hear how transcended something like the stage musical has been. A show I have not seen myself, but clearly understand why it is so important and it looks and sounds amazing from this show where we see performances from dancers in animal costumes on stage and also songs from that stage musical that are so incurable and well performed here in native African tongues.A overall enjoyable time and a lot of great performances of great music and a good stage show. Some things could be better and again, the show should embrace all of the Lion King mythos and not just pick and choose. I liked what I got here overall and it is easy to just pick up and watch or have in the background as the music is going.",False
4,9,Very good but...,Pilajewlz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was amazing but North West performing left a bitter taste for me. She is not bad but they should have asked one of the kids that performs in the musical or at least the one from the 2019 movie. She was there only because Disney owns the Kardashians now. It was a publicity stunt which I didn't appreciate. On another note, Jennifer Hudson was unbelievable, the reunion of Timon, Pumba and Simba brought tears to my eyes and seing some of the original broadway cast was amazing. The rest of the show was beautiful and brought back memories from my childhood so I still had to give a 9. Would strongly recommend but skip I just can't wait to be king.",True
5,9,An absolute delight,shannonripsher08,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was an absolute DELIGHT to watch. As a lifelong fan of The Lion King, I was so happy during the entirety of the lion king Hollywood bowl......well almost the entirety.I know it's not easy to be a 10 year old performing to a large audience (I know this personally) but I must admit that North West did not belong on that stage. Was it nepotism? Could they have not found a child for their good voice rather than their famous name? This was the only thing stopping me from giving this a 10 out of 10 though. I could have done without this one.Back to the positives:
Having Jeremy Irons back to sing my favourite song (Be prepared) AND having the voices of Timon and Pumba was a lovely throwback. And everything else was just incredible to looks at. It must have been amazing watching it live!",True
6,9,"It was a great production, except for...",TOrockchick,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe appearance of North West as young Simba. Like many of the other reviewers, I found she was out of place in this production. She was very monotone in her voice, and there was no bravado in either her voice or movement. She just sang and walked around the stage as if she was doing a home or school talent concert. I do agree the Kardashians must've pulled some big strings to get her to be a part of the anniversary event. The time SHOULD'VE been spent finding a more experienced actor or singer, preferably from the Broadway musical. I mean having a girl be Simba is way out there.I was plaeasd that they had performances from both films and the Broadway musical. It was great to see the OG actors come back and preform. Plus the imagery that they provided was just as exciting to watch. I was happy to watch this and reminisce in seeing the first film over 30 years ago.",True
7,9,Nostalgia + Artistry (with a sprinkling of nepotism),syvmgbnjz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler9/10 purely for the fact that I skipped through half of North West's number after giving her a real shot. It's not easy being a kid on a big stage but I've seen many many young performers her age display much more skill and stage presence than she did. She could carry a tune, that's about it. The rest of the featured singers also had their own unique and deep connections to the franchise, something NW lacked and it changed the tone of the show for the whole number. And not in a good way. It was a transparent marketing move crammed into a show that was otherwise a celebration of a beautiful work of art and artistry.It would have been a stronger choice to book whichever young actor most recently finished their contract with the musical.I was four when The Lion King first premiered in theaters. I've been lucky enough to see the Broadway touring cast perform twice. This story and music have been dear to me my whole life. This anniversary celebration, besides one singular performance, was crafted with as much care and artistry as the franchise it pays tribute to. I appreciated the curation of talent, the return of many of the original actors from screen and stage and how much heart they put into the performances. The visuals were stunning, the costumes imported from the musical were as magical as ever. Worth all the watches, just do yourself a favor. Skip ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" (sorry Zazu!)",True
8,5,First Half was Amazing,andychow-09106,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved the first half with beautiful outfits, vocals, performances, touching tributes, and was ready to give this a 9/10 rating. Then North West came on in the coveted Simba role singing I Just Can't Wait to be King and ruined the whole show for me. I've seen the theatre performance twice and the kids they have perform Simba are truly amazing, especially at such a young age! She wasn't anywhere near the same caliber so her father and mother clearly pulled some strings and took away a spot from another theatre kid that deserved the big stage. Disney - do better with what you put on Disney+. The West family ruined this for you.",False

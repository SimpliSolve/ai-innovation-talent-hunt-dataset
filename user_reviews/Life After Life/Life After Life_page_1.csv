1,10,Highly interesting and recommended,mjomtehrani,n/a,16/08/2025,"This project and the cast try their best to introduce NDE, discussing and analysing the proofed experiences of those who had this journey from all over the world, emphesising on Iranian ones; they benefits from the international experts, like Prof. Raymond Moody and Dr. Eberhard Rast.",False
2,10,One of the best TV shows ever,mojtabaamirjan,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to know more about after life, this is the best TV show for you.I love the proofs they provide for everything that will happen after life.Remember! This is a documentary not an entertaining show
The fact that all people who died and came back after life described how they were standing beside their bodies and see what was not possible for us to see, is frighteningSome people might don't agree with proofs that they provide but to those who are looking a path toward god it's obvious that at least 95% of what they say is completely correct.Life after life changed my life and the way i think about the day of judgement and heaven and hell.Highly recommended!!",False
3,10,best for humanity,alisfanno,n/a,16/08/2025,"This TV show is a very fruitful research effort, which can move any human being towards goodness and righteousness. NDE is the best thing for truth seekers. I really consider Abbas Mozon as a unique and God-believing person. He is a real Iranian. Near-death experiences teach people that they should never disobey God's commands. Because human actions can have bad effects for him in the other world. But God gives everyone this opportunity. An opportunity to earn the reward of the hereafter. Please watch this program in its entirety to understand how a programming effort in Iranian TV can change a world.",False

A series beyond the truth with an interesting topic that will change your thoughts about life.Where does the human soul go after death?Like a video tape from the moment before your birth to the moment of your death, all the sequences of life and the events in it are reviewed before your eyes, like a storage hard drive with infinite volume..""

Good deeds..
And what is the source of this human soul?Every moment of this series is spectacular and enjoyable.Thanks to Mr. Abbas Mozonüôèüåπ",False

6,10,Really So interesting Program...,meghdadh-0,n/a,16/08/2025,"The best scientific and supernatural program about the afterlife and the events that have happened to every human being and will experience, Those who experienced death and understood that death is not real and desperately asked for return or intercession.This program is with real-life experiences, hospital research, and discussions with professors in this field in America and Europe.This program is great for those who are looking for the reality, reason, and purpose of our lives in this world.It changed my life a lot, so watch if it can change yours too.It's a wonderful, educational and engaging program, but it's in Persian and needs to be translated.You become convinced that there is no death, that there is always only life, and that human life is eternal, and you understand that we are a small part of God.This gives people great hope and greatly reduces the fear of death.Of course, this is not a religious program at all.",False

1,7,"Decent series, but they missed a trick.",thefenna,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're into background stories of individuals, the histories of the rivalries/competition etc, and the physicality of the sport, then this is totally the show for you. It's a decent series.But if you're hoping for an insight into the sport's rules and how the game is played to help gain an interest in the sport, then you won't get any of that.I was hoping the creators might have followed the F1 Drive to Survive series, where that had the odd explanation thrown in, which told us what the odd rule is, or what certain tactics aim to achieve etc.I was never a fan of F1, but I watched that series and because stuff was explained, it created an interest for me and I now see a point in watching a full race.I don't watch Rugby matches because I find them boring and too stop-start... Plus I don't understand all the rules, so confuses me when random penalties are given.I was hoping this Six Nations series would've chucked in some education. A bit more insight in that regard might convince me to have more interest in actual games.Others might feel the same perhaps.Still, I enjoyed the series because I have had plenty of experience with the rugby atmosphere thru friends, so it's not a totally alien sport to me. But to folk that's never given it a proper chance (like me with F1), it might be tough to stick with. It's not convinced me to start watching full games anyway.",False
2,8,Better than the newspaper reviews,boylec-50478,n/a,16/08/2025,"The series has got quite a harsh reception in the media but I enjoyed it a lot. I follow rugby so didn't need explainers on the rules of the game but I could see how some background and also the history of the Six Nations could have been beneficial.The characters are compelling and the interviews with specific players going to their homes, hearing their partners worries and learning their family history was interesting and fresh.Overall I think it's a strong series but it's not quite sure whether it should be 'Drive to Survive' following multiple characters or 'The Quarterback' which focuses on just three NFL players.I expect season 2 to get better and commend this first effort!",False
3,6,Above average,collycolm,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was fairly good. Was expecting to be blown away by it but it fell a little short. Probably down to personal preference but they didn't seem to spend that long on the Irish players. It seemed like a highlights reel of the 2023 6 Nations.Probably expected more action shots of rugby itself. Some of the interviews with various players were interesting, especially Negri, which gave a huge insight into the Zimbabwean born Italian.However, other players who were briefly interviewed, seemed to have huge potential but the documentary barely scratched the surface with these, leaving way more questions than answers.Probably worth a watch but could have been a lot better.",False
4,7,Too Anglo-focused for me :(,caoimhemakesfilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"Huge lover of the sport, and think season 2 improves widely upon season - but I can't help feeling as if some magic moments from the 2024 season were missed with such a heavy lens on England.Of course I understand the natural need for a narrative in non-fiction, but it felt like every team last year had such interesting development that could've been followed much more - Italy's match with France would've been a fantastic episode in and of itself. I know many rugby unions were funny with allowing camera crews in (and have since become much worse), but the increase in the behind the scenes of each team was genuinely super enjoyable to watch and relaxed the pacing slightly.Admittedly, I'm an Ireland fan so will always have some bias, but it was a shame to have such a brief focus on them so far into the series - especially with exclusive access to them during such a dynamic time for the team.Nonetheless, still a great series at humanising these players beyond their careers and successes. Wouldn't necessarily recommend to someone who isn't a rugby fan, but thus seems the way with these Netflix sports docs. Still, such a shame that Netflix have negated to continue on with this series. Maybe another approach in a few years could be a bit more successful!",False
5,9,Good for the sport,hooper-s,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched the first couple of episodes with my partner (who is in no way a rugby fan) and she is keen to watch more. For me the show is therefore doing exactly the right thing in bringing more people into the sport.It's not perfect though and you could tell an 'all access' approach hadn't been taken. Would be good to see the more raw, heartfelt moments on the training field and in the changing rooms so you can really connect with the players and the team (rather than the motivational speeches which don't feel like the whole story).But all around good show and would recommend to both rugby fans and people new to the sport.",False
6,7,Surprisingly engaging,shazzawatchestelly,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm from New Zealand. Generally this means we see all of these teams as our foes on the field and love to bag them during games. Kiwis find England especially irritating, France is often our bogey team in world cups, and now Ireland is the one to beat (used to be Aussie but they've been AWOL for some time now).Putting all of that aside. I began watching this with a conformation bias, but actually was pleasantly surprised. Sure the actual rugby is nothing more than a highlights reel, but actually it was the backstories of the players that was engaging and somewhat heart warming. I found myself very much rooting for Scotland (my great grandparents would be delighted!), fascinated by the philosophical reflections of coach Galthi√©, chuckling at the banter in the England squad and sympathising with those senior players grappling with decisions to retire from the game they love.It's a shame the focus was a bit more on just a couple of players and England's journey, rather than seeing the secret sauce behind Irelands success in recent years. But that said, it's great to see a positive spin on a great sport that hopefully is engaging a much wider audience as a result.Looking forward to seeing how Gats rebuilding plan for Wales plays out in the new few seasons, and hopefully seeing a few of these lads on the field out here in NZ playing the ABs!",False
7,10,Fantastic,jaycrafter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full Contact stands out for its ability to seamlessly blending on-field intensity with behind-the-scenes intimacy. Navigating this balance cannot be easy, especially in a sport rooted in tradition. I think the producers succeed, creating a show that not only captivates with the raw power of the game but also adds a personal touch, connecting fans to the players and the sport on a deeper level.Ellis Genge and Andrew Porter are excellent ambassadors and hopefully the stories they share will help young aspiring players focus their energies into this exciting sport!Well done to the producers. They have done a tremendous job, looking forward to Season 2.",False
8,7,"Good, if you're into your rugby",neilj-34446,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a good insight to the demands, commitment, physical and mental challenge of top class rugby. If you like your rugby and especially the six nations then it's a good watch.Some areas could be improved eg the editing of play is so disjointed that even if you know what's happening, it's not easy to follow the play. Also, not a single minute is dedicated to the fans (still got couple episodes to watch). This is so much a part of rugby and the six nations - the friendship between rival fans - it's a big miss IMHO.Agree with some other reviews that if you don't know rugby, it's not very welcoming. I think adding screen graphics to give an insight into rules/reasons for decisions could have been a different approach eg as conversion being taken, on screen graphic showing line from where ball grounded and added text could have help the non-initiated.",False
9,9,Indepth Super Analysis Of The Six Nations' Tournament,t-d-t-m82,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like my Rugby. This is a fabulous indepth analysis of the characters in international Rugby & the glory; pain & heartache which players go through to achieve their dreams of playing for their countries.It also looks at the players' family life & experiencing key moments of their lives such as marriage & early parenthood whilst preparing for the pressure points of the big games.There is indepth discussion with the coaches & the media commentary and it's well-shot & well-made. We need more series like this on Netflix, please!I like how it gets personal & players are asked intimate questions. You also see how tight the units are with the friendships on & off the pitch.",False
10,7,"Enjoyable, but....",qxfbpcrg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big (England) rugby fan and the 2024 six nations was probably the closest fought tournament across all 6 teams that there has ever been.Ireland and France were always favourites but actually all teams were capable of upsetting expected results, and that created a tournament full of results that were very close and could have easily have gone one way or another.As a rugby fan, I don't believe that the series really showcased the drama of the tournament as a whole.It was lost because of Netflix's intent on focusing on individuals rather than teams.Rugby is not a game of individuals. Yes there are stars, but no one is greater than the team.I just don't think the real drama of the 2024 six nations was shown in this series.But I love the game so I still enjoyed the series.",False
11,n/a,Pity there isn't more focus on the Champions IRELAND,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a really good series, just a really pity at the lack of focus on Ireland the Champions!!!! They should call it the 3 nations full contact as the only ones who they seem to be following is England / Wales & Scotland!!!!!! The biased towards the 3 UK teams is pathetic. You'd swear they're the only teams in the tournament with the amount of time they get in the series!!!! The production is great and clearly the access is incredible just ultimately yet again a disappointing series due to the pathetic lack of focus on the incumbent champions of the tournament. The last season was the same so won't be watching again if the England promotion format stays the same!",False
12,9,AMAZING!!,nicholasdejager,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some people are way too critical. It is awesome to watch in terms of cinematics, storytelling and engagement. Every episode was quality, with in-depth storytelling. You get a brilliant outlook of what rugby is like at the higher levels, and how the players endulge in it.The show goes through each team, and focuses on some of the big matches. I love its variance from team to team, kind of like in movies where you get the backstory of a character. It is hard not to support Italy, as the underdogs of the competition, and so getting their story is incredibly powerful. Would definitely recommend to rugby fans and new fans/people who don't know much yet about rugby.",False
13,7,"Good, but could have been better",grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"A behind-the-scenes documentary on the European Six Nations rugby championship. Each season showcases one season of the tournament, focusing on particular players in each team, showing the build-ups to certain games, what's at stake, highlights from the games themselves and the aftermath.An interesting look into the world of international rugby, in particular Six Nations rugby. The behind-the-scenes footage and interviews are illuminating and helpful. Some great close-to-the-action shots from games too, footage you won't see in your average sports coverage.However, it feels a bit superficial. There's a lot of team meetings and huddles but not much in the way of strategy and tactics. I found the player profiles dull - I really don't care about selected players' personal lives, I want to follow the rugby.The experts who are wheeled in to provide some context and colour to proceedings are often just cheerleaders, telling us how great a player is with glib, trite comments.The fact that each episode is devoted to a handful of players, generally one from each team with someone from the opposing team of that week also covered to balance things out, is also an issue. The experts and players often comment that rugby is the ultimate team sport - and it is - but yet the main focus of the series is individual players! Would much more have preferred a team-based view of proceedings.Still, it's quite entertaining and, unless you already know the results of the games, quite tension-filled, something the producers manage quite well.",False
14,2,Wanna be celebrities,fitzpatrick-gavin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Season 2 is terrible, turned it off half way through the first episode following the ordeal of watching a photoshoot of Marcus smith and then his promoter talking about topics not related to rugby but instead Smiths image.If I knew in advance this was a PR stunt for English Rugby and Smith I'd have thumbed down it on Netflix before it started.Ireland and France have been the two best teams for the last few years now in the six nations but also on the global stage, yet between them they each get airtime in approx 1.5 of the 8 episodes where as the whole focus is on England.Netflix squarely tailoring this for the English audience, that's fine, just promote it as Englands Six Nations docuseries, don't claim it covers all teams equally.",False
15,6,Your typical over dramatized netflix sports show for people who don't watch the sport.,El_Borrador,n/a,16/08/2025,"I pretty much said everything in the Title.A 5-6/10 for people who enjoy the sport just for the imagery of the games that is top notch but everything is over dramatized and explained for people who don't know the sport. I understand that for people who love sports and want to get into something they know nothing about this is a decent introduction to the world of rugby so 7/10 for neophytes.It would of been so much better if they filmed it like France football films their training camps, team talks and video analysis on their youtube channel! A more in depth look inside Nations locker rooms, learn more about our favorite players they do this a bit but it's over dramatized and feels fake.... such a missed opportunity!",False
16,n/a,Good series but disjointed and follows the same predictable theme,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I liked this series but the back and forth between games made it hard to follow for the casual fan. Also why do series like these feel the need to use attractive female reporters as their narrators? This has zero to do with credibility and everything to do with trying to hit every common theme of Netflix sports docos: drama, sport, tension, back story and attractive reporter telling us ridiculous facts and story lines. It's insulting to sports fans and reduces any credibility these producers have in regards to authenticity. We are supposed to believe the only reporters for these teams are 30 something attractive females and there isn't even one male reporter worth adding to the program. Every Netflix series has the same formula and it's getting old quick
The rugby is fine but the rest is crap.",False
17,10,A great showcase for rugby's quote-unquote 'Greatest Championship'',allmoviesfan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Featuring a cast of the game's best and brightest - Scotland's Finn Russell, France's Antoine Dupont, Ireland's Johnny Sexton, England's Owen Farrell, Wales' Dan Biggar and Italy's Seb Negri and all the coaches as well - ""Six Nations: Full Contact"" combines game footage that is superbly cinematic with footage from inside dressing rooms, in homes, at training headquarters and everywhere in between.The insight from the players ranges from mundane to very interesting. The peek into those players' private life, though sparing, was fascinating. More of that in season two, please.The best narratives are when teams aren't going very well, so Italian coach Kieran Crowley, who doesn't mind an F-bomb or twenty-nine, was always fascinating. Same, for similar reasons but without the F!@#$%g swearing, Warren Gatland of Wales.Really enjoyed all eight episodes. I don't think rugby union has ever had a better platform. Hope it translates into new fans.(Shoutout to Mark Robson, who voice-overed a lot of commentary for the games. He is an acquired taste, I must admit, but one of my favourites.)",False
18,6,Rugby for dummies... but it's not terrible.,paulmoviez,n/a,16/08/2025,"Should start by saying that I'm big into my rugby and understand that they were always going to try and entice the unanointed. And in all fairness, they successfully made the sport into a consumable little package and it's by no means a bad watch. The players they choose to focus on are (for the most part) good viewing, especially the likes of Porter and Russell.All that being said, the show is flawed. I feel like dedicating one episode towards bringing casual viewers/newcomers up to speed and then going a little more in depth to the sport itself may have been the move rather than the oversimplifying route that they went down. Sound effects on every tackle gets old pretty quickly, as do the angles changing every 5 seconds, and MY GOD somebody has to answer for the SICKENING amount of slow-motion shots. Efforts to cinematize the matches don't land and are cringy across the board.In summary, something in it for everyone and it is broadly speaking more entertaining than boring. But if you're looking for something that goes a bit deeper then keep looking.",False
19,8,"Great show, more excited for the rugby!",syandulai,n/a,16/08/2025,"I already love watching the six nations, it brings some excitement to the northern hemisphere winter! But seeing this show with the history of the teams and more insight into the players' backgrounds and who they are as people, I can't help but feel more excited for this season's championships! A fairly typical format with the match story arcs and ending in the champions, but very entertaining and I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to learn a bit more about the sport.Such a shame Netflix cancelled the show before season 2 was even released as this show could have done great things for the exposure of the sport internationally. Hopefully another company creates a RFU show!",False
20,6,Weird Sport,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a very weird sport. I mean, the losers win a wooden spoon. The sport is also a very brutal one. There's an argument in hockey that helmets made the sport more dangerous because players can hit harder. People who make that argument have never watched rugby. A hard hitting sport with barely a helmet to be seen. Also interesting to see are the motivational speeches given by the coaches, especially the Italian one. Clearly, the Italian team is the worst in the tournament, but he's saying that they have a shot. I wonder how motivational it would be if he had just said that he doesn't beleive that they can win. It's a good introduction to the sport, but drags a little bit.",True
21,7,Don't believe the haters,mattcamode,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought season 2 was an improvement on the first and enjoyed the insights into the players. Yes it begins with England but it's just a narrative, keep watching as whole episodes are based around the other teams.It's a shame Netflix isn't continuing this as I feel as with the F1 series it takes a few seasons to find its feet. This would do wonders for the sport so a pity it's stopping, hopefully you will reconsider and crack on.Thank you Box to Box for giving it a go though, Rugby is a tricky sport to play let alone capture without giving away tactics to one's opponent! The dark art is lives on.",False
22,3,Season 2 is awful. Don't waste your time.,niallmcentegart-93295,n/a,16/08/2025,"For some reason they to have dedicated half of Season 2 to the English team. Ireland won the tournament and got about 20 minutes across the entirety of the 9 episodes, most of which was focused on the only game they lost - against guess who? England. France didn't fair much better.This is a really poor documentary, and it was obvious that they weren't planning a season 3, from the half-hearted effort they made on Season 2. It really doesn't do justice to the sport or the best team over the two Six Nations seasons it covered.There's only two ways to watch the 6 Nations - in the stadium or live on TV. Don't waste your time watching the second season of this. It's awful.",False
23,3,"So disappointing, worse... boring!",philwatson15,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was desperate for this to be good! Desperate for it to encourage more people to see rugby for the entertainment that it is. But unfortunately it hasn't delivered.Each episode features a player or 2 talking about their own journey, but no insight into the sport itself. Can't really see any positives about the series at all. I believe some teams weren't forthcoming with content for Netflix, but I don't think a second series is coming and to be honest I don't think I'd watch it.If it does go again we want to see the teams behind the scenes. Not get to know a player or two. That's what Instagram is for!",False
24,5,Could be so much better,connaughton,n/a,16/08/2025,"The 6 Nations, oldest rugby tournament in the world, made up of Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, France and Italy. For those viewers not familiar, each team play the five other teams only once.Interviews with players, coaches, and families and friends of the above. Some insight in to players they selected to cover, particularly mental health and doubts. Lots of nice footage of games, but often looks like video game, and missing the build up to a try being scored - just the end product, failure.But, why of why, could they not show the matches in the order they occurred!? Infuriating. And very uneven coverage of each team.",False
25,4,It's all about England.. NOT..!!,Deepdiver67,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis is a great series but I can already see why it is not being continued.. Episode 1. England v Italy.. Episode 2. Wales v England.. Episode 3. Scotland v England.. it's called the Six Nations..Bored already.. sbwriel...The problem with the Celtic approach to rugby does not need to be exgagerated by the way this is portrayed. Box to Box have done a fundimetal thing with Formula 1 and each season now Drive to Survive has become a part of each new seasons racing that we all look forward to but making a documentry about England in each episode has I'm afraid become a little boring.Sorry to have to say this but but it's obvious why so many have drifted away..,True

1,7,"Enjoyable Lovely filmography, lots of old stock NG scene fillers; overall good narration factual story; good for kids",cgtam,n/a,16/08/2025,"WHY ppl complain millions of other sentient mammals stories, most have gone extinct by 2023, CANNOT be told as if human, is an INSULT to ALL same beings who evolved over millions of yrs, esp top predators, long before chimps evolved to humans. Humans have existed for mere 10k yrs & in under 1 century, destroyed true Eden for greed.Here, Narrator's voice fit the rare true black panther that usu fails to live long bc black fur does not give adequate camouflage in India's wild areas, & is killed as cub.Note: this film says 2020 release date but uses many DECADES OLD scenes been enhanced.Yet, ALL black panthers endure same survival challenges. Tigers kill regular coated leopards when Indian rangers try to bring diversity back to their national parks .Script is well written & narrator has vocal
acting ; no kills , no gore, shown so def G rated. Real facts are told in tale, too. VIP: Kids can see what existed 60 yrs ago in India's tiger reserves.Filmmakers followed this decades old black panther for 2 yrs & hard work shows.Fact that no nighttime heat vision/ night vision was used to film which PROVES TRUE Age of this film in 1980s, def not 2020.If PPL can try to see this world thru perspective of other intelligent beings on this planet who are needed in any health ecosystem, the natural world would be cherished & protected. Since 1990s science has proven repeatedly ecosystems benefit PPL MOST.Despite 30 yrs global info free spreading of facts, PPL continue to plunder & destroy all nature & wildlife for short term greed, putting HUMAN survival at risk since 2010 as global climate accelerates & entire pristine habitats are erased forever.For haters who posted reviews:
Plenty of OBJECTIVE boring dull FALSE nature docs, made for arrogant who believe only PPL possess emotions & culture. Those same PPL, incl their kids, will suffer in an ever rapid climate changing ""no natural"" HUMAN planet, as last few viable ecosystems die/ harvested. Billions of PPL will suffer globally bc of these antiquated beliefs & short term greed.Without WILD natural ecosystems working FREE tirelessly 24/7, THIS planet is doomed because of certain PPL's apathy & arrogance. That's fact- not fiction since 1990s.",False
2,10,Awesome Narration.,ishqinair,n/a,16/08/2025,Must watch with kids!The narration is beautiful. The direction is awesome. Feels like I am watching it from close by.,False
3,10,Fabulous Documentation,rohanshettypacu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shaaz Jung and his team must be given a huge round of applause for their spectacular determination and dedication. We watched the film on Big Cat Week in the US and all of us , including our two kids loved it. The cinematography was breathtaking and I was lucky to be in Kabini when Shaaz and a South African couple were spending months tracking Saya. Well done to the team on this superb documentation of a black leopard. Shaaz's pictures in the movie and the National Geographic magazine are an absolute delight. We can't wait for the sequel!",False
4,1,Could have been a lot better,alexnlilly78,n/a,16/08/2025,"As another reviewer stated, I also did not like the first-person narrative. I kept waiting for some kind of educational information about black panthers in general.. statistics, facts, anything. It provided none of that. It was just a short story about one particular panther. I suppose it would be good for kids. It's just not the same quality as PBS Nature.",False
5,10,AMAZING Documentry!!,vkrishng,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw the picture of the famous 'Black panther by the shadow of female panther' a while ago in the news, titled as, 'the eternal couple'. I was amazed by the photography and the efforts put in by the photographer after reading the backstory behind the photo.This documentary narrates a wonderful drama and real life story behind 3 panthers in Khabini's forest including other animals. Moments of tiger scene is like a big star cameo in movies. Truly magnificent everything about the nature, Indian forests, wildlife diversity, and drama.",True
6,1,Just why?,darkangeljha,n/a,16/08/2025,"I couldn't get past the intro. I was hoping that speaking in the first person was just for the intro but it wasn't. All the other docus I watched were great and had either regular narration or we were along for the ride with an actual explorer. This was just weird and unnecessary. The voice actor didn't help but to be honest, I don't think it would have mattered.",False
7,3,"Good, if you're a crayon.",raykristopher,n/a,16/08/2025,The most mangled footage ever. I bet the camera crew vomited when they saw what was done. It's either a documentary or a film. There's no in between. Anthropomorphizing is insulting. Who's the target audience? Probably crayon.,False
8,1,Disrespectful,mabryarchie,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fact that you used an anglican/european voice for this was utterly direspectful & ruined this potential experience for me within the first 15 seconds.Talk to Michael B. Or Danielle Kaluuya, then reshoot this.",False

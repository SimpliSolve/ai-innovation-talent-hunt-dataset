1,9,Nice short film,sujit_kumar,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie shows the Godse's side of the story, of his reasoning of why he assassinated Gandhi. The dialogues are accurate as per the actual court hearing of Nathuram Godse. I really liked the acting skills and dialogue delivery of Amol Kolhe.",False
2,10,Short but succinct film on Nathuram Godse,vijayadar,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very important film on an important event that successive Congress and Leftist Governments in India tried to suppress. Nathuram Godse removed the false halo around Gandhi's head like an onion, peel by peel, and displayed the false Mahatma's egocentric mentality that resulted in not only a religious partition of Bharat but also sowed the seed of perpetual hostility between Muslims and the rest. Godse's last speech at his trial is a masterpiece that needs to be widely read and now heard.A very simple film, presented simply, without any frills. That makes it even more appealing.Amol Kolshe is the only star in this drama and his performance is absolutely riveting.",False
3,10,Beautifully made and expertly performed movie on Nathuram Godse,anandpa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very well made movie which shows the other side of the coin. The factual representation and courtroom drama is stunningly delivered.It makes us think why historical events happened the way they happened. There were reasons and those reasons are depicted in this movie without taking sides.It also shows positive and negative sides to what we take for granted due to public hysteria. Reasoning and core belief in truth and belief in intellectual integrity is very much appreciated.The movie is straight to the point and engages right from the beginning. The actor (Godse) delivers highly engaging performance with factual dialogs, integrity and emotional intelligence in his acting.",False
4,1,It's a fantasy - courtroom drama,anshumankrsingh,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the film attempts to provide a different perspective on historical events, it seems to lack thorough research on its subject. The portrayal of the motivations behind Gandhi's assassination feels oversimplified and somewhat misguided. Historical accuracy is crucial, and it appears that the film overlooks significant details, such as Nathuram Godse's prior assassination attempts on Gandhi, which predated the partition of India. The narrative seems to defend Godse's actions without adequately addressing the complexities of the historical context. It's important to approach such sensitive topics with a commitment to factual accuracy.",False

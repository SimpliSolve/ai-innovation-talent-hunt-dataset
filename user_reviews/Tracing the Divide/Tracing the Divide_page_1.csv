1,9,An Unexpected Surprise,AnnieLongLegs,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was an unexpected surprise. Labeled as a sports documentary, TRACING THE DIVIDE shows the endurance, grit, and tenacity of two athletes as they transcend the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route from Canada to Mexico. Hidden behind the cycling and spectacular views, however, is really a heartwarming story on male friendship and what it means to be vulnerable in the moment. The two Chrises force themselves to get comfortable with the uncomfortable throughout this film, but through it all there are moments of humor and light and playfulness that the men keep finding during this ride of their lives - which ultimately keeps the viewer captivated and rooting them on during the 1hr 24 minute runtime.Pop some popcorn, grab some Mike & Ikes, and get ready to sit back for a really enjoyable movie.",False
2,9,The Journey We Take with Our Hearts,lorawndupree,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some stories find you right when you need them most.Tracing the Divide found me exactly two months to the day of being laid off - still sitting in the tension of what's next. What I didn't expect was to see my own journey reflected so clearly on screen.The film follows two lifelong friends cycling the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route. Their physical journey mirrored the inner journey I've been navigating - knocked off course, uncertain of what lies ahead. And yet, this film reminded me that being stuck isn't the same as being stopped.Visually, the film is stunning - but its deepest beauty lies in how it captures the quiet, vulnerable moments of what it means to keep moving forward when the path isn't clear. Sometimes the muddy muck isn't a detour - it's part of the journey. A place to pause, reflect, and gather strength before moving forward again.This story found me exactly when I needed it - reminding me that the most important journey isn't the one we take with our feet, but the one we take with our hearts.",False
3,9,Very inspirational,hrd2bhmbl-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"While it doesn't carry the heart pounding intensity of the film Free Solo, Tracing the Divide still highlights the drive a select few have to push themselves beyond their limits.The best friends at the heart of this film are engaging, inspiring and fun the watch as they tackle this 2400 mile trek and all the challenges and emotions that come along with it. Add to that the interviews of both men, separately, and it is a fun ride.Beyond that, the scenery of the continental divide is breathtaking and captured beautifully.I really enjoyed this film and it reinforces my belief that some people, in the best way, are just crazy. LOL.",False
4,8,Two Good Buds and Some Peanut Butter Mud,mxferraro,n/a,16/08/2025,"Friends since childhood, a couple of middle-aged guys named Chris follow through on an epic bucket list item--riding the Continental Divide, from Canada to Mexico, on mountain bikes. Beautifully photographed, both by drone and up and close and personally by the director/editor, this film slowly unspools into much more than a glorious travelogue, which it certainly is.These are not actors, or over-produced reality show contestants, desperate to get followers-- they are husbands and fathers hoping to test their physical limits and discover something about their character while seeing the country in a unique way.Mission accomplished. They push themselves hard, and face myriad obstacles along the way-- weather, muddy paths, a wipeout injury and... punctured bear spray canister anyone? Chris and Chris's friendship comes across as solid and dependable, and despite a little occasional friction, they have some charming moments together along the way, including a memorable candy debate (Twizzlers vs. Mike & Ikes). One minor issue on the sightseeing front is that we don't really get to see/interact with local characters on-camera when they pit-stop in towns during their arduous, 24-day trek.The film is bookend-ed with verite footage and interviews with their families, giving us a sense of just how profound an experience this would be, if we were thusly inspired, and decided to pedal over 2,000 miles.",False
5,8,Unexpected lessons on the journey,katiequercus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thoroughly enjoyable documentary which showcases a longtime friendship, the stunning vistas of the West, the delight of encountering trail angels, and the lessons learned en route which impact the riders lives afterwards. It also never ceases to amaze me what riders will endure to get through the miles and the variety of culinary treats (or not) that are devoured to fuel their ride. A major achievement for the riders and the filmmakers too. It is well worth the time to watch this buddy biking documentary although you feel guilty doing this while wearing clean clothes and enjoying the comforts of home.",False
6,9,Inspiring,jbenko-77833,n/a,16/08/2025,Right from the start I was so interested in the two characters and their journey. As I watched I loved the way the characters became more and more vulnerable each and everyday with the various challenges they faced. The playfulness of becoming a kid again laughing and joking and being able to enjoy nature living in the now. As a society we are so connected to our phones and the digital age we forget how to enjoy life. Having a family of my own I get lost and forget about the important things in life. This movie helped me want to reconnect with family and friends. The cinematography was simply breathtaking. Really enjoyed it from start to finish.,False
7,10,An adventure of a lifetime,jjlutgen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I felt like I was on this trip with the guys. What a wonderful journey from Canada to Mexico. I really enjoyed seeing and listening to the highs and lows of Chris and Chris as they worked through their mid-life journey together. The scenery and music were amazing in this film and the people they met along the way, although not in the film, was inspiring to know that there is such a community that supports travelers in this way. This is not a trip that I would sign up for, but I am thankful that I was able to see it through their eyes and that they were willing to share their thoughts and feelings along the way.",False
8,10,Immerse yourself in an amazing ride!,cjhribal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tracing the Divide is a film for everyone from armchair enthusiasts to weekend warriors to hardcore cyclists to anyone curious about long cycling adventures. If you've ever wondered how a massively long and difficult bike journey (2400 miles, following the Continental Divide from the Canadian border with Montana to the Mexican border with New Mexico) happens, this is your movie. Amazing cinematography, with great shots of the two bikers cycling through one majestic landscape after another, plus close ups of the bikers, Chris Hiebert and Chris Schmidt, navigating rocky trails in the dark and battling the mud caking on their bikes after a storm. Achingly beautiful vistas of mountains and sky are paired with shots of Hiebert and Schmidt up close and personal as they confront their vulnerabilities and test their physical and emotional strength. Moments of sheer joy and serendipity-a celebratory drink as they cross from one state to the next, and meeting various ""trail angels,"" the people who helped them out along the way-alternate with moments of fear, uncertainty, even irritation. By film's end, we better understand why Hiebert and Schmidt undertook this trek, and how they changed as a result. A fine film about resilience and discovery and the splendor of truly immersing yourself in the landscape through which you're traveling.",False
9,10,Enjoy the journey,speedy_pete,n/a,16/08/2025,"This beautifully shot and well-crafted film is exactly what you'd hope for-a heartfelt story of two lifelong buddies pushing themselves to the limit, testing their friendship through both physical and emotional challenges. It's got all the makings of a great adventure: stunning mountain trails, grueling climbs, heart-pounding descents, and just enough campfire wisdom to make you want to grab a bike and hit the road yourself.At its core, this isn't just a film about mountain biking-it's about the kind of friendship that's been through the wringer and still holds strong. The journey takes these two pals deep into the wilderness and even deeper into their own thoughts. And, as you might expect when two stubborn folks spend that much time together, tensions bubble up. There's some good-natured ribbing, a few honest (and maybe overdue) conversations, and a couple of moments where you wonder if they'll make it out still speaking to each other. But through all the sweat, scrapes, and scenic overlooks, they come away with a clearer sense of who they are and why they've stuck by each other all these years.It's an easy, enjoyable watch, full of sweeping vistas, raw moments of frustration and triumph, and the kind of natural humor that happens when two old friends know each other a little too well. The breathtaking cinematography pulls you right into the ride, and the soundtrack sets the perfect tone.Recommended!",False
10,8,This movie inspired me to get off the couch and clean the garage.,knclhed,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew nothing about this trail. It seemed almost absurd that something like this would exist, but surprisingly it does. A better title would have been ""There will be blood and mud and... candy. This is a true test of friendship. But so much more. Motivational. A goal oriented pilgrimage with no pot of goal at the end. Just bragging rights. Definitely a bucket list box checker. It makes you question how far you would push yourself. If there was ever a documentary that lived and breathed the slogan - it's not about the destination, but solely about the journey this is it. Buckle up Buttercup - it's up hill all the way.",False
11,10,An Unexpected Treat!,hsampson-57543,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't relate to sweat and brutal physical exertion. I can, however, admire it.Fortunately, this film is about so much more. At its heart, it is about relationship and transformation. The friendship between the Chris' is real (and not always sunshine and lollipops), touching, and at times laugh out loud funny! These two childhood friends have weathered many years and life changes together, but this terrain puts their friendship to the test. It also tests their relationship to themselves. ""What am I doing? What's it all about?"" Finally, how their individual experience and the transformative nature of the journey impacts their relationships at home reminds us, that at the core of adventure is change.These two good-hearted men set out on this big adventure with the humility of ""I'm not sure this is a great idea,"" and we are all rewarded with beautiful landscapes, a team to cheer for and a full heart! Thank you for taking us along for the ride. I absolutely loved it!",False
12,9,A Compelling Documentary: The Arduous Journey of Two Lifelong Friends,emilyemikobusiness,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Tracing the Divide"" is an engaging documentary that follows two lifelong friends, as they tackle the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, spanning from Canada to Mexico. The film dives deeply into the physical and emotional challenges they face, shedding light on the strength of their friendship that drives them to keep going. Stunning cinematography captures the rugged beauty of the landscape, immersing viewers in both the serenity and the intensity of their journey. Along the way, the story also highlights the kindness and camaraderie of fellow travelers and locals. This inspiring film celebrates resilience, adventure, and the transformative power of human connection, I thoroughly enjoyed it!",False
13,9,So much fun on two wheels!,dpnu35,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love cycling more than most people, so my opinions aren't without bias. Before watching this wonderfully crafted and inspirational documentary, I knew nothing about the Great Divide mountain bike route from Canada to Mexico. The longest ride I've ever gone is roughly 60 miles, which seemed very long to me. Understanding how much pain and discomfort just a century ride puts on the human body, my jaw was on the floor when the well designed and informative graphics showed the mileage count that these two warriors accumulated not just in a single day but over the course of the entire journey. It's a testament to the resilience of humans and the glory of sport that drives some people to take on such a mammoth endeavor.The film does a great job of balancing the relationship between our two main characters along with what is at stake for them personally. It's quite a journey emotionally and physically that you won't regret joining them on. I can't wait to see what the filmmakers do next!I bet the film will make you jump on your two wheeler and get outside...",False
14,10,Surprisingly Rewarding,innicksmind,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being unfamiliar with the world of bicyclists, all I knew was from my experience in Portland, OR where they slow you down a bit on your way to work. After screening this documentary, my perspective has changed by its invitation to its viewers to not only witness but also experience one of the longest and greatest treks for any cyclist.The film doesn't start slow; it jumps right in to these cyclists's lives immediately at the beginning of their incredible journey. It requires more than strength, courage, and endurance, but also mentality. This film reveals the toll on the mind with the struggles of the weather/conditions/logistics and the climb of the trek itself with a spiritually rewarding finish. Cycling isn't just about commute; it's about personal reflection, a metaphor for your own life's journey with each and every pump of your pedal. And this film conveys these cyclists's stories beautifully.",False
15,9,An unexpected soul search on a bicycle adventure on the Great Divide.,vickiehsieh-29847,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two life-long friends, Chris Hiebert and Chris Schmidt, embark on a bike ride down the scenic and sometimes treacherous Great Divide Mountain Bike Route. Their journey takes 24 days, 2,415 miles and multiple stops to McDonalds. What may have started as an adventure with a little soul searching quickly becomes a deeper exploration of endurance, friendship and self-discovery. Along the way, they face not just physical obstacles but mental challenges as the hours tick on while they churn their bike wheels. As the two bikers push through the exhaustion of this journey, what is tested and revealed is the strength of their bond, like when Chris Hiebert could not get to his unhealthy foods at a town stop and had to figure out the compromise and stop ""whining"", or when he takes a good fall on a downhill trail and his friend Chris Schmidt carefully patches him back up. It is in these tender moments that the true characters are revealed. From the sweeping aerial shots of the rugged terrain to the close-ups of the bikers exhausted faces, the visuals immerse the audience in the raw beauty of the Great Divide. The camera work captures some of the grueling nature of their trek but I feel that the filmmakers needed to give a little more attention to the rawness of those challenging moments. Overall, the film had very good pacing and had my full attention for 80 minutes. I laughed and I awed. I was inspired by their human transformation and their endurance.",False
16,10,An Inspiring Journey,bengal,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was pleased some friends had me over to watch this film! It's more than just a watchable documentary; it is an inspiration to get feet-on-the-pavement to try any giant, risky endeavor that's been lingering in the back of your mind.These two gentlemen demonstrate amazing fortitude, brotherhood, perseverance, and humility through adverse conditions, pushing themselves not just to trace the continental divide, but also to discover more about themselves as men.The cinematography is beautiful, as well. With a mix of drones, GoPros, and high quality interview footage, the film immerses the viewer in the gorgeous landscapes that make up that part of America. I'd watch this for the fantastic views, alone!But the film is rich with many other elements, as well. The music, for instance, is also noteworthy. One of the songs is written and performed by the son of one of the cyclists. With perfect timing, the mood of each scene is punctuated by profound melodies.When something as physically demanding as this is attempted, the facade that people normally put up in front of the camera breaks down and what we are left with is raw emotion and often brutally honest discourse as these two soul-searching athletes grow. Strongly recommend!",False
17,10,Not Just A Bike Ride,nancyhmu,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you've ever felt the need for an epiphany or a deeper discovery of yourself , this beautiful film will move you in that direction .It was great to see a friendship of two men support one another along the way
The safe space and grace each of them offer to each other during this physical and mental journey was heartwarming.I felt like I was riding side by side with them as they pedaled through our country and its vast beauty! This is truly a fun ride with great scenery and music
Let it inspire you to do that thing you've been putting off! Take the trip! Push yourself forward and grow! Your loved ones will enjoy a better version of you in the end!",False
18,10,Dynamic Documentary,tashiagates0,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tracing the Divide is a well executed and dynamic documentary. Immediately the cinematography captivates the audience as we see shots of the two cyclists and close friends Chris Schmidt and Chris Hiebert on their initial journey days in Montana. We are drawn in to their friendship and become invested in their success as we are allowed to follow them visually and emotionally on the their epic 2,400 mile mountain bike route from Canada to Mexico. What makes this film so dynamic is that we as an audience get to experience multiple aspects of these two humans...their strength, determination, endurance and fortitude while also experiencing the breathtaking landscapes of their journey. This film is a great tribute to cyclists, adventurists and dreamers.",False
19,10,Start Your Adventure!!,davidcstoddard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tracing the Divide is an adventure lover's dream, offering a compelling journey for audiences of all ages.

Through their journey, we're reminded that the opportunity for adventure isn't just a one-time event-it's something we can seek and embrace in our daily lives.",False
20,9,Tracking the Tracing,davidjamesslama,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was very impressed with this documentary. It kept me engaged and I felt like I was actually along for the ride. I can assume it would be difficult to take the mundane and make it interesting, but this project did it. 2 bicyclists just riding their bikes, how can this be interesting? The bikers made this an enjoyable experience. They engaged the audience naturally and nothing ever felt pushed. You felt what they felt and saw what they saw. The scenery was beautiful, the ups and downs were magical. Well documented and well edited. I won't ever try the trek myself, but again, after this documentary I feel like I've done it. Great job!!",False
21,9,A indi gem not to be missed!!!,joelandryc,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautiful film about the relationship bond between two of the closest best friends. This type of raw and emotional honesty is very rarely depicted in real life let alone in a small indi gem of a film like this one. 24 days of cinematic beauty captures the emotions of a lifetime. Facing wind, rain and all sorts of inclement weather, the strong bond proves that brotherly love can conquer all. Pull out the popcorn and snuggle up with your significant other. TRACING THE DIVIDE is a perfect date night film especially when you need a distraction from so many of the negative and violent films.",False

Whether you're a cyclist, a friend, or simply someone who believes in the transformative power of journey, this film is bound to resonate.The cinematography of the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest serves as a stunning backdrop to the cyclists' journey, but it's the relationship between the two friends that really drives the narrative.Both of the riders came out of their journey different people and for different reason. I enjoyed watching Tracing the Divide and will be sure to tell my filmophile friends.Great job!",False

The director anticipates every question forming in the mind of the viewer and provides sweeping cinematography, personal insights from the riders, and a poignant Indie soundtrack to tell this fascinating story.

It was shot very well.Also, anyone who is into riding, would really love this film too. It was lovely to see the kindness of the people they met along the way. Gave me some faith back in humanity.

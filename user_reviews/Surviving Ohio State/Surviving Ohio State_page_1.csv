1,9,Sickening Abuse Of Power,dark41969-818-469810,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis scandal was appalling to watch unfold. I briefly heard about this story on the news. And I had no idea how deep this cover up would end up at the board of trustees. One doctor was allowed to get away with decades of sexual abuse towards teenage boys (I feel although they were in college their minds are still adolescent & not fully adults, yet). The coaches, other doctors, the school board etc., didn't care about these kids well being when their families entrusted them to care for their offspring. Instead they get sold out by their college & get no justice for being abused as survivor /victims of a known sexual predator. The documentary made me sad & angry that they were sold out for a few billion dollars, there's so much money in college sports that those in charge sold their souls. No accountability from the school while people's lives were shattered along with trust & the need to feel safe away from home. I would boycott this school, but the school will continue to prey on innocent kids by giving them scholarships & desperate people would unfortunately accept them as a lifeline to achieve their goals as an individual striving to do better. It's a really thought provoking & heart wrenching documentary. I highly recommend it.",True
2,9,An Outstanding Documentary,chiltonsjillfreeport,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOne remarkable aspect of Dr. Richard Strauss' long history of sexually abusing Ohio State male athletes and students is (despite the open secret of his predation in athletic circles) that he finally triggered his own investigation, by filing a complaint about his supervisor to the medical board after he was put on administrative leave following three sexual assault complaints in a year.Given the damage he inflicted...the ego and pathology of the man was just staggering.Filmmakers set the scene vividly, bringing alive OSU's culture through the eyes of subjects as proud of their school as they are haunted by Strauss and the complicity of silence on their lives and athletic pursuits.Among the awful truths of Surviving Ohio State is the fact that literally no one who could've intervened tried to protect or listen to these students. All except fencing coach Charlotte Remenyik, the one female coach of a male team, who 'year after year' relayed complaints about Strauss' assaults, ogling and masturbating in exam and locker rooms .About 40 minutes in, punctuated by long weary blinks, Dr. John Lombardo, OSU's director of sports medicine, who ostensibly supervised Dr: Strauss, admits in a 2019 deposition he never spoke to a single fencer, despite Coach Remenyik's *years* of relaying sexual abuse complaints, before dismissing the accusations as 'rumor and innuendo.'Likewise, no one at OSU, to his knowledge, ever reached out to students about Strauss. Lombardo never asked a trainer or coach whether the doctor behaved inappropriately with a student. Because OSU refused to investigate, no formal evidence was recorded.Watching, my burning question was (beyond how those who should've protected these men lived with themselves), why didn't they at least replace him? But, of course, if Strauss was fired, minus the OSU imprimatur behind him, it all would've come out. Fingers would've pointed back at coaches, supervisors, trainers, the director-and ultimately, the board of trustees.Another athletics aha is shortly revealed: Strauss was a pioneer of anabolic steroids. Who, according to OSU athletes, oversaw a years-long steroid regimen. Making two OSU secrets that would've wreaked havoc with their public image of athletic excellence.It's not an easy watch. I expected to cry and OSU hockey player Al Novakowski's (named Strauss' 48th rape victim in the investigation) and wrestler Dan Ritchie's stories were devastating to hear and imagine.One of the film's particular strengths is the sensitivity and restraint of the storytelling. This is a clear-eyed view, minus sentimentality or prurience; filmmakers did an admirable job of staying out of their own way and letting subjects speak for themselves.OSU wrestling coaches Russ Hellickson and Jim Jordan come off as badly as they do largely via their own (damning) words.The slow reveal of exactly how nightmarish it was is nothing short of gripping. What I didn't expect was how uplifting it ultimately was, as so many men supported one another in truth.",True
3,7,Extreme negligence,mattatthemovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is absolutely damning to the reputation of Ohio State athletics. It is eerily similar to another scandal happening concurrently with another Big Ten university involving an athletics doctor. Add in Penn State and the Big Ten has a pretty bad track record when it comes to protecting student athletes.The different testimonies from the former athletes, students, and wrestling official Fred Feeney are all devastating. For decades these kids had to weigh whether speaking up was worth risking their dreams as an athlete. The school has claimed ignorance despite it being an open secret for years that Dr. Strauss regularly engaged in many inappropriate behaviors.The most egregious action they took was promoting Strauss to a position in the campus medical clinic which gave him access to thousands of students. Even after multiple formal complaints were made alleging misconduct.Ohio State almost certainly knew what was happening. They likely chose to do nothing because their sports programs were performing, and they didn't want bad press to jeopardize that.Russ Hellickson and Jim Jordan are absolute cowards who have chosen to save their own reputations over doing what is right. They knew their athletes were being molested, and they did nothing about it.",True
4,10,Good telling of a coverup by a sports powerhouse,tigers-48267,n/a,16/08/2025,"What stands out in watching this is how time after time, responsible parties did nothing for children in their care. The students didnt know how to react to the situation they found themselves in. The adults did, but buried it. Embarrassing beyond belief for OSU, as they continue to fight taking full accountability. No honor for any Buckeyes here.The coaches that deny knowing are less than believable. The administrators who admit anything seem to do so begrudgingly. Those students who were molested had their lives changed not only by a predator, but also by people who knew better and did nothing.",False
5,10,well done doc regarding a disturbing story,jdn-82931,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a horrifying story of over twenty years of abuse. You wonder how something like this happens and how it could have been ongoing for decades. This documentary lays out the story very well and the horror of the handling of the reported abuse that makes it more horrific for the hundreds of survivors.I appreciate that this documentary told the story in a respectful way and had interviews with survivors who told their own story of their experiences. The pacing was very good in this professionally edited production.Although this is a tough topic to hear about; this is a good documentary.,False
6,10,Must watch for all Americans,Nothingbutblueskies22,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerFirst time writing a review here. Just watch it. Then tell everyone you know to watch it. Then talk about it. With everyone. Incredibly important documentary perfectly executed.It is high time for the conversation around men and boys being abused (sexually and otherwise) to be totally out in the open in our country. It would in no way be dismissive to or undercut the importance of the conversation around the abuse of women and girls. Every single person who goes through this is important. Every single story is important.These brave men say all you need to hear about what really happened at Ohio State. All I can add is that it is not possible to completely heal from trauma without accountability.I'll be watching this case to see if they finally get that. They deserve it.,True
7,10,Excellent doc on a difficult topic,cobrainey,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a stellar example of good documentary storytelling! It could have been a jumbled mess, given that there were many characters across the span of 20 years. But it was laid out clearly with just enough backstory, well-told, and very watchable. My heart goes out to the athletes & students who were subjected to the horrors while they were at OSU, but their courage absolutely made the doc the compelling film I watched. It shined a light on the double-edged sword of ""winning at all costs"" and accountability. As the plaintiffs wait for their ultimate 'day in court', I wish genuine justice to all.",False
8,10,Must See Film,kennethdower,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent documentary about horrific sexual abuse and the university that cared more about its reputation than protecting their students. Rep. Jim Jordan was one of the people who knew what was going on for years and did nothing. If this film helps to bring him down and effects real justice for the many victims, it will be a job well done. This is a highly emotional documentary that will leave most viewers aghast and angry. Bravos for the brave men that have come forward to share their painful stories with the world, and for standing up against the gross injustice inflicted upon them by the Ohio State University.",False
9,10,Disturbing,DrZom-77-388656,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not an alumni, but I have been a fan of tOSU since the Ten Year War. I feel like I have been punched in the stomach. Yes, I knew there was some scandal about Jim Jordan, the wrestling team, and the team doctor but never had any idea just how extensive the criminal behavior was or how long it went on. Worse, I did not realize how the school has dealt with the scandal.I don't know if I will be able to feel again the joy a National Championship has brought me in the past. Even if I can, certainly I can never forget what I have learned from this film.I highly recommend every Buckeye fan to watch. It will change you.",False
10,10,intense must see,jennibeavers,n/a,16/08/2025,For athletes going to the ohio state university they never could have imagined the dangerous dr they were supposed to trust. Dr strauss abused many male students for decades all while the school covered it up and from my understanding still does to this day. Your heart breaks for these brave men who come to tell their horrific stories and the impacts on their lives. It is a must watch and these brave men need to be heard loud as can be for all those watching truly sicking horrific and unimaginable just how long that abuse took place and how many people knew it but never once cared to protect those students.,False
11,10,The coaches should be held criminally accountable for their coverup,BeaKay-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Might bring the two wrestling coaches up for charges in court. The young men who were sexually assaulted deserve to see justice served. Jim Jordan will be remembered for this over anything he has done in Congress.Reck Hellison, head coach, was disgustingly wrong about not telling authorities the team doctor was sexually assaulting some of the team members. He did meet with those who were assaulted and told them he would take care of this. He never said anything after this meeting.",False
12,10,My Hometown School Disgraced,theRetiree,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI literally grew up on campus while my Dad was studying there and my brother was born at the OSU hospital, so I've been following this story for years, but never understood the full depth and depravity of the scandal, nor the shocking cowardliness of those in responsibility during the horror. Glad this is now coming out in detail and hope it gets wide distribution. You must watch this documentary, and remember that ""the honorable Gym"" Jordan is the chairman of the US House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. Contrast his behavior with that of the only person in authority to raise her voice--the female fencing coach. See, there are a few heroines left, but obviously not many heroes.",True
13,8,Compelling content,Arts-student,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a movie about grotesque and heartbreaking circumstances. It allows its subjects to speak to their own experiences and uses documents to corroborate their stories and the role in the institution that is focused upon. My criticism is regarding the lack of expert on-screen interviews. No medical professional or expect on grooming, sexual abuse, etc. Gives context to the abuse, the shame around it, what these people must have gone through. All of this is offered through the subjects themselves which is compelling however leaves me wondering if it makes the film more editorial (regardless of fact) rather than a documentary on the subject. I hope these survivors find peace.",False
14,8,A Real Life Horror Movie,CineChamber,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. What an absolutely devastating and horrifying story told by people who have no reason to tell it other than seeking accountability and justice. This documentary is very well crafted, and the stories told here are powerful. It absolute astounds me that large organization like this, and people in positions of power can hide truths of ""open secrets"" like these allegations again Richard Strauss. I truly hope this documentary helps move this case forward, and the victims and survivors of this situation can find peace and justice. I will always call to hold accountability to power. The Ohio State University, Russ Hellickson, and congressman Jim Jordan deserve to have the walls of truth come crashing down around them.",False

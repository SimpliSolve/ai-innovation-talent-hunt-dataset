1,7,Good but could've been Great.,myfakeemail-53394,n/a,16/08/2025,7.5 Overall a good documentary although there have been numerous documentaries before. I just wish there was more players interviewed from the redeem team. Kobe was one of if not the main focus of the documentary as he should be. All respect and honor to the late KOBE. Great showing how USA BASKETBALL dominated for many years until not winning the GOLD and then to finding their way back to glory. I felt like it would been better if this was a mini series documentary like the one with JORDAN and the BULLS. What I learned is Kobe was different from the rest and TEAM USA is just unfair with the individuals talents they have.,False
2,6,About the calibre of an NBA Championship DVD,js-sherlock,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nice recap and highlight reel of the Redeem Team's 2008 Olympic run, but aside from that, it was a somewhat hollow rehashing of events. The documentary didn't tell us anything we didn't already know about this team. There was no greater message to take away from this event.Since the first series of ESPN 30 for 30 was released, the standard for sports documentaries has been raised and ths doc didn't come close to that standard. The level of journalism here amounts to nothing more than an NBA Championship DVD.Documentarians need to understand that the biggest stars and teams don't always make the best documentary subjects and this is a prime example.Team USA definitely deserved the gold medal in this Olympics but my biggest takeaway tells me that there are major cracks in USA Basketball development programs and how the AAU is ruining American basketball. It was embarrassing to see a team of nearly-all Hall of Famers pounding their chests and talking trash about beating a Spanish team led by one NBA Hall of Famer, an all-star, and a group of fringe NBA role players and benchwarmers. USA needed every single ounce of effort that LeBron and Kobe gave to win that medal or else they wouldn't have been enough to beat Spain.A more interesting documentary might be how Team USA has become a victim of its own success and how the 1992 Dream Team inspired a legion of international players to take on and beat Team USA.",False
3,7,"A fitting tribute to the GOATs of that era, especially Kobe! [+73%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jon Weinbach (who was one of the producers of The Last Dance) showcases the journey of redemption for the U. S. Olympic Men's Basketball team and tells us why we refer to this team as one of the greatest ever. We get perspective from all the key folks involved, including coaches, announcers, and the players themselves. I stopped watching the NBA in 2006, and gave up playing the yearly EA Sports videogames too, eventually. But this piece is such a well-made throwback to something that took the Olympic games by storm and reinstates why Kobe Bryant is among the all-time greats in the game of basketball. To hear from the top guys (including Chris Paul, Jason Kidd, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and more) adds much-needed depth to the story, and gives everyone who loves the game plenty to cheer about.The games themselves prove to be more about Kobe's workmanship than anything else. While the main ingredient here is missing (i.e. Sitdown interviews with Kobe), it still has enough for anyone who enjoyed the game in the 2000s and still harbors a liking to the GOATs of that particular era. Also, they've included some brilliant cutaways during the end credits.",False
4,6,Who was on the team?,mikefox-04778,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's an ok piece of film work, gives some historical context, and has some good and interesting behind-the-scene insights into the motivations and mindsets of coach K and some of the players.But for a documentary which is trying to make the point that teamwork, camaraderie and chemistry are the most important ingredients in a successful team, it sure does a terrible job at including all players as an integral part. The film hypocritically preaches team spirit, then goes on to single out the individual contributions of 3-6 players at every possible turn, while pretty much ignoring the rest of the team.So who was on the team? Yes, Kobe, LeBron, D-Wade, Melo, Chris Bosh, Carlos BoozerBut also:Jason KiddDeron WilliamsMichael ReddDwight HowardChris PaulTayshaun PrinceIt could have been a lot better, if all players had been interviewed, or if they actually didn't want to (which I doubt), then at least give them their separate spotlight on the court. They were on the team, they made it work as well, they had their moments, not just the ""main"" characters.",False
5,9,Nice documentary that highlights camaraderie in a sport traditionally filled with too much ego.,ubreakubuy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not going to pretend I know about all the history of all the NBA players so my perception might be off, but I enjoyed this documentary. It shows the intentions, personalities, and most of all humbleness of players when playing for something greater than themselves. In the NBA, many of these players are perceived to be best of the best, which results in development of inflated egos. To watch the journey of them temporarily putting it down for the benefit of others, fosters that belief that we as humans aren't always selfish.There's a growing tumor of entitlement that been slowly festering in American culture. Watching the journey the team went through to overcome the difficulties is refreshing as well as inspiring.",False
6,7,"After Michael, Kobe is the best.",christopherstamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is no 'The Last Dance' by a long stretch. However it's great that they finally did a documentary showing just how great Kobe was.To be honest most of the team, are forgettable, so it's a shame that so much of this short documentary was wasted on team members who did little to get the win. What happened between the previous generation and this generation, is unbelievable how far they have fallen. So much arrogance, and ego, where once there was courage and dreams. The basic flaws were clear as day. The team would rather party than practice. The coach used a military approach rather than skill and learning the sport. Lebron ego, based off popularity rather than skill. The repeated failures write themselves.Yet when you have to bring in 1 guy to fix all of that and whip the team into some sort of shape - that says a lot about Kobe Bryant.",True
7,10,The Greats,lestertrent,n/a,16/08/2025,An amazing documentary that gives perspective not just on how great the USA basketball team was but also about the types of people it takes to be great.Lebron and Kobe are the definition of being the best athletes of all time and the best people of all time.These types of people don't come around often and we should feel blessed that we were privileged enough to be able to see their greatness.To think this was only a part of all the great things they achieved in their lives puts it in perspective how many levels there is to this game that we call life.Much respect for the gods and RIP to the GREAT Kobe Bryant!,False
8,7,"Totally biased, History is always written by winners. Spain should have won the final.",stagiraswarrior,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a nice documentary but it hides that the final against Spain was a thief: USA team did more than 20 travelling situations and the referees did nothing but penalized Spanish team with technical fouls as everyone can find on Youtube.This was admitted on BasketNews months after the final by Chantal Julien, one of the referees of USA-Germany game. Chantal said ""they could not penalize travelling with every Kobe Bryant's dribbling"" and also that ""the final was a shame"".It is specially funny that the documentary does not show the last seconds of the final game when Juan Carlos Navarro did intentionally travelling with 4 or 5 steps in order to protest while he was looking into the eyes of the referee.By the other hand, it is nice to see how some of the best players of NBA History was scared by players without NBA experience as Carlos Jiménez, Álex Mumbrú or 17 y.o. Ricky Rubio.",False
9,9,Pride and respect,hague13,n/a,16/08/2025,Wow. Great lessons for building pride and respect. History lessons utilized to educate the team and viewers on the importance of both elements to becoming champions. Shout out to Coach K for his leadership in coaching the egos and the players. The importance of the China market to the NBA is highlighted especially with the ever valuable Kobe Bryant on the team. Last the humble Kobe applying himself for this team and national redemption. Just wow. Great documentary to teach Respect and Pride in the beautiful game of basketball from the American perspective. Team work and Olympic fans themselves.,False
10,7,An enjoyable Netflix doco for sport/non sport fans alike,eddie_baggins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Keen to try and emulate the global success of their 10 part documentary mini-series on the Chicago Bulls The Last Dance, Netflix have given one of the series producers Jon Weinbach a spot in the directional chair with one off feature doco The Redeem Team.An insightful if only skin-deep examination of the USA men's national basketball teams quest to overcome a dwindling standing in the world ranks that came to a head with their bronze medal display at the 2004 Olympics and find redemption at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Redeem see's Weinback given access to some of the most famous talking heads in the sport as the likes of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Carmelo Anthony, Doug Collins and Mike Krzyzewski all recall the history behind getting one of the most talent filled national teams on record together to achieve the greatest success possible.A proud country and one that prides itself even more when it comes to their national sports and sporting feats, Redeem does a great job at showing what representing their country meant to the players that coach Krzyzewski assembled to work together for 4 years of hard training as some of the most gifted players to ever grace the courts of the NBA formed together to try and bring their team back to the glory days of old.Much like The Last Dance knowing the results and key instances of this journey doesn't stop Weinbach's doco from being a white knuckle one that does a great job of editing together countless hours of footage to a short and and sharp 90 minute product that never attempts to add additional weight or sub-plots to the central story that naturally finds extra meaning and interest from the presence of James and the late Kobe Bryant who at the time of this moment was dealing with some huge upheavals in his career that threatened to derail his legacy.After watching Bryant's feats as part of the Olympic team here and the type of effort he put in behind the scenes to drive a new standard within the team it's hard not to be inspired by the controversial figures works on and off the court and for any fans of the late superstar Redeem once more gives you a chance to watch one of the greatest basketball players of all-time work his magic, in this instance for no selfish reasons but reasons relating to his beloved country.Free of any extra emotional weight or baggage, Redeem never threatens to become an addition of the upper-echelon of sporting documentaries both from the feature or mini-series landscape but its another strong addition to the growing Netflix catalogue of quality basketball related products that are accessible for fans and casuals alike.Final Say -A short, sharp and fun examination of a group of sports superstars determined to make their country proud, The Redeem Team is a quality Netflix doco that is sure to please a wide ranging audience of sport and non-sport enthusiasts alike.3 1/2 early morning gym sessions out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",False
11,10,Triumphant Redemption Story,lemarkp,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary shot with pride, class & respect to it's source material.""The Redeem Team"" is a prideful inspirational film, that tells the story of the dominant rise of the USA basketball team on a global scale , the standard of excellence set for years and how it was in many ways neglected and taking for granted.The failure of victory in 2004 and their difficult road back to greatness at the 2008 Olympic Games.As an retired athlete, and a basketball fan. I felt educated, sadness, and tremendous emotion while watching this film. This is a document shot with class, respect, and immense quality.If you love sports, or inspiring true stories, you will enjoy this documentary.",False
12,7,An Inspiring Look at a Great Players Playing as a Team,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"'The Redeem Team' (2022) is nothing special like the 2008 U. S. Men's Basketball Team, but it will make you smile as you see the ""downfall"" and ""return-to-form"" of USA basketball.I thought this documentary was pretty good especially with conveying its narrative of redemption not just for Team USA or American basketball players, but also for the United States searching to return to form after the tumultuous early-to-mid 2000's.I will say though, this documentary doesn't really do anything unique and seems to rely on archival footage for its narrative instead of bringing in more individuals from previous US Olympic teams or players from rival countries.There is a touching tribute to Kobe Bryant as the film progresses and everyone seems impacted by Kobe in some way. This documentary is kind of a ""sub-doc"" on Kobe and makes you feel the energy and legacy he had across the world. Just a thought.",False
13,5,I didnt get it,jaiv345-588-762357,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo let's talk clear, this was a documentary about a very very very super squad to the rest that for surprise for everyone won at the end...
Usually this type of documentary was like al the way around, a team that nobody expect to do anything or not to much finish with a surprise, but really...
A documentary of a team with kobe, LeBron, wade and a lot more of USA stars that finally beats gasol and his partners (that were very good players, but not at the same level) it's is really a joke...
I suppose it was a really cheap material to produce because otherwise I don't cath the idea behind this documentary.",True
14,6,Not as good as 'The Last Dance',philpriestley,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was so looking forward to this because I've watched The Last Dance so many times. I'm not a huge basketball fan admittedly - but the telling of the Bulls story and the whole Michael Jordan biography is absolutely compelling. When the same guys came out with this and were touting LeBron James and Kobe Bryant and Dwayne Wade - plus the trailers - I mean I was salivating... The risk with these things is that it can be over-hyped quite easily.With a documentary film like this you have you recognise that there are certain narrative features that you cannot ignore or neglect. This cannot be a story that basically says ""We were the greatest basketball team in Olympic history - we took our eye off it, took our foot off the pedal, looked the other way, and someone stole it out from under us unexpectedly. So we focused, paid more attention and won it back. That's the story.""That story doesn't really light you up does it? Sadly - that is the actual story. Man for man the NBA has always produced the heavy guns and no matter what the documentary suggests about one or two countries having a couple of NBA players - nobody was taking hall of fame, NBA MVPs, front to back, to the Olympics. The competition - if the USA team was paying attention - was never that great. So the USA paid attention, they didn't really do anything tactically that special, they motivated their guys and they rolled up with LeBron, with Kobe and with D Wade (and others) and the inevitable happened (spoiler - they won the gold medal).The efforts to suggest that the final was close or got nervous are pretty thin. The USA led from the beginning and played it out. It wasn't a buzzer game.In the meanwhile you are hoping that behind the scenes you're going to find something new out, see something happen in training that you didn't know about, catch a brilliant anecdote... something? Nah. It doesn't come through. The stories are pretty tame.The documentary really tries to make this look like much more of an achievement than it really was - and in fact one commentator (American, naturally) even tried to suggest that this was 'the greatest team in the history of Olympic sport' (for what they achieved and what they over came). Nah. Don't get carried away.So it's interesting - probably wouldn't watch it more than once - will definitely interest an NBA fan specifically - but overall it's really not the story that they're trying to turn it into. Watch it - by all means - it is watchable and the production values are great - but don't expect a feature length version of 'The Last Dance'.",True
15,9,Respect the Greats,Mabkid,n/a,16/08/2025,"The NBA represents the best of the best in basketball. Every kid with a gaming console knows it. So when America gets beaten at one of their own national sport, it's incredibly humbling, and embarrassing.The Redeem Team tells a gripping behind-the-scenes look at how individual superstars came together as a team, so that the American flag, and anthem, could return back to the gold medal podium. The leadership, the stepping up, the discipline, the pride of the country over individual egos... all for America... is an incredible story put together brilliantly in this documentary.A very good sports documentary indeed that's more than worth your time.",False
16,6,No dreams inspired by this team,diegyfunteas,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you watched the Last Dance and got a glimpse of what true inspiration looks like don't expect to get anything out of this.This documentary just shows how the Dream Team was abominable and the new US team a disappointment and a boring ego driven spectacle. Every player is simply unremarkable and has little to no charisma (aside from Dwayne Wade). Same with the coaches. There really seemed to be no heart in this. And by the end you feel unaccomplished and like you simply sat through an hour of drab conversations and some okay highlight reels.Was the goal of this film to show a ""good"" comeback story? Feed off these basketball documentary trends? Remind people that modern day basketball players are human? Maybe be patriot? Whatever the goal it failed.Was an okay watch as a backdrop to cooking

Kobe came in and brought it to a different level who knows what could've happened of the panel didn't see Kobe in his gym gear at 5:30am, Kobe set the tone!! Not Lebron, Kobe! When they overcame Spain in the final I could almost feel their emotion shaking Dougs hand, putting that gold medal around his neck, putting the medals around coach K's neck. Incredible.",True
18,7,Decent doc about the 2008 US Olympic national team,JurijFedorov,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pretty emotional.It largely focuses on how US basketball embarringly lost in the 2004 Olympics and only got bronze. Which is a rare disaster for the most talented national team in the world. So they return in 2008 to revenge the loss. This time they are not arrogant about it. Last time most of the big names dropped out as the team was not a huge thing like during the Dream Team days in Barcelona where US went professional in the Olympics as NBA wanted to put basketball on the world map. They also wanted to revenge the USSR loses. One loss was a game where USSR paid the refs to give them the win in the final so that after USA won the game USSR got to replay the last few seconds until they scored. This created the Dream Team with all the top players. Basketball got extremely popular worldwide because of this kind of outreach. Other national teams started to improve and beat USA. The Redeem Team was then created top-down where they had to play every summer together to become a real team as talent alone would not win you anything anymore. So they couldn't just get together and win easily anymore.The doc largely focuses on Kobe and how hard he worked while the younger players partied. He and the coaching team got the team to really fight for it. The doc pays huge respect to him and his life and even shows his daughter at some points which is extremely emotional as he died with one of his daughters in a plane crash. It does get too melodramatic at times as they keep mentioning Kobe and his hard work rate.It's also extremely shallow. Basically 90% of it is about the training camp and they never explain anything about basketball. They just claim they need to train hard and play hard. No tactics are explained, not tactical plays. It's just all ""we need to get better"". For someone who doesn't watch basketball this is all confusing. So it's not quite clear how the teams play tactically or even what the Olympic rules are. Which is a damn shame. The interviews are fun for sure, but they all sound fake to some degree. Knowing LeBron was one of the people behind this doc just makes it sound more fishy as he is a known liar who even lies about small things to make himself look heroic and smart. Shame they never explain tactical matters or how you build a team.",False
19,9,Interesting and exciting watch,NS-reviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved all the old footage that was used in this documentary. It was great to see the authentic ""from the vault"" film of all the players, coach K, and the Collins family.It also was very touching how highly regarded Kobe was in this project. He truly was built different, and this documentary goes above and beyond to highlight that about him.It could have gone a little deeper, done a bit more digging into the storytelling. However, I enjoyed this documentary very much. It got the adrenaline going as a basketball fan to watch all the highlights from 2008! It brought out a lot of emotions for me as a viewer.",False
20,6,"Spain was THIS close, though.",ericknromero,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not a great documentary, but good enough to make you feel something.I appreciated the history of USA Men's Basketball provided in the first half of the movie, though. It was fairly thorough in covering major events like the 1972 controversy, the 1988 loss that prompted the introduction of pros with the 1992 Dream Team, the 2004 team that had multiple losses, and even a couple of FIBA World Championships. I think they should have covered the 2000 team because that was when everyone knew the world had caught up to the United States in basketball (and so they would show that Vince Carter dunk).Overall, I'm just not a big fan of the players on the 2008 gold medal team. From Melo to Bron to Wade to CP3, it feels like a lot or entitlement in one locker room. My favorite parts were pretty much anything Kobe was in. I can't say I was a Kobe fan during the majority of his career either, but no one could ever claim Bryant felt entitled to anything. He worked for everything he got, and his example taught the other guys how to be better prepared, more committed and disciplined, and more engaged in the game.I still think Argentina would have come back to beat Team USA if Ginobili hadn't gotten injured, but aside from that, it did feel good to have Coach K and the revamped USA basketball program comeback an dominate the sport again. I'm watching some of the highlights from the current FIBA tournament and the young guys look good. The point of the film is that the changes made 15 years ago got us here, and they may be right.",False
21,10,Great Viewing,dbisseker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really well made documentary, outlining the rise, fall and re-rise of the USA Olympic basketball team.Great interviews, footage and stories from the early days up until the 2008 Olympics.The Kobe chapter was my favourite.The true GOAT.Rest in Peace.From start to finish this was so well made.Highly recommend to watch for anyone just not sports fans.It is inspiring and shows how important culture and team work is.All these lessons can be applied to your professional and personal life.All in all, this was a great product.Made so well and squeezed into a very watchable 90 odd minute session.",False
22,5,Not much more than a LeBron patting himself on the back,v982911,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's too much focused on LeBron, Carmelo, Kobe, and D-Wade. Having LeBron as the exec producer also didn't much help the credibility of this docu. It's nothing more than an attempt to give a boost to LeBron's image. It's nothing in comparison to the Dream Team docu or the Last Dance. For example the Dream Team docu, the focus was on how the team got together, how they build their chemistry, and how they bonded and became a team. Every team member got a time to shine, even the people behind the scenes were put in the spotlight. I am missing Tayshaun Prince, Michael Redd.and Chris Paul from the docu. All in all just a docu focusing on LeBron and HIS friends. It's an average basketball docu.",True
23,9,I enjoyed it,MatthewLong23,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI usually love sports documentaries and this is one of them. It tells the story about the Team USA mens basketball team and their journey to redemption after a poor showing in the 2004 Olympics. It details the mindset Team USA management had, in getting players to commit to playing at the Olympics 3 years out and play in the various tournaments needed to qualify for the Olympics. Many great basketball players were on this team such as Lebron James, Dwayne Wade, Carmelo Anthony and Kobe Bryant and it mainly focuses on them and their mindset going into this. It plays almost like an underdog story but they weren't given all the talent they had. There was also a focus on previous Team USA basketball teams, particularly the one in 1972 who was robbed of a Gold Medal. Film also focuses on the whole Olympic experience these players had. If you like basketball, you'll most likely enjoy this.",True
24,10,Thank You...,lizreed-32103,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved this! Thank you for putting this together and sharing some of the backstory of this event. While I don't follow sports as actively as I used to, I'll always appreciate and admire great athletes. After watching this, I feel like I actually got to know some personally! They have every right to be proud of who they are and what they've accomplished. I agree with a few other reviews that referred to the Players and the documentary being first class... and I'm impressed with their attitudes, their behavior, and their achievement! As far as naysayers on any aspect of the film or the people involved, I can't understand what more they could want! It seems people, too often, glorify superficial nothingness, but can't give real credit when/where it's due. So, again, thank you to the Producers of this documentary... thank you for making it all more ""real"" for me.",False
25,8,Sizzling Slam Dunk Action on your Screen!!,mjpiro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Redeem Team is a documentary about the 2008 US Men's Olympic basketball team and so much more!! It encompasses all of what went into USA Men's basketball leading up to the 2008 Beijing Olympic games, including the long streak of unbeaten games where the US used collegiate athletes including the 1972 controversial game in Munich Germany where more time was put back on the clock and the USSR defeated the USA handing the Americans their first loss in a gold medal game. A loss in the 1988 Seoul Olympics had the US Men's basketball committee panicking as the world had finally caught up with the Americans talent wise at the amateur level, thus professional NBA players were used in the 1992 Barcelona Summer games where the much talked about Dream Team crushed the competition. All was well for American basketball again as they were dominate on the World stage until early in the 2000's when the world caught up with Uncle Sam once again. Countries like Germany, Spain, and Argentina were fielding teams that were giving the professional American team a run for its money so much so that Argentina won the 2004 Olympic gold medal in Athens, not even facing the US in the gold medal game who were relegated to play for the bronze. Much was wrong for Team USA in that Olympics, from a split in the team - a young generation of guys that never really gelled with the older group - and a coach (coach Larry Brown) that really never got the team to see his vision. Enter Jerry Coangelo and Coach K of Duke who reshaped Team USA basketball, and with the addition of a veteran by the name of Kobe Bryant, Team USA went on to great things in the 2008 Summer Olympics!! Great basketball highlights, great interviews, a well written documentary, good file video, and a great sense of fun have this as a video that any basketball fan should see!! 8 out of 10 stars!!",True

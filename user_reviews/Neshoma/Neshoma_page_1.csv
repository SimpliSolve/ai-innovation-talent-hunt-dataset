1,8,Suddenly movingly brilliant,Screen_Maven,n/a,15/08/2025,"Neshoma combines archival footage with a fictional voiceover character who writes letters to her brother who immigrated from Amsterdam. The historical footage is cleverly edited to align with the perspective of the letter-writing narrator.This film is perfect for anyone interested in Amsterdam's history. Many locations shown are still recognizable and exist today.Beginning in the pre-World War II era, the film gradually shows the creeping influence of fascism. Since the narrator is of Jewish descent, viewers are aware of the impending historical events. There's a powerful moment when the letter-writer reaches a point of uncertainty about the future. Without explicitly revealing known historical events, this creates an emotionally charged experience for the viewer - it certainly was for me.One of the film's strengths is its restrained portrayal of the war years. The decision to make an abrupt cut to the post-war period makes this movie movingly brilliant.Seen:January 5, 2025.",False
2,9,Excellent documentary style Holocaust movie,blhubner,n/a,15/08/2025,"The story of Nesjoma is admittedly fictional, but it paints a realistic picture of Jewish life in Amsterdam between the two world wars. A narrator writes personal letters from her perspective to her brother, who has gone to the Dutch East Indies. The story is presented as read-aloud letters, and while this may not seem like an appealing modern filmmaking approach, the constant accompaniment of relevant historical archival footage is so captivating that the viewer's attention never wanes. It is fascinating to see old images of Amsterdam-some places I recognize, while others are gone forever. The result is a successful film that is also educationally powerful. It is personal, moving, and builds toward the tragic climax of the Holocaust-not in a sensational way, but as if it could happen to you. It is commendable and remarkable that this film was made in 2025, as I am shocked to find that knowledge about the Holocaust among young people is either absent or incorrect. This film proves that the core of the Holocaust is that completely ordinary people, with normal ambitions and personal traits, were innocently caught in the murderous machinery of the regime, regardless of who they were or what they thought, solely based on their heritage. It would be good to show this film to as many people as possible, especially young people, to improve knowledge about this important topic. I believe the film is engaging enough for non-Amsterdammers and non-Jews as well. There are no false sentiments; it all feels as if it could have happened as told and shown. The only downside to this film is the sound balance. The accompanying music, though beautiful, is so loud that the narrator's voice is sometimes not fully audible. Other than that, nothing but praise for this remarkable film.",False

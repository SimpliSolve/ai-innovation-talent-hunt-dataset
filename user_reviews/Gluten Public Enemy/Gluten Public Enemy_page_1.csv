1,10,"On point! Everyone, who doesn't know yet, can learn: corrupt politics and industries and their industrial food is the real enemy of our health!",mapika,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary about the wrong ""interpretation"" of gluten intolerance and many other deseases, the wrongdoings of our free market system, the politicians, the lobbyists and the big players of our world!Not the gluten of natural grown wheat and grain is responsible for our allergies and auto immune deceases. Glyphosate & other chemicals from Monsanto (Bayer) and the food industries are responsable for it.Most people in industrialised countries eat highly processed food with low nutritional value as good as every day. Sooner or later they get sick of it. And instead of solving the well known problem, the food industries create new ""promising"" markets with knew highly processed products, allegedly to help those who became sick of their former products. The real reason is obvious. It's a vicious circle.The only way out, for those who can afford it: start eating non processed, local and organic grown food; without pesticides, antibiotics and other poisoning chemicals. But those, who can't, have to go on living with this corrupt, irresponsalbe behaviour of those in charge for this mess.Everyone, who wants to get a good overview about our destructive free market system, the lobbyism of our food industries and the consequences for our environment, life and health, should watch this well made documentary!",False
2,10,This explains alot,mike_uk_1984,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a sufferer of an IBD with an intolerance to gluten, this documentary explains alot.Disgusted by some of these statements if they are factual. This world is governed by corporations earning trillions, regardless on the effect it has on the planet and its people.The documentary covers the history of gluten, questioning why something that has been a staple to our diet is now effecting us. Detailing the changes in the growth and maintenance of wheat highlight similarities to increased diagnosis of many different illnesses suffered by the worlds population.It does leave you wondering, for something that is so obviously poisoning us, why are our Governments allowing it? How factual are these findings? Why are powerful influencers and figures also not demanding changes?",False
3,10,An amazing and very informative documentary!,linkedinopd,n/a,16/08/2025,"The above documentary is one of those that should be watched by everyone who cares about their health and the health of their family and children.It shares very important information regarding the security of our food by addressing the root cause on why many people today is being sensitive or intolerant to gluten.Humanity has being eating wheat for millenniums and it has been one of the base crops for survival. Only a very rare number of people were back them, intolerant to gluten. The vast majority of us had no problem with it. But, in recent decades we are seeing an exponential increase on the number of people with auto-immune diseases and other kind of heath situations.At first, doctors thought it was caused by gluten intolerance. But, why cereals that have being consumed by millenniums are now becoming an issue for our heath? What if gluten had nothing to do with the wave of intolerance for which it is blamed?It is an amazing investigation work and it is very well filmed and explained, with interviews of some worldwide experts on the subject.",False
4,1,Serious Subject.....not good delivery,bellemara,n/a,16/08/2025,"Although gluten problems are a serious subject matter that needs to be exposed, I felt the narrator's voice was monotone and lacked authority to speak on the subject. Or maybe, it was the dialogue that was written for her.Other than my production critique, there is valuable information to be obtained from this documentary.",False

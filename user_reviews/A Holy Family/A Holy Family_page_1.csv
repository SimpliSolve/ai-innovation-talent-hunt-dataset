1,9,Real Documentary,military-00495,n/a,15/08/2025,"Shooting with the actual Taiwanese lifestyle is very close to the real, the plot is very simple but after watching the heart will be a little sour feeling. The pace of life in the countryside in Taiwan is slower, the farmers are watching the sky to eat, really hard. This drama presents the family's affection and care in a documentary way. Although it is not supported by big casts and big stars that we all know, it is valuable to be real, sometimes, family members don't need to speak too much, in the interactions and mutual care, they can feel the affectionate care. After watching the movie, I really think about it, and I really recommend you to watch it.",False

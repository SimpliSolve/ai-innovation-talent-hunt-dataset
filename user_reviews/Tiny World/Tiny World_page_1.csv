8,8,Wonderful comical and intriguing script that Paul Rudd narrates,rannynm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Have you ever wondered what if it would be like if you were tiny? Well, the documentary series, Tiny World, explores the world of tiny creatures, some of which live right beneath our feet.This series takes an unforeseen look into the world of minuscule animals and looks into the advantages and disadvantages of being such a small size in a massive world. Each episode follows the lives of multiple species in the same habitat and what they must do to survive and thrive.Writers Tom Hugh Jones and Pamela Ribon have created a perfectly comical and intriguing script that Paul Rudd (Ant Man, What If) so ironically narrates. The macro cinematography, shot at such a small scale with such detail, had my mouth down to the floor. All the intricate details are captivating with their up-close perspective along with the sounds of these miniscule critters. My favorite part about this show is when the audience gets a real glimpse of what it is like to be so small!The message of this show suggests that, while you may be small, what makes you unique makes you necessary in this big world. This series is educational and enlightening.I give Tiny World 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, as well as adults. It is streaming now on AppleTV+.

9,10,AMAZING,abdullafkh,n/a,15/08/2025,"You won't believe that it is true, you'll learn so many new things, you will see some animals that you don't know that they existed",False
10,10,Spectacular Cinematography,roshansalgadodarcy-24748,n/a,15/08/2025,A beautifully filmed series and a true masterpiece of visual story-telling.,False
11,10,Incredible!,Nathan4,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although there are multiple quality nature series out there, nothing came close to Planet Earth for me...until this. I'm absolutely blown away by the shots they got, and the storylines are excellent. Yes, I'm sure they edited the heck out of the footage to piece it together to make it look like there's a story there that wasn't really...but they all do it and it's what makes it so captivating. I don't understand the ones who complain that it's 'fake' because of that. Do you know how boring it would be if they just showed the footage unedited?!Fantastic. Love it.",False
12,6,Not deserve much ratings,hesoyamfsa,n/a,15/08/2025,This documentary is good. But not to deserve much ratings. Bbc and netflix had did this before and in more quality. But this series have scenes from six continents and thats anew thing. Some things are planned artificially to animals.,False
13,5,Not Authentic Whatsoever!!,jasonaldrich-87239,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not sure how people aren't seeing this or realizing this! Granted, they worked hard on getting all these shots, most are real, but they are doing 2 not real things...1- These action shots during an event, and sometimes even the ""event"" itself, is manufactured to look like something it's not. They film these animals doing stuff like running or eating or chasing another animal... but what they do is take shots of one animal running, then edit in shots of the other animal running to make it look like it's chasing the other one. When in fact, they got a few seconds of 2 animals fighting, but then add in footage to make it look like it was a chase scene so there's some kind of ""story"". It's theatrical, but not authentic whatsoever.2- They clearly CGI some of the footage!! Perfect example: S1 Ep1 they show a baby bird in some grass in a field, the mother has gone somewhere... then they show some kind of fox or something walking all creepy like it's stalking the baby bird. Then they show the ""mother bird"" alone squawking, and claim that it's protecting the baby from this animal. Then they show a different angle shot of a similar bird in grass with the fox behind, but the bird is CGI'd in, it's clearly fake as hell. But alas, the fox heard the mother bird and turns around... as if A- a fox is gonna turn away from food that's shown to be about 10 feet away because it HEARS a bird squawking, false. And B- a mother bird would've flown immediately to her baby's defense and pecked this animal until it ran away or she got ate too.Sorry to be a hater, I know these people worked hard to get some of these shots... but don't claim it's 100% real from 10 years of footage when it's clearly not and can't be. Watch for yourself and decide. But all I'll say is, if it was THAT good and THAT real, with all these amazing cameras and drones etc, it wouldn't be free on AppleTV. It'd be on a cable network, like Planet Earth. Just sayin!!",True
14,10,"Pure nature, without the politics!",honest_reviews17,n/a,15/08/2025,"Imagine, a nature documentary that shows animals without needing to preach to the viewer about how evil humans are; that tells animals' stories without even mentioning humans once, and that actually makes you feeling good from beginning to end...This is that documentary!Simple narration, a great soundtrack, and footage that will have you constantly asking yourself ""how in the world did they get that shot??"" is all that's needed to tell the compelling stories of these tiny creatures, with a fair amount of natural humor thrown in as well.This is the first AppleTV+ series I've felt strongly enough about to write a review on.Please, Apple, make more content like this. It is very much appreciated and needed in the world today!!",False
15,10,Amazing Tiny World,beccautu,n/a,15/08/2025,You must watch this show. I am in awe of the photography and the stories that go with. Must have taken years to accomplish each episode. Thank you for your dedication to this project . What a joy yo watch with my 3 year old granddaughter!,False
16,10,Amazing!,hdmhszb,n/a,15/08/2025,This is one of the best documentaries and even tv shows I have ever seen. It's beautiful storytelling combined with outstanding cinematography. I can't wait to see more of it.,False
17,10,Nothing comes close,sajaan,n/a,15/08/2025,Love it !!! The most spectacular thing you roll ever see!! Period ! Unbelievable . How do they even do this. Teaches us that Nature is the best movie . The most beautiful actors and the most compelling story is written everyday by nature .,False
18,10,Incredible cinematography!,sergiilitvinov,n/a,15/08/2025,A truly incredible cinematography! Something that I never seen before.,False
19,10,10/10,dino-imhof,n/a,15/08/2025,Probably the best nature documentary up to date...,False
20,10,Wonderful TV!,helenfrost38,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love nature documentaries- David Attenborough is my hero! But I honestly can't cope with the harrowing direction his shows have recently taken... and neither can my autistic daughter.
This is wonderful stuff indeed - unbelievable camera work with a more ""positive"" perspective. We were captivated from the start, and although there are poignant moments one doesn't come away feeling devastated, lol...
Educational, informative and enchanting: this is perfect lockdown viewing - and one of the best nature series I have ever seen.
Please, more like this Apple tv+",False
21,10,Mind-boggling!,henrycoles9,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dancing spiders, waterfall-climbing gobies, gliding squirrels. There's no end to the wonders of this world of puny animals and it's breathtaking how the makers got to film all that. How on earth did they get a shot inside an acorn that's been occupied by an acorn weevil larva? Or how did they get just in time the beetle plummeting down to the floor of the forest after a bitter fight with another beetle on a log, while a chipmunk hides inside? It's just dumbfounding!",False
22,1,Cruelty.,unfinishedfootsteps,n/a,15/08/2025,"Have all the negative reviews been removed?! I could not even make it past episode one. Purposely placing these creatures into dangerous situations for our ""entertainment"" is disgusting. Is this an American thing to add more drama?",False
23,10,Masterpiece!,Littleman95,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very interesting, funny and extremely pleasing for the eyes.
Also the way they decided to narrate everything is very enjoyable with no drama and I really appreciate it.Highly recommend to everyone who likes documentary, gets new intel about nature and for who like simple and funny things.Note: I really hope they will do a second season, maybe also in the underwater world.",False
24,10,Beautiful and incredible!! A MUST FOR FAMILIES,maryann4510,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yes ypu can watch a beautiful nature show wuthout the mass killing and sadness.
We love nature documentaries, but detest the constant graphic hunting and killing. Yes ,it is the ""circle of life"" as my angel dad said many many years before the Lion King
I cannot bear watching ...
This series does not show the killing of critters, lots of bugs bite it but ...
And Paul Rudd's narration is wonderful !! Thank you Paul for amazing narration and making the series even more enjoyable",False
25,10,Another reason to love Paul Rudd.,toddlloyd91,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a fan of Mr Attenborough. I went into this skeptical. Seeing that Paul Rudd was narrating this drew me in and wow, this programme and Mr Rudd could give David Attenborough and Planet Earth a run for its money. Beautiful cinematography. Definitely worth a watch.",False

1,9,Very good stuff!,gubnaitallup,n/a,15/08/2025,"Disregard anyone who criticizes the last 15 minutes or so! The movie introduces a political aspect that is impossible to ignore! Not appreciating it is hard to excuse because it's harder experiencing it! Open hearts and minds demands accepting this information as fact, not fiction!",False
2,8,on the road,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. When I was a kid, our family vacations consisted of loading up the car (with stuff and people) and hitting the road. Airline travel was not in the budget, and, at night, we typically piled everyone into one room at a low cost roadside motor inn (motel). We always had an ice chest, which allowed us to prepare most meals while on the trip ... eating in a restaurant or caf√© was a luxury that might happen once or twice on a trip. Why do I tell you this? Well because this is pretty much exactly how black people in this movie describe their long ago vacations. However, the few differences were substantial, to say the least. As a white family, we always had options for places to stop, while the black families were always concerned for their safety, and certainly never had the number of options we did. That anxiety and horror felt by blacks on the road in a racist society still exists today, and the history is expertly examined in this PBS documentary from author Gretchen Sorin and Ric Burns (brother of Ken).We are told that the phrase, ""Driving while black"" covers much more than the time behind the wheel. It's the constant concern for safety - while eating, sleeping, and living. The advent of affordable cars opened up the opportunity for blacks to answer the call of the road, and make memories with their families, but the constant fear never left. Mobility is emblematic of freedom, and the film goes back to the 'forced mobility' of slave ships and takes us through many progressions: slaves needing a note from their owner to cross the street, the Underground Railroad, the Fugitive Slave Act (the lit fuse to start the Civil War), the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation that freed blacks but left them nowhere to go, Reconstruction as a hopeful era, cotton and tobacco sharecropping, the rise of the KKK and the Jim Crow era, the booming Interstate Highway era - with the sacrifice of black neighborhoods, the Great Migration (north and west), how integration impacted Black culture, history, and heritage, and finally, how the cell phone age has opened many eyes.Since this is a detailed history lesson, Ms. Sorin and Mr. Burns include terrific interviews with historians, writers, and journalists. Some of the archival video and photographs are stunning, and the film includes pertinent quotes from such dignitaries as Thurgood Marshall, W.E.B. Dubois, Richard Writer, James Baldwin, and Frederick Douglass. The photographs of actual lynchings are tough to look at, and the statistics provided are soul-crushing. As we hear people recount history with actual stories, it becomes very personal, rather than just title chapters in a social studies textbook.Many ""Black travel guides"" existed, but it's (NYC postal worker) Victor Green's ""The Negro Motorist Green Book"" that is most well-known and the longest lasting. It contained ""safe places"" for blacks to stay, eat, and stop. The book could be found at many Esso stations, and we learn that it was published for more than 30 years. The fallout of integration meant that many black businesses failed as families moved to the suburbs ... leaving only a very small percentage of 'Green Book' businesses with open doors.An interesting segment on how the automobile industry, and Henry Ford in particular, led to the Great Migration of blacks from the south to the north (specifically Detroit). The promise of a job, decent pay, and independence were quite the draw. On the other hand, we see the many Chevrolet ads touting how the open road allows one to control their own destiny ... but the folks in those ads were always white. This is a remarkable history lesson, and it's very well documented. Today's readily available cell phone footage has opened the eyes of the rest of us, so that we can understand the meaning of 'Driving while black'.",False
3,8,Great doc!,BretMcg,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amazing work from PBS, all of the historians and speakers provide great context and personal stories. Really learned a lot about what Driving While Black means and how it pertains to our current society. Only critique is I wish the premise was comprised of shorter episodes similar to other documentary series and not a 2 hour movie. My recommendation watch it in two parts as the doc isn't a slog but is very rich. Left the doc with more knowledge and a question about my own entitlement.",False
4,10,Pleasantville revisited,doctorthornton,n/a,15/08/2025,"Excellent documentary! I don't know who rated this truthful and well-researched film a 6.2. Compared to many other documentaries, this film is at the top of the list. History revealed in ""living color"". I disagree with the other reviewer regarding the last 15 minutes of the film. Very powerful.",False
5,8,Important historical contribution,vampiri,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a white man who can't jump I want to say that this documentary is a important piece in the history of the brutality against people of color. Although I before hand knew bits and pieces mentioned in the documentary, i.e. The Montgomery boycott, Jim Crow, these bits and pieces were nicely put into a larger picture and thus became more coherent to me.Although I cannot be held responsible for these horrid actions against afro-americans I still feel some degree of awkwardness. But most of all I feel ashamed of being a part of mankind.Watch it and take a moment to contemplate what you just watched.",False
6,10,Very powerful,richard-1787,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this a very well-researched and well-constructed documentary. It lets the facts speak for themselves - and of course they have a devastating story to tell.Having seen the movie *Green Book*, I knew a little about the problems Blacks faced when they drove around the U. S. in the first decades after World War II. I had never thought about how the interstate highway system lessened some of those- Blacks didn't have to stop in small towns to get from one place to another. I knew that the construction of the interstate through cities often led to the destruction of Black neighborhoods. I saw that happen in Milwaukee in the 1960s. But it was not just Black neighborhoods. It was any neighborhood too poor to defend itself, too underrepresented in Congress and state legislatures.A previous reviewed found the last 15 minutes of this documentary less objective and more slanted. I disagree. It is the section that shows one example after the next of police stopping a car with a Black driver, and then either yanking him out and beating him or shooting him while he is still behind the wheel. That's not easy to watch. But even so, I wish they had provided information in each instance of where it took place and what happened to the driver.The scene where the Black father, perhaps in his 40s, asks whites to look him in the eye and imagine what it is like to think that such things might happen to their sons, as he fears it might happen to his, is devastating and hard to watch without crying. But I know that is what my Black friends who are parents worry about.I strongly recommend this documentary. I have lived through most of the era that it covered, yet I still learned a lot.",False
7,7,Very good until about the last 15 minutes or so,asc85,n/a,15/08/2025,"What I really liked about this documentary is that I learned a lot of things on this topic that I didn't know about. Yes, I knew this kind of stuff existed, but the level of detail they gave was extraordinary, and the context of the times, and the things that black families had to deal with to make things work was eye-opening for me. The detail given of Pre-Civil War, the Jim Crow Era, and even after the Civil Rights Bills were passed were all very insightful.However, my issue with this documentary was when it went into modern times (i.e., the last couple of years). Prior to modern times, I thought the documentary stayed very informational and objective. The modern times showed more of a political slant. Some people might have appreciated that, but I didn't.",False

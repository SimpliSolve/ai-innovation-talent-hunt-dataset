1,6,"A slice of life, but not the best one.",gingerrdriley,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is one which any self-respecting sumo fan will see at some point. It is a nice portrait of the wrestlers featured and has some nice coverage of training and competition.This film is also not a very compelling narrative, and frankly doesn't entice one to sit down with it again. Like many other attempts to document sumo, the information is incomplete and there are key moments which could not be captured because of the limited access and financial support for the director.If you're new to sumo, this is probably a good introduction. If you're a fan, then it's nice supplementary material, but not likely very informative overall. Certainly worth seeing at least once, and with company if you can help it. It's clearly a film which respects sumo and tries to show the aspects of it which truly captures the hearts of fans.",False

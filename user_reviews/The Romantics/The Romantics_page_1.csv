I am someone who doesn't like the Melodramatic bollywood, songs and dance movies but would definitely appreciate it's existence and important to the core of our Indian identity. This show has documented Mr. Yash Chopra's struggles and film making skills. There are interviews of his films actors and newer generation artists. And man!

Kudos to its makers and Netflix too.It's a fitting tribute to an all time great filmmaker, Yash Chopra. But my biggest take from it has to be the man, the myth, the legend, Aditya Chopra.

It reflects on its glory and the legacy it'll leave behind for generations to come.",False

6,8,A tribute to a legend of Hindi cinema,rehmankhilji,n/a,16/08/2025,"Movies, a dream of a maker, shown on a big screen to a wider audience, who tend to find themselves within it, building up their own dreams.This series is a tribute to one of the legends, whose name will remain, as long as there is Hindi Cinema. I would agree to his dislike to the term ""Bollywood"" as in India, now, at least the south is making way bigger movies, so bringing all the different cinema's under one umbrella is a little harsh.This tribute is beautifully told not only by the actors who under the direction of Yash Chopra became the legends, but also showing the love, the affection, his family has for him.Growing up in 90's, can depict the behind the scenes of making some of the all time best movies coming from this industry. It shows how it all started, the journey of many, the low's, the rising and how till date it continues.If you like Hindi movie cinema, do watch this 4 episode tribute, you will like to see the star's telling / sharing their stories.",False

8,7,A Fascinating Journey of YRF's Legacy.,SAMTHEBESTEST,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Romantics (2023) :
Series Review -The Romantics follows the journey of the two ""Big Chopras"" of B-Town, Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra, through a docuseries format. This new form of storytelling is the safest bet for filmmakers because it's a non-narrative process. You don't have to worry about the story because you don't have any. You just take multiple people and ask them to open up about their experiences without any script, and everything that comes out is highly organic. This Smrithi Mundhra's docuseries is blessed to have one of the finest contents to explore, and fortunately the data is unlimited. It feels like four episodes are not enough to explore the journey of YRF. They had to miss out on many movies and events due to the 4-hour runtime. Having a story on Yash Chopra and Aditya is no less than a big golden egg. All you have to do is lay it properly, and the baby is certain to have good health and shape.The Romantics has a peculiar structure from the writer's point of view because it has no head and no tail, like in mainstream format. The series is four episodes long and has only one aim: to explore the cultural impact and legacy of Chopras in Hindi cinema. While doing so, it doesn't shy away from accepting several heartbreaking facts and bad experiences, and it's a very good move. A docudrama should be as real as it can get, and Smithi knew it. She also knew that you cannot whitewash anybody when everything is available in the public domain, such as old clips, articles, write-ups, and recorded statements. Like every human being, Aditya and Yash Chopra both struggled with some things in their lives, and the series doesn't limit itself to glorifying them. Rather, it's a straight-forward take on their professional achievements, just like they always wanted.Whatever you see in The Romantics is nothing new, except for a few shocking facts. I mean, who would've thought that Aditya Chopra was a better dancer than Hrithik Roshan!!?? Karan Johar evidently reveals it. Who would've imagined that Aditya Chopra had to follow Shah Rukh Khan for months to do DDLJ, and SRK was barely interested in doing that film? Who knew that Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra had creative differences on Dilwale Dulhania Le Jaayenge's sets? After all this, the film turned out to be the biggest hit ever in YRF and Shah Rukh Khan's filmography. As they say, it was in their destinies. The Romantics will ride you through this nostalgic theme park.Smriti has worked on nuances, mainly historical events of the time. Yash Chopra's most popular films belong to the romance genre, but I am a huge admirer of his early works like ""Dhool Ka Phool"" (1958), ""Dharmaputra"" (1961), ""Waqt"" (1965), ""Ittefaq"" (1969), ""Daag"" (1973), and ""Deewar"" (1975). All these films were made before the Emergency, and after that, Hindi cinema also changed. Action films took over, and the top hits of the decades were mostly action films, except for Raj Kapoor's ""Sangam"" (1964) and ""Bobby"" (1974). The Romantics didn't mention this vital fact. In one of the segments, it openly blamed the action and masala flicks of the early 80s. How could anyone forget ""Kranti"" (1981) so easily, which was the biggest hit of the 1980s decade and perhaps the last of the true red multistarrer action entertainers in Bollywood? Yes, Chandni (1989) redefined romance-mostly for the urban section-but the craze and love ""Maine Pyar Kiya"" (1989) received were 10 times bigger. Yes, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is a trendsetter and the longest running film in the history of Indian cinema, but it could never match the collections and family values of ""Hum Apke Hai Kaun!"" (1994). YRF's recent string of unsuccessful films ended with Pathaan, and that's what the lengends do. They don't stop after one or two failures; they continue their passion and achieve success with their work. Missing out on these facts was a big mistake considerably. I would've loved to see the inclusion of Spy-Universe, Broadway, and other recent events in Indian cinema, such as how South and Hollywood films have overtaken our Hindi market. The Romantics were shot before, so naturally they missed it, but let's just accept that it would have been a big bonus.The Romantic is a nostalgic journey, but you have to be a Bollywood fan, a movie fan, or a fan of one of the superstars who is seen speaking in the series to understand it. Unfortunately, it's scattered because the linear equation isn't handled properly. That would have looked better because then you would have gotten to see their journey with a perfect line-up of events. The Romantics shuffles the events, and the editing skills are put on cold burner there. However, I liked the climax portion that features Yash Chopra's demise. As an audience of Hindi cinema, we have become habituated to watching emotional endings, and The Romantics follows the traditional pattern, despite knowing that it hurts the linear equation of the narrative. That's the masterstroke. Again, you have a burning quote coming from Adi Sir: ""What happens to YRF after me?"" That's a general question, but we never think about it. YRF stood strong after Yash Chopra's departure because Aditya Chopra was there, but who will be the next Aditya Chopra? ""I'll die my boots on,"" and ""This one will too."" These two quotes hit hard and right at the core of your heart. The emotions are there, just like in any film, or, should I say, slightly more.I am still confused why this docuseries has been named The Romantics? If it isn't just about romance, then why? Or did they use the other meaning of the word from mediaeval times? Smithi Mundra's case study is not concrete, but it isn't abstract either. I can only imagine the amount of pressure she felt before taking on this project. I mean, taking interviews of 35 people, bringing Aditya Chopra in front of the camera, telling the story that spans across 8 decades, carrying forward the iconic moments from classic movies, and giving a sneak peek into national events isn't an easy task. Smithi did that, so let's have a moment of applause for her. What's missed is missed; forget it and let's enjoy what she gathered. If this is how you make docuseries on filmmakers, then bring more stuff like this on bigger legends like V. Shantam, Mehboob Khan, Bimal Roy, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, Satyajit Ray, Raj Kapoor, Manoj Kumar, and many more. A major chunk of our audiences is not aware of all-time greats like DW Griffith, Fritz Lang, John Ford, Buster Kearton, Charlie Chaplin, Williams Wyler, Billy Wilder, Ingmar Bergman, and Jean Renoir, so better give them a case study of our legends. And you have so many of your favourite stars, their iconic moments, and memories to cherish in The Romantics. Turn binge mode on right this minute because The Romantics is just Fascinating!RATING - 7/10*",False
9,9,Paean of love,zahidjavali,n/a,16/08/2025,"YRF's tribute to the Father of Bollywood Romance is a breathtaking ode that captures the very essence of Yashji's cinematic legacy. Love was his mother tongue, and through it, he spoke to the world as a true friend of humanity. In today's repressive times, this poignant documentary stands as a vital testament to the enduring power of art and the boundless capacity of the human heart.And only YRF could pull off such a coup of sorts, getting A-list actors, directors, and filmmakers to talk about the man whose films were adored by India and the world. I think this documentary should be a precursor to many more on other legends of Bollywood, such as Manmohan Desai, Mehboob Khan, Subhash Ghai, and so on.",False
10,7,watch it for Adithya Chopra,saru2020,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was really good to see Aditya Chopra talking, the pioneer of Hindi cinema, and Indian cinema as well, who bought us DDLJ, Dhoom, all these time he has been at the forefront of the trajectory of the industry itself, and I think his contribution is huge as a creative producer of YRF than the director, IDK, if that's correct because DDLJ still running in theatres is not a small feat and this kinda feat is never achieved by any filmmaker at all, he's the only kind. The film running in north India is understandable but re-releases of it running in other non-Hindi speaking states is definitely an outlier and no other film even comes closer to this kinda achievement.On favouritism/nepotism: after seeing him talk for the first time, it feels like Aditya Chopra hasn't been part of that usual group of Bollywood folks that has triggered this whole nepotism thing. 2 parts of his talk: 1. Saying that he doesn't want to get into that group that make films just to get awards and competing for awards wasn't for him, making the best films was only his goals; 2. When he said that he introduced Ranveer Singh just because he did well in his first audition and how he always relates to the common audience as he himself is an avid film goer and does so every Friday which in itself shows his passion for cinema as a whole.Overall, it's a documentary where most Bollywood fraternities talk and it slightly gave a feeling that this documentary itself was made & released now to make people feel that there's no nepotism in Bollywood and how these people even hate saying Bollywood itself, a more like a brain-washer for the common audience but just with a little understanding of the current pathetic state of Hindi film industry, one could easily understand that this is again a gimmick by these people to instate the confidence in Bollywood but these pricks aren't still getting the point that nothing matters in the end except making good films and if they start doing it again, everything's gonna fall in place again, it's damn so simple but these people's brains are so fried out of popularity that they're not able to see/imagine this simple picture of their mind, god bless them.But, if you're still reading to see if you should watch this documentary or not, I'd say you must if you're following Indian Cinema since this is probably the first time the pioneer of Indian Cinema, Aditya Chopra has opened himself up and its really good to see him take us through his journey of film making and his passion for Cinema is just fascinating to see.",False
11,8,If you've loved Hindi Cinema so far you'll love this.,MandalBros-5,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Romantics is not only about the romantic films that YRF produced but all about The Great Yash Chopra & YRF. Also, it talks not only about the successful films but also about the films which failed. It also presented how Cinema has changed with its time and situation.I've never watched an Aditya Chopra interview and by watching the documentary I got to know that he never gave that. But, it's so good to hear him, first he's a movie lover and then a producer, writer & director. It features the making of some iconic films, it would've been good if they showed the same of Veer Zara too. Lastly, if you've loved Hindi Cinema so far you'll love this.Available on Netflix.Â© MandalBros.",False
12,6,Self Service Publicity piece disguised under Tribute,i_odin,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Romantics is a tribute to Yash Chopra's magical world of cinema but also an outright advertisement of the Yash Raj Films' slate of cinema. The later becomes pretty obvious during the second half of the show.It is an entertaining journey along memory lanes if you ignore the layer of self-promotion. There are some anecdotes which are very interesting specially the first couple of episodes when it talks primarily about Yash Chopra's magic and romanticism (justifying the title). Some sublime and emotional moments when actors share their experiences about working on a set with him. But as the show progresses and it dives into the more commercial side of the production house itself the show for me starts to get boring.After a while it becomes very hard to ignore the fact that this show is just bankrolled by this producer family to boast about their own successful films and how that makes them geniuses.For me the show would have worked better if it had sticked to Yash Chopra and his craft and magic or, as the name suggest, to his ""Romantic"" world.",False
13,4,Self glorification taken to nauseating levels,dev_alok,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have only seen 1 episode and was totally taken aback by this self promotion. Other thing that stuck me was to see the number of nepotism babies in this piece. I didn't know that yash raj himself was a nepo baby thanks to his much more talented brother b r Chopra. Yash Chopra just made these glamorous which were not very good. Towards the end, the movies became bad to worse. Now his nepo baby Aditya Chopra has taken over it is truly nauseating. They are setting up this spy verse which is kind of comical. I will probably watch other episodes just to if I can count people who are not nepotism babies.",False

This shows how the generations have shifted from father to son in emotional and talented way.I just loved it . It has its story starting from yashji's start of career as a director and how he made us fall in love with a studio. I am a huge srk fan but seeing this i really believe srk would not have that charisma that differs him from other big actors that he has now being the biggest film star in the world , it shows how srk owns yrf and how yrf could make the world fall in love through Shahrukh Khan.",False
15,10,The romantics(season 1):-a deep dive into the legacy of filmmaking family,puranjanbasak,n/a,16/08/2025,"The romantics is a documentary show directed by smriti mundhra.YRF has been the most influential production houses in this century, even in the last century as well, when it was growing up. This show captures it beautifully. This is for all the hindi cinema enthusiasts out there, who love the hindi film industry out and out. The concept of nepotism has been talked about as much as we get to see YRF's highs. Its not like that only the good is highlighted. And those who have a problem with a show centred around YRF, don't watch it, who compelled you to watch it! Aditya chopra's interview was a major highlight. He seems to be a sorted individual, believes the audience to be the supreme power. He knows what he wants to do and does that. Its evident in his filmography. This is a great documentary to watch which talks about the romance culture of the hindi film industry thoroughly. It talks about nepotism, changing vibes of cinema alongwith age. I loved it!!",False
16,8,A treat to Bollywood lovers,vjnambu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Episode 1 of the romantics is the biography of yash chopra where he started his career directing films under the banner of his brother B. R. chopra. After his marriage to pamela chopra, he decided to come out of his brother's shadow and direct films individually establishing yash raj films starting with daag which proved to be successful. Then he turned amitabh bachchan as the angry young man in deewar. In 80's, yash chopra was suffering a bad time as his good films like silsila and mashaal failed due to the emergence of action masala films with south indian flavor. Also the rise of vhs reduced the footfalls in theatres. Looking at the current trend, he made a multi-starrer action film vijay which its actors anil kapoor, rishi kapoor and anupam kher revealed that he was not happy during its making. And when the film failed, he decided to make a film which he believes in and that was chandni. Chandni was a do or die situation for yash chopra and its success gave him a huge comeback.The second episode is my favorite which focussed on aditya chopra, who hardly makes any public appearances and media shy. Adi used to watch all kinds of films in theatre and when asked he used to say, i want to learn what not to do as a filmmaker after watching every film. The most shocking fact came where karan johar revealed that in childhood there used to be a dance competition where adi comes always first and hrithik roshan second. Adi realized that he would not be a successful filmmaker in India without knowing the pulse of the Indian audience due to his western upbringing. So, one day he took all his western music CD's and dumped them and brought all kinds of hindi cds to learn indian culture. He started his career as an assistant director in chandni, then in lamhe in which he was creatively very much involved and darr, which marked Srk's first collaboration with yrf. While the making of darr, srk developed a good rapport with adi and planned to do an action movie with him. But adi wrote ddlj and shocked srk because this was not the film he intended to do. Srk, who is today known as the king of romance at that time didn't believe that he had the charm or looks to be a romantic hero and always wanted to be an action hero. But adi saw that soft side in him and was constantly behind srk because he didn't say either yes or no to do the film. Then in the sets of trimurti, he agreed to do the film after an 80 year old said to him that why you always die or kill people in films(referencing his back to back negative roles in baazigar, darr and anjaam at that time), to which adi explained to him that you can be an indian superstar unless you are a son to every mother, a brother to every girl or a friend to every man. Then we see the making of ddlj for which adi brought karan johar and uday chopra as his assistants, how he and yash chopra had creative differences while it's making where yash wanted chiffon sari on the other hand adi opted for silk sari. Srk also shared that the climax fight was added on his request to which yash chopra agreed because he loved him very much. The main reason for its historic success was due to its respect given to parents as our hero won't elope but would seek the consent of the father. Another interesting fact was where sooraj barjatya revealed that when the initial screening of hum aapke hain kaun received a negative response, adi suggested him to remove two and a half songs which he did.Third episode begins with a prologue where all nepo actors speak about their family background(nepotism) to which adi counters the topic citing the example of uday chopra where despite their efforts they couldn't make him a successful actor. In 2000's adi decided to expand yrf by producing films of multiple genre starting with mujhse dosti karoge in which he didn't believe it to do well but agreed just because his parents loved its script. And when the film failed, adi decided to back those films only in which he believed irrespective of its success. In 2004, yrf had three successes with urban romcom hum tum, action thriller dhoom which broke the yrf stereotype of yrf being only romance and classic epic love story veer zaara. In 2005, they made bunty aur babli which started the trend of small town films in Bollywood. In 2010, they launched a newcomer named ranveer singh without any film background(though now its revealed he is not an outsider fully).In the fourth episode, when several Hollywood studios were tying up with Bollywood producers, adi was absolutely against it. In 2005, yash chopra opened yrf studios. Adi revealed that from 2007, yrf were facing many unsuccessful films which led him to direct rab ne bana de jodi and also he took a bold decision(which worked) to not shift its release date which was two weeks after 26/11. He was disappointed with the failure of befikre citing that audience were not ready to accept such kind lf film from him. He started to handover the production responsibilities with other capable starting with maneesh sharma turning yrf's producer for dum laga ke haisha. This episode also reveals the last moments of yash chopra who passed away one month before the release of his directorial venture where adi and uday said that he wanted to die always with his boots on. The episode concludes where adi reveals his future plans for yrf in which he wants to collaborate with various international companies, bring Broadway to India and start a theme park.Only drawbacks i found was uday chopra's accent and lily singh who was just talking like some fangirl.On the whole, its a perfect tribute to yash chopra and his legacy. Its great that despite various highs and lows yrf is still standing strong.",False
17,9,The Romantics: A Celebration of a Legendary Legacy,piyushpadwale,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary series depicting the entire legacy of possibly one of the biggest production banners in the Hindi film industry - none other than the legendary YRF (Yash Raj Films).It takes you on a journey through generations, celebrating all the ups and downs faced by this illustrious production house, giving you a glimpse into real-life experiences and the creative processes behind several Yash Raj projects - shared by people who have observed this massive industry from a much closer lens. It also delves into the more personal, real side of individuals who are, in every sense, masters of Indian filmmaking.Although my only letdown would be the fact that they didn't delve into one of their biggest films and my personal favourite YRF-SRK movie - Veer Zaara.Would've truly loved to see them explore more about this masterpiece, especially since it portrays romance like never before - in a way that only the late and great Mr. Yash Chopra could.Walking into the show, Yash Chopra and Aditya Chopra were just great filmmakers to me - whose films I've always loved watching. But by the end of it, they've become much more than that.Every episode, at multiple points, made me feel the kind of true love and passion that moved me in ways I can't put into words - so much so that I had legit goosebumps and tears throughout the experience.They've now turned into huge inspirational forces who've given a deeper meaning to the passion I carry for the thing I love the most.It leaves you with this beautiful realisation - that if you stay true to your vision and instincts, carry immense passion, grieve your failures but come back stronger, and don't succumb to the norm - then eventually, everything will fall into place. You don't always have to seek validation. What you rightfully deserve will find its way to you, and no one can take that away.In the end, I have nothing but immense respect and gratitude.There was a phase in life when I used to shy away from typical romantic films - calling them cheesy, unrealistic, and pure fantasy. But honestly, this documentary reinstated the romantic and emotional feelings we all carry as people.And there's no harm in unashamedly shouting it to the world and admitting -
""Yes, I was, I am, and shall always remain a hopeless romantic.""You can watch this series on Netflix.",False
18,6,Good business mind,sriramthestranger,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a series of interviews with people sharing their experience with YRF and the family. The interesting thing is the business mind of Aditya Chopra even from a young age. No wonder the studio is a legacy for 50+ years.The choices made are based on the Indian economic environment, people's lifestyle, mutual connections and trusted ppl rather than a story / screenplay. And, the man agrees and had lead to some bad films and some very great films.Yash Chopra is polar opposite to Aditya Chopra but he is the rare kid to successfully exceed and excel better than his father. And you should watch the interview part of Aditya Chopra!",False
19,10,Great show. Not very well marketed.,vasanisalim,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed the documentary. The interviews felt very genuine. The best part of course is Aditya Chopra. I had never seen him before this show. Had no idea how he looked. For a person that is regarded as shy and introvert, he actually is very well spoken and expressed his ideas clearly. He should do more interviews. The series is laced with great scenes from some of the most iconic Hindi movies. There are also several behind the scenes footage I had not seen before. The series renewed my interest in some of the classic movies and I am going to watch some of the older Yash Chopra movies that I haven't seen before. There are also several pictures of young Abhishek Bacchan, Hrithik Roshan, Uday Chopra and others. They all look very cute. I also feel bad for Uday Chopra. He is a very sweet guy. I actually like him as an actor and thought he did well in the few movies he starred in. It's sad we did not get to see more from him. This is also evidence for all the nepotism complainers that if nepotism alone ran Bollywood, then Uday Chopra should have been a top actor. I personally do not see any wrong in kids wanting to do what their parents did and parents wanting to give their kids the opportunity. It happens in all businesses; why treat the film Industry differently? There are many good actors who have made it in the Industry that were outsiders. The biggest example of course being Shahrukh Khan. I would also be very happy to see Aryan Khan in movies. Let the audience decide if a movie or an actor is good. We Indians love cinema. Let's keep politics aside and just welcome good movies and actors wherever they come from.",False

She needed to see this, she would feel indescribably more than what I did.Yash Raj movies are an emotion that you carry with you where ever you go. The music of these movies fills every part of your being, the cinematography of the early YR films transports you to a world of its own.Glad I got to experience the 80s & 90s magic of Yash Chopra and Yash Raj films.Ok bye, I'm about to watch Darr.",False
22,1,Very poorly scripted,gautamsinghchauhan-47723,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is an attempt to save the doobta Bollywood.Starts off well with the story of Adi Chopra, his fascination about films, how he kept track of the box office in his early age, but losses track by just bragging about DDLJ and other stuffs. Should have been more informative about film making and Indian cinema. Indian cinema is way broader than just romance which was shown by Yash Chopra. Yash Chopra ji is undoubtedly the best at romance everybody knows that. We don't need netflix to tell us about that, there are many other better interviews of Yashi ji on the same topics that have been covered here. Why would someone pay Netflix to see this? The only selling point I could find is Netflix Interviewing Adi Chopra for such a long time.But this series is totally unnecessary and unwanted.",False
23,9,Treat! Delicious! Impeccable!,viratjain25,n/a,16/08/2025,"How else do you celebrate indian cinema if not for the romantics. Its one of the most soul touching and heart felt documentaries which have come out in recent times. It celebrates cinema and gives us a peek into the men behind the camera and the great maestro duo of Adi-Yash chopra's. Starting from his early days to the peak of stardom and following into his life not only as a director, but as a father and a legend, the romantics does true justice to Yash ji's legacy. Time and again it brings back all the sweet memories we have shared growing up with his films. Not to be missed, will make you feel proud to be a bollywood fan and an indian. Hats off Netflix!",False
24,9,A Heartfelt Tribute to a Cinematic Legend,izhar_hussain,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Romantics is a beautifully crafted documentary series that pays tribute to the iconic filmmaker Yash Chopra and the legacy of Yash Raj Films. Even for someone like me, who doesn't typically enjoy the melodramatic, song-and-dance world of Bollywood, this series was an eye-opener. It makes you appreciate not just the films, but the cultural and emotional core they carry within Indian cinema.What makes this four-part docuseries stand out is its deep emotional authenticity. It documents Yash Chopra's personal and professional journey with care, his early struggles, groundbreaking romances, and his bold creative choices. The show doesn't shy away from showing the failures or internal conflicts, making the tribute feel honest rather than glorified.The biggest surprise, and perhaps the highlight, is Aditya Chopra's rare on-camera interview. Known for his extreme privacy, seeing him speak candidly about his father, their filmmaking philosophy, and the industry was a revelation. His heartfelt tribute feels like his final bow to his father's legacy.The documentary also features intimate interviews with the biggest names in the industry, from Shah Rukh Khan to Rani Mukerji to Ranveer Singh, offering personal anecdotes and behind-the-scenes stories that elevate the viewing experience.While the editing jumps around at times and some YRF films get more attention than others, The Romantics still manages to hit all the right emotional notes. It doesn't just chronicle a studio; it captures the evolution of Hindi cinema itself.Whether you're a die-hard Bollywood lover, an SRK fan, or someone who appreciates cinema's power to move hearts, The Romantics is a must-watch. And yes, by the end, you might just find yourself becoming a hopeless romantic too.",False
25,1,Pathetic attempt to cover up NEPOTISM by Yash Raj Studio!,gouri-patil,n/a,16/08/2025,"Justifying their nepotism tactics and trying to recover from their negative sentiments triggered by SSR'death.. Aditya Chopra gave his first interview for this, shows how powerful SSR aura was and will always be! He has brought all these nepots to their knees.Shows how shaken these folks are by SSR's popularity and genuine love, respect by the whole country! You cannot win over SSR with all your explanations - we will continue to hate your films and not watch it. What his simplicity, intelligence and sincerity managed to evoke will stay FOREVER.Pathetic attempt..everyone featured is the son or daughter or a servile to these nepots sitting high! This does not work anymore, pls wake up.",False

1,7,Most Objective By Far,LeoDeLeo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary made beyond the dictatorial control of Jaime Spears' grimy paws.It is fundamentally not a documentary about Britney, but about the issues that led up to the conservatorship and behind the scene manoeuvrings and her failed attempts to free herself.Understandably we do not hear from any of her family members nor anyone from the conservators camp except for snippets from old edits. Who we hear from in direct interviews are mainly the pro-Britney side, and a few non-commital individuals linked to her situation. While this is understandable, it also renders the documentary partial and not a proper tell-all.Substantial portions of court related documents are also shown or read out verbatim which is revealing, incredulous and lends credibility.I'm no particular fan of Britney nor her music, but what obviously comes across is a troubled woman both strong and also vulnerable, desperate and trapped yet untiring in her attempts and resourcefulness to gain herself a meaningful life.It does give me new respect for Britney. Go girl!",False
2,7,"The Legal system is Broken, sometimes even for Rich People.",midnitepantera,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nobody listens or cares when these type of vampire conservatorships swallow an unknown person, an elderly person, a child alive. But hopefully this will open peoples eyes, and maybe it having happened to someone famous and rich will make them want to see change in this type of legal process.I can understand in the beginning, when she went off her rocker years ago that her family did this, but maybe for 1 or 2 years. Not indefinitely, her Dad is a Greedy con-man and so are all the other people he involved in this Scam against his daughter.You know what, If she wants to blow all her money out her A**, then let her, SHE EARNED EVERY PENNY OF IT!! At most they should have maybe secured 10% of her earnings if she proved to be mentally unstable, to ensure her children would be financially cared for in the future, but the rest of the money, belongs to HER!!I wouldn't trade lives with her, that's for sure. :O.",False
3,7,Much-needed documentary for #FreeBritney,witra_as,n/a,16/08/2025,"Much-needed documentary which gave us insights about Britney's problematic conservatorship. Though quite messy at times with too much informations from several perspectives, Erin Lee Carr made strong closure by Britney's wholehearted speech for freedom.",False
4,6,Hearing Britney's Voice,3xHCCH,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis new documentary ""Britney vs. Spears"" focused more about Britney's tight legal trap of a conservatorship. It was basically a conversation between the director Erin Lee Carr and Rolling Stones journalist Jenny Eliscu as they looked through and commented on various documents that came out about the case. It featured interviews with Spears' rumored ex-boyfriends paparazzi Adnan Ghalid and former manager Sam Lutfi, as well as her former personal assistant Felicia Culotta (who was very clear who she did not want to talk about).""Britney vs. Spears"" is a considerably more sober affair than the more colorful ""Framing"". Aside from the ""toxic"" Jamie Spears, shade was cast against former manager Larry Rudolf, her business manager Louise Taylor and another ex-boyfriend Jason Trawick. Meanwhile, the controversial role of Lutfi was essentially diminished. Carr saved the best for last, as we hear Britney's own impassioned speech appealing for her freedom in court last June 2021. The final cards update the progress of the case up to September 7, 2021.",True
5,7,Extreme Manipulative Measures With An Abusive Use Of The Court System,AudioFileZ,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary Britney vs. Spears is definitely in Britney's defense thus, perhaps, not equally objective. The viewer isn't at all sure what actual events may have led to such an extreme decade and a half conservatorship of Britney Spears. It is vaguely implied she was not competent mentally...though what exactly was the diagnosis and/or reasons for her situation?What seems at root is her father was very worried about financial things over a caring and healthy relationship with his daughter. He basically made her his livlihood by indenturing her. When you can work your rear-end off in a very demanding job but you have to receive permission to go out for a hamburger I'd say it obvious something very insidiously wrong is going on here.If I had to guess if she is released from her conservatorship she will thrive. It's questionable if she will ever have any further relationship with her father after hearing her tell a judge he should be jailed. So this is a sad story, yet it has the feel of a survivor's tale that may still be uplifting. For Britany to go through so much she seems much sturdier than the press has painted her. This is quite the interesting story which often stretches one's belief it has taken so long to potentially right.",False
6,n/a,disappointing,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"No real updated facts relating to her conservatorship until the ending. I question whether or not her dad had her best interests at heart. Her family and Kevin Federline lived pretty well off the money she made. If she can prove that she is mentally capable of handling her own affairs, then the conservatorship should end once and for all. Nobody should have to live like she did.",False
7,6,"It'll all sound ""whoa!"" to you if you've been living under a rock. [+55%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the content in the documentary is neatly compiled and put together, there's very little stuff in it that's ground-breaking. This is Netflix's ready-to-consume version of the New York Times documentaries on Britney's paparazzi-filled life. The first 20 minutes or so, including an interview with K-Fed's lawyer, doesn't excite all that much. The documentary rushes into high gear once the conservatorship aspect is brought up, and from there on, it's quite engaging. Most of the interviews featured in the documentary are in favor of Britney as a person - so, it wouldn't make sense to call it objective. Heck, it's almost a fan perspective, reinstating what the media and the public already know about Britney simply wanting to live life her way. Since the hearing that decides whether or not to conclude the conservatorship is due shortly, this honestly feels like Netflix trying to milk whatever they can from the situation. That's not a complaint, however. But let's #FreeBritney and hear what she has to say before it's too late!",False
8,6,Enlightening but biased,beatrizstaboada,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was quite enlightening for people who, like me, didn't know anything that was going on with Britney's conservatorship.As for the documentary itself, I believe it was quite biased, and by this I am not, in any way, justifying the existence of the conservatorship. But it does feel that the filmmakers only cared about showing the part of Britney's life that would get viewers to sympathize with her. The 2007 Britney lifestyle was never really explored and the reason for the start of the whole situation seemed very rushed.Furthermore, the ""coffee type"" conversation while reading the documents felt quite out of place for a documentary, specially because there was a clear tendancy.With that being said, the highlight for me was Britney speech at court. What a moment.",False
9,8,Freedom is Priceless,wiseman513,n/a,16/08/2025,"1. Not a flawless documentary, but one that is made with passion.2. There's something terribly wrong with the courts in USA. I'm glad such laws don't exist in my country.3. Britney shouldn't just be freed. Her dad and his accomplices ought to pay for enslaving her all these years. Freedom is priceless!",False
10,7,Good for when you haven't followed,yaraclement,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a good docu, but only if you haven't followed the whole story step by step.For me, there was a lot I didn't know, which made it very interesting, heartbreaking, also easy to watch.",False
11,4,Save yourself some time and just watch the NYT documentaries,dwl23,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was a huge disappointment after the excellence of the New York Times docs Framing Britney Spears & Controlling Britney Spears. It gives a lot of solid info for those new to the conservatorship case, but where it epically fails is its portrayal of her former manager Sam Lufti. The filmmaker's bias is apparent in how they brush over a lot of the details of the guy in an attempt to make him seem misunderstood. He is a known abuser who has had a handful of restraining orders against him from other women he attempted to control and financially swindle. This documentary gives Lufti way too much credit and attempts to make him look like a ""good guy.""Just because Jamie Spears is a monster doesn't mean Lufti can't also be a monster. To imply everything Britney's parents said about him is a lie is to also discredit the other women who filed restraining orders against him. I wish Netflix hadn't stooped so low as to involve this piece of trash.",False
12,9,Courts are brokem,ghatbkk,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is an indictment of the US Court system and many people deserve to be jailed in regards to the information shown here, including Judges.",False
13,7,Interesting!,davegir-45616,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this documentary, it had a lot of information about Britney Spears, which is obviously what the documentary film is about, but i wish the documentary was made to be a little bit more exiting and maybe edited and shown in different ways other than just interviews!",False
14,5,Disappointing documentary,eduardomendesribas,n/a,16/08/2025,I gave it a 5 due to my sympathy to Britney's situation but this documentary was so disappointing as it pales in comparison to the NYT documentaries. It brought nothing new and it was not presented or produced in an engaging manner. The two journalists who worked on it seemed to have not put a lot of effort to it and interview Sam Lufti was really a low point and a shameful and inexcusable decision.,False
15,6,What about the medical reports though?!,MyMovieTVRomance,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary presents actual documents from medical personnel who say that Britney has dementia-related health conditions that do affect her mental/emotional well-being. Are we supposed to believe those professionals were just paid-off by the Spears family to say all that? Weird how no-one seems to take that seriously, but are so ready to damn the family. Makes one wonder...",False
16,6,Decent but doesn't add many new bits,bluesparkles-59317,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a decent effort, however apart from some of the interviews (Adnan Ghalib especially) this didn't really add anything new; most of the info in this documentary was already revealed IN Framing Britney Spears.I guess it's a decent watch to round out what you already know, but nothing groundbreaking.",False
17,7,Getting the Deep Dive on the Free Britney Movement,iquine,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was dying to learn more about the Free Britney movement....joke....was just curious enough to have it on while multi-tasking. This documentary dramatically reveals the back story, why the conservatorship was established, the trauma it was for Britney and how she was able to free herself. Hope that wasn't a spoiler. LOL. This doc was nicely done with decent creative effort. It has light visual interest for the personal interviews, mixed in some visual graphics to accentuate points along with live footage with or without voiceovers from the interviewees. It obviously took Britney's side but did a good job of humanizing a huge pop star, showing her flaws and her life obstacles. And now I hear she just inked a multi-million dollar book deal. Someone else will have to see how much deeper she gets in the book than this film.",False
18,6,Good template for future messy Hollywood docufilms,Mike_Devine,n/a,16/08/2025,"In some ways, the fascination with Britney Spears of late has felt like a time hop back 20 years. In the Netflix documentary 'Britney vs. Spears,' we travel down a rabbit hole of lies, deception and drama - all the while getting a crash course in the complex concept of conservatorship.Erin Lee Carr and Jenny Eliscu certainly made waves when this expose premiered, as it was timed to Jamie Spears' white flag in giving up on the years-long battle to control his uber-famous popstar daughter. There's no denying it is well crafted, with numerous exclusive interviews and points of view that provide a pretty damning argument against Britney's conservatorship. Still, it's not a perfect documentary. The chief reason is that there were not enough alternative perspectives included here, with the whole thing seeming very one-sided. Even if public sentiment was and is very much against Mr. Spears, the duo behind this film should have made a better effort to represent the ""other"" side to let the audience make up their own minds (which almost undoubtedly would have come to the same conclusion).It may not win any awards, but 'Britney vs. Spears' is a good template for other filmmakers to use for many other messy legal battles from Hollywood's history.",False
19,8,#arrestjamiemovement,ana-44521,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thanks Netflix! I hope with this, more ppl can see a bit of what happened and stand up to end this injustice. This is immoral to treat someone like this. #arrestjamiemovement ! Arrest that mo'""$#/ FKR. Enough is enough.",False
20,6,"Oops, They Documented Again",natmavila,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Britney vs Spears"" is an interesting dive into the legal battle that defined a pop icon's life, but let's be honest, it's the cinematic equivalent of eating plain oatmeal - it's ok, but where's the flavor? The documentary manages to present the facts in a linear, digestible manner, which is commendable given the complexity of Britney Spears' conservatorship saga. It's like being given a map in a maze, but the map is in black and white, and you're pretty sure it's missing a few secret passageways. The filmmakers deserve a pat on the back for not getting lost themselves.However, the docu feels like it's playing safe, hovering in the shallow end rather than diving deep into the murky waters of the conservatorship issue. It's as if they're trying to bake a cake but forgot to add sugar. Yes, the structure is there, and yes, it's technically cake, but it's not going to satisfy your sweet tooth. The documentary does an ok job of laying out the timeline, but the emotional impact feels a bit like a firecracker that fizzles out - you're left waiting for the big bang that never comes.In conclusion, ""Britney vs Spears"" sits comfortably in the middle of the road, not daring enough to venture into uncharted territory, but not boring enough to make you switch off. It's the documentary equivalent of a lukewarm cup of tea; it's ok, but it won't be the most memorable cup you've ever had. Three stars because, like Britney herself, it's impossible not to root for it, even if it doesn't hit all the high notes. Plus, let's face it, any exploration of Britney's battle is bound to be at least somewhat intriguing, simply because it's Britney, b*tch.",False
21,1,Not worth anyones time,gkwkrzsf,n/a,16/08/2025,Just bad. No real look at both sides and a very cringey watch with the uneducated fan girl filmmakers making it more about themselves. Skip this one altogether can't believe they got Netflix to pick this up.,False
22,8,Iluminating,isaacochoterena,n/a,16/08/2025,"In this documentary, despite the fact that there are no testimonies of who is being talked about, it manages to delve into how it happened.It gives details that I did not know and had no idea, it informs us about the latest updates of the case and makes you want to follow the whole thing closely, and it does not do it as if it were gossip, it does so that people know certain points of reality that we can get to know. I feel that some testimonies are needed but because of the delicacy and because the case is very recent, it is understood.Some explanations of several years are missing where there is no information, but it correctly exposes the whole case.",False
23,5,Some interesting revelations,jlroodt,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is gripping throughout, and reveals some new previously unknown facts about the whole saga.Unfortunately the motive of the filmmakers are questionable, especially as at some point the blame the so-called patriarchy for Britney's woes. At that point one realises that their worldview is questionable and it creates a suspicion about what they might not have added to the movie in order to portray the narrative they want.",False
24,9,#freebritney,j0hn22,n/a,16/08/2025,"That documentary was amazing! It revealed so many things about her life, that we didn't know. Gladly, she is free now. The ending scene was hair-raising. I don't have many things to say, because it's a documentary not a movie. By the way, f**k patriarchy and her father too.",False
25,1,Britney Deserves Better,MotormouthOnLegz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Britney Spears finally spoke in open court this year after a disgustingly long period of media intrusion, speculation and dirty tricks campaigns by those who seek to keep her under the thumb to continue lining their own pockets.I think we all agree that the treatment of Britney has been disgusting. Her own words only give us a small glimpse of some of the horrors she has faced at the hands of those supposedly looking after her best interests.The mantra from her conservators that she has ""addiction and mental health issues"" that are too horrific to share with the world are laughable when you look at how many world tours, Vegas gigs, singles, albums, perfume promotions and on and on she has done under the conservatorship. If she is *that* ill then making her do all that work highlights just how corrupt and manipulative her conservatorship -and those who control it - really is.Britney is sick of being used yet people reveal her private texts for cheap thrills under the guise of caring for her and being horrified by her current situation. If you really cared, private messages would stay just that - private, regardless of your intentions.Some people worked for over 10 years with Britney and claim to have witnessed horrific things pretty early on - yet chose to stay for years even when they had hard evidence of wrongdoing. No doubt their fees for being on everything Britney Spears related this year will be going towards mental health charities. Seeing as they are such caring, compassionate souls and not attention seekers pouring more stress onto someone who already told a court they cry every single day as it is!By making endless shows like this, the makers are doing what Britney is partly fighting against - invading her privacy. Is this the new thing? A new ""shocking documentary"" every few months with the same people adding more and more bits onto their story with every new documentary they appear on? It already feels intrusive and cashing in on someone who needs help, not former friends or colleagues who share private things about Britney but are obviously terrified and still under NDAs when it comes to certain people involved with the Spears clan.Miss Spears has already called out some of these documentaries for peddling yet more lies. She was right in court - nobody listens to her.Britney deserves a private life with who she chooses to be with. Her real friends and whoever she chooses to be her family. She deserves to be allowed to make her own choices. If she chooses to stay in the entertainment industry, let HER choose what things she wants to do. Sing. Dance. Act. She might want to release a ""Gurmukhi mantras and English songs from the Kundalini Yoga tradition"" album like Belinda Carlisle!. She should be able to do that and do whatever the heck else she wants!Britney Spears deserves all the love in the world. Most people would break beyond repair after the last few years but she keeps going and towering above it all.Mental health problems? Be warned: Britney's situation could happen to any one of us.Last but not least: Britney Spears deserves her FREEDOM.",False

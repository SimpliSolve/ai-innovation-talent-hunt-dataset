1,5,Too long,andreshuerfanoh,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great real crime story that could be told in 45 minutes takes 3 episodes of redundancy, is an ego trip for cops and thieves and withbtge excuse of being a documentary left the viewer with no other option to sit through unending monologues. There is no assesment on the script. Both cops and robbers just let their imagination go nuts and said whatever they suppose they have to say.The viewer is left alone with an ocean of info and no critical view of the facts, the characters or the force of order.There is also a total lack of context. It seems that they are actually afraid to deliver a comprehensive picture of the facts.",False
2,8,Great!,Henriqqke,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another great Brazilian true crime docuseries. Edsm100 why do you want a cast for a docuseries? It seens you don't know much about quality neither. Brazilian productions such as Good Morning Veronica, Invisible City and Brotherhood are way better than spanish-language crap such as Elite and Rebelde.",False
3,4,The most boring bank heist in history,pascual-953-520640,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first 20 minutes of the first episode is basically a police officer explaining that a tunnel starts with a hole and when you get to the other end and there is no more tunnel one can assume that it stops there.Next 20 minutes is flashbacks where journalists recalls answering their mobile phone the morning the robbery was discovered.This is just a filmed podcast where everything is dragged out to infinity to fill the episodes. Boring interviews: 90 %
The same still photos taken at the crime scene: 10 %.",False
4,n/a,The great bore of a retelling of the great robbery of Brazil's Central Bank,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kudos to the makers of the documentary for turning such an ingenious heist story in the most boring retelling ever. I agree with the other reviewers, the decision to have the English translation layered over the original Brazilian Portuguese is truly baffling, requires extra effort to pay attention to what they are saying.The documentary content itself isn't much interesting, either. Bunch of police officers introduced with the cringest possible way as these geniuses for solving the case, when 90% of what the documentary details as their method is they just blanket tap everyone's phone even remotely connected to a suspect, and ultimately they are lead to the criminal. Groundbreaking.gifAnother small gripe, one thing i found really funny was how the documentary would dramatise the capture of a suspect, and the actor paid to portray would have a head full of thick hair, and right after they would show footage from actual capture, and the real criminal had barely any hair on their head. Lmao.",False
5,1,Unwatchable,kenbo-87360,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is the kind of programme I'd choose to watch. Unfortunately after five minutes I had to give up because of the awful dubbing/voiceover.Instead of muting the original narration, Netflix have just added an English speaking voiceover to play over the top of the original. Hence the echoey, annoying noise that you hear play out.It may be a good show, but it's unwatchable for me as it is.",False
6,1,Couldn't watch it because of the poor English translation,martoka_z,n/a,16/08/2025,I can't believe that Netflix couldn't invest into a better English translation. Why would you layer English translation over the original Brazilian Portuguese??? Stopped watching it after few minutes cause It was really hard to focus on English then there's a simultaneous background voice going on!,False
7,1,A Poorly Made Documentary That Was Just So Dull And Boring To View!,silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"If all Brazilian TV documentary's are made like this one has been, I will never watch another one from that country!It was dull as dishwater in the way it was told and presented and, was made worse by a competing double soundtrack of both Brazilian and English languages. Why didn't Netflix turn the original Brazilian audio levels down, 50% at least, so that the English dubbing audio could be heard clearly; also there was continuous incidental background music that was so loud it made the audio clarity even worse.The only undeniably clear truth anyone will get from this is how evil and corrupt many Brazilian police are (I have known this for years as I have watched a great deal of documentary films about their corruption, killings of people etc. Etc)The story is told in an awful fashion that makes you bored with it after about 10-15 minutes so, you are dreading possibly watching parts 2 & 3. It could have done with being cut to a 1hr:30mins film as it felt way too long and everything dragged out and repeated.",False

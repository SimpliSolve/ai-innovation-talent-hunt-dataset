1,5,Ya I'm just gonna say this straight out,orcinussr,n/a,16/08/2025,"EFF this dude in the B- I can't anymore with this and I believe, neither should society - first I want to make it understood that this is NOT a fair review of the documentary, in terms of technical elements and production, but rather about the subject of the documentary - personally I'm disgusted that we, as a society, are so lascivious for true crime and 'entertaining' documentaries now, that we will (essentially) REWARD anyone by compensating them for appearing in and recounting thier life's story - but this is a bridge too far! This man (if u can call him that) is a 19x murderer - let me reiterate thisNINETEEN TIMES HE'S MURDEREDadmittedly so, and his degenerate criminal family are ADMITTEDLY drug dealing thugs - WHY ARE WE GIVING THEM AIR TIME - sure I get it, the story is worthy of telling but let's do this IN EXCLUSION of allowing these people to relive and revel in thier misdeeds, their crimes THEIR ATROCITIESwe have to do better guys WE MUSTand if you think I'm overreacting, just pay attention to the lifestyle they've afforded themselves off of the 'buried 3 million' ill gotten gains and the entitlement the children have about getting their ""bottle popping VIP"" lifestyle that 'was ripped away from us' backThis is everything that's wrong with the world in one documentary.(ultimately I've given it a midlane 5 cause I don't think it's fair I penalize or reward when I feel this way)",False
2,4,Pseudo Rough Guys on Bragging Parade,larryschneider-80967,n/a,16/08/2025,"It gets to be hysterical how these would-be tough guys act tough about selling drugs to kids. Yeah, they made money but were the furthest thing from mobsters. The Gravano adult-child kept saying ""back in New York,"" which seemed to me as a way to remind himself that what he was doing in Phoenix wasn't like being a mobster in NYC. He played a game trying to be accepted by his lame father. The English Shaun mug is just that. I was laughing or rolling my eyes through the whole doc. Why do we promote these idiot-wannabes?My miniature schnauzer is ""tougher"" than these guys, and she doesn't need a gun.Nice one, HBO! Swing and a miss!!!",False
3,1,English Shaun hahaha,JamesK-780,n/a,16/08/2025,"Load of codswallop. 2 years ago Sammy said he'd never heard of Shaun Attwood.

4,9,Another chapter in the Sammy the Bull story,trent-89751,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew of the arrest and the surrounding circumstances of the ecstasy ring Sammy and family were involved in, I didn't know the details. This documentary she's the light on the underlying story and the people affected-including the competition. I like that it features NYC, suburbs of Liverpool and Phoenix. I remember the rave days in the late 90's, it definitely sheds the accurate light on what the scene was like back then. All in all, a well rounded movie that sheds the light on the underbelly of crime and society that exists from city to city in anywhere of the United States of America. Well done.",False
5,8,There reviews are ridiculous,Innocent2000,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, if you don't like the subject matter: DON'T WATCH. These people, from the get go hate these type of documentaries, and then come here and give it a low rating, regardless of what they have just watched. So ridiculous and this is the main problem with reviews...all the idiots out there.For what it is and what it is trying to convey - a story of redemption - it accomplishes its goals. I personally liked English Shaun's story which was pretty touching. Like the lady detective said at the beginning, he was completely different than the Gravano's, although their story is also important. Overall I definitely think this is worth the watch, especially if you like stories about learning from one's mistakes.",False
6,8,a very honest...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStory , told by some of the most dishonest drug /mob kingpins of the raving ecstasy era of human history ( well at least a fracture of its...at least in the mesas of arizonas dumps of icehouse and crowbar clientel)sammy gravano et co and shaun the englishman unravels their bad conscience through their drug crimes of the 90's and 00's, in a friendly manner, the only thing lacking out is the justice side of the story, its there, but not enough compared to e.g cocaine cowboys and the like thinks the grumpy old man.So if you were flying high on a delirious cloud of bam bam rythms in a warehouse somewhere, have a look, its history after all.",True

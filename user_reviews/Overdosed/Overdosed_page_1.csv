You took a negative action and turned it around to a positive outcome. But you're very much in denial. How do you fully recover when you don't take acountability for your actions? Did you know that withdrawing off of suboxone is worse than fentanyl? Vivitrol is meant for two addictions opiate and alcohol, one must be completely detoxed before starting but this doesn't help with what your mind is reminding you of. Relapse is very much imminent unless you've trained your brain to get these thoughts out of your head. How do you teach someone recovery when not only is it an action its a mindset, a mindset you're very much still in denial about?",False
2,10,Mesmerizing and crucially important,annconnolly-53144,n/a,16/08/2025,"So proud of all the wonderful women who had the bravery to speak from their hearts. It was a very touching and thoroughly mesmerizing film that connected all the dots as to how this catastrophe unfolded. Everyone should see this, especially the corporate pharmaceutical sector who tend to live in denial of the lives they have ruined. This film was interesting as you actually got to see how this transpired on the ground in West Virginia, which has been devastated as a result of the opioid crisis and the influx of deadly pain killers and other very damaging products. Its a tragedy that history will never forget and films like this will help ensure that this is never forgotten.",False

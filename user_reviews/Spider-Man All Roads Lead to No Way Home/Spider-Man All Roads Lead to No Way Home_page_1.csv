1,9,Great documentary,Boonhawk561963,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was on VUDU for a short time. I watched it 3 timed. It needs to be a regular release, or Blu-ray release or added to the movie as a bonus feature on streaming. Come on @Sonypictures and @Marvel Studios. Make it happen. It gave more insight into the making of the movie and had some laughs. JB and Martin were great and the whole documentary should have been a regular thing for streaming. Bring it back to VUDU or add it to all the streaming services as a bonus feature. I bet if you even put it as a separate blu-ray release, it would sell with all the Spider-Man fans out there. I know of a few friends who would buy it.",False

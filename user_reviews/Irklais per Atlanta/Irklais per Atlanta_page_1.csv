1,10,"Lots of tears, laughs and applauds",valutkeviciusadomas,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've recently seen the movie, and it was a great experience. The fact that this man crossed the Atlantic ocean is unreal. The preparing for the adventure was also very intresting.Aurimas Valujavicius is an influencer, and I've been following him for years, and to see him in a movie is immaculate.This film also had lots of lessons from Aurimas himself, as he thought long and hard about them during his time in the water.Lots of tears, laughs and applauds from the public as we watched the movie. At the end everyone stood up and applauded for the film.Overall it was a great experience, and i would like more movies made about this man.",False
2,10,Action packed,lavalamp5,n/a,16/08/2025,"It needs great talent to produce such documentary film that is not just a person rowing through the Atlantic ocean. There was a little bit of everything, which made the viewer experience pleasant. All the way from the backstory, to aftermath; from crying to laughing. Easily one of the best films Lithuania has ever produced. To my mind, this film will go into history and will be still viewed many years from now.It's hard to comprehend what rowing by yourself in the middle of nowhere feels like, but the film definitely gave an idea of how it all went. Hope to see more of Aurimas' in the near future.",False
3,9,Imperfect masterpeace,MarcusNebo,n/a,16/08/2025,"A really great movie. Documentary style, but it also has a great story. The music and dialog are perfect, but the visual storytelling, the space left for the viewer to interpret how hard it was, the pain he is dealing with, but not a single complaint was heard from the rower. It is really inspiring; motivational speeches ideally fill in to the story. The only drawback is the pacing; it's apparent that the second part was shortened, and a lot of key elements have been deleted. For instance, how he got rejected to dock in Miami. But overall, a great inspiring documentary about a charismatic person and an unhuman journey.",False
4,10,Beautiful Movie,mrshadesman,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI just had the pleasure of watching the movie, which was phenomenal!I was slightly sceptic of the movie after watching the trailer as it seemed un-Aurimas like - I felt as if it was ""pushing"" on the motivational and philosophical quotes, did not seem like the down to earth Aurimas that I ""got to know"" by following him on YouTube for years.But the movie was top tier, everything flowed smoothly, the shots were beautiful. Aurimas himself was the one we got to know over all his previous journeys.The only thing I would have loved to see more was the scary part of the ocean - the lightnings, the mini-storms etc. But this is me nitpicking :) Overall 10/10 movie, would definitely watch it again!",True
5,10,A journey across the Atlantic Ocean,vglotovas,n/a,16/08/2025,"One man, one ocean. A truly beautiful story of a trip across the ocean, done by a single person on a rowing boat. Many interesting moments, action, thoughts from the main character. Lithuania is a tiny nation with many people with huge hearts and no one represents it better than the hero of this movie - Aurimas.He is a young gentleman, with a humble start. Educated as an architect he found out that travelling is what he wants to do. After many trips on bike, canoe he finally decided to make a trip of his life, rowing across the Atlantic ocean. Thanks to his previous experiences, Aurimas captured lots of beautiful moments on camera and created this wonderful movie. I really hope it will be translated to English so many more people in the world can enjoy this as me and my family did. Thank you Aurimas!",False
6,10,Inspiring and sensational achievement,RM851222,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Irklais per Atlanta"" (2024) is a documentary about
Aurimas Valujavicius - a man who crossed Atlantic ocean solo with a rowing boat. It took him 4 moths to do it, and way more to prepare. This documentary is shot entirely by Aurimas himself, and its shows the preparation and daily ""work"" in ocean itself.This is a splendid documentary about a man that did seemingly impossible thing. You have to have a courage to say the least to even attempt to do it and to be physically and psychologically ready for anything. The achievement he did is astounding and highly inspiring.",False

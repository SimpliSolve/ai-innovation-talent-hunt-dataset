1,5,Trial,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust a few months after the TMZ special The Downfall of Diddy, there's a follow-up that has the TMZ crew get into the indictment against the former Bad Boy.Sean ""Puffy"" Combs has been with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The charges claim that he abused, threatened and coerced women and others, and led a racketeering conspiracy that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.These are not small crimes.According to the legal records, his ""sexual abuse of women included causing them to engage in frequent, days-long sexual activity with male commercial sex workers, some of whom were transported over state lines. These events, which Combs referred to as ""Freak Offs,"" were elaborate sex performances that Combs arranged, directed and often electronically recorded. To ensure participation in Freak Offs, Combs used violence and intimidation, and leveraged his power over victims -- power he obtained through obtaining and distributing narcotics to them, exploiting his financial support to them and threatening to cut off the same and controlling their careers. Combs also threatened his victims, including by threatening to expose the embarrassing and sensitive recordings he made of Freak Offs if the women did not comply with his demands.""According to Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, he is representing more than 120 men and women whose allegations against Combs include violent sexual assault or rape, facilitated sex with a controlled substance, dissemination of video recordings and sexual abuse of minors. There are nearly more cases by the day.Just this past week, Combs' lawyers have asked for a gag order on all New York media, as they claim that the government has an illicit partnership with the press that will ruin Combs' ability to get a fair trial. This is in regards to the video of him abusing partner Casandra ""Cassie"" Ventura that he claims was leaked to CNN.This doc even has an interview with Combs legal team, claiming that this is all about an attack on a successful black man. I've never felt right about Combs since the early incident where he oversold a concert leading to deaths, but I must remember that you are innocent until proven guilty. I wonder if Combs will ever get to trial.",True
2,5,Fall again,AvionPrince16,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo yeah pretty interesting .....But it get pretty repetitive after a while . I mean the events of the nightclub with Shyne , Cassie and her relationship with Cassie , the violence towards womens .One thing bothered me except the repetitivity was that lawyer who was annoying as hell : Making thing racial was dumb and stupid as hell .And i dont understand why people cant make that reflexion that even the biggest talent on earth cant hide human nature despite the fame , glory and money . Humans will be always humans despite allits more a question about power and how people handle this and the fear to not control everything : but guess what ? We cant control everything despite all the money on the world .I mean that part with the lawyer was annoying and it get pretty repetitive but it was good to know more , to see people talking about what they saw . With that girl who survived at the club when Diddy used guns and it was very interesting .But for now it was good and only time and investigations will save or not P Diddy. Need to wait then.",True

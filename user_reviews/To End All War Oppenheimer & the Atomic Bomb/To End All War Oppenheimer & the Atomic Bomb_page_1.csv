1,7,Worth your time!,khalidmoubile,n/a,15/08/2025,"To End All War: Oppenheimer & the Atomic Bomb.Exploring how one man's brilliance, hubris and relentless drive changed the nature of war forever.After watching Nolan's Oppenheimer, this it an absolute must see, it is informative and full of ethical issues and philosophical ideas that you'll have during watching this documentary.Isn't Oppenheimer one of the greatest scientists ever? Sure he is.Is what he said about ending all war is true especially the nuclear war? Yes it is working so far.Was it necessary to use it in that brutal way ? I think it shouldn't have been that way, it should have never used on people they could have demonstrate it differently .And finally ,Is Nolan's movie is accurate? Sure it is!This doc shows the respect and the fear of science and as have been said, Oppenheimer was a man representing both sides of it.",False
2,8,Just the facts; the depressing facts.,dansthyarra-10138,n/a,15/08/2025,"On the coattails of the Hollywood extravaganza arrives a depressing, factual documentary that entirely dispassionately explains Oppenheimer's life and how the bomb came to be.The use of real archival footage is addictive; adding to the depressing reality of bombs and war.Definitely worth viewing either before or after the Hollywood epic.Then make sure to go see the Barbie movie, because you'll definitely need cheering up!Back to Oppenheimer, by end end of the documentary, given what's happening in the world right now, depression should absolutely set in.Get a good strong drink and go to bed.",False
3,7,A 90-minute summary of Nolan's movie with real pictures,arall3,n/a,15/08/2025,Even structure wise it is beat by beat addendum to Nolan's film if you want to see beautifully upscaled pictures from the era.Essentially it does the trick and clarifies things that are included in American Prometheus book but skipped in the movie like Oppie's extremely bourgeoisie early life and his stubbornnesses on his compulsive need to convey his genius to everyone. Also literally hearing things from the experts make you feel more knowledgeable on the area even if you just saw the exact thing in the movie.People who hated the movie will not find anything of worth here but its recommended if you want to spend more time with oppie.,False
4,7,"A good documentary about Oppenheimer, and his role in the development of the atomic bomb and the sad consequences",ma-cortes,n/a,15/08/2025,"In Los Alamos , New Mexico, a team of government scientists is working on the top-secret Manhattan Project in a race to produce an atomic bomb before the Nazis . It is the greatest clandestine race against time in the history of science with the mission to build the world's first atomic bomb . There flawed scientists and their families attempt to co-exist in a world where secrets and lies infiltrate every aspect of their lives . On July 16, 1945 , the first atomic bomb was successfully detonated . At this moment, the future of history and that of its inventor, J. Robert, changed forever . After years of research, Oppenheimer finally achieved his goal, but in that moment of apparent triumph he realized the seriousness of what he had done. This documentary ¨To End All War: Oppenheimer & the Atomic Bomb¨ delves into the life of the controversial inventor of the atomic bomb , in his genius, contradictions, and the moral conflict that his invention caused him . Robert Oppenheimer led the team of scientists at Los Alamos who developed the bomb under General Leslie Groves's direction . With two men from as widely divergent backgrounds as these were , conflict was inevitable . Scientists, historians, analysts , soldiers , descendants of Oppenheimer and director Christopher Nolan himself introduce us to the scientist and the consequences that the invention had for him was the bomb , an achievement that gave humanity the power to destroy itself as well . We see physicist who had a large hand in the development of the atomic bomb , thus helping end World War 2 . Later , he would try to amend his mistake by warning of the dangers and fighting to stop the trend of nuclear proliferation, without success . As we see his life from days at Los Alamos and all the way to post-WW2 , where his fame saw him embroiled in political machinations .This documentary shows us a fascinating and complex man whose greatest achievement became his greatest regret . Exploring how one man's brilliance , hubris and relentless drive changed the nature of war forever .

In the documentary shows up notorious historical characters and scientists , such as : Harry S. Truman , Iosif Stalin , Lewis Strauss , Edward Teller, Franklin D. Roosevelt , Eleanor Roosevelt , Adolf Hitler , Joseph McCarthy , Albert Einstein , among others.Other films dealing with this enigmatic figure Robert J. Oppenheimer are the following ones : The best knwon is ¨Fat Man and Little Boy ¨ (1989) , Fat Man (this way called by bombing in Hiroshima) and Little Boy¨ (so named by bombing in Nagasaki) directed by Roland Joffe with Paul Newman as General Leslie R. Groves , Dwight Schultz as J. Robert Oppenheimer , Bonnie Bedelia , John Cusack , Laura Dern , this movie describes the power struggles and tensions between an idealist Robert Oppenheimer (Dwight Schulz) , the project's science leader and General Leslie Groves (Paul Newman) , the project's military commander . Furthermore , ¨Day one¨ ; ¨Engola Day¨ ; ¨Hiroshima¨ and for TV : ¨Oppenheimer¨ with Sam Waterson as Oppenheimer and one of the best resulted to be the Canadian series titled ¨Race for the bomb¨ with Tom Rack as Robert Oppenheimer , Maury Chaykin as General Groves and directed by Allan Eastman , as well as Manhattan (2014-2015) series with Daniel London as J. Robert Oppenheimer . And of course , the recently successful ¨Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer¨ (2023) -which is a perfect complement to ¨To End All War: Oppenheimer & the Atomic Bomb¨ (2023)- being starred by
Cillian Murphy , Emily Blunt , Robert Downey Jr. , Scott Grimes , Tony Goldwyn , James D'Arcy , Kenneth Branagh , Josh Harnett, Tim DeKay, David Krumholtz . Rating : 7.5/10 . Good documentary and worthwhile seeing.",False
5,9,Much better than the recent Christopher Nolan film,rjtrede-98864,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched both this documentary and the Christopher Nolan film (staring Cillian Murphy). While Cillian Murphy was indeed superb as Oppenheimer, the film seemed to focus on just ""being entertaining"". On the other hand, the documentary version covered a lot of interesting material, not covered in the movie. As a fan of history, I found the documentary to be much more in depth and thought provoking than the film. I really cannot fault the cinema version, nor the viewer who loved it. It just depends on what your preferences are. If you want to see a relative accurate history of Oppies life, watch the documentary. If you prefer to be entertained, watch the Nolan film. (Of course, there's nothing to keep you from watching both.) For my tastes, I preferred the documentary.",True
6,6,Good but with some shortcomings,eweb-882-22538,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good and interseting film but its more about the movie Oppenheimer than Oppenheimer himself.It shows that the movie is very close to the truth and reality at that time.Also original material is used and if you have seen the movie you will feel the closeness.I know that Oppenheimer was a big smoker and that smoke looks like an atomic blast but sometimes it looks like Marlbro sponser this film.I also dont get the way narrators tells the story in pices cut togheter, its no way they tell the story, they just read a script and pretending they tell it, cuiet usual in documentaries now a days but total unreal.",False
7,10,Way better than Nolan's bloated movie,taseron-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Looking for facts about WW2, nuclear war and people behind it? You are at the right place. ¨To End All War: Oppenheimer & the Atomic Bomb¨ is an A+ documentary.If you haven't fallen for Nolan's marketing gimmick and haven't seen his movie yet, my advice to you is, don't buy it. You won't lose anything. On the contrary, you will gain 3 hours by avoiding boring drama scenes. This documentary is way better than Nolan's bloated movie. If you are a fan of him, he is in this one too, being interviewed.I have watched this documentary before watching Nolan's movie so I recommend doing it in that order if you want to see both.",False
8,7,Worth watching,danpedersen27,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBetter than the movie.I found this documentary really informative with a good storyline and I was quite surprised about quite a few things in Christoffer Nolans Oppenheimer that where actually true, so really glad a watch this documentary.What I do not under stand at all is why they director chose to have all the ashtrays with cigarettes in them. I mean common we write 2025 are the really necessary to create create an atmosphere and if the have not been in the documentary would any sane human beings say: ""what a good documentary, but I really missed burning cigarettes to think it were great""?Despite that I really enjoyed it.",True
9,10,"A credible, insightful account of the A-Bomb Creation and the People behind it.",charlottebegayy,n/a,15/08/2025,"I knew there were two 2023 Oppenheimers to watch and it was a matter of what I choose first. The Christopher Nolan's 3 hour creation did not live up to our expectations with muffled dialogue and a completely nonlinear depiction of events.To End All War: Oppenheimer &The Atomic Bomb, on the other hand, is a clearcut documentary with archived footage and a beginning to end, up to date history of what it meant to create a weapon of mass destruction, a feat of science, technology and human intelligence.It touches on the morality and ethics behind the monumental project and the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer after his famous achievement, revealing his complex nature and lifelong guilt.A must watch in today's world, worth every minute of your time to watch a group of experts, Charles Oppenheimer - Dr. Oppenheimer's grandson and the Hiroshima bombing survivor and activists retelling one of the most important historical events and calling for peace.""As long as men are free to ask what they must, free to say what they think, free to think what they will, freedom can never be lost and science can never regress.""",False
10,4,Not all that interesting to watch,Xavier_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"It starts out decent enough, mostly the usual history and beginnings college life and early politics.Then all of a sudden Bill Nye shows up and starts speaking and it completely ruins any authenticity of this program. Why on earth is he chosen to spout off a few lines. He adds nothing, has zero scientific credentials and severely compromises the subject matter by attempting to describe how to make a nuclear bomb work. Mickey Mouse would have been slightly better.Overall you can fast forward through most of this and not miss much. 4/10 as it's nearly all interviews and a few spots of information.",False
11,10,Phenomenal,tracylondon,n/a,15/08/2025,"A superbly thorough account of Oppenheimer' s life. Shows the struggles he suffered from developing this weapon and it's death toll. Great footage of Oppenheimer speaking about the personal toll it took on him and his urgency that we never use these weapons again. I consider myself an avid consumer of all media about Oppenheimer yet I learned new facts from the documentary
Disappointed that Christopher Nolan was a part of this, weighing in like he's an expert when all he did was make a lackluster movie about the man. It's important that we know about the real man and not just the portrayal in the film
He was so much more than what was portrayed.",False

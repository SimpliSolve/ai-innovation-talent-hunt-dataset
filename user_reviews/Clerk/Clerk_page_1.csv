1,6,Kevin Smith is a man worth getting to know.,subxerogravity,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's strange for me to watch the movie because I already know Kevin Smith. I was aware of Fatman on Batman for a long time and really started watching Fatman Beyond religiously during the pandemic and believe me, he will not let you forget that he made Clerks.If you think of yourself a movie geek you got to see Clerk, cause the movie is about an iconic filmmaker who does not see himself in that way, but unlike many others who also don't see themselves like that. Kevin more embraces it. He's geeking out on his own stuff and its only an advantage for us because it makes him sooooo open about telling us about his experience as a filmmaker, lessons any wannabe filmmaker should listen to cause its inspiring. He had a story to tell and all he was doing was telling that story and everything about Smith tells you that if he can do it, you can do it.From his younger years as a filmmaker to his older years as a messiah of geek culture, Kevin smith tells a valuable lesson on how far being yourself can take you.",False
2,7,Moving documentary about a not-so-fat-anymore-man they did good,deltacr13,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a Kevin Smith fan since I was five. I remember vividly watching Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back with my parents and as the credits rolled being told ""Now remember, Chris, you can't repeat any of this to grandma and papa.""As a life long fan, this documentary is an excellent love letter to Kevin Smith the filmmaker, Kevin Smith the podcaster, Kevin Smith the icon, and Kevin Smith the person. From Jersey to Hollywood, it's been an emotional ride and Malcom Ingram certainly captured all of it.Clerk is a quintessential viewing for any fan of Smith. Clerk will make you laugh. Clerk will make you cry.",False
3,6,"If you love Kevin Smith, you will love this",BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerClerk is an extensive all access documentary examining the life and career of indie filmmaking icon Kevin Smith. If there's someone that had any connection with him and his films, they show up in this film to discuss his films and what it was like to work with him.Directed and written by Malcolm Ingram (with Sean Stanley) -- who also made Phantom of Winnipeg, a movie about how Phantom of the Paradise became a local sensation in that Manitoba town -- this movie shows everything from where Smith grew up to how he met the friends that would be in nearly all of his movies to how he went from indie filmmaker to being part of Hollywood to his spoken word, comic book and podcast careers. It even touches on his romantic relationships and how his life has changed since his heart attack.If you're a fan of Smith, you already know all of these stories, but perhaps those fans will love to see his whole story again and celebrate him. He certainly seems happy with life, kind to his fans and devoted to making the films he wants to make, even when films like Red State and Tusk push his usual Jersey hangout films into different directions.At one point in my life, Mallrats was the most important movie to ever speak to me. That feels like a long time ago, but I can't deny that so many of the ways that I look at film and life come from the movies of Smith, even if our sensibilities went in opposite ways when it seemed that he would continually just make the same Jay and Silent Bob films again and again.My lack of fandom doesn't keep me from thinking that this is a fine film that has plenty of access to its subjects. Sure, it doesn't dwell long on his failures -- there's always a reason -- and also doesn't get into some of the wilder stories like working on the Superman film or Cop Out, a movie that Smith claims he experienced total darkness while working with Bruce Willis. I guess the multitude of spoken word shows -- and DVD releases -- can tell those stories.",True
4,10,DO NOT READ 1 STAR REVIEWS,kansasdownu,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you don't like Kevin, that's fine. But as far as I can see, I am seeing people who have nothing better to do... so what do they do? They 1 star amazing doc's like this. Why? Because they're bored and have nothing better to do and they like down-scoring movies.That being said, the contribution to cinema that Kevin Smith has made, is more than significant. Maybe it wasn't your cup of tea, but most likely the people who write these reviews do not know what it takes to make a film. Kevin Smith does, the producers of this Documentary sure do, so don't listen to those people who have no idea what they are talking about. It's a great documentary. And if your an aspiring filmmaker, there is testimony from great indie filmmakers in this one and the praises they sing for Kevin Smith. So again, ignore the 1 stars, they're just pathetic, sad, angry little trolls.",False
5,10,Not seen footage is worth it for Kevin Smith fans,bononista,n/a,16/08/2025,"People writing reviews seem to have missed that this was put together by Malcolm Ingram and not Kevin. If you are a Kevin Smith fan this is for you. If you are not, haters back off (stop spamming the reviews with your hatred this footage is not for you). Thank you Kevin and thank you also Jay Mewes for all you do - FANS appreciate it.",False
6,n/a,About as good as a Kevin Smith doc could be,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt first, it seems redundant that a documentary about Kevin Smith would even need to be made. More than any other living filmmaker, Smith has documented almost all of his life and work through blog posts, books, podcasts, stage shows, interviews, and videos. From the 1990s until now, seemingly every aspect of Smith's life has been put into the public record. This is what makes Clerk ultimately a big surprise. While there isn't a ton of new information, viewers are given the chance to hear from people that rarely publicly comment on Smith's work, including family members like his mother and his brother, actors like Judd Nelson and Justin Long, and filmmakers like Richard Linklater and Jason Reitman. Yes, there are all the Smith regulars like Jason Mewes and Brian O'Halloran, but it's the comments from those that are mostly outside the View Askewniverse that make the doc really interesting and different from what I was expecting. I didn't know the story of how Smith came to work at the Quick Stop or that Jason Reitman was a big Kevin Smith fan. These new tidbits make the whole movie worthwhile for longtime fans, while those unfamiliar with Smith will learn just about everything they would want to know about his career. It covers every movie in his filmography, the highs and the lows, and the his influence on film culture. For those who aren't fans of Smith or his work, it's highly unlikely Clerk is going to change minds. However, for those who dig the View Askewniverse as a whole or even just individual Smith films, Clerk is a must-see. Highly recommended. 9/10.",True
7,10,We All Need To Reach High,Fallenhazel,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a world where the stage lights have dimmed and we are too afraid to even sit back down in seats now covered in shadow, and the fans over our head decline to carry voices once lifting, soothing, we're fading into the background. But there remains a silver lining waiting to be seen, a reminder of what was, struggles and triumphs. Whether we stand or sit, it doesn't matter. We just need to listen to his story and feel his inspiration.Because when we pass through this period of pandemic, and it will be another chapter to belong to history, we can either remain in the background
or peel ourselves away from the walls to make our dreams real.",False
8,1,The Most Boring Man in the World,Kamandi73,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another take on Kevin, the ONE TRICK PONY. Kevin wants to revisit his genius again. Lets watch in bored amazement as he does nothing, again.The story of the brilliant guy who put on a cap backwards. Next comes another reboot of Mallrats, and a prequel, and a sequel to the prequel. Then re-issue all the dvds with dozens of hours of outtakes and funny bloopers.",False
9,1,Just stop.,B_Truth,n/a,16/08/2025,Kevin Smith just like Ric Flair had his time. Now he just needs to go away and stop talking.This fake humility hidden behind a blabbermouth who keeps going over the same points and just so desperate to be relevant was worn out years ago.,False
10,1,Kevin Clerk,daryalstokes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh Kevin, here you are again.Relevance is necessary in this time, but maybe try to write another movie- not a prequel or a sequel. Nor another remake
Do you have it you?",False
11,1,Awful. Worst 10 minutes of my life.,kevk-05459,n/a,16/08/2025,Does anyone like this guy? I personally doubt his parents do.It's the most self indulgent rubbish from someone who nobody likes. I want my 10 minutes back.,False
12,1,Still pretending to be that indie filmmaker,ilcool90,n/a,16/08/2025,Smith can't stop talking about himself. He sold out many years ego and is a full fledged member of the church of woke.So his pretending of being that rebel filmmaker is a massive lie.Anyone with slightest criticism of him he blocks and then attacks.Save some of your own time and don't give him the attention he clearly does not deserves.,False
13,1,And he blabbers on.,Rastifan,n/a,16/08/2025,Silent Bob was a perfect role for him because there he had to shut his trap. People will never forget his blunt lies that made him the medium for ridicule. Go away Kevin. You are not relevant anymore.,False
14,n/a,It really is the documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Not much else to add. I started to watch and then stopped 10 mins in realizing it's not a joke. It's just slowly boring. I don't like when they get you excited and then you get disappointed so much.,False
15,1,"Stay Silent, BOB!",ThatMonkey,n/a,16/08/2025,"When you take stock in Kevin Smith's career and weight his failures along side his innovation and success, the former wins in a big way. I never understood the so called genius of Clerks. I think it was exactly what this documentary made it out to be. A couple people saw it, liked it and everyone jumped on the bandwagon, than Mallrats revealed the truth that Kevin still struggles with today. He got lucky!There was a beauty in Chasing Amy and despite it mostly flying under the radar, it showed a gifted writer who was able to create great works when he gets out of hits own way. That writing showed in his involvement with Good Will Hunting. Unfortunately, Kevin leaned too hard into his relationship with Ben and Matt and put the literal God Awful Dogma on screens.He told an amazing tale in Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back and everything since has been a downward spiral. I think the dark side of this documentary is the fact that you start to see that Scott Mosier was more than the battery that powered View Askew, he was the magic!Since Scott left, everything has been horrible and everything produced has been some form of weak knock off or attempt at someone else's work. Despite how happy Kevin is to be working with his less than talented daughter, she is basically the Tori Spelling of his empire. She only gets work because of her dad and even though she got the gig with the Quinten film, it was a result of his relationship with Kevin. So when Kevin brags about how well she's doing, take away all the terrible work they have done together, I would assume her voicework from He-Man is what keeps her mortgage current, if not parental support.Great people do great things and when Kevin got a true Hollywood budget he blew it. Cop Out was a terrible film. Sure you can blame Bruce, but when you watch the film, nothing stands out as amazing. I think he got decent funding for Zack and Miri and he blew that also.The fact that Marvel hasn't tapped him to write or direct tells me everything I need to know about this Comic Book Man. I like Kevin, I think his contribution to cinema is significant, but I think it's in the form of mentorship, production and marketing. I get nervous every time I see a new Kevin Smith trailer. When you have the lowest expectation of something and it still disappoints, that is a problem.This documentary, is also mediocre at best and when you consider that Jason Mewes' wife produced it and everyone involved is a friend, it's just clear that he surrounds himself with unqualified filmmakers, actors and producers.",False
16,3,Where's Garman?,robbscott-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWould've given this one a higher rating, except for the disturbing lack of any mention of Ralph Garman. Anyone? Will he be in the Director's Cut? The Reboot? 'splain, please....",True
17,2,Very disappointing,GrammarMatters,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was looking forward to this documentary because I've very much enjoyed listening to Kevin Smith speak in the spoken word talks he's done. THE GUY CAN TALK !But there is so very little of his great storytelling here - and I suppose if you really like his movies, you may enjoy learning more about him and listening to people talk about him - but I just found this so boring.There is not much more I can say: I'd SO much prefer to listen to him speak and tell the entertaining stories that I've seen him tell - and they are much, much more fun to listen to than this drab, lifeless 'tribute' to the greatness of this man.",False

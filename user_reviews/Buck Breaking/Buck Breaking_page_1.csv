1,4,The Great BWC of Tariq Nasheed,ronaldsonbob,n/a,15/08/2025,Amazing film from start to finish. The beautiful art of broken men from the challenges of bwc.,False
2,2,"(Mostly) Pure, Unfiltered Insanity",tfitzhunna,n/a,15/08/2025,"Although there was some legitimate information on horrifying historical practices in the documentary it's worthless. The few factual elements are dispersed throughout an ocean of lies, conspiracy theorism, metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and overt bigotry. For the record:
-The ""feminization of men"" (aka gender roles being loosened) is not at all exclusive to black men
-White men are not all secretly gay
-Treating gay and trans people better is not a conspiracy to emasculate black men
-Feminism is not a conspiracy to emasculate black men
-Black people's hair does not contain spiritual African energy
-Pedophilia is not being normalized and has nothing to do with homosexuality
-White men are capable of enjoying sex with women, know how to have *consensual* sex. Sex with women is not a ""necessary evil"" to continue the white race, it's actually pretty chill.In conclusion I highly recommend this movie if you want a laugh. Tariq and his stooges make the exact same arguments as neo-Nazis except with a few words switched around and somehow it makes even less sense. If you want an informative documentary on the issues facing the black community this ain't it.",False
3,2,Hang on a minute,nadblaster,n/a,15/08/2025,"If this is an actual documentary, it's beyond terrible. If this is secretly a satirical comedy, it is absolutely brilliant.",False
4,1,"Fetish Derived, Substance Deprived",electronmove,n/a,15/08/2025,"While fetish material can give quite the inspiration for cult classic material such as 1975's 'Mandingo' or even impressively executed masterworks such as Dracula, the director here tries to shamelessly and blatantly pawn off his fetish as a historical fact, but becomes a historical farce with zero evidence to show for any of it.",False
5,1,Tariq sure was busy,darkshad3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Tariq sure was busy in May creating all those accounts to give this ""documentary"" a 10. Haha, all of them, literally all of them, IMDB member since May.Other than that wth is this thing? A bunch of insecure guys trying to pose? Trying to make themselves look important? Or something? I don't know but it is wonderful comedy though!If you're looking for a funny movie, give this a try. If you're looking for factual information, stay very far away from this.",False
6,1,Worst form of hatred propaganda,info-85684,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerThis is a shocking piece of junk made for simple minds. The 4 ratings are much too high. It is nothing but racism in its truest form.,True
7,1,Fake news,cs35,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThere's a lot to unpack with these memes in particular. The ""gay white slaveowners"" is interesting. It actually doesn't make zero sense. Existing proudly as gay in antebellum America? Unheard of & unrealistic. Man on man sex was illegal during antebellum America. Even the most powerful men during those times couldn't exist being found to have had sex with other men. So if sexual abuse against men by men was going down, it was happening in secret & not out in the open. So where exactly would anyone be gathering this information from without any documents supporting this? During antebellum America those men simply would not have identified as gay. The concept would have had no meaning to them in the same way it does today.It's very similar to how men in prison are victims of other men. Simply because it's not as black & white as men being gay is. I'm sure there are gay men in prison. But there are also men in prison who prey on others who are more vulnerable & men they can have control over. It's the dynamics here that are in place. With how rape is about control & power. It's not about the stereotypical homophobic strong booty warrior"" taking a man's ""manhood"".It's men who are victims of other men.The main thing that strikes me about these memes is the emphasis on gayness. The creators of these memes are more focused on the slaveowners being gay than the awful things they've done to enslaved people. These memes have been constructed & disseminated with homophobic thinking & intentions. It also doesn't help that the myths further harmful stereotypes about gay people. It treats gay people as predatory & sexually violent beings.So with that being said... This entire ""buck breaking"" narrative has been fictionalized. The sexual exploitation of enslaved women & men was very much a real thing. The ritualized practice of public humiliation & violence was very much a real thing. It was a means of dehumanization & asserting control. There was never a shortage of trauma during slavery. Therefore, there's no reason to fabricate history for one's own agenda. It does more harm than good when we spread misinformation to further an agenda that is deep-rooted in anti-LGBTQ ideologies.",True
8,1,Uhhh,greg-53682,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow, this was awful. Should have known that by looking at all the 10s from a week old IMDB accounts. Tariq's been working overtime making all those accounts. Don't waste your time and money with this propaganda. Just awful.",False
9,10,BBC posters on suicide watch,xxxmmxxx-22886,n/a,15/08/2025,Amazing film. They no joke said Japanese people can't dance and that the Turks brought being gay to Africa. The whole thing is basically a /pol/ schizopost. Can't make this up. 10/10 best terrible movie. Deserves an oscar.,False
10,1,Black Man's Fairy Tale,ninewestcampuswatch,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is honestly the worst movie/doc I've ever seen in my entire life. The cinematography looks like it was done by a child having a seizure, with constant jumpcuts to deviant art fetish anime. There was no structure, and the whole thing looks like a third graders Imovie project. I cannot stress how hard this was to watch.I also found the movies focus on the heterosexual black male to be rather peculiar. The movie discusses blackness and homosexuality as a whole but ultimately concludes that black males are at ""the bottom of the totem pole."" I'm still not really sure why, as there was constant contradictions and baseless thories.This movie also suffered from a lack of any evidence or credentials. Apparently any random person off the street can qualify as a ""historian."" And apparently being an ""activist"" is a good enough credential for me to trust you. There wasn't even consistency among the random jumble of incoherent speakers. For example, some would argue that white people are inherently homosexual and that only white people exhibit homosexuality. Later, others claim that whites are the source of homophobia. This is clearly just a white hate film that is so poorly done it is best viewed as a comedy sketch, I got a few good laughs out of it, and I'm sure Tariq loves to have the movie rental money. Clearly just a cash grab that pissed pretty much everyone off, which is what he was going for. Pretty weak bait and ultimately so poorly done i could never be convinced this was legitimate. 90% of the speakers need to find a personality outside of fringe race theories and fake phds.",True
11,7,Glacier Apes will continue to ignore the truth.,reggieb-40752,n/a,15/08/2025,Very informative documentary. The reviews by the melanin deficient Neanderthals is the main reason I'm here lol.,False
12,1,If this was a parody movie would be 10/10,FKintheCoffee,n/a,15/08/2025,"What do I even rate this, it's highly entertaining and funniest movie I've seen in a long time, but it fails at everything it sets out to try and I've never seen such a crazy and not based in any reality doc than this.",False
13,1,A pack of lies,victor-cypert,n/a,15/08/2025,"Being gay is not an agenda; it is a fact in nature. The events depicted here never happened.Yes, slaves were sexually abused by their illegitimate owners. However, the practice of ""Buck Breaking"" is so absurd in its legal ramifications that it's clear it never happened.Tariq is just a bigot.",False
14,1,Wtf,delwhat,n/a,15/08/2025,This movie is just homophobic and racist rhetoric spewed by antisemites who think they know more than they do. This is why I hate conspiracists someones identity isn't open for your opinions.,False
15,1,Couldn't tell if this was real or not,chde-75302,n/a,15/08/2025,I just don't even know. So much hate here. So much gaslighting.,False
16,1,Grown Men Playing Victim,lanejohn-94869,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI really thought this entire film was a parody/joke. This film is literally grown black men playing victim and blaming everybody expect for themselves. No accountability whatsoever. Sissy cry babies who use what happened 400 years ago as an excuse to sit, cry, and do nothing today. Very sad, shameful, embarrassing, and tragic. This ""film"" did nothing but expose male weakness, and male acting excessively feminine in the black community.",True
17,1,Not very informative!,Riggyjiggy,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have about a dozen bucks need breaking, but this movie didn't teach me anything about the process so im just as lost on where to start as ever.Tareek Mashead goes on at length about the history of the sport but does very little unbiased instructional work, leaving me wondering who broke him and did such a bad job that he can barely pass on the knowledge to anybody else.If anything, waffling on about how this relates to the modern world does more to confuse the viewer than it does to educate on how this sort of thing should be done, it's not like I'm trying to open a massage parlor or something.",False
18,3,Why is it not available?,adariousl,n/a,15/08/2025,Why is it not available??Not sure why it's no longer available .,False
19,1,Such a disappointment,slimgig,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was looking forward to watching this. It was beyond trash.They kept on contradicting themselves. These people are lost and cannot look at themselves. The constant finger-pointing was sad to see. The talkers on the show think they're smart but they strike me as people who are extremely mentally fragile.""Woe is me, everyone's tryna keep the Black man down (except himself) wah wah"". They blame Oprah for more damage than the rappers, pookies and ray rays killing and criming all over the world.According to this show, no one is actually homosexual... This is obviously factually incorrect. Homosexuality, both male and female, can be observed in the animal kingdom. It is NATURAL.Also, one minute the church is the saviour yet it was enforced on slaves by white slave masters. Why not look back to African traditional religions? Because they're ashamed and there's so much contention between African and the diaspora.The film was shameful and it was embarrassing to see adults with such little sense and no shame.Here's a tip: if a Black man starts talking about being asked to wear a dress, just switch the show off cos his brain is undeveloped and the show's gonna be trash and about half baked racial conspiracy theories. Not that a Black man must wear a dress, everyone should dress as they please but the way these smooth brains overblow the dress thing when Black people have much larger problems, it just shows the level of thinking.A Black woman is female before she is Black, wanna know why?If she were alone on a desert island, who would interact with her as Black? No one. But she'd still menstruate. Which means biological sex comes before gender.Get your act together: Find a religion that suits you, embrace your sexuality responsibily, go get your money and stop pointing the finger at people.",False
20,9,Pressing Documentary,coreycurrie,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm not sure if Tariq Nasheed's ""Buckbreaking"" documentary was completely factual-being that they used a picture of Rasputin's phallus to present image evidence of black men being castrated. But the talking points were spot on and well needed in this day and time. I liked the notable figures he used to present the talking cases too. Especially Judge Joe Brown. I think all of you should watch it.",True
21,10,"REAL TRUTH IS ON OFFENCE, NOT A SIN",u_locks,n/a,15/08/2025,"I always feel like I learn something from this Director's documentaries. What's up with that Bird Island situation though?Not sure why but, before being allowed to post this, I did get the following error: ""Sorry, your review is too short. It needs to contain at least 150 characters.""",False
22,10,Easily the best movie of the year,mrbrown-59016,n/a,15/08/2025,"I dont expect anyone whos not black American to like this movie. But to those of us tired of seeing our image run through the ground in Hollywood, this movie is a breath of fresh air. This movie is the truth. Watch it with your black children at least a dozen times. Let them know these images of black people portrayed through mainstream media is propaganda purposed to lower their self esteem. This film will illustrate to young black minds why black people are portrayed in such a negative light.",False
23,10,Top Tier . A Must See!,smjnupe,n/a,15/08/2025,Movie was awesome. Highly recommend. Very informative and will open eyes to hidden truths.,False
24,10,Great Documentary and not surprised by Trolling,SilentDProductions,n/a,15/08/2025,"Major props to Tariq and the crew for making this production. It's ashame that when truth is taught, you have forces that aren't exactly find of it getting out.",False
25,10,Great starting point to begin your research into the present agenda.,blackboylogic,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie serves as an outline for the agenda being executed on Foundational Black Americans. It breaks down the psychological and sexual motivations behind every force against the black family and the perpetuation and thiving of Black people. It explains the history of buck breaking on the plantation and the manifestation and practice as it exists today in the form of workplace discrimination, social media and political intimidation, zoning/redlining, heterosexual shaming, and even indoctrination as early as pre-school.This is a must-see for everyone to understand today's socio-political landscape.",False

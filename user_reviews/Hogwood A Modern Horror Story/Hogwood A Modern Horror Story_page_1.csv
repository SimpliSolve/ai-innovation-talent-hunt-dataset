1,7,Awful how this is our reality,ello-03383,n/a,16/08/2025,This has to stop! Showing us this reality maybe an effective form because people are ignoring this. How can companies allow this to happen. I really hope that they get consequences even the people working for it. Please people when you buy something: check out the animals are treated or else you are a contributeing. (It shows really horrifying pictures that won't live in my head ever I believe. But it is worth watching because you need to get the whole picture). I really hope this industry will change in the future and that stuff like this will blow up so that it also can disappear. So watch and share this documentary! Please.,False
2,8,a nation of animal lovers,kbdqjmnf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Or so we like to think we are. This one mainly focuses on the maltreatment of, and speciesism directed towards, pigs.This kind of treatment is considered acceptable because the buying public ""love"" animals and therefore believe all the happy smiling animals down on the farms just waiting for their day to come.With cig packets now coming with pictures on to warn you of the obvious health risks posed by smoking then why are we not applying to the same to meat and dairy which also can lead to serious health problems for humans but is always fatal for the animals.If you don't want to know where your food comes from then you probably already know the truth.",False
3,n/a,Essential viewing for anyone who buys bacon in the UK,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most meat eaters believe they are fundamentally against animal abuse while simultaneously funding unimaginable suffering. The vast majority of meat is factory farmed and this is another important film to help people realise the reality of modern day farming. And as highlighted here, much of this horrific treatment is considered acceptable by the governing bodies. Any decent human being would be sickened by what is being done to these animals behind closed doors and the more people see films like this the more people will wake up to the atrocities they are funding when they buy bacon and other meats. It's not just factory farms either.People think what we are doing what we've always been doing, but even just since the 1960s (in many of our lifetimes) we've increased meat production by about 95%. So what we are doing now is nothing like we have done historically. With this rising demand, at some point there has to become a point where the treatment of animals is so bad that it is morally wrong, and I believe we are well beyond that point.And as highlighted by this film this isn't something that's happening somewhere else, it's happening here in the UK and being sold in the major supermarkets we use every day.It's not really possible to be against animal abuse if you are buying meat in restaurants and supermarkets in the UK, if at all. Terms like local, grass fed and organic have no guarantees at all of animals being treated any better.Hopefully many people will see this film and make steps to reduce the amount of unnecessary animal suffering they they are supporting.",False
4,10,Heartbreaking but brilliant.,amyparkin-41265,n/a,16/08/2025,"I respect those that did all they could to make this short film. It is so horrific and sad - at parts hard to watch, but really needed for many people who still contribute to the awful abuse and killing of these innocent beautiful animals. This one film specialises in the factory farms of pigs, the torment and pain they endure in their short and unfulfilling life. It's not too long but it captures all points that are important for people to see. Brilliant work and I really hope they make more films like this that I can continue to recommend to people to hopefully turn them the right way - VEGAN way.",False

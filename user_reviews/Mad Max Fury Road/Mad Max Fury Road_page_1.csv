1,9,What a lovely day!,AfricanBro,n/a,15/08/2025,"The opening is wild, kicking off with a captivating start. I think everything about this movie is perfect: the visuals, the action, the dialogue, the costumes, the acting... it was both beautiful and apocalyptic. I loved how everything felt like a rock 'n' roll fest.I love dystopian movies, but you don't have to be a fan to recognize how amazing this was. It's a story of survival in a savage wasteland, every scene felt epic. I liked the cult-like nature and how they glorified their deaths like they were Vikings. Everything was eccentric and crazy, with non-stop action for nearly the whole movie.It's really dystopian and wild, so it's surprising that this was actually a mainstream hit. ""Do not become addicted to water"" was such a wild statement, lol.The premise is very simple; I don't think I can think of a more simplistic movie that worked so well. They drive out into the desert, then make a U-turn back to where they came from. That's it. And it's a blast. This is my favorite action movie, jam-packed with crazy sequences.The movie is really just one huge dystopian action sequence, so I guess the drawback could be that it's all action. If you're looking for something more, you won't find much. Apparently, Mad Max lore has some complex and darker elements, and maybe the upcoming Furiosa will delve deeper into that.Furiosa was probably the main character; it felt like Mad Max himself was just tagging along. The villain, Immortan Joe, was great. All the characters are memorable. And because the premise is so simple and the movie is so action-packed, it feels shorter than it actually is. It's just great fun and keeps me glued to the screen. Looking forward to Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.",False
2,9,"Beyond Thunderdome on acid, with a huge budget",Imaculata,n/a,15/08/2025,"I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie popping up. People complaining that there is a lack of story and character development, and too much action.... too much action? Really? Have these people never seen a Mad Max movie before? How is that a bad thing in a Mad Max movie? Fury Road feels like an 80's action movie, with a preposterously large budget, and it is GLORIOUS. This movie was an epic ride. So many awesome set pieces, incredible car designs, twisted and bizarre costumes and characters, and a lot of really strong warrior women as well.I've also heard it said that this movie contains a lot of feminism. Strong female characters that kick butt, is not feminism people! There's no anti-men message here. Just a cast which is dominated by more women than men. And about time for a change! Charlize Theron is my new favorite actress after this (it used to be Sigourney Weaver and Linda Hamilton). She really takes the spotlight, and that is about the only criticism I can think of with this movie. It's not so much about Mad Max, but about road warriors in general, and specifically Theron's character. I didn't think Tom Hardy was quite as good as Mad Max as Mel Gibson was, but he wasn't terrible. He just didn't lend enough presence to his character in this movie. Which may be a hard thing to do when the movie does not focus on Max.Special mention should also be given to all the side characters. The villains are enjoyably menacing, especially Hugh Keays-Byrne as Immortan Joe, John Howard as the People Eater, Richard Carter as the Bullet Farmer, and I also loved Melissa Jaffer as the leader of a gang of elderly motor ladies.Go see this movie if you like Mad Max!",False
3,8,A Vehicular Magnum Opus That's Short on Plot But Heavy on Everything Else,psgorio,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rewatching this before Furiosa felt like a cornucopia of action, eye candy and quite simply, madness. It's a film that has a simple plot and premise but is heavy on pretty much everything else from dedicated actors sinking into the madly written lines and plot, gorgeous cinematography, an excellent audio score and the excellent use of practical effects. Seriously it uses such a blend of practical effects within special effects that compliment each other so well you start to believe they're actually in these crazy chase sequences including a ridiculous one through a live sand storm that was wicked to watch unfold. My only complaints would be it could have used a little more complex plot and Max himself could have been in the movie more as a protagonist instead of feeling like a supporting character in a movie with his name in the title. Other than that it's a wild ride from start to finish with almost near non stop action to keep you invested until the climactic, while partially abrupt, finish.",False
4,10,Pure action spectacle,Leofwine_draca,n/a,15/08/2025,"MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is the finest piece of pure action spectacle that I've watched since THE RAID 2 and JOHN WICK. It feels like the MAD MAX film that George Miller always wanted to make, and in many ways it's a virtual remake of MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR, except with a grossly inflated budget and CGI effects used to enhance rather than dominate. Now, I love THE ROAD WARRIOR and always will, but MAD MAX: FURY ROAD truly is an action film for our times.I know that some will hate it; the story here is action and action alone and there's little else to get in the way. It's one long chase film and the amazing thing is how they manage to sustain the momentum for a good two hours. Exemplary cinematography and quite wonderful direction is what makes this work. With bad direction it would have been a real chore to sit through, but instead we get tons of suspense, great fight scenes, and incredible spectacle. This is the kind of film you watch to see stuff that's never been done before.Tom Hardy feels like an obvious fit for the role and brings some working class style charisma to the part. As many have commented, Max is often a supporting player in his own film, but Charlize Theron as the real lead is excellent too, so that's not important. Even Nicholas Hoult in support is fantastic. I loved the way that the bad guy is played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who was the villain in the first MAD MAX all those years ago. Overall, though, this is a film not about the people, but the Namibian desert landscapes, the modded vehicles, the speed, the violence, the overall thrill of the chase. And it's pretty much my idea of a perfect film.",False
5,10,An Action Masterpiece. Ridiculous In All The Right Ways. (9.5/10),isaacsuttle,n/a,15/08/2025,"George Miller returns to live-action filmmaking with one of the greatest action films ever put to screen. 'Mad Max: Fury Road' is ridiculous in all the right ways.For those who have seen the original films and loved them, you'll fall in love all over again with this film. Tom Hardy takes the reigns this time around as Max - a man of few words who has been hardened by the world in which he lives. Along with him is Charlize Theron as Imperator Furiosa - a woman who seeks redemption by helping five young '""wives"" escape from the film's antagonist.Leading up to the film's release, many speculated if this would be just another action film that lacks a solid narrative and motive, but I am happy to say that this is simply not the case. Yes, the film does fill 80% of its run-time with action sequences, but it never gets in the way of the humanity between these characters that Miller has brought to life. There are some emotional moments. Specifically, with Theron's character. Is the story something we haven't seen before? Not at all. But in a film loaded with action, it's nice to see a solid narrative.Now, how about those action sequences? Incredible - exhilarating - jaw-dropping. George Miller has put together some of the greatest, most memorable action set-pieces ever. One thing that sets the action in this film apart from a good majority of mediocre action films today is that every action the character's make have an affect on them. For good and for bad. The action is not pointless. It's motivated. And it's glorious to behold thanks to the use of practical effects, incredible stunt work and stunning cinematography.'Mad Max: Fury Road' has set a new standard for action films. It's arguably the greatest action film of the 21st century. It's that good. George Miller has brought back what we loved about 80's action films while also brining new ideas to the table. It's the best time I've had in a theater in a long time, and I couldn't help but laugh in appreciation of the ridiculousness that was unfolding before my eyes. The film left me feeling giddy, with a big smile on my face.",False
6,10,"Oh, what a film. What a lovely film",gnperuti,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first Mad Max film in thirty years is a master class of visual storytelling. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue throughout the film, and even less in the way of exposition. Instead, it relies on what's shown onscreen to tell much of the story, leaving it up to the audience to fill in the blanks themselves. The dialogue we do get is over the top goofy, as are the characters and performances. However, both are perfectly fitting for the absurd nature of the story and setting. Besides, there are still some highlights among the cast. Furiosa is an amazing herione, as cool as she is pretty, and played spectacularly by Chalize Theron. While Max takes a backseat to her, he's still a great hero and Tom Hardy more than fills Mel Gibson's shoes in the role. And Immortan Joe is a great, creepy villain.George Miller's movies are pretty much guaranteed to be stylized and stylistic to a crazy degree, even if, unlike some directors, not all his films look like he made them (the man worked on Babe of all things). And his style perfectly fits the visual storytelling he was going for with this film. Everything, from the costumes and makeup, to the sets, to the many, MANY vehicles are an amazing visual feast, full of grotesque detail and bizarre quirks, like one of the vehicles in Joe's convoy literally just being there to accommodate a blindfolded man playing a guitar that spews fire. That's the kind of epic madness that we get from this movie, and it's as glorious as the action. Speaking of, this is basically one big car chase, with tons of little set pieces thrown in throughout, full of great stunts, awesome music, and a perfect blend of practical effects and over the top CGI.Overall, Mad Max Fury Road is easily the best of the films and one of the best action movies of the current century. If there was one word I could use to describe it, it would be cool. It is a cool, cool movie that can't get enough of, nor recommend enough.",False
7,10,Mad Max Fury Road: A statement to embarrass and destroy all other movies in the action genre,confrank,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, is George Miller's attempt to reignite his long dormant Mad Max franchise...and my god does he ever. For the past decade or so, with exceptions such as John Wick, The Bourne Trilogy, and The Raid, action movies seem to be struggling to capture the excitement and enjoyment the genre once held; a tenacity that classics from the 80's and 90's had in spades. George Miller single handedly delivers our saving grace with Fury Road on the back of a spike covered oil rig with a blind zombie playing a fire breathing electric guitar.Max is a man of few words, but Tom Hardy's talent for portraying strong, silent characters shines through in a gruff but sympathetic performance. He teams up with Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa to save the last 5 hot women in the world from the leader of a powerful cult with a terrifying breathing mask inspired by the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. From there, the chase is on.Using this simple plot as the setting, we are able to bear witness to one of the most beautifully shot films in years. The world of Mad Max looks absolutely gorgeous, combining awe-inspiring practical effects and landscapes with bold colours brimming from all edges of the frame. These are of course just bonuses in enhancing the primary reason people will love this film, the action itself. I'm happy to report these action sequences are damn near flawless. No shaky cam, barely a hint of CGI, and scenes where we actually feel like our characters are in danger (yes Furious 7 I'm calling you out). Total chaos relentlessly ensues for the majority of the film, but it's chaos you can follow clearly and marvel at. Whether it's one of the explosive car sequences, or one of the smaller emotional moments, Mad Max: Fury Road refuses to let up on tension for one second.There's a reason this movie is sitting at 98% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is an action movie that will set a precedent for years to come, roaring ferociously at all who may challenge it. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of a genre revolution early in the making.FINAL VERDICT: Mad Max: Fury Road is a beautifully chaotic display of masterfully executed action sequences with a strong emotional core, and a raw energy unmatched by nearly all of its action genre competition.",False
8,n/a,What A Lovely Day!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The rationale behind the success of 'Fury Road' predominantly lies with director George Miller whose commitment and love for the film series that he's been developing since its first outing in 1979 is evident throughout, and it's pretty obvious that he knows how to craft a damn fine action sequence. Without this passion, the film would have likely stooped as there's not much else in the way of a plot or character development, even though Theron tries her hardest to give us an enthralling new action heroine to be revered. Aside from the aforementioned writing setbacks, 'Fury Road' is a powerhouse in the technical categories. With stunning contradictory cinematography from John Seale giving us a post-apocalyptic world of lavish colour rather than your typical muted tones, a heart-pounding score from Junkie XL and exquisite production design work that rightfully earnt the film an Oscar (one of six) for its spectacular vehicle design.",False
9,8,Well made and mindlessly entertaining....,planktonrules,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is not the sort of film I enjoy and I after watching it, I am not a huge fan though I deeply respect the filmmakers. The reason I even saw it was the insane reaction the public had to this one...and the critical reviews were all surprisingly good. I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about...and try to understand why folks liked it so much. My take on it is that if you enjoy a film that is non-stop amazing action, then this one is for you. As far as the story goes, it's plot is super-thin--but the movie is handled so well and the stunts so amazingly insane that you don't mind. Worth seeing--but I sure wouldn't like to see a lot of films like this. Additionally, it was VERY refreshing to see a film where so many women are NOT mindless objects to be killed or protected--several are about as strong and heroic as Max himself--and no doubt this is why women seemed to like the film so much.",False
10,10,Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015. Mad Max: Fury Road is the finest blockbuster of 2015!,ivo-cobra8,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I wrote this review 3 years ago I had no idea how many people hate this movie and they are preferring Mad Max 3 over this film. Claming Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome the third film is better film than this, really? Better than this? Listen folks it has no Mel Gibson so what? So what's your point? Gibson dropped out this film and he wasn't interested, it was in development for years, since in 2004 this movie was announced. George Miller did something different with this film and he got hate for it. I hate Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome to death! It is rated PG-13 family film and I wanted an action bloody rated R film not a boring stupid lame fu**** movie! I got an rated R bloody action film that I wanted in Mad Max: Fury Road. I was entertained and I enjoy it.At least it wasn't so sick like was Beyond Thunderdome. Mad Max: Fury Road is my second favorite film in the franchise and this movie did it right and it correct that third film that it failed been an good action film. Like it or hate it, is your problem but in my opinion it is a good action violent movie and I love it to death I am an action junkie myself. Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is my number 1 favorite film of all time.I think Mad Max: Fury Road is George Miller's masterpiece. Finally, Finally after 30.years of fiasco Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome that completely destroyed the Mad Max Trilogy, George Miller finally come back and fix the mistake he did 30.years ago. Why wouldn't I love this film? This film is the best one in the series along side Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior at least for me it is the best film. It has action, high explosive and Tom Hardy been a real Mad Max unlike Mel Gibson was in Thunderdome. I am happy they made the 4th movie. Tom Hardy was a bad ass Mad Max. I didn't even noticed that we don't have Mel Gibson in here. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. I love high speed and pursuit on a road which I seriously love this. The thing was more similar to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior but much better, George Miller fix it, the film did not copy The Road Warrior the film has it is own story. All, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Immortan Joe was a fantastic villain in here he was really good. The film shows a real wasteland and the future which I am really happy about it.NOTE: ""Don't waste your time if you have seen the original."" from a hater review my reply: Yes I will waste my time watching this awesome action flick! Yes I have seen the Original Film Mad Max with Mel Gibson so many times than you ever did! I love this film much more than Mad Max because sometimes the original is very boring and the film has so much Drama in it and less Action than it is in Fury Road. I wanted to have an apocalyptic action film like are Fury Road and The Road Warrior which this film fix it. Finally yes Finally I have seen a good Action Film from 2015 and It is finally the finest blockbuster of 2015!Mad Max: Fury Road is a 2015 post-apocalyptic action film directed and produced by George Miller, and written by Miller, Brendan McCarthy and Nico Lathouris. The fourth installment in the Mad Max franchise, it is an Australian and American venture produced by Kennedy Miller Mitchell, RatPac-Dune Entertainment and Village Roadshow Pictures. The film is set in a future desert wasteland where gasoline and water are scarce commodities.10/10 Awesome film I have seen it twice. I love this film to death I love it! Fury Road would be the second favorite best film in the franchise.",False
11,6,Fury Road,motrous,n/a,15/08/2025,Don't take my word on this one. I recognize that I am in a small minority of people who didn't care for this move. It wasn't bad! I just think it wasn't for me. The crazy vehicles were obviously pretty cool but I couldn't rationalize the worldbuilding in it. Broke my suspension of disbelief and I couldn't really enjoy the rest of the movie I guess.,False
12,10,An absolutely insane action film that will blow you away,stephendaxter,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mad Max Fury Road is George Miller's return to the franchise he started way back in 1979 with Mad Max. I will start by saying this movie was absolutely batsh** insane. It was filled right to the brim with continuous over the top bloody ridiculous action sequences that keep you on the edge of the seat and just amazed at what Is happening on screen. Now this film doesn't have much of a plot at all but seriously you're not going into this film for an intense plot, this is a film that almost didn't even need one at all. The one thing I was worried about going in was whether I needed to have seen the previous films to understand this one and thankfully you don't, the story is independent of the previous film which was really helpful.The characters were all awesome and it did an amazing job to introduce them all almost instantly and get right into the action. Max (Tom Hardy? and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) were were great and extremely likable characters. Even the villain who I will just call Sweet Tooth was so great, he wasn't anything too special but was a great threat throughout the film.I just absolutely loved this movie, intense action from start to finish and didn't slow down at all, that made it ridiculously fun to watch. The great characters and the performances are awesome on screen and we're always interesting to watch. If there was ever a Twisted Metal movie, this is what it would be. Nothing really let the film down and everything really worked, such a great time and the best cinema experience this year so far. - 10",False
13,6,2-hour action scene,akdjreview,n/a,15/08/2025,"The concept of the Mad Max films is incredible. A universe that's been left in ruins from war and only a few people left with different psychological damages is a good concept. But Mad Max: Fury Road honestly fails to succeed with making an impressive film from it.The many different cool and fantastically engineered cars, which the entire movie is based around are amazing. Alongside, a few beautifully filmed scenes Mad Max turn out to have a few beautiful scenes. But this is about all Mad Max: Fury Road has going for itself.The film is quite boring. It's based on the plot of driving a straight line for half the movie. Then realising they cant continue to then turn around, and drive back for the rest of the film. Meanwhile basically being on constant fight scenes along the way. Even so, most fight scenes are quite poorly filmed. The director used odd angles. Where a lot of the time you couldn't even make out whats going on.I don't really recommend you watch Mad Max: Fury Road. The Mad Max universe is a cool concept, but without it, this movie would be nothing.",False
14,2,Last 15 minutes of The Road Warrior stretched to 2 hours,andrewwhopkinson,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have this movie 2 stars only because of the incredible set design, and some of those cars are just insane. George Miller got his wet dream I suppose to make this movie, I am sure the budget was 50x more than he got in his previous Max movies. Well George, sometimes less is more. Sometimes it's better to have some constraints, just look at Quentin Tarantino. As soon as he got lots of money his movies became over long, self indulgent messes. George seemed to have listened to all the praise about how good the ending chase scene was in The Road Warrior so he made a movie of just that. Well that's like a meal of just cake. It may feel good going down, but it doesn't sit well. What made the last 15 minutes of TRW so good is the previous hour and a half of plot and character build up, without that it does not have same effect, no matter how many explosions and insane stunts you throw at the screen, it just numbs the brain. Miller stated that 90% of the movie was practical stunts but I find this hard to believe. I saw a LOT of CGI.This movie has no charm, no feeling of engagement, and very little sense of realism. People fly through the air crash on the ground with barely a scratch. Max has his leg brace but runs around like a football player. Some pale faced kid needs a ""blood bag"" for blood transfusions and then suddenly he doesn't? And old lady shoves a shell casing in someones eye? A guy is wearing a mask rips his face off when yanked off? Whatever happened to the idea that things like gasoline and bullets are rare in post apocalypse? Where are these things being manufactured? Oh well I guess you are supposed to ask these questions, just enjoy the explosions and the women being...uhm...milked.Charlize Theron is good but based on interviews she had no idea what she was doing and to me it shows, she cries when she is told to but her character is poorly developed. We get her back story and then 5 minutes later she has this big breakdown, which has no weight to it. The movie would have been better with fewer characters, cut out the nux kid and the old ladies and just focus on Furiosa and Max. And while we are at it, this movie is called Mad Max, not Mad Charlize, why does he seem like a side character? And why show his beloved last of the V8 interceptors and crash it 1 minute later? And his character just didn't feel like Max, Max was the coolest of the cool with a tinge of a maniac, this guy is all frantic and comes across as just another action hero. This movie had some potential to be epic, but it needed more balance, a better script and more realism. Movies have become rides.",True
15,9,"A blockbuster that dark, gritty, brutal and bloody? Right here.",punishable-by-death,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was left speechless when this finished. It can be hard to describe  indeed.... but I'll go for it...  Sheer madness that isn't sullied by bad acting or laughable lines. A  blockbuster that is gritty and doesn't have a sense of humour that  could be equated to a fluffy kitten. No 'lets all hug' sentimental BS.  This is seriously a movie I thought I'd never see: a CGI-filled  blockbuster that I flat out loved. The stunts are so much fun, the FX  so great, it is the first movie I have seen where I have thoroughly  enjoyed all this type of stuff - probably because the cinematography  for once doesn't suffer cos of it. It is all incredibly shot.  The action is so brutal and appropriately high-octane. I thought to  myself more than once, 'I think I am loving this more than Terminator  2' but other than that, there wasn't time to think. It kicked off fast  and barely stopped, and the lulls were amplified by the insanity  preceding them. Plus it is a dark film, which made it even better. I  many people do an Aussie accent even close to well, was Hardy actually  trying for that? Either way, he didn't talk much so it didn't really  matter. This is more Theron's movie than Hardy's, he doesn't say much  and does next to nothing for the first third or so. Theron's Furiosa is  more of the hero is the story, if there were to be a hero in such a  grisly and dark world.  I don't even like this type of movie but the execution is  everything. I'm gonna go see this again, soon. 4.5/5",False
16,10,One of the greatest action films,0U,n/a,15/08/2025,"George Miller elevates action and violence to a true art form in this remake of a classic. The film is a gripping full adrenaline race across the desert of a post-apocalyptic future. The action sequences are mesmerizing and the work of a true master craftsman in action. What is perhaps the most enthralling part of the film is the absolutely absurd story and world building. Miller created a fantasy world where men playing flame throwing guitars and leaping through high speed chases on pull-vaults seems like a typical milk run. The movie keeps a relentless action pace that makes all of the absurdity seem so completely ordinary, which might be the real magic of this movie. This is only really possible because the action, filmography, set choices and music are so brilliant you cannot help but believe the insanity that plays out before you. You want to believe the fiction because of the quality of the production. The movie also features some surprisingly good performances. Charlize Theron being the real the star of the film, with the titular character really only acting as her support.",False
17,10,A masterpiece on a massive scale.,sukhmanjitcheema,n/a,15/08/2025,"George Miller returns with a bang and takes the helm of this crazy 2hr bonkers extravaganza named Mad Max: Fury Road. First of all, the stunts and action sequences are SPECTACULAR. Tom Hardy breaths life into Max Rockatansky and Charlize Theron is excellent and emotionally perfect as Furiosa. The story opens, with Immortan Joe who has young ladies as his wives, but he'll goes down when they escape the sadist's hands. Max, who has a violent past with Joe's cronies, decides to help Imperior Furiosa take the girls somewhere safe. Furiosa can't trust Max, and neither can he. So it all comes down to Joe's cronies fighting against them reaching to their destination. The movie is a bananas car chase for the runtime, as Max and Furiosa work together to fight against the evils. And then, there is Nux, a bonkers ""really skin coloured"" guy, who works with Joe, played well by Nicholas Hoult. The 3D really pays off, and is worth the extra ticket. The movie puts all other action movies of shame, the effects really pop out. Well, this is a definite masterpiece. One of the best movies of the year, one of the best action movies ever made and the role of Theron's life. Miller is truly a mastermind as stated clearly in the trailer. This exceeded my expectations, and will exceed yours as well. The dark style, dark comedy and the over the top characters make a return in this reboot. Must watch, and worth the extra IMAX 3D ticket.",False
18,10,Great non-stop action,leotfoster,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great film, so fast-paced it makes every other film out there look slow and old-fashioned. Wonderful to see George Miller back on the Australian road, where he belongs. Charlize Theron is great, Tom Hardy is not bad, but the stunts are really where the film shines. It's hard to think of a better action road movie. It has all the intensity and perversity of the MAD MAX and THE ROAD WARRIOR, but amped up to new heights of craziness. Miller is the real star of the film -- in some ways technology seems to have finally caught up with his early hyperactive camera style, and he takes full advantage of the ability to move wherever he wants, however he wants.",False
19,9,Dark Yet Visually Exhilarating. Beautifully Brutal and Yet Still Visceral,prospectus_capricornium,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEven at the beginning, there's no hint MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is going to a stop. Right at the very start, the engines are already rewing, gathering furious fires of vengeance and redemption, and before the audience could snap out of the sheer moments of brutal grittiness and exhilarating high-octane drama, they are surely already held hostage within the confines of a post-apocalyptic world, where everything is horrendously scarce. Not that it's a bad thing, no it's not. I tell you, this is like being hurled into the space in a roller-coaster ride. It's dangerous, but it's also thrilling. Witnessing this dystopic world and all its hellish drama unfold might make you grope for seatbelt under your seat.The film shares Max Rockatansky's (Tom Hardy) adventures. Max is an ex highway patrolman. He's been haunted by the past, by family he never saved. He meets the Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who is being pursued by the dictatorial Wasteland leader ""Joe"". Furiosa reaches for Max for help in keeping the 'Five Wives'—women she brought with her—into safety, as Joe's deranged breed of warriors called The War Boys, that are barely humans, are raging across the desert to capture them. This pursuit throws the unlikely partners into the whalloping dangers of bloody escape, suddenly sending them into a game of survival.After a rip-roaring opening chase sequence, Max is held captive in the Citadel, the city where the ruthlessly totalitarian leader ""Joe"" is ruling over. The grotesquely brutal lord maintains tight grip of every valuable resouces across the land. This brings the entire populace crippling under his control. As for Max, he becomes merely a blood bag for Nux (Nick Hoult) one of Joe's War Boys, who is a fatal devout to the cause of their fascist leader, who has promised them the glory of getting into Valhalla, the promised land.Everything in this cinematic behemoth screams grandeur, even the feverish chase, even the dark erubescents spurred from the ruthless violence. Miller has molded a world where darkness is an escape from the stream of clichés and retreads, surging into the cinemas, today. It's a visual feast, but surprisingly, with sense. It's explosive in every unimaginable ways, but it's not devoid of a human story, which in this case, is propelled by stellar performances from incredible actors on the movie's payroll. Tom Hardy is utterly capable as the main hero, but the emotional spine of the narrative mostly runs on Theron's character. At some point, there would be a sense that Max isn't the only one playing under the spotlight, as it gets evident Furiosa is equally as massive as his role is. Hardy here is singularly stunning, playing his role with utmost credibility as he is required. His mission transcends past his emotional torments and he's never pulled himself free from the ghosts if his past. Same can be said with Furiosa, who is not only running from Joe because she wants to get herself free from his cut throat grip, but also to bring every woman into safety, back to freedom where they belong.Much of the movie is spent with furious speed chases that goes from end to end of Joe's subjugated land, while also taking surprising twists and turns along the way. It's like it doesn't know how to stop, and if it does, that's surely only to allow us breathe and catch up with the next electrifying action setpiece. There's an enigmatic style Miller has employed to provide distinctions in his fantasy world, and it keeps the momentum in tack, if not ever progressing. The tone of the movie, all those vividly dark colors, that magically shifts from something to another, imparts a drowning experience, only it's enjoying and looks festive to the eyes. This makes every eye-squashing spectacles take mammoth forms of visual extravaganza, turning all those burning combustions, metal blasts, and endless pursuits, from mere technical marvels into a hair-raising escapade.Amid these sanity-grabbing action sequences, though, is an emotional streak that keeps Max and Furiousa's humanity alive. This prompts them to survival, into carrying out their similar humane causes, clinging tightly to their only mission even if they get hurled into the barbaric hostilities of their dystopian society. This turns the movie into something visceral, cathartic in some ways that probably only a small fraction of the audience could understand. It will not be enough to merit this achievement with merely a splurge of superlatives. This needs to be experienced, felt, and forever cherished. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, ignites eternal fire, and it will keep burning through the stretches of cinematic history.",True
20,10,Response to punishable by death''s review,tannerbrown-97210,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yo punishable by death just letting you know that this movie was shot using 80% practical effects and that's a fact on this web page so you're completely wrong when you say that it's full of cgi. But anyway this movie is a real crazy ride. From the very beginning it takes you straight into the action and never lets go. This movie is so incredibly filmed and the stunts are performed marvelously. Although this movie is said to star Tom hardy and Charlize Theron, the real star here is George miller. This man created a masterpiece and it was so beautifully put together. He managed to show the chaos and urgency without the constant shaky camera crap that we see out of action movies now. This is the best pure action movie that I've ever seen.",False
21,6,So overrated,mattdjoyce,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is all spectacle and all action. It has next to no story, no plot, no character...apparently there was no script, just storyboards...which makes sense, it's like watching one non stop story boarded action sequence...it's relentless in that regard. Are the action sequences masterfully done? Sure, they're incredible...but there's so much more that goes into making a good film. It's as if critics and audiences were just looking at one aspect of the film and then dishing out a 9/10 which to me is crazy. Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron also could have been anyone, anyone could have played those roles, all the characters are basically mute.",False
22,10,"""My name is Max, My world is fire and blood.""",michaelsharples96,n/a,15/08/2025,"'Mad Max: Fury Road' is the 4th installment in mastermind, George Miller's insane post apocalyptic journey. Starring Charlize Theron (Monster, Hancock) Tom Hardy (The Dark Knight Rises) Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy) and (Hugh Kaeys-Byrn) as the movies villain Immortan Joe.Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is assigned to a mission. The mission is to drive the war rig and go through to the next town and siphon gasoline. Furiosa ends up double crossing Immortan Joe and stealing his 5 wives to take them back to her homeland where they can be safe. Along side her is Max, a man of action and very few words. Together they must fight trough hordes of enemies in what is basically a 2 hour long, high speed chase.I have been waiting since I heard about the green lighting of this movie back in 2009. I have been waiting for almost 6 years for this thing. My hype was high, I wasn't sure it would live up to my expectations. Well I am here to tell you that it did. It lived up to the hype, AND THEN SOME. This movie is absolutely, 1000% insane. What you saw in the trailers wasn't even close to the level of crazy that goes down in this movie. You know this movie is pretty much just all out, balls to the wall action, so if you think the trailers maybe showed off a little too much. You couldn't be more wrong.The stunt work is choreographed and directed to perfection, it is the most well crafted and stunning movie I've ever seen and will probably ever see, which is kind of the norm and what to expect with a George Miller movie. There's explosions going off everywhere, cars blowing up left, right and center, people being killed and blown to shreds. But none of it is convoluted, it all streams together perfectly, you know what is happening, when it happens. The fact that pretty much 90% of this movie is all practical effects and all stunt work is mind blowing. The cars that explode, that's happening. People bouncing from one side to the other on long poles at 60mph, picking people up and flying then back across, that's going down, too. Too many blockbusters these days are filled with CGI. And even with limitless amounts of stuff you can do with all of that. NONE of it even is even comparable to the action in this movie. The crap that goes down here, other movies couldn't even dream to aspire towards such a spectacle.People complain that there's not much of a story, they wanted more. Well I gotta tell you, the story is just what it needs. For something to be great it doesn't need to be a vibrant cohesive piece of art. The story is very simple, and the simplicity of it is what makes it great. There's enough story to keep you paying attention to it and not just going in for explosions. Not to mention that It's not driven through its narrative or its dialog. It's driven by its characters and its action. To which people also said they were underdeveloped and weren't written very well, from my stand point they absolutely were.The character of Nux (Nicholas Hoult) was developed amazingly well, I didn't really expect to see much from him but he really became his own in this movie. He was developed enough to make you care, he was written to be understandable in his actions and he was by far, for me, one of the best things about the movie. Furiosa was also developed just enough to make you feel something for her character. She's one of the only good left in a world full of bad. What Miller does in this movie is make characters that not only do you are for but are also incredibly likable and super bad ass. Max wasn't developed as much as some of the others but let's face it. If you've watched the older ones (which I recommend you do) There really isn't much to him. He's a man that's had everything taken from him and he has nothing left to lose. All he wants is to be left in peace. That's all he's every been and that's all he wants to carry on being.What I also love about this movie is that the lead character is a woman. Hollywood these days are always depicting women who need a man take care of them. That they can't live without men. That is DEFINITELY not the case with this movie. Furiosa is fierce, she's skilled, she's unpredictable and she's all out bad ass. This is a testosterone filled movie but it's not the testosterone that takes charge.Action movies these days aren't normally as good as one of the reasons being is that the hero is never really in any really danger. If he's never in danger or near death how can you possible expect to have your audience on the edge of their seats. Pondering what if the inevitable happened. Max was in peril SO MANY TIMES in this film. There was at least 10 times where I thought ""this is the end, he's going to die"" then he miraculously gets out of it. But it's not the cliché type when someone luckily comes along at the last moment and saves him. Believe me there aren't many, if any clichés in this movie. He fights his way out of these death defying situations. Furiosa out other lead is also in life threatening situations throughout this movie. Many times where we wouldn't know if she would make it.If you don't see Mad Max: Fury Road in the theaters then you are missing out. I went in IMAX and I can tell you it was worth every goddamn penny. Papa want a sequel",False
23,7,It's a whole lot of style and not much substance,cutesd,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI realize a lot of people will disagree with me ... but personally ... I don't like movies that leave me scratching my head with a lot of questions at the end. I prefer to ... you know ... understand the movies I'm watching.Now we get from the film that the world as we know it has ended. They are fighting over gasoline and are running out of water. There's this guy Max who used to be a cop who has become a drifter trying to survive. There's this guy Immortan Joe who is really scary, clearly has health issues, and is bogarting all the water from the people. He's got a bunch of blood sucking kids dressed as skeletons who are his lackeys ... and he keeps a harem of women against their will (gross).Furiosa grew up in a ""green"" place with a bunch of other women ... was taken by Joe when she was young. She wants to get back there and the ""breeders"" beg her to take them. And the film is basically them trying to get away from Joe who is trying to get them back. As plots go ... it's extremely basic.But that is it ... that's all we know and it's all we find out (except that the green place is gone). There are a lot of MENTIONS of things that never actually get explained AND THIS IS MY PROBLEM.Who is Immortan Joe?
Why does he look like that?
How did he wind up controlling all the water?
Why are they drinking breast milk?
Why are the boys called ""half-lives"" and dressed like skeletons?
Why do they need ""blood bags""?
What is with the silver teeth thing?
What is all this Valhalla, shiny, chrome, what?
Why do they have a vehicle that spits fire with a dude playing electric guitar on it?
How did Furiosa lose her arm?
Who was Furiosa to Joe?
WHO DID KILL THE WORLD? (they keep asking and it never gets answered even a little bit)I had to look it up ... and I hate when movies don't explain things to the point where I have to look them up. That's what is called BAD STORYTELLING.I won't spoil it by telling you what was there but there is SO MUCH CRAZY INFORMATION that the movie just left out to make room for more fighting and chase scenes. This movie is 2 hours long and they couldn't fit any more story into it?Sorry guys ... that's some bad bad writing.",True
24,1,Oh dear,kirwanj-89759,n/a,15/08/2025,Utter garbage. No plot spoilers because there is no plot. Why is this film so highly regarded? Production design and stunts are great but this doesn't make it a great film. Sad,False
25,10,Exactly what it needed to be.,phil-79572,n/a,15/08/2025,"Complicated hero who is easy to latch onto. Fantastic plot that is plausible in this environment. Terrifying nemesis, horrifying and relentless. Non-stop action and brilliant stunt sequences that will make you cringe. This movie will have you feeling parched and gritty. Usually Not a fan of 3d - however, it works perfectly here. This movie has managed to honor the previous films without being clunky about it. if you love mutant vehicles, art cars, burning man, etc. you will be satisfied. A few scenes that were taking place in cobbled together 1000 hp vehicles at 50mph where it was quieter inside than a modern Cadillac - the absence of the din of machinery for the sake of dialogue was the only thing that bothered me.",False

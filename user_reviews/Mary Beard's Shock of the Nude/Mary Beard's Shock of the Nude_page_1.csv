1,2,"Disappointing - could have been informing, but was otherwise.",vincentwadsworth,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMe and a female friend watched this independently. I texted her part way through and we agreed exactly the same points; dull and really off subject re the nude. The only bit that started to go anywhere was the section about The Origin of the World painting, but that was short lived. We never know what lies on the the cutting room floor, but I don't think the nude is her subject at all. It would only be disappointing if it was only a mis-fire, but I think she let the subject down completely with the tittering women and the life model as sexual objectified hen night, followed by excessively large flaccid penises in paintings. Thanks, but no thanks for screwing all over the subject! Ok, at best, as a an apologist for Mary Beard, it was two fingers at those who complain about an old woman presenting historic documentary, but really, did she really have to reduce life drawing and the presentation of the nude as titillation? If you want to learn about the nude, look somewhere else, unless you want to see how it's done badly and to the detriment of the subject. Sad.",True
2,2,Art or something else?,aarjunp,n/a,15/08/2025,Basically she's tries to convince that all female nude art was made to satisfy men ( calls it porn of the middle ages) Her thoughts are pretty narrow-minded and comes from the frustration that men dominated society back in the day and most painters and artists were men.She criticizes the views of people who enjoy art and it's beauty and says that people have tried to clean up the graphic nature of art by giving them names which appreciate the beauty of it rather than calling them as she wants them with graphic names.I expected the show to be more off showing what the artist life was and how they depicted the characters that they painted or sculpted. But it is just basically a show about her views on art.,False

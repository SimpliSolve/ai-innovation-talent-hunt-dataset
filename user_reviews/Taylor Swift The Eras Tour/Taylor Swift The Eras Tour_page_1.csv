1,9,"Kind of hard to review this one, but yeah, I see the hype",ryanpersaud-59415,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife is an ENORMOUS Taylor Swift fan and we've been trying to get tickets to see this concert for months. Suffice to say, when tens of millions of people across Canada are also trying, it's not very easy. Taking her to see this was a treat, even if our theatre was kind of quiet and lame. We genuinely expected more of a concert vibe, but unfortunately, even the amazing staff at our cinema, who tried their hardest to hype people up, couldn't do it.To say that this concert really fits the cinematic experience would be an understatement. You don't have to love TS (although, 17 years of making music, there has to be a couple songs you know...admit it), but this concert does a phenomenal job of showcasing what makes her special. The sets, the outfits, the distinct visual and sonic style of the Eras...let's just say, the whole room shimmers.Taylor is an incredible performer and has amazing stage presence. She simultaneously feels like a a girl sitting on the bleachers and trouble as soon as she walks in. Her outfits gleam in the Los Angeles night and she commands the room in a way few artists do. For the film specifically, the cinematography is honestly fantastic and not only makes you feel as it you're on stage with her, but allows you take in the enormity of the moment tooDon't what else to say, if you're a Swifty, you belong in a theatre watching this thing. If you're not, you'll be enchanted to meet her.(And yes, this concert did what all great concerts do. Make you appreciate the artist even more. I'm a soft Swifty now.)",False
2,8,I was not a fan until...,DanMovieReview,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just to give you an idea from where I came from to write this review: I'm a head banger. I'm an Iron Maiden, Death, Kreator fan. I like heavy rift, yealling and impressive guitar solos...Yet, I had a very good time enjoying this concert film. It is technically speaking the best concert show I've ever watched. Very good sound editing and camera angle shot. The movie is very immersive and provided the viewer with a unique up close point of view that uou would not get other wise.As for the music, Taylor Swift have a wide range of musical genre that can please a lot of different group. She is a top notch performer that never missed a beat or a note.And most importantly, she know what her fans want and she give them exactly that.",False
3,9,"A newer, better and cheaper way to enjoy a concert",Avwillfan89,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not only were Swift's tickets expensive as hell (700+ for a VIP. What?) but I would have had to travel to a different city and stay the night in a hotel to see the concert.Not worth it.So I was really pleased when Swift announced a movie of her 3 hour long concert for theaters.And boy was this amazing.The sets, the costumes, the lighting, the props and the videos were absolutely sublime and gorgeous to look at. The dancers and the backup singers gave it their all in their choreography and singing.And then there's Taylor herself.Her goofy, lovable personality was on full display, as well as her prowess and blooming confidence as she strutted the stage in hella sparkly costumes crooning out all of her best hits from all her albums.Had I been there, no doubt my bank account would have been empty and I would have ended up being squeezed with a bunch of Swifties, barely catching a glimpse of the songstress. Instead, the camera focuses lovingly on Taylor from all angles throughout the show. And no extra charge for a pair of glasses. Plus I giggled as the ardent Swifties in the cinema got up from their seats to dance and form circles in front of their beloved.Great choice to film and to share it in the cinema. :)",False
4,10,Blown away,randalford,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'd never really paid attention to Taylor Swift until I saw a documentary about the album she recorded during the pandemic. Her thoughtfulness and talent were a revelation.And then ... I watched this! Just an amazing display of talent by everyone involved. The stage production had, for me, the same feeling as evoked by those amazing opening night spectacles they always put on at the Olympics.I utterly enjoyed the whole film and never felt impatient for the entire 3 hours (in itself an accomplishment!) The music everyone else seems to have memorized was mostly brand-new to me, and thoroughly enjoyable. What a musician and lyricist!In short: Taylor Swift blew me away.",False
5,10,The most fun I've had in a theater in my 60 years!,robby77777,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't know what to expect as I am an older guy out on a date with my wife. We first noted that every girl was dressed up and was just so happy. When the film started, there was an excitement I've never experienced. Everyone was so happy. The film started and we soon realized this would be different than anything we've experienced. As soon as the music started, every girl in the theater started to sing. And, I mean sing loud. We looked at each other and wondered if it was just the first song. Nope. It wasn't the first song as it would be every single song after that. I've never experienced anything like this in a theater. It was so much fun and highly recommended.",False
6,9,"Spectacular sets, choreography, music and cinimatography",wlb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am hardly what I would consider to be in the ""Taylor Swift"" demographic. A man past 70. But a female friend of mine liked it, and I like music so I went to see it tonight.This is called the ""Eras Tour"" because the 3 hour show is divided into the various eras of her songwriting, with different stage sets and dress for each ""era"".I read a few weeks ago, in the WSJ of all places, a bit about her tour - requiring 50 semis to carry all of the stage equipment from city to city. I was thinking just of the logistics and of all the people ""behind the scenes"" who put all of this together.When you see the show, you wonder how they could do all of this in 50 trucks.This was filmed at the last stop of her tour, the Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, CA.It was sold out.The visuals are spectacular, the costumes, sets, and of course her music.And you are right on stage with her.It isn't simply a recording of the show with 2 or 3 cameras angles but a very well thought out production and with a mystery to me, not an external camera in sight as you see various angles of the massive stage.Very well done in all respects.",False
7,10,"Taylor Swift - Phenomenal Performer, Businesswoman, & Human Being",Gleek4eva,n/a,16/08/2025,"I got the luxury of seeing this beautifully produced film of Taylor's Eras Tour on opening night at the Big Mo Drive-In Theater (Monetta, South Carolina). Taylor did not fly in on a helicopter, but emotionally, I felt like she did! It was packed with Swifties & other people from all walks of life. It started out and people were screaming and clapping as if it were the actual concert. The movie itself had effortless transitions and preserved the beauty throughout the concert. I am a trained opera singer with a degree in Vocal Performance (I even have perfect pitch) , and I am here to say that Taylor sang with marvelous pitch, technique, resonance, and stage presence throughout the concert film. Her entire team of singers & dancers were great, as well, and I mean phenomenally great! The actors featured in her story songs in Folklore and Evermore were amazing, as well! In my opinion, there weren't any weak points in the entire movie. Her mini-speeches beautifully connected the songs when she chose to add them in, her outfits were gorgeous, & her live performances of HER music was unmatched. Is it too early to say it was timeless? ;)",False

She has a know-how, she has a Brightness or Likeability to her Facial Expressions, also her Physiognomy coupled with her own added personal Face Mannerisms and Look Mannerisms adds more to her. She also has this certain type of Elegance about her that adds to her Singular Ability to pull off what she does and how she does it.

9,8,"Good, but not great",themanford,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off, I want to say I went to the Eras Tour in Los Angeles on night four, right after a the filming of this movie. It was awesome! By far the most fun I've ever had at a concert. So I was glad to hear the movie of this show was coming sooner than expected. That's where I think they went wrong. The grand scale of this show wasn't showcased in this movie. There were too many closeups of Taylor and not enough wide shots of the stage sets and the stadium/crowd. The sound was good, but honestly I thought it could have been better. I just don't think the production had enough time to properly mix the audio. I thought the Reputation All Stadium Tour film was really good, and with all the hype surrounding this epic tour, a little more time editing of this film could have made it even better. My hope is that there will eventually be a Directors cut, or maybe a Taylor cut that includes all the songs, including the surprise songs in the future. I'm sorry if this sounds like I'm putting down the production, I am not. With the time they had, I'm sure it's the best they could do. Great job though, recording a live 3-1/2 hour show and editing out all the cameras must have taken up most of the time because on first viewing I didn't see a single camera. I can't wait to see this again at home and enjoy the Eras Tour for many years to come.",True
10,7,Impressive,marcobrcc,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am not a Taylor Swift fan, but I was curious to watch this given the high ratings. I went in without expectations and was greatly impressed by the concert, quality of camera work, costumes, set design, and impressive level of crowd participation. For a concert film, the production value is spectacular and credit is due to the excellent direction by Sam Wrench. The dancers here are really talented and she surely is a great live performer. Highly recommended even if you may not consider yourself a Swift enthusiast.There were a few standout moments for me in terms of songs. Anti-Hero had the best songwriting on display, objectively. Love Story is definitely a good song even if she was tonally flat for a good portion of it. Cruel Summer is a great track. She tapped into something nice there.However, I can't help but find that her lyrics come across as somewhat corny, often incredibly basic, and her performance feels sometimes unauthentic, never reachinhg greatness. She's having trouble hitting vocal notes for someone who's supposed to be the most powerful pop star right now. Kudos for not using live Autotune, though, like most artists out there right now, or lip-syncing to her own backing tracks.Set rankings:1) Anti-Hero
2) Cruel Summer
3) We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
4) Love Story.",False

12,7,"Even those who aren't fans of Taylor Swift, this concert movie is still a really fun to watch",peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a whole, it was a good watch.It's a fun concert movie with great production, camerawork and fun musical performances and acts from Taylor Swift. I am not a fan of Taylor Swift but growing up, I had enjoyed quite a few songs from her. Especially with her songs ""22, Bad Blood, Style, and Love Story"" I really liked. The production sets, colors, and the camerawork is insanely colorful and demonstrates the big energy and atmosphere presented. I did enjoy that the concert had some creative moments with its structures as the sets, dancers, melody and tone were like telling a form of theme and narrative.Since I haven't been following Swift's recent works, many of the new songs were a mix of some I really liked listening to and some I didn't really like much. Though some of her older songs have brought some nostalgic vibes back. The sound mixing from the audio and music is amazing to which it helps create if you are at the concert. The dancers all provide good energy and feel to the environment though admittedly some of the dancers movements and expressions were slightly cringey at times.Overall, it's a good concert movie that fans will enjoy and good for music lovers to have some fun.",False
13,4,Genuinely mediocre,trevormdm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a big Taylor Swift fan, but from a film perspective, ""The Eras Tour"" lacked in so much. The cinematography felt so uninspired for the majority of the movie. The db levels in most of the film were all over the place and apparently it was a problem with the way the film's music had been mixed. Most of the film was so slow. I felt like I was just trudging through the pacing the entire time. I understand it's rare to make a great film based on a musician's tour or album as a general plot/documentary based, but even yet I had such a hard time just sitting trying to ""enjoy"" it. Musicially, of course the Eras is less original than her other work like ""Speak Now.""Overall, it was decent. Not horrible, but horribly underwhelming.4/10.",False
14,10,Long live...Miss Americana,Boristhemoggy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taylor Swift is probably the best artist in the world and I can't see her being beaten anytime soon. I do believe that I have just watched the greatest show ever made.It's fine if you are not a fan of pop music, or blondes, or women, or indeed just her. But no-one can deny that her shows are superlative.The Eras final US stage show opens with an aerial view of the 100,000 seat SoFi stadium in Los Angeles, and the camera dips to enter the stadium and show a packed out venue, with a stage almost half the length of the stadium field. The entire stage is also made up of hundreds of screens. Throughout this several minute long sequence Taylor can be heard voicing titles and song lyrics and statements, all designed to build up to the start of the show.Every person has a ticket on a lanyard which can light up and they are all controlled by the musical director. They also have armbands which light up too, and flash with the music. About 80,000 of these lights make the stadium look like a clear, starry night.Enormous, 5 metre tall butterfly wings enter the stage in front of the enormous screen, flowing gracefully all the way to the far end where they seem to gently float down to a pile on the stage floor. Ethereal music with hints of Swift tracks plays as these gossamer wings finally settle to the floor, then rise quickly to reveal Taylor, in a trademark sparkly outfit, who moves immediately into the song Miss Americana and the Heartbreak Prince.The crowd of course erupt with cheers as she appears and thus starts 3 solid hours of spectacular showmanship the like of which I've never, ever seen. She sucks the audience in during a 17 minute introduction to the tour show, with some fabulous tracks and beautiful imagery and non stop energy before she even says hello. By the time she properly greets them, they are all one and tuned into her and the entire stadium including security and venue staff are all in one organic pleasure orgy based around Swift's personality and music.As a way of introducing one of the songs Taylor shows that she can control 70,000 simply by pointing a finger, and long time fans like me know after a few moments what she is referencing. It's her way of leading into a particularly track.The scenes and sets backed up by hundreds of enormous screens, lights and special effects are beautifully done and are worthy of the best sets Hollywood has to offer. The entire concert is worth watching just for the scenes created, and the costumes that they all wear which suit the songs and the scenes. The production value is out of this world. If you watch her backing singers, dancers and other staff during the film, you see a dedicated bunch of guys, highly experienced and rehearsed, all ensuring that their part in the night also goes smoothly.Taylor's superpower, apart from being a beautiful human being that is so approachable, is in creating images in your head with lyrics. She has done if for years for me and sometimes I wish I could see a film based on some of the scenes she makes me imagine while listening to her music.Taking the freedom to produce her own show, she makes a lot of those images come to life for us, bigger and better perhaps than we could have thought of. Your mind is allowed to run amok as she almost seems to free you of earthly ties simply by singing and showing you her colourful, energetic, surreal world. All the familiar tracks are there, and Taylor moves effortlessly from pop, to rock, to folk, to hiphop, to country and back to rock with such ease that you think there are no genres anymore. Taylor Swift has made all genres merge into 1 giant super-music genre labelled Swiftish.She interacts personally with her fans, she interacts regularly with her backup singers and dancers and musicians. She has no God complex, she has humility and knows that she is part of an unstoppable musical machine, but one which relies on others to help it along. And she humbly thanks us, the fans, for letting her do this. Letting her reach our very hearts and souls with love and anger and joy and sadness and thoughtfulness, in a unique and beautiful way.She makes sure every person attending can see her and hear her, and although she is dancing as well as singing for a solid 4 hours, she barely misses a beat, constantly smiles at her audience, and puts everything she has into singing the songs -not just repeating lyrics musically like a lot of artists do- but actually singing them and putting the appropriate feeling into the lyrics so that her singing matches the meaning of the words. Another thing that not many artists do.Taylor covers songs from each of her albums, hence the name 'Eras tour' so any fan at any point of fandom can enjoy something. She absolutely slayed All Too Well, one of her best songs along with 'Long Live'. And yet even her very early songs all seem just as relevant as her latest ones. Such is the power of her storytelling.Barely breaking sweat she travels the length of the stage many times and even at one point shocks the crowd by seemingly diving off stage into a 100 metre long pool and swimming to the far end so she can leave the set to get changed. The 4 hours of all of her past hits from the present to her first song passes by far, far too quickly: I could happily have sat for another 4 hours listening to and watching this amazing force of nature.Throughout the entire show she commands the stage, and controls the audience, leading them willingly into pleasure and joy in her own inimitable way. She proved that simply by pointing a finger she can control thousands of people at a time, and they love her doing it because she is one of them. Indeed the big studios turned their noses up at her idea of having a filmed grand tour. I bet they're regretting it now that she followed her instincts for what her fans want and did it anyway, for them.Taylor Swift, despite her flaws and wholesome humility, has become a living legend, easily witnessed by her rise to super stardom and the unwavering passion of her fans: men and women, old and young. And I believe that she has changed not just music, and not just showmanship forever, but also taught us what it's like to be a great human.I give this show my first ever 10, and I'd give it more if I could.",False
15,10,The Magnificent Tour,madoricco,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seems odd to say, given that it's just a ""concert,"" but this was one of the most exciting and thrilling cinematic experiences of the year. It has the remarkable ability to capture the viewer, making them feel as if they are at a real-life concert. The direction was superb, the editing was poignant, and the camera shots were exceptional. It's truly one of the most breathtaking live concerts ever, a genuine masterpiece designed to entertain and get the audience dancing and singing in a crowded room. Even those who aren't Swifties loved every single moment of this work. Taylor Swift once again proved her dominance in the music industry. She is the music industry.",False
16,10,"Such a fun, incredible experience",parksiet,n/a,16/08/2025,"No one does it quite like Taylor Swift!The Eras Tour movie was an incredible experience! Sure, we didn't get to see the concert live... but this was very much the next best thing (especially in IMAX with a large crowd of excited, passionate Swifties)! It made for such a fun, truly impressive experience! It's truly a spectacular achievement in terms of cinematography, editing and sound for a concert film - it's really something special to treasure forever. I would even say this is likely the greatest concert film ever made... due to both the insane production value of the show, and the impressive work put in to film it all! Some of the shots/coverage they got blew me away, and the sound was excellent! They did such a good job of making you feel like you were there, feeling the energy and emotion of every song along with the crowd at SoFi stadium! It's infectious, and my god is it ever so exhilarating to experience with a full theatre of fans!But nothing would have made this experience what it is if it wasn't for Taylor Swift herself, who enchants with talent, charisma, grace and stamina to carry such a long event like it was the easiest and most natural thing! She puts on a show that can feel intimate even in a stadium setting. Swift has a way of making every viewer feel like she's personally performing for them whether they are sitting in the back row of a stadium or in a movie theatre. This is possibly the most famous performer in the world, but she engages her audience with humility. She's such a talented performer and put together one of the most elaborate and stunning concerts I've ever seen.My favourite eras during the concert: Lover, Red, 1989 and especially Reputation!Excellent vibes, unparalleled cinematic experience for a concert. It's a must see in IMAX!Only problem is it made me want to see this show live even more...",False

And in between? Christian Louboutins, incredible bass in IMAX, and some very emotional moments with Cruel Summer, champagne problems, and marjorie.The audience was respectful! Sang and danced in their seats but, mostly, no scream-singing or standing and blocking views.Stay around for the end credits. Taylor cut the live performance of Long Live (one of my faves) but it plays over the credits and it def brings tears. Plus the bloopers/wardrobe malfunctions...You're on your own kid.

18,9,"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (2023, Sam Wrench) It is Taylor's world... we just live in it, and bask in her glory",hoernkeem,n/a,16/08/2025,"Eric's Grade: A-
It is times like this I feel it is Taylor Swift's world, and we are all just living in it. Taylor Swift is a household name and a musical and pop culture icon, and that was before 2023. In 2023 the already popular musical artist entered the stratosphere with her Eras Tour which became cultural touchstones and economic booms to every city she visited. She would go on to exert influence on professional sports with her romance with Kansas City Chiefs' football player Travis Kelce, and even go on to be named Time's Person of the Year. The Eras Tour is set to stretch to the end of 2024, but on the heels of the American leg of the tour Swift produced a concert film so all those who were not able to bathe in her glory live could do so in an AMC theater of their choice or later on Disney+. Not only was her concert world altering, but she completely rocked the film industry with her unique distribution of the film. Swift basically forsook partnering with studios instead partnering with AMC to distribute the film directly to them. It quickly became the highest grossing concert film of all time. Predictably a bidding war ensued for the streaming rights to the film as well which would be ultimately won by Disney+ where the film was finally released in March of 2024.The concert film itself, directed by Sam Wrench, was filmed at the three shows at Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, California. I watched ""Taylor's Version"" on Disney+ which took the just under 3-hour film and beefed it up to 3 ¬Ω hours with some additional performances. Despite the enormous runtime the concert flowed extremely smoothly and is a dazzling spectacle to behold as the superb production value, amazing sets, visuals and costuming all combine with amazing performances from Swift and her fellow singers and dancers. The concept of the Eras Tour itself is a stupendous idea as each album/era of Swift's gets its own section in the show each with their own lavish and distinctive production design. It is a marvel to behold cementing Taylor Swift's hold on the pop culture zeitgeist. I feel at this stage people fall into a few varying camps when it comes to Taylor and this inflated success. On one hand there are die hard Swifties which are legion and have clearly let their voice be heard over the course of 2023. There are also those like me who are far from the rabid fan base, but enjoy Taylor enough to kick back and crush a bottle of wine on the couch while enjoying all the Eras Tour has to offer, and even perhaps singing along with a song or two as the wine leaks out of the bottle magically. Then there are the haters who roll their eyes because god forbid anything they don't appreciate be good or celebrated. Love her or hate her it is clear that Taylor Swift is at the top of her game and is one of the few artists in the world with insanely global reach and appeal. 'The Eras Tour' concert film is an amazing celebration of her musical career and massive appeal, and while nothing lasts forever, right now Taylor is clearly the name at the top of pop culture pyramid, and if she plays her cards right could be there for some time to come.",False
19,10,Brilliant,kaitlynmurray-49086,n/a,16/08/2025,Amazing. Engulfing. Just shear brilliance. I have not shed so many tears with pure musical genius ever. She is a one of a kind. Would recommend to any and everyone. She is one of a kind and born to create this content. She takes you through each era of her career and shows you her progression and her adaptation and exploration. I enjoyed every second even with songs I wasn't as familiar with. She is an inspiration for people all over of what a truly pure and committed artist is to their craft.

20,6,Really fun and entertaining experience.,jdevilliers-43224,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was singing, dancing and jumping up and down while watching this journey of music . A film for all fans who did not have the chance to see this magical tour live. This spectacular is not going to be for everyone .

If you are not such a big fan of hers but want to see what the hype is all about , I recommend having a friend who is a fan. I promise that they will make your time so much better .

21,10,One of if not the best concert films out there,bspbczb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie it's not an actual movie it's just a concert film BUT for the people who COULDNT make ticketmasters $1,400 + price per ticket this is a great way to experience the concert and support your local theater. Along with it being just fun people were trading friendship bracelets like the concert belting out the songs (which if you read into it they allow since Taylor wanted this to be a concert experience for people who couldn't attend in person) not to mention the staff telling us they're doubling the volume to get the actual concert experience is fun. My theater had a Taylor section for pictures and a bar with Taylor themed drinks. If you're a swiftie go for it. It's worth it. If you're not but like some of Taylor's music then go for it it's fun. If you're a grumy old man who can't handle people treating a film of a concert like a concert and enjoying their time stay home and leave everyone having fun alone. Be careful if you have epileptic issues as there are flashing lights that can and will cause seizures so go at your own discretion. It was totally worth it. The collectible cups the posters the pictures the fun I had with my friend and getting to experience the tour was so worth it. I'd go again and again. A real concert is fun but paying 50$ for 2 tickets vs 1k+ for 1 is a lot better of a deal. Glad I could go made my night. Thank you Taylor.",False
22,n/a,Worth watching!!!!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Taylor did a splendid job by dropping this film and I really loved the film. I've always wanted to be in her concert but this movie made me so happy that I actually felt like I was standing inside the crowd screaming. All the background singers and dancers made a fabulous job. The entire film is so energetic and felt so good. I would suggest this movie to all age group of people and family audience. This film breaks all the marks set by Hollywood and exceled. Taylor swift performing in a high pitch and all the colors with amazing albums make the film so satisfying. As a Swiftie I love this film and will watch multiple times.,False
23,7,A must see for dedicated Swift fans,kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I had the privilege of attending the grand opening of a new dine-in theater and were treated to a free viewing of Taylor Swift: The Era Tour (2023). The concert concept revolves around Taylor Swift's last ten albums, spanning over seventeen years, and her first post-COVID tour, where she strives to bring her entire discography to life for her fans.Directed by Sam Wrench, known for his work on music docuseries for artists like Lizzo, Billie Eilish, and Mumford & Sons. Notably, the use of drones adds a captivating dimension to the experience, and CGI enhances several performances. The backup dancers are impressive, representing a diverse mix of cultures, sizes, and personalities. The background stage design is nothing short of amazing, cleverly creating immersive settings. Taylor Swift's limited dancing abilities occasionally impact the choreography, with some hits and misses. The standout ""snake"" set was a highlight, while others fell short, especially when she wears awkward ensembles or engaged in less fluid movements with her hands or random skipping. Swift deserves credit for creating music that resonates with a particular demographic, capturing the essence of young girls singing into their hairbrushes while getting ready for school.In conclusion, Taylor Swift: The Era Tour exceeded my expectations. Swift's robust catalog allows her to explore diverse themes and emotions, despite occasional awkwardness in her appearance and movement. I would give this a 7/10 rating, but I recommend it primarily to dedicated Swift fans.",False

25,10,A Captivating Journey Through Music and Emotion,paulamartins-97943,n/a,16/08/2025,"The concert film was simply perfect, a highly immersive experience. And what an extraordinary singer! Deep lyrics, beautiful voice, fantastic visual effects, great dancers, great band, wonderful stage, and everything just perfect. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a minute, an experience far beyond a simple concert film. The transition of each ""era"" of her career makes everything very original and incredible. Taylor Swift is certainly one of the greatest singers of today and the best songwriter since The Beatles. It brings tears to my eyes, evokes very strong emotions. Everyone should see it someday.",False

1,8,Enjoyable but frustrating,ginjaninja-43907,n/a,16/08/2025,"These women complain about injustice and prejudice in the world but they cannot see how their own ideology that they cling to is completely unjust and bigoted. After studying Islam for a couple decades to hear the ignorance and hypocrisy spewed from them is so frustrating. And the propoganda that ISIS is not Islamic couldn't be further from the truth. Islam does permit slavery and trading slaves. It also Permits taking married female captives and having there way with them. They say no scholar would agree that this is Islamic. That's the problem, they don't do any independent research and just listen to the lies they are told. Read sura 4:24 and the tafsirs of al Jalalayn, IBN Kathie, IBN abbass and the Sahih Hadith when it was revealed. They are perpetual victims until they begin to educate themselves. How anyone would submit to something without investigating it first is beyond me. And If they change there mind the menalty for apostasy is death. Stay away from Islam.",False
2,9,Actions have consequences,medic061076,n/a,16/08/2025,"Eye opening how those who chose a way of life with their religion and looked to inflict their ethos now do the 180 and try the victim route to garner sympathy.Didn't worry them when killing innocent children through terrorist actions.Only remorse being shown is that they lost and now want forgiveness and all the words uttered is so fake and only being repeated because that's what they think will gain them their lives they so disposed and wanted shot of.It's a lesson to those who want to inflict their way of life on others that civilised society is about diversity and acceptance.Good riddance to the ditritus shown on the programme
You lost goodbye and live with your decision.",False
3,10,Documentary movie,ingamazonaite,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell, I think it's well made documentary.Topic of documentary is controversial and inviting for discussion.In my opinion, the government shouldn't removed citizenship, because I feel this is illegal to do. Wash hands instead of dealing with problem.I feel like young girls were brainwashed and really young and I think they deserves second chance. And theirs children, especially children, suffering without quilt on their own.I feel really sad for them and stupid choices they made.",True
4,1,Terrible,teamac-78231,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerAbsolutely terrible waste of the time ' made this to get sympathy try and get back into England.,True
5,10,An eye-opener and a heart-breaking true story,savetheearthplease,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, it's a great documentary which depicts the story from numerous angles. Well done!Second, the movie gives you a glimpse into the stories and minds of ISIS brides and, suprise-surprise, it's a typicall cult case. The stories of these women are really heart-breaking and I wish I could see them back home in the end, but, unfortunately, they might live in that camp until they die. That's a horrible punishment for believing fake news and online scammer, especially from democratic countries that experienced WWII firsthand.I promise this documentary will open your head.",True
6,10,Great documentary,t_moor,n/a,16/08/2025,"I strongly suggest to watch this documentary to understand what pushed these women into joining ISIL. Understandably, the Western governments are hesitant to bring in women and children, while some planning to bring children alone. However, it's sad that UK for instance is paying to keep children in Guantanamo-style camps in Syria, while developing countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are working hard to bring them back alone with their mothers.",False

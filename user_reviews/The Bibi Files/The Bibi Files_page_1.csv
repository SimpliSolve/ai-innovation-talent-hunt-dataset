1,9,Very good doc - sad state of affairs,Sarden,n/a,15/08/2025,"Eye-opening documentary shedding light not just on Netanyahu but also on the background to the tragic events in Gaza and some deeply disturbing elements of Israeli society.Unlike what some have written here, the documentary is not based on hearsay, but on police interviews with the involved parties and the movie makers' interviews with some key characters connected to the upper echelons of Israeli society.So the sources are primary, and this lends credence to the accusations against Netanyahu being put forward, but, more importantly, paints a picture of some of the motivations behind Netanyahu's and wider Israeli society's gruesome treatment of Gaza.Spend 1Â½ hours to better understand contemporary Israel and the events in Gaza. The editing and storytelling will keep you interested, and enlightening films such as this one can play an important role in putting an end to catastrophes such as the one unfolding in the Middle East right now.",False
2,8,Excelent movie. Tragic thug mentalitty.,yairsss,n/a,15/08/2025,"What do you expect to get from watching a movie? If the goal is to enjoy, and not for example to get sick to the point of vomiting, this movie may not be for you.Through tapes of investigations of Netanyahu and his family, he tells the story of a hedonistic and morally degenerate man, who will not let anything stop him on the way to his goal.For Israelis it probably won't do much new. They know their PM well: The fine rhetoric, the low execution ability and the moral corruption. Still for me, an Israeli, it was very interesting to watch the defiant attitude of Netanyahu and his family towards the police investigators, to understand their thug metality, to realise they'll do anything for him to stay in power - which he probably will untill convicted somewhere around 2026, leaving heavily devided and demaged Israel behind him.",False
3,9,Realistic,mb-33087,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerA well constructed and narrated documentary. For any students of the middle east it lays out what a lot of us knew but were not sure off. The complicity with Hamas was suspected but here we have proof. The shady dealings were known all along but to portray Sara as a Lady Macbeth is an insult to the Lady. Why aren't the democratic institutions in Israel strong enough to rid themselves of such a Crime Minister? I guess when you go to bed with the far right extremism you have sold yourself out and then it is a question of survival. I found the 20 year old Kibbutz survivor very lucid and pertinent. Hopefully one day justice will be served to all the victims on either side of the self serving policies of one man.,True
4,10,Portrait of a sick psychopath,Freddy_Zilt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just watched this. What can I say, if you want something enjoyable, don't watch. If on the other hand you want to understand what's happening in Gaza and why it's happening, this documentary is a must watch. It has leaked scenes of never before seen footage, showing credible evidence of people who were really close to him. Poor Bibi can only respond in one or two ways: I don't remember or lies! This man, together with other war criminals should be behind bars for the rest of his live. But he still had friends in the US who got his back. It makes you wonder why.. go watch it, it's a must see! May peace return to our planet!",False
5,9,Fair Review,amr_dahab,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was afraid that it will be boring,but I couldn't skip a minute , the structure is solid, the info delivered in away it doesnt direct your judgment ,its showing facts the guest are 100% relevant, it's a piece of Art showing the world how we can be deceived by the elites, the film showed how the world is ruled by psychopaths, and hipocryates we call politicians"" ,it revealed the ugly face not of Bibi but all the leaders and politicians putting their hands in his hands or being mute while watching all these horrific, acts done by USA and Israel , the people support such leaders should be ashamed , I couldn't hold my tears of being in such unfair , violent world , the blood shed since 2023 is the result of actions built minute over minute , i really recommend watching and spreading the truth , I send my appreciation to the makers of this brave documentry ,",False
6,7,Eye Opening documentary,CanI-730,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beyond the explicit corruption charges, ""The Bibi Files"" suggests a more sinister undercurrent: that Netanyahu's relentless pursuit to evade justice has deeply impacted Israel's political landscape and even its security. The documentary posits that his efforts to avoid prosecution influenced his political decisions, including his attempts to weaken the judiciary, which sparked massive protests across Israel. It even implies a connection between his legal entanglements and his approach to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, suggesting that prolonging the war could serve as a means to delay his trial and maintain power.What makes ""The Bibi Files"" particularly impactful is its use of raw, unvarnished interrogation footage. This direct access to the private world of the Netanyahus, usually hidden behind carefully constructed public images, is both voyeuristic and deeply revealing. It provides a chilling insight into the mentality of a leader and his inner circle, whose sense of entitlement seemingly knows no bounds. The film's meticulous organization of this vast amount of footage into a coherent timeline is commendable, allowing the viewer to follow the complex legal and political threads.",False
7,10,Such Blatant Reality,KillBill5669,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of the BEST documentaries I have ever seen. I laughed quite a bit at these people and their delusional, out-of-touch-with-reality mindsets. They're stuck in Narcissistic Mode. But then I stopped laughing after they got through all the recorded interrogations when they showed how Netanyahu's and Wife's twisted minds and the twisted minds of their ""cohorts"" has resulted in War for no other reason other than to stall his trial, keep him out of jail and in power. We got one lone wolf that just killed a healthcare CEO, you bet they went after him, got him and there will be no delay or doubt where he's going. But we've got these Leaders killing 10's and 100's of thousands of people, using them basically as HUMAN SHIELDS! Putin, your day's coming too! The times Netanyahu and his Alcoholic, Diamond Crazy Wife told police interrogators ""they (the interrogators) should be ashamed"" ... I'm like MAN, these people belong in an insane asylum. They've wracked up so much Shame they should be drowning in it. They have absolutely NO SHAME - NO HUMANITY. - A huge Thank You, Bravo! Standing ovation! ... to everyone involved in the making of this Excellently DONE Documentary about the reality of those in Power from high to low, they're all the same character ... narcissists/sociopaths, PSYCHPATHS. Major SERIAL KILLERS DELUXE VERSIONS! Why does the MAJORITY put up with them????",False
8,7,Just like the Panama Papers,tonyofbrisbane-38530,n/a,15/08/2025,"It shows there is definitely two levels of society the accountable (us) and them!! How many years ago did the Panama Papers expose wide spread money laundering? How long was Syria producing high scale opioid's with full immunity. The world needs to change for the better greed is not the way forward. If what is happening in the middle east is the legacy we are leaving our kids globally as this affects us all I am ashamed when my generation were 'going to change the world' yeah right. Once the hippies hit the corporate world greed set in and pasts forgotten, try buying a beach shack and opting out? I see my generation walking around in their 'designer hippy clothes' and enough bling to feed a small country for a year. Then, they jump in their Porsche and drive away hypocrites and totally shallow role models.",False
9,10,"Leaders, Myths, and the Price of Ambition",pinkmanboy,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Bibi Files,"" directed by Alexis Bloom, dives deep into the heart of a leader whose persona has become almost inseparable from the nation he governs. Through a gripping mix of revealing interviews and leaked interrogation footage, Bloom crafts a character study that's as fascinating as it is unsettling. Benjamin Netanyahu emerges not just as a politician fighting to survive but as a symbol of how ego can turn a leader into a threat to a nation's stability.The documentary's narrative structure is flawless. Bloom builds her case with the precision of an investigator and the pacing of a seasoned storyteller, letting the facts speak for themselves. Over 115 minutes, the film lays bare a leader obsessed with his own image, wielding Israel's flag not as a unifying symbol but as a shield to protect his position. The claim that Netanyahu perpetuates the Gaza conflict as a ploy to avoid imprisonment on corruption charges is presented with a rare balance: it's supported by evidence and nuance, yet it doesn't shy away from the complexities of the geopolitical landscape.Bloom's greatest strength lies in weaving the personal and the political together. The leaked interrogation footage captures Netanyahu at his rawest-defensive, theatrical, constantly framing his actions as sacrifices for Israel's greater good. This juxtaposition of the man and the myth feels almost like a Greek epic, with Netanyahu cast as a tragic hero whose inability to separate his survival from his nation's puts both at risk. His relentless declarations of innocence, coupled with grandiose claims about ""Israel's best interests,"" skirt the edge of comedy, but the real-world consequences of his actions are devastatingly serious.One of the most intriguing aspects of the documentary is its portrayal of Sara Netanyahu. While Benjamin commands the spotlight, Sara looms as a silent but insatiable force behind the scenes. Testimonies from former associates paint her as someone whose influence extends far beyond the domestic sphere, shaping political decisions through extravagant demands and subtle manipulations. Even in her limited on-screen moments, Sara's presence evokes comparisons to classic tragic archetypes like Medea. Bloom doesn't just suggest Sara's pivotal role in Netanyahu's power dynamics; she raises unsettling questions about how power is wielded and distributed within their inner circle.Visually, ""The Bibi Files"" is austere but effective. The editing is straightforward, allowing the footage to speak for itself, while the understated score maintains tension without overwhelming the viewer. Bloom steers clear of sensationalism, trusting the weight of the information to carry the film. This minimalist aesthetic mirrors the gravity of the subject matter and amplifies the urgency of the documentary's message.At its core, the film isn't just a critique of Netanyahu but a sharp examination of how power can erode democracy. Bloom highlights how Netanyahu's decisions have left Israel vulnerable-not just in terms of physical security but institutionally-by prioritizing his family's interests over the nation's collective well-being. It's a sobering warning about the cost of leaders who see themselves as indispensable, turning nations into reflections of their own ambitions.""The Bibi Files"" demands attention and reflection. It's both an exposÃ© and a political tragedy unfolding in real time. Alexis Bloom delivers a cinematic piece that goes beyond mere factual reporting, urging viewers to consider the dangers of conflating leaders with myths and governments with dynasties. The result is a film as provocative as it is necessary.",False
10,10,A Thorough and Revealing Documentary,rehit-it,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Bibi Files is a bold and meticulously crafted documentary that shines a light on some of the most controversial aspects of Benjamin Netanyahu's tenure as Prime Minister of Israel. Far from being vague or unfounded, the documentary offers a compelling narrative supported by diverse sources and insights that challenge the status quo.The strength of The Bibi Files lies in its ability to weave together personal testimonies, political analysis, and historical context to create a multifaceted portrait of one of Israel's most polarizing figures. The individuals interviewed may not all be high profile or immediately recognizable, but their perspectives offer a ground-level view of the social, economic, and political ripple effects of Netanyahu's policies. This approach underscores the documentary's commitment to amplifying voices that are often overshadowed in mainstream discourse.Critics may dismiss the film as biased, but such an assertion overlooks its clear focus on presenting evidence and arguments that spark critical thought. The filmmakers challenge viewers to connect the dots themselves, fostering a more engaged and questioning audience. While it does not adopt the rigid investigative style of something like Gold Mafia, its approach is no less valid - offering a more humanized and relatable exploration of its subject.The timing of the documentary is also poignant, coinciding with a pivotal moment in Israel's political landscape. This synchronicity amplifies the relevance of its message and provides a vital lens for understanding current events.",False
11,10,CHILLING,cairobug-89339,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was glued to the screen for the entire duration. THIS IS A MUST WATCH. You think that what you already know about his man can't get any worse but boy oh boy get that idea right out of your head. This family are evil to the core. Watching them being interrogated. The arrogance, hedonism and deviancy oozing out of them is chilling. It showed a clip of the US congress giving him round after round of applause and that was even more chilling. The USA is truly the great Satan. How they cheer this clear psychopath is frightening. The wife!!! She is beyond doubt equally evil. Maybe even worse than him. The son!! The entire thing will chill you to the bone. It should be shown in every school and cinema. We get to see what true evil is. They and their supporters are by far the most depraved people on our planet. The demonic state of Israel must be dismantled. It will leave you in no doubt who controls the USA and UK. Our planet is in serious danger.",False
12,10,Eye-Opening and Brilliantly Crafted,vzptxypxu,n/a,15/08/2025,"Files of Bibi is more than a documentary - it's a mirror held up to the face of power. With surgical precision and gripping narrative flow, it decodes the intricate web of Middle Eastern politics, revealing not only what happens but why it happens. It dares to expose how corruption, dressed in patriotism and strategy, can turn brilliance into poison, and justice into performance. The film doesn't preach - it unveils. Layer by layer, it guides the viewer through the shadows of leadership, where decisions shape destinies and silence speaks louder than words. A haunting, intelligent, and essential watch.",False
13,9,A classic case of corrupted despot,mrouttt,n/a,15/08/2025,"A classic story for anyone with even the slightest interest in politics, whatever your country of origin.As a Frenchman, the corruption of this Israeli politician often reminded me of the life of Nicolas Sarkozy, except that we managed to get rid of him after his first term.Apart from the fact that we learn that the entire Netanyahu family is just as corrupt as he is, and completely full of themselves,
like people who enjoy their own gastric emanations.His desperate attempt to stay in power with the dregs of humanity, namely Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, leaves only one ominous horizon for the region's near future.The status of perpetual war launched in 2023 will enable this tyrant to remain in power indefinitely, leaving the way clear for the extremists who want to annex the whole of the Palestinian landmass and beyond, while being supported by the army and institutions of a state on the verge of implosion.",False
14,9,reminiscent,imizrahi2002,n/a,15/08/2025,"Being of American origin, even though i haven't lived there for 25 years, with every scene...every tactic and response by Netanyahu, i was, unfortunately, reminded of the present President of the United States, Donald Trump, who seems to lie every time his lips are moving.How Netanyahu can claim, time after time, question after question that he doesn't remember and then gets away with it? How he consistently uses the war with Hamas as an excuse to postpone his trial for corruption(the main reason, as i see it, that Trump was desperate to win the Presidency...to stay out of jail for HIS misdeeds)...and now the decimation of the legal and military systems...? The two could be twins...echoes. And the people on both sides, Israelis and Palestinians continue to die...Trump's allegations of 'fake news' about anything critical of him...Netanyahu's claims of 'leftist media'...it seems that Trump's MAGA cult and Netanyahu's supporters speak the same language, parroting what's fed to them by these two leaders.I've had the same amount of success speaking to both of these groups in social media around news articles...and that is no success at all...no matter HOW many facts i've presented...they each seem to have an inflexible agenda, impervious to any provided data...i feel sorry for the people of all 3 countries...",False
15,4,Interresting watch,quobitit,n/a,15/08/2025,"This Documentary really struggles to bring concrete evidence to show what it is trying to portray. It's extremely biased with quite a lot of vague statements from different people. I would have felt the Bibi Files more believable if it was done by unbiased investigative journalists. I would have expected it to be more of a Gold Mafia kind of investigations that follows the money and show us concrete evidence instead of showing us interrogations of random people and not giving much substance to the investigations and the people that are interrogated or questioned. Where is the, who are these people and where did they work? How do they know the PM where do they get their information from? The timing of this Documentary is also quite SUS with everything going on in Isreal now.Give us more evidence and do professional digging into his money affairs and then come back and try this documentary again. Everything here is extremely touch and go, it struggles to bring anything concrete to bear and feels more like a documentary that is made by people that have a thing against the PM.",False
16,3,Seems extremely biased.,Badlands1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was waiting for any concrete evidence of criminal activity. But all I saw was interrogations of allegations about champagne bottles, and other gifts? Or hearsay? Doesn't make for a great documentary.It was interesting to learn that his brother was the only fatality in the successful raid on Entebbe Mission. I'm sure that affected him his whole life to fight against similar terror.Everybody agrees the hostages are the biggest concern, but who's keeping the hostages? They also pointed out he funnelled millions to Qatar to Palestine. But every western country has given millions to Palestine. It's aid.. Should Israel not give them millions? Nobody told them to build the tunnels or launch rockets daily. I'm still Wanting to see any actual crimes and then I would be convinced. But this hit piece documentary didn't convince me of anything like that.",False
17,1,Completely bias hersay,kvwkcxsbs,n/a,15/08/2025,"How do people want to become legitimate in documentaries when everything's coming from a one sided biased side, full of allegations that arnt even proven to be true, how fitting with all the racism towards Jews at the moment
Thought this might be an unbiased document I could gather information from but exceeds a defamation of character in all sorts of ways
Definitely not worth the watch lol.If you want to waste 115 minutes of your life, listening to how H ler would make a documentary if he was alive today here it would be, actually truely disappointing when there's so much you could make use of your time then wasting it on making something like this.",False
18,4,Doesn't even try to hide its bias,RyanJamesDJ,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Bibi Files 2024 kicks off with promise, drawing viewers into Benjamin Netanyahu's political saga with slick visuals and an intriguing setup. The early moments suggest a deep dive into Israel's complex landscape, but this documentary soon stumbles into a glaringly one-sided narrative. Its relentless use of ""far right"" to describe Netanyahu's policies and allies grows repetitive and reductive, echoing the heavy bias of a CNN or MSNBC takedown of Trump. Key issues like security or coalition politics are oversimplified or framed to push an agenda, sidelining any real nuance. Despite solid production and some compelling archival clips, the film's lack of balance alienates viewers who want insight over propaganda. It's a frustrating missed opportunity that fails to respect its audience's ability to think for themselves.",False
19,3,Leftist thug propaganda,xlars,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Bibi Files"" is a documentary or rather a mockumentary that presents leaked footage from police interrogations of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his family, and associates, focusing on allegations of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust.The film showcases Netanyahu's clear attitude during questioning, where he dismisses the investigations as baseless and labels witnesses as liars, which they clearly are. They are so afraid of themselves ending up in jail, that they are willing to lie for leftists.Some observers suggest that certain witnesses, including business figures like Arnon Milchan and Shaul Elovitch, appear apprehensive, possibly due to concerns about their own legal repercussions, which could influence their testimonies against Netanyahu.These testimonies are indisputeably motivated by self-preservation, potentially compromising their credibility and casting doubt on the impartiality of the investigation.",False

1,3,I Have A Headache Now,Shrewdthewise,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoy wild conspiracy documentaries and wanted to watch this one all the way through. But the narrator and voice actors are practically yelling, the music is off key and distracting, and the graphics going on in the background are moving non-stop... it's like staring at a very busy moving screen saver. I don't know if the intention was to hypnotize the audience or what, but after 20 minutes my head is pounding and I'm shutting this mess off!",False
2,3,Boring,charlesjflagg,n/a,16/08/2025,Informative but the background music and narrator combined for a great antedote for sleep,False
3,10,Clears up a great deal of confusion learned in school,RodMartinJr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sadly, our schools leave out a lot of the hard facts needed to make sense of history. Memorization of dry facts and dates is NOT what history is about. I finally gained an appreciation of history in 11th grade World History class, where Mrs. Hendry informed her class that history was all about ""motivation."" I was electrified and enthralled by this new reality.This film does a deep dive into the history of historical motivation and one of the key motivating factors of all human existence -- greed!More than half a century after high school, I still love history and this film scratches a very big itch to know more.Oh, and those small minds who criticize the notion of ""conspiracies,"" likely have no idea what a conspiracy is. It's merely a conversation between 2 or more people for the purpose of doing something unethical. In my research for my book, ""Dirt Ordinary,"" I discovered that there are at least 489 new conspiracies starting every second, on average. And some of those conspiracies involve the starting of wars, and the theft of billions of dollars. A conspiracy is merely part of group selfishness.",False
4,1,By any stretch of the imagination this is far fetched,james_abbey,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerConspiracy theories at its finest. Linking the only four U.S. Presidents that were ever killed while in office through slavery and civil rights. Far fetched as you can get.,True
5,9,For every American,rolfhu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very clearly shows the story of the 4 Presidents. The reason to be killed, why they died and what happened after. If you American, you probably have never thought about this before. Watch and learn.",False
6,10,A Wonderous Piece For The Ages Of Screens Computers And Simulation Living,christaphor,n/a,16/08/2025,Wow what an excellent perspective on america. i can tell from this alone that Ken has a produced another fantastic piece of commentary that we can all sit back and enjoy this one with many many years to come . Thanks so much for this fantastic and persistent .,False

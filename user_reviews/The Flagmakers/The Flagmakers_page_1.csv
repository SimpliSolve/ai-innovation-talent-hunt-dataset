1,10,A Very Soulful Perspective on Patriotism,jakissell,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had no idea what to expect with this film, and it really touched me. The good folks at the Eder Flag Company are all very real, very relatable and very proud to work as flagmakers. This documentary is not only well filmed; it is also very topical and very emotional. It shows a lot more than what our flag means to our melting pot of a country, and it shows how we are still very far from perfect. The writing is soulful and profound. The characters are very well portrayed. The cinematography is brilliant. The message and images will haunt you and inspire you. Brava to Cynthia Wade and Sharon Liese. I recommend this film highly.",False
2,n/a,Expected Cliche and Missed Opportunitiy,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI wish, I really wish this was as a documentary about the particular flag and an appreciation for the enumerated self evident truths that people came to pursue.Instead, this is sadly a poor film due to a bizarre insistence for the right diversity moments only occurring
in a modern Los Angels setting.This film could have had insight into the diversity for small a town with a large immigrant population juxtaposed to the backdrop of a traditional American culture. Unfortunately that authentic scenario did not match the producers expectations for rural Wisconsin.Yet another, this is how producers wish America was
vs an observation of how America is.",True
3,1,"Should be Titled ""From Pride to Propaganda""",DanielM-090,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was surprised in the beginning at how beautifully this documentary displays the melting pot that is America, with our shared flag at the center of the discussion. The diversity and pride displayed by the employees at Eder Flags was awesome to see, with one natural born citizen even helping a legal immigrant employee practice for their citizenship. Everyone was proud to display their heritage, but seemed equally unabashed in their love of this country.At exactly the halfway point, sad piano music begins, and the black character devolves into a tired ""You can love this country, it don't always love you back"" speech. The rest of the documentary is a sad, political tantrum that nobody asked for, everybody is tired of, and that is entirely misguided and based on falsehoods that are apparently still being perpetuated on a population that knows better. Criminals are treated as such, and no amount of misinformation is going to change either that fact or anyone's feelings about it. It's certainly no reason to hijack the film this could have been.Frankly, I expected this misguided commentary earlier in the show considering it's NatGeo and Disney, but the beginning made me think they'd turned a new leaf. Boy was I wrong to expect any different. I should've realized sooner how careful they were to not depict a single white man.This is propaganda. This is not something to be proud of. I would not recommend showing to children unless you want them regurgitating nonsense and growing up despising this country.",False
4,10,Wonderful Short Film!,getpoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this glimpse into the lives of these diverse Flagmakers, and thought it was not only great storytelling, but it was compelling and emotional without being forced. It's a really gorgeously composed and shot short film that could be a feature or docuseries, but was actually just perfect the way it came together as a short. I know a director who gets asked if their next project will be short or feature length, and they always reply -""it will be as long as it's supposed to be"" and for me, this one was right on time. Such a heartfelt and authentic statement about pride in country, work ethics, and craftsmanship. Hearing the pieces of these characters stories sewn together so eloquently really made an impact on me. I hope these remarkable people see themselves, and their craft, as beautiful as the camera lenses and I do.",False
5,2,The concept was good,amlcart0y,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started off enjoying this film. The people working at the flag company were diverse in cultures and seemed to share a love for the country that welcomed them in and they had a love for the flag making they did for their living. The problem for me started when they brought in the political division and solely focused on the right side as bad and the left as good and victims of the right. The problem with doing that, is that you create more division in race and culture unnecessarily. The reality is that there is good people and bad people that believe any certain idea. The film focused on Jan 6th riot calling it deadly when the only person killed was a rioter shot by capitol police. The film shows sadness from the flag makers, but there is never a mention of the blm riots that burned cities and killed police and citizens. They mention George Floyd but only as a victim of stupid cops and not who he was. If we truly want a peaceful, fair and just America, then let's all stop and realize what politicians and media are doing as they spread one side views that divide and cause hatred. We all are equal and we all should show both sides of a situation to paint a real picture of what we need to do to foster love and appreciation for all people.",False
6,9,Thank you Eder Flag Company,jrneptune,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some people see the U. S. Flag and they think of the history behind it.Some people see the U. S. Flag and they think of what they should be entitled to.I like to think of the U. S. Flag as a beacon of hope and unity in democracy as a powerful testament to the ever-evolving vision of what the nation can achieve through collective effort and shared values. It's a symbol that can inspire a sense of purpose and direction towards a more united and democratic future.Or to put it another way:
The U. S. Flag indeed carries a multitude of meanings and symbolizes a rich tapestry of history and ideals. It's a reminder of the country's long journey and the diverse thoughts and beliefs of its people. Your perspective of the flag as a beacon of hope and unity in democracy is a powerful testament to the ever-evolving vision of what the nation can achieve through collective effort and shared values. It's a symbol that can inspire a sense of purpose and direction towards a more united and democratic future.The documentary represented so many different viewpoints. I can't wait to have more people watch it.",False

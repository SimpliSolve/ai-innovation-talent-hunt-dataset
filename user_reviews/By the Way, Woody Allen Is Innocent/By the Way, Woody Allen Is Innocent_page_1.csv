1,9,awseome youtube video,yurisilvasouza2001,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's crazy that someone needs to make an 2 hour long video about a thing that is basically common sense but this is the time we are living nowadays so...
Otherwise is a very well researched video that shows things that most people don't even stopped to think about. Even if you really think he is guilty, watch it, at least you will put your judgement on test.",False
2,8,Amazing work!,facundofr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rick Worley did this documentary all by himself! And the film is very clear about Woody Allen's accusations: he's innocent and everybody owes him an apology! Thank for this, Rick! Woody Allen is one of the best directores and writers of history and he deserves the truth.",False
3,9,Amazing Revelations,CorpeningMedia,n/a,16/08/2025,"I say ""Amazing Revelations,"" but that is only because I, like most, have spent years assuming the tidbits and nuggets of the story I have heard in the periphery, are in fact the whole and true story. This epic work of detailed and sourced facts and timelines means the revelations are actually that I, like most, were operating under false assumptions. It is simultaneously enlightening and frightening to learn the truth about what has been a decades-long, and ongoing, take-down of an artist falsely accused.
This is most-certainly the type of analysis that should be viewed by anyone struggling to accept Woody Allen despite the accusations against him, and should be required viewing for those who think him guilty.",False
4,10,"Yep, Woody Allen is innocent. We already knew it, but this great documentary was needed. Facts, sanity and the truth.",antoniatejedabarros,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge fan of Woody Allen. I'm furious at this wave of rage and lies against Woody that seem to never end. People have finally lost their common sense in the United States and the country has returned to the McCarthy era. The situation is really pathetic (not for Woody, but for those cheap, hypocrite, opportunist, and ignorant accusers) and in Europe we don't know if to cry or laugh at this whole mess.The story is quite simple. I don't understand why there are still some people who say ""We don't know if Dylan was abused or not"". Of course we know! She was not abused. Not by Woody, in any case. That's not my opinion but the facts talking.The truth is, nobody believes Dylan Farrow. The real problem for narrow minded people is Woody's love for Soon-Yi. Mia Farrow's goal (then and ...still now!) was to destroy Woody Allen at any price. And, what better than stab a knife into his heart by taking his adoptive daughter Dylan Farrow away? Mia Farrow said to Woody: ""I have something very nasty planned for you"", and, most important and relevant to the story: ""You took my daughter. I'm going to take yours"". And she did.By the way, Soon-Yi and Woody did marry. They married in Venice in 1997. They are sharing their lives together for almost 30 years, and have formed a beautiful family. They have two adopted beautiful and bright daughters (Bechet and Manzie).Rick Worley did an amazing job in putting this documentary together, by bringing to light the insanity and the mafia-power-threat of the Farrows and the inconsistency of the false accusation, with many clips, interviews, documents, and facts. The music is great, the narration is great too, and the content is indispensable. Bravo.People should be thanking Woody for all his wonderful and amazing movies, and not stabbing him with lies and false accusations.Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. 10/10",False
5,10,Not that HBO Series,lonoffj,n/a,16/08/2025,"A real well researched, referenced, even balanced documentary - examining everything the Farrows said - and looking at the actual evidence. Evidence. Law. Innocent until proven guilty. You'd think after four years of Trump, we'd have enough of mob rule ...",False
6,10,Calm cool and collected overview of the full facts,Jon-73,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film marvelously cuts through the hysteria and moral panic surrounding the allegations against Woody Allen for which the evidence is as thin as gossamer.
I have long suspected Woody Allen was almost certainly innocent but this film (and the writings of Robert Weide and others) fully anchored all the general intuitions I had in that direction. Watching it is like watching a fog lift on an early morning.",False
7,10,"Finally, some Proper Journalism",coltmccoy95,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rick Worley shows us in this excellent and informative essay not only how innocent Woody Allen is, but the dangers of the persistent groupthink mentality of today's culture that is all too eager to uphold a narrative over facts.A must watch for anyone interested in the chaos of the Farrow household, and the petty mudslinging tactics used to sully the reputation of one of our greatest writers.",False
8,n/a,Yessir,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,I thoroughly researched this years ago and came to the obvious conclusion of Woodys innocence and Mia's insanity. This documentary lays it out pretty plain and even had a few nuggets that I did not know.,False
9,10,It's on Youtube: everyone can watch it ans share it,superrichinweek,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since 1992 and the two investigations by two states (Connecticut, New York) who have found Dylan Farrow no credible, people believing in facts and due process know that Woody Allen is innocent. Rick Worley's documentary is very well documented, if you believe in facts rather than lies and gossips spread by mob trial apologists, you must watch it - search on Youtube ""By The Way, Woody Allen Is Innocent"" - and share it.",False
10,10,A remarkably well researched and rigorous documentary.,sibylle-10909,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is remarkably well researched and documented. It explores objectively all evidence at hand, and can only conclude to Woody Allen Â´s innocence. Whether you like Allen or not, a must-see for anyone valuing the truth.",True
11,1,Why would anyone believe anything he says,dphkng,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mob Lynching ...too good for this man. Getting sexually involved with your lover of 12 years' adopted daughter, who you are a father figure to, is out of bounds. This is not what a man of integrity does. It is what an unprincipled reptile does.HIm painting Mia Farrow, as the villain and continuing to attach her tells you everything you need to know about him. The New York judge in the custody trial made it clear what Allen's motives were at that time and his motives remain the same.Finally, he is getting a taste of the treatment he deserves but, in my humble opinion, not even close to what he deserves. He should be in jail for the rape of his 7-year-old adopted daughter. If people think this is the only underage child, he has raped they are wrong. People like this are emboldened when they are able to escape the legal consequences of their behavior.",False
12,10,Watch this not the HBO doc,henrywwdurrant,n/a,16/08/2025,Far superior to the horribly biased HBO documentary.,False
13,10,Brilliant. Indispensable.,paskcqfe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thorough, smart, witty, well informed. Perfect antidote to that HBO disgraceful series.",False
14,10,A factually based documentary which considers both sides the Allen and Farrow saga,lauritz-andr,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a balanced documentary, which doesn't assume anything but invites the viewer to make her own judgements by putting the facts forward. It has no agenda except for the truth.",False
15,10,Thank you Rick Worley,rogmortsmith,n/a,16/08/2025,I only wish more people would see this than that HBO garbage.,False
16,10,A great documentary about Woody Allen,ninagleize,n/a,16/08/2025,"Simply the truth. I recommand it with the autobiography of Woody Allen ""Apropos of nothing"" to counterbalance the one sided show presented on HBO by the Farrow clan. At the end of the day, justice system is the most serious judge about all this but this attempt to recapitulate everything rationally is great and deserves to be watched and refered to.",False
17,10,Fantastic. Great. Thanks.,yaelstreetttejeda,n/a,16/08/2025,I love Woody Allen and I think that this documentary is great. Do not watch the HBO one (that's a fake documentary). Watch this one! Woody Allen is the best.,False
18,10,Excellent work and a must-see!,akeshishian17969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone should see this and then read Robert Weide's work. Together they comprehensively demolish Mia Farrow's hideous lies. (And while you're at it, pick up Apropos of Nothing, too.)",False
19,9,Excellent documentary film about the Allen/Farrow saga,HuntinPeck80,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thoroughly and exhaustively researched, an intelligent and incisive engagement with the material, 'By the Way...' is a powerful, engaging documentary. Despite being more than 25 years old the accusation against Woody Allen, that he molested his adopted daughter Dylan when she was about 7 years old, keeps popping up again and again and found new converts when it was (wrongly) tacked on to the #MeToo movement a few years ago. Rick Worley's film is a critical analysis of both the case history and why, despite the fact that the allegation never even made it to trial, Woody Allen has effectively been found guilty and ostracised in the court of fickle public opinion. Given that the accusation was investigated by two professional bodies over many months and found to have no truth to it, I see no reason to say there are spoilers in this review. However, if you watch the film, which is readily available online, you are bound to encounter much that is revelatory.",False
20,10,"Finally, some facts!",ewelthorpe-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thank you for this. It is incredible that anyone could believe this accusation when they know any of the actual facts. The journalists who spew the side of Mia/Dylan/Ronan are doing a great disservice to their profession. Anyone with a modicum of common sense can see Woody Allen is innocent, but thank you for presenting the full story so clearly.",False
21,10,An Eye-Opener!,shakethepoet,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rick Worley's riveting, fact-driven documentary takes the viewer on a step-by-step exploration of court documents, sworn testimony, police reports, and interviews that were noticeably missing from the HBO docuseries. A must-see for anyone advocating for justice in this case.",False
22,9,Watch this one not the other.,kham2939,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are interested in this sad tale & are a critical thinker, watch this film, not the HBO trash. Any alternative to Allen being a ""monster"" is so horrendous, that most cannot fathom its possibilty. Either way the cost is monumental to Dylan, & her siblings, 3 dead from suicide, & 2 estranged, spoke on the record of abuse by Mia, whose brother btw has been convicted of child abuse.",False

1,8,Hard to watch but great and sad,UniqueParticle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very emotional documentary that is very important, well expressed and unfortunate! I'm shocked of the events that are told in this documentary; baffling some of it occurs and it's got artsy poetic ness mashed in well. All the people involved are magnificent despite the subject matter! Would highly recommend this just because it's sublime.",False
2,8,The beauty lies in it's simplicity,mellenweldensei,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who would have thought that a book reading could move so much. This TV special showcases hightlights from the book Between the world and me by using todays finest black voices. The use of personal footage, historical footage and animation have turned the whole into a piece of art. A piece of art that cannot be missed. The story and language used by Ta-nehisi Coates is personal, poetic and literature at it's finest. I recommend this to anyone who loves books and is interested in the civil rights/BLM-movement.",False
3,10,The Real Deal,danderson3-308-146904,n/a,16/08/2025,"Deeply moving and authentic and evocative. A mixture of poetry, history, narrative, cartoons, and music - well done!",False
4,10,"Regurgitating what was never past rather, still present in this America",kickstandsupriders,n/a,16/08/2025,"Exhilarating yet disturbing truth. A display of fear, pride, anger & hope turned to acceptance then rage. A black man' Eyes void of tomorrow sees the truth in police brutality, hate & fear from White America. WATCH! And take young black men & Young black women under your wing to teach, mentor & protect.
I was not pleased with the inclusion of Oprah Winfrey wearing an African headdress for, she has not supported black Americans & was just an actress acting a role she forgot & was not familiar with. I chose to forward her portrayal; her piece of superficiality.",False
5,10,Good adaptation from the boom,nick11042002,n/a,16/08/2025,So timely. It was interesting to watch and compare the police response here to the police response to the white people that invaded the capitol building.,False

1,2,Not a good documentary,Graf_Z,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's just too many things that don't make sense.There's a ton of shots that physically could not be candid. There are whole sequences that had to be staged or at least rehearsed beforehand. And the whole thing seems very contrived. We're seeing only glimpses of real people, they seem very aware of the camera most of the time.I also don't get how they got permission from the hotel unless they gave up final cut. I refuse to believe that a huge hotel would allow thing kind of filming without some guarantees that they will get positive publicity, and that's exactly what the movie delivers. What's the point of watching a hotel documentary that obviously had to be approved by the hotel?",False
2,5,Voice problem,emresefa34,n/a,16/08/2025,I did not understand all conversations cause voice problems and it was unhappy movie time for me. It's felt bad. I never watch again. All voices are too less.,False

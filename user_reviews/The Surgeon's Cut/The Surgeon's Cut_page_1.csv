1,9,"This Documentary Series is Amazing, Fascinating, Beautiful, and can move you to Tears.",strongarmcharm,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first episode alone had me dumbstruck. This very human man is a surgeon at the highest level. Redefining what is terminal and what is now just a procedure to fix. We often make the remark, ""if it was 100 years ago, you would be dead"", well there are alot of people alive today who would not be if it was 35 years ago. And all the while as the story goes on we get to see some of just the most amazing operations being carried out. This guy goes into a human being where he then operates on another tiny human being and we can see it all on screen.I will save the rest so you can be as captivated as I was.",False

3,8,So good that it made me write my first review on IMDB!,mounicareddy-34878,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have used IMDB extensively since many years! Never have I written a review! This documentary is so good that I am writing one!Documentaries can be not as entertaining as other content. But, this one had a good mix of story and showing a new surgical aspect in each episode. I loved the 1st and 4th episodes. They showcase the story of each surgeon, their passion and it gave me a whole new perspective on medical field (I am from engineering!). It is a must watch and after watching this, this will stay in your mind for some time for sure!Give it a try! Do not miss it!",False

10,6,Great but...,AlphaBravoCheesecake,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found the medical side completely enthralling and fascinating. I personally thought that the filler, the inane social justice (typical Netflix) drivel in the form of the background information on the surgeons was at times overbearing and unnecessary. For me personally, it didn't really enhance or flesh out the show and just drew me away from the more interesting medical content.All in all its worth a watch",False

12,6,Expected better,shauny_buxton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not enough medical and surgery viewing and and too much about the background of his life. The surgery parts was class, but it goes on a bit too much about his upbringing. Fair play to the bloke though. Very inspiring.",False

18,9,"A great watch, but a difficult watch",kinozomby,n/a,16/08/2025,Amazing look into the world of a surgeon. I found it difficult to watch not so much because of the surgeries but more so because it highlighted the amount of personal hardships people around the world suffer every day no matter where you live or who you are.

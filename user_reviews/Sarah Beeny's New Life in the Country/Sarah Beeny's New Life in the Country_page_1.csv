1,8,"Entertaining, without patriarchal issues.",EarthFromObserver,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't care if they're a bit posh, I don't care that their lifestyle is somewhat unobtainable, I don't care that the family is mainly men; they seem like nice people.One reviewer seems to have a problem with the family not being a regular 'normal' family...who watches a show like this to see that? Then the reviewer comments on' the patriarchy' inside the house; clearly this person has an axe to grind against wealthy people and against male people. I think anyone who sees a patriarchal nightmarish dystopia in this tv program is being disingenuous or is a pure ideologue.The show is good. It shows the journey of successful and famous property developer Sarah Beeny, her artist husband, and their four boys as they sell up other properties and build a classic style mansion in the country. I like the family, it's nice to see such a friendly, playful and funny bunch of people doing things in interesting and different ways.",False
2,9,Different angle,sarahleysmount,n/a,16/08/2025,I enjoyed this and watched each episode back to back. I really like Sarah and it was really interesting to see and hear about their move to the country. I like the fact they include business ideas and show us interesting facts about cheese making and cider making Etc . I'm looking forward to seeing the next series when they start building.,False
3,10,Loved it,mamamoocat,n/a,16/08/2025,Regardless of anyone else's view I really enjoyed watching....more please,False
4,9,Much sought after series,wmholmes-32032,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a family show, so didnt mind all the extras that followed the build. It's a shame to wait for the next series as was looking forward to seeing the interior progress. Please sell up quick so you can do another show, these programs are much sought after. I'm really jealous!",False
5,1,Oh Dear.... Poor Somerset,lesallen-68268,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard work watching celebrities invade the countryside... Even more so when the continuity editor let's a white truck turn into a red truck.... Full truck white... Empty truck red...
Just about sums it all up...
Celebrity invaders... Now You See Them.... Then They're Gone... Hurrah!",False
6,10,Very enjoyable,stephanie_homes,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a mid 20s person I hadn't seen much of Sarah's previous programmes but I will watch most things about the countryside.
I found Sarah and her family down to earth and entertaining to watch. We really looked forward to every episode and was great for a midweek evening. I liked the focus on different 'cottage industries' on each episode and felt they were informative.",False
7,1,Could be better,tungrian,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have liked the previous shows by Sarah Beeney - interesting, informative and entertaining. This is none of the above! Boring (how much entertainment is there in digging a hole?) and too much playing to the camera. I hung on to the end, hoping for something to redeem it. I imagine they are going to have problems with planning permission and perhaps the county archaeologist but I just can't be bothered to watch.",False
8,10,Love the show,mills52,n/a,16/08/2025,Have enjoyed both series very much.Looking forward to series 3???What a lovely family they are!The viewers who gave this a low score are only envious/jealous of their success.,False
9,1,"Sorry Sarah, this is just self indulgent. (Series 2)",crumpytv,n/a,16/08/2025,"Property Ladder you could identify with. Ordinary people in the program, ordinary people watching.Watching Sarah and her family do things that others can't even aspire to is just pretentious nonsense.They never mention money and how much things cost. The amount they have to throw at this project is beyond just about everyone, so get on with it and stop sharing your wannabe lifestyle, either that or get back to basics with regards TV programs.",False
10,1,Annoying,carolynocean,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found myself getting very irritated when watching this.A little too posh and self indulgent for my liking , I know that may sound a little envious on my part , but truly I am not !I am not a fan of families who are willing to let the camera into their lives for the sake of money and recognition .All a little ""me me me ""
No thank you !",False
11,1,Pretentious and annoying,pollitohoward,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an awful program and the family are so annoying. The council who approved their planning should be ashamed - allowing a new mansion in the middle of an agricultural field, really. They are ruining the beautiful countryside and have no ideas what they are doing, sell it back to a real farmer, not someone out to transform it into a business and make a few bucks.",False
12,1,A downtrodden posh woman's life among horrible men,sprigent,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is a scary reminder that even if you ""have it all"", you can still end up a downtrodden victim of the patriarchy,. Sarah, arguably the far more successful partner in her marriage than Graham (& his same four portrait paintings that get moved in to the back of most indoor shots) will still be ridiculed, gaslit, used & abused by all the men in her life, no matter her successes. All while following her husbands dream of life in the countryside, with little gratitude for her sacrifice.The pair also seem to have bred four cookie-cutter misogynistic posh private school boys who treat their mum more as their servant than a loving provider. These ungrateful boys have dreams of their new stately home bedrooms being decorated in the style of.... gentleman's clubs, compete with fox hunting portraits! So fun, so normal, real everyday people!Lots of realllllllly enjoyable shots of Sarah under incredible stress, managing the household, being everything to everyone, taking on all the domestic & emotional labour of these messy males (who absolutely weaponise their incompetence), while Graham sits at the table in the background doing busy-work.The whole thing is a posh version of car-crash TV, watching a multimillion pound mansion go up, while your hopes for equality go further down the pan.",False
13,1,DULL and DREARY,janewinkwrth,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poor old Sarah Beeny , she looks worn out, tired and miserable while her dull and unattractive family are bravely struggling to appeal to viewers now in love with the glamorous and sparkling Strawbridges in Escape to the Chateau . Sarah Beeny may know her ""property onions"" but neither she nor her family have anything interesting to offer . The building of this new life has no plan, no originality and no style .",False
14,1,Pretentious millionaire Londoners tip up in countryside to build vanity project,oliver-stevenson,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a dreadful and dreary program. 2 Londoners tip up on a farm in rural Somerset to build a massive vanity project. And they want TV company to pay for it. They should go to the Cotswolds and join the rest of their gang of London TV anchors. (To be fair to Clarkson though, at least he appears to be making a really good go of it and has highlighted some of the real issues facing the farming community, as well as making some really entertaining TV). Anyway, I could not care about the Beenys or their project and could not make it to the end of the first episode.",False
15,4,Somewhat tedious with annoying narration,mrty-99294,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not up to the usual standard, or maybe it's just a case of too much of the same thing. Needs more kittens to make it appealing - and I'm a man.",False
16,1,Very pretentious.,dydod,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its all very look and the rich city dwellers trying to be country folk, all the time patronising everyone that doesn't live in a city.
Don't even try to convince me they don't have loads of money either.
In all the time the spend faffing over polystyrene forms, a bloody bricky could of built the whole sodding house for half the price.
Don't waste your life watching this crap and I used to like Sarah Beeny and I like her husband. But it's an awful tv show.",False
17,1,Why?,simon-pickersgill77,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhy did anyone EVER think that this would be of interest to ANYONE?Perhaps this demonstrates just how detached some TV executives must be from the difficulties and lifestyles of the average people watching their output. During a pandemic that has had a crippling economic effect on countless families and literally killed thousands, why would anyone even remotely care about some posh, privileged TV celebrity building a mansion in the countryside? Watching her privileged kids design and execute their own massive bedrooms, each with their own en-suite bathrooms, interspersed with shots of summer games in the grounds of their huge estate, complete with private lake is sickening to say the least.",True
18,3,Dreadful,mattsuv,n/a,16/08/2025,Watched till the end but hidden it was hard work. Narrator was so annoying like a kid program. Not enough about the actual build.,False
19,5,Love/hate,jamesmurphywalsh,n/a,16/08/2025,"To start with I do really enjoy the show. It's one of my little guilty pleasures. I did love the house at first but the more it's gone on, I feel that it has completely destroyed the scenery. It is an absolute eyesore.I absolutely adore Sarah she is so pretty and she's a very intelligent and mindful woman.I find Graham very annoying,he's an absolute tit.They have got some great kids, who get involved and are not afraid to get their hands dirty. I also find them very entitled, given their bands name. The charity shop clothes or dad's hand me downs need to go. The oldest lad is very pretentious and as annoying as the dad.",False

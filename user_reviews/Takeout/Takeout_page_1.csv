3,1,Wish it was made better.,cconrad-16693,n/a,15/08/2025,I want to love this documentary so much. The message is so important but the subtitles killed it for me. So much reading. There are news articles presented at the same time as you're supposed to be reading the translations. Most of the time I couldn't even read the title of the speaker because I would miss the translation of what the speaker was saying. Please redo this move with a voice over so you can actually watch the movie and get the message delivered to the audience. So disappointing.,False

1,8,Great re cap,Ckrisis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFor anyone who has been watching this show in real time since the begining...this show is a great way to recap on the entire show in a single hour- long episode. The Daryl recap is probably the best episode of the three since he has been there since the very begining, unlike Maggie and Negan.",True

4,n/a,Watch if you want to know about the characters more,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show includes four main characters from TWD: Maggie, Carol, Daryl and Negan. Carol and Daryl are two of the characters that are still alive since the Atlanta Camp. Maggie has her debut in S02 and Negan joined rhe show in season 6 finale. Each character has one episode to tell their journey since the outbreak began: how they managed to survive and what kind of person they became. Each episode is about 1 hour long, showing us their major breakthrough while they tried to survive. The show will be presented by interviews with the cast members playing the four characters. Listening to how they think about their own characters was very interesting and intriguing.",False
5,9,Maggie is the only one I don't care about,samimirshak,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved watching Carol, Negan and Daryl, as for Maggie, never liked her vengeful persona and so won't watch it. How the series made Maggie in-charge is beyond me.",False
6,1,Pointless Recap Show; AMC Loves Money,jjenk911,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seriously, what was a point of this series? It's a pointless recap told through narratives by cast members. They overlap each other. Just watch the series instead of this drivel.",False

1,9,Incredible,CarolienLennipsYes,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is incredible, a lot of relatable struggles. Its a film that can change you view on life, or even the way you live it. I felt all kinds of emotions during the premiere, Congrats
I would love to see a recap of how the participants are now, a specially the filmcrew.The commitment and drive of Anders is so amazing to witness, it put the limits you give yourself in perspective, it made me start to think about my life, which is really difficult to achieve in a film, the director as a good eye for storytelling, aspecially since it is one of his first documentaries.Its not a slow story, by shifting between scenes which make it fun to watch.",False
2,9,Incredibly POWERFUL and thoroughly motivational. A MUST watch.,TRIO-Stories,n/a,16/08/2025,"Project Iceman is not just any documentary. What makes it remarkable is how deep we get to dive into Anders' journey, his motivation and his struggles. The decision to make this film independently meant that it remained real, raw and brutally honest. The story-telling comes from the heart and you can tell that the message of the film meant so much, not only to Anders (The Iceman) and Ammar (the director) but also to the entire crew.Project Iceman will have you on the edge of your seat, it will have you laughing, crying and everything in between but most importantly - it will leave you wanting more from life and will open up a whole new way of looking at things that may have always seemed 'impossible'.",False
3,9,"Powerful, surprising and motivating",bdkais,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary takes a place among the best documentaries I have ever watched. Everything about the movie is outstanding.Starting from the inspiring story of a seemingly normal person willing to tackle impossible and unthinkable challenges. It shows you how important it is to always keep the child inside alive. It shows how motivating it can be follow the voice inside. It gives you limitless power to pursue your dreams.And what I found it super innovative to show the actual process, how a super hero is formed, what journey does it take, what struggles to be taken over, rather than the glory and the superficial image of success.When it comes to the technical challenges they had to overcome to film, to edit and to produce, it says a lot about the amount of courage, of creativity and of determination they all had to finish the project.Project Iceman is a movie capable of motivating you and inspiring you to lengths you couldn't imagine.",False
4,10,"If you are feeling lost in life, this is a must watch.",diezavel,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not just a film about pushing through physical discomfort, this is a film about going after your dreams no matter what stands in your way. It shows the process of having a dream. Starting with an idea and then the steps and missteps it takes to get to the dream. You are truly rooting for Anders the whole film. The great thing about this movie is the effort and love put into it. To this day, the team is still putting everything they got into this film because they believe in it that much. They want it to inspire as many people as possible. You would think that Anders was just the protagonist, but he has been part of each step of creating this whole film. Leaving this film really makes you question your life. How you are living, what you want out of life, who you have around you. You don't necessarily have to take on Antartica, but it makes you think deeply about how you would like to spend your time here on earth.If you are feeling lost in life, this is a must watch.",False
5,10,"Awe inspiring, death defying, truly incredible",grantlopresti,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, this film truly blew me away. Journeying alongside Anders (the Iceman) through what can only be described as a headfirst dive into the seemingly impossible will be something I remember and rewatch forever. Incredible storytelling, videography, animation, soundmixing, and overall production that really allows you to feel the highs and lows right alongside the team. I was left truly inspired and can think of no better film to add to your collection or view in theaters! In short, both the top notch production of this film, and the incredible story it tells make this one of the best documentaries I've ever watched. The fact that it was independently produced makes it all the better.",False
6,10,Incredibly Inspiring. Almost Fiction.,tk-88197,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is documentary I didn't know I needed until I watched it. I walked out of this movie searching for what thing I can push myself in, and woke up the next morning wanting to take a long swim in the ice cold hudson river. Some cold showers. To remind myself what I already knew.Shot by the Yes Theory team, the filmmaking shines, and it sucks you in to a journey you have to see all the way through. You meet the team, and everyone has something to give, and the animations threaded through the film tie it all together in a way I've never seen before, this will become a trend.We are WAY more capable than we think we are, and there's nothing we can't do.Thank you Anders, I needed this.",False
7,10,"Breathtaking, Emotional, and Utterly Inspiring",emmettkasper,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anders Hofman is such an outstandingly inspiring human being. This documentary is not just about this adventure he embarked upon, but it's about him, his childhood, his life, and his motivation for attempting (and subsequently succeeding) easily one of the most insane and dangerous athletic feats of all time. This film beautifully follows this storyline and you get to see him go on a real life version of the hero's journey. You learn not only about him as an athlete, but as a man as well, and get to see from his family's perspective just how much of a genuine person he truly is.This film is completely riveting. You'll be on the edge of your seat as you watch Anders and his team willingly (and unwillingly) put themselves in some of the most ridiculously dangerous situations. To witness Anders not only be in one of the harshest environments on the planet, but then also complete what is considered to be one of the most challenging athletic competitions of all time while done in normal conditions, and then have the process take several days is just mind-blowing. He is truly a perfect example of the phrase, ""Limitations are perceptions.""",False
8,10,Limitations ARE Perceptions,sassonlonner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Recently, one of my roommates introduced me to the famous ultra-marathon runner, David Goggins, who famously says, ""I don't stop when I'm tired, I stop when I'm done."" While I think Goggins is a maniac who enjoys pain, I think this quote really does have a deep message, that a lot of people in our mostly lazy society can learn from.Everyone has a dream, but too few actually pursue them. Whether it be the fear of failure, or just laziness, so many take the easiest path that's given to them, but those who ultimately are the happiest, and enjoy life the most are those who seek discomfort. Those two words have pushed me through much of my youth and into my 20s -- ever since I discovered Yes Theory, I've found it easier in my life to find motivation, and inspiration. And this film truly took those feelings to the next level.Not only did I enjoy this film, but it pushed me to sign up to run the marathon the following day. I am so happy Yes Theory discovered such an inspiring, motivated ""seeker"" to star in this film, as nobody else could have done a better job at proving that limitations are perceptions, and that the impossible very much is possible with the right attitude. Thank you Anders for chasing your biggest dream and for pushing others to do the same, and thank you Yes Theory for making the world a better place each and every day.",False
9,10,Nothing short of inspiring,camilaherreranow,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film displays how our perceptions are the only things that are limiting us from achieving our deepest, most authentic dreams. We embark on a journey watching Anders, the protagonist, set out to do something that has been deemed impossible. We watch him as he risks everything to prove to the world and himself that anything is possible. It will leave you with a new outlook on the world and a powerful inspiration.The film's nonchalant vlogging style makes us feel as if we're just watching a friend go through the journey and we get to see a vulnerable side of each team member in the expedition.",False
10,5,"Impressive, but felt like it missed the mark",leximhenny,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe cinematic shots were beautiful, and Anders's feat and determination were awe-inspiring. But as a film, this felt like it could have been so much better.I really wanted ...something more from it. Whether it was an epic soundtrack, or history of the sport, or real in-depth discussion of the philosophy driving this mission, or more and better-documented details about the ups and downs of his training - or, ideally, most of these things.But for me it was the narrativizing of Anders's life story which really fell flat. It seemed like they were trying to portray a journey from struggle to triumph, but the content just...wasn't there. His struggles were: not being allowed to wear a hat in school, and not being good at football. As proof of his good character, they showed that he: likes his brother, and cares when a loved one has a panic attack.And there's nothing wrong with this - I'm boring, we're all boring, but it felt weird and a little cringey to see minor/common life disappointments and baseline human decency dressed in the garb of the hero's journey. I think, in the absence of a cinematically compelling personal story, they should have added in more of the elements I mentioned earlier. Sure, this probably would have made it more like a traditional documentary, but hey, those documentaries do a lot of things right.So yeah. I'm glad everyone loves it, and maybe I'm just dead inside (lol). Certainly there were things it did well. The whole Antarctic section was utterly stunning and mind-boggling. But something about it just hit weirdly for me.",True
11,10,This Is More Than A Documentary; It's An Anthem,dvvrmmdnhj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everything about this film is impressive. The grit and technical prowess required to document the story in the first place is remarkable, and to get such well-composed shots while doing so takes the film a step beyond extraordinary. Furthermore, the mixed-method storytelling approach presented beautifully and was a fantastic add to the film.Anders Hofman asserts that ""limitations are perceptions,"" and his effort and the success of this film proves that he's right. It's a motivating message I'll carry with me for the rest of my life, not just because of the incredible feat accomplished by Hofman and his team, but also because of the community effort that brought this film to life in a non-traditional and noteworthy way.This film represents a positive paradigm shift toward a world where everyone sees that we can, truly, accomplish the impossible, especially when we work together. It's more than a documentary; it's an anthem.Hats off to everyone who played a part in this extraordinary accomplishment. I'm looking very forward to future endeavors.",False
12,10,One for the history books!,reachtintin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the privilege of meeting Anders in person before I saw the film, and had a nice conversation with him, and the way this guy approaches life, is just terrific. To do what he did, is nothing short of spectacular and this film showcases that beautifully. It's an emotional and inspiring journey filled with various ups and downs. It empowers you to push yourself beyond your limits because you are the one who set those limits in the first place. It certainly proves 'Limitations are Perceptions'.The whole visual aspect of this film is just beautiful. A lot of it was shot on an iPhone due to the various challenges in filming the crew was met with in Antartica, but it's all just gorgeous. This film is definitely worth your time and I can't wait for everyone to see it.",False
13,10,Chasing your dreams/Iceman,kristofvalgaeren,n/a,16/08/2025,"Limitations are perceptions. A powerful quote from the movie which not only represents the mindset of Anders and the message he wants to carry out into the world by performing an ironman on Antarctica, but it also defines this movie. A film that shows what is possible in the world of independent movie business. As a proud Ice Squad member (kind of executive producer, am I right? ;) ), I can only highly recommend this film. It leaves you with a small existential crisis. After which you put everything of your own life in perspective. Am I doing the things I love/I'm passionate about? What were my childhood dreams? Thank you Anders, Yes Theory, Cory Martin and all the other creative people that were part of the production of this movie. You gave us an astonishing cinematography and a motto to carry throughout our whole life.",False
14,10,A raw odyssey of the human spirit,otilia_lefter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Project Iceman is a dive into the depths of the human mind and spirit capable to commit to an impossible mission in order to heal trauma and empower ones inner child by regaining the ability to believe in ones childhood dreams.This is a raw journey and not for the faint of heart. The documentary brings the audience on the edge of their seats by witnessing one step at a time how Anders, the main character, conquers his fears, fails and gets back again, doubts and pushes even more, tests his limits and decides to believe against all odds and for the whole of man kind that limitations are perceptions and thus achieving the unachievable in the end. This is a powerful lesson about empowering oneself and believing not only when no one else believes but BECAUSE no else believes.The story presents an extreme approach of how to give voice to the child self by becoming its superhero, the one that will eventually give him permission to believe that everything is possible and that he can become whoever he wants to become.I had the fortune to attend the premiere in Berlin. The atmosphere was ecstatic! A room fully packed with aspiring heroes.There, I have meet Anders in person. I was deeply touched to witness how he was advancing unnoticed, quietly and paciently through the crowds in the lobby in order to get to meet everyone personally and give them a genuine warm welcome. It became obvious to me that his superpower was actually his service driven nature, truly one of the most humble and inspiring individuals I have ever met.",False
15,10,Inspiring,qmkycx,n/a,16/08/2025,Going in to see the film I knew it was going to be amazing. But it was truly inspiring. It is so personable to everyone because we all have our own challenges whether they are just everyday struggles or by choosing to come outside our comfort zone to achieve new heights.The perseverance of this film to be completed is truly astounding. It makes me want to continue my journey to conquer my iceman. I cannot wait to watch this movie again and share this story with others.And the ending just shows wraps it up and shows you that the journey never ends.This is more than a movie it is a movement.,False
16,10,Must See!,lebilcik,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was incredible! So inspiring and a wonderful achievement. Absolutely go watch! The creators did a wonderful job in capturing the story and emotion of the experience. The impact this film had on communities across the world already is amazing. It shows us how we can aspire to constantly push our boundaries and achieve what others may think impossible, whether it is small day to day things or something as grand as doing an ironman in Antarctica-something that no one else has done. Thank you Yes Theory for continuing to bring people together through sharing stories. Your message shows that no matter what we are struggling with, we can do it.",False
17,5,For whom was this made?,rgkqgbg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love Yes Theory and Seek Discomfort as much as the next person. For whom was this film made? If you weren't a huge Yes Theory fan already, you wouldn't be in the cinema, and the film was certainly not compelling enough for extreme sports fans. I wanted to watch Anders' tribulations and trials, and I also wanted to watch the rôle of Yes Theory in making this all happen. Yes, much of that was covered on YouTube, but then why make a cinema release in the first place? This will appeal neither to Yes Theory fans nor to people who love films about mountain climbing, arctic sports, & cetera. The only glimmer of hope was the scene when Matt and Amman sponsored Anders. A truly lost opportunity. Sorry guys.",False
18,10,Most inspirational movie of 2022,nickarriola-58709,n/a,16/08/2025,The process and journey that Anders and his crew went thorough is a testament to what the human mind and body is capable of. Through faith and an unwavering attitude of work and collaboration they were able to achieve something that was once thought imposible. I say they because you will come to learn that it took a small village of dreamers and doers to not only get across that finish line but also get this film on the big screen. I was personally fortunate enough to attend the premier of this film and I must say every human in this world has something to learn from this film.Ammar / Anders / and everyone else involved in this project you guys did something amazing.,False
19,10,Limits are Perceptions,coled-36788,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was absolutely amazing! I have watched this movie 5 times. Each time I saw it I was absolutely blown away. The message is one that everyone needs to hear!I am inspired by this movie. All my friends that have seen it are blown away. We all walked away thinking about what limits we are putting on ourself. We are setting new goals and going big.I have been following Yes Theory for a while now. They continue to inspire me. They also continue to exceed my expectations. I can't wait to see what they will do next, and how they are going to inspire others.On a personal note. I know they are going to do great things. And if more people saw their stuff they would be inspired.",False
20,10,2 HOUR DOCUMENTARY WITH A POWERFUL MESSAGE,sraza-27856,n/a,16/08/2025,"This 2 hour documentary is an absolute MASTERPIECE. The powerful message that this journey upholds is beyond inspirational. The documentary is suitable for all ages and demographics. However, there are curse words here and there but nothing too vulgar or profane. The amount of dedication and commitment and mental toughness it must have took to accomplish this project is something out of a movie. The only difference is this is not a movie this is REAL LIFE. This man made history by completing an IRONMAN in Antarctica. He deserves recognition beyond the norm and I hope this powerful message circulates all around the world and reaches every person with a dream and a vision.",False
21,10,PROJECT ICEMAN,pirellisumner,n/a,16/08/2025,I would definitely recommend watching this it is very inspiring to young people and is just an amazing film showing what he came from nothing to actual getting permission to going to do the iceman. I saw this at the London premiere and it was a wonderful experience watching and is one of the best documentary Yes theory has done. When it comes out to the public watch it. My favourite part was him finishing the iceman you can feel the excitement of it and it gives of a really happy effect. I would definitely be watching it multiple times. A lot of people put effort in to this documentary and it really really shows it of thank you.,False
22,10,Life changing,anniekleppers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Never have I seen a documentary this life changing. Watching the movie makes you realize how hard it was to achieve this, not only physically and mentally.Anders proves that limitations are perceptions. I will never ever listen to others people telling me what I can do and what I can't do. Dream big.Also big up for the story line and way of storytelling. Having his family included in the movie makes it feel like you know Anders and everything that has happened in his life. Watching the end made me emotional 'cause I could feel his pain and the stuff that he had to go through.However I am still curious what happened to the boat, haha.",False
23,10,Awesome,bporumb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Superb documentary about what it means to be human and overcome all the perceived (visible and invisible) barriers in life to create change, make an impact and leave the world a better place.We are (not 'can be', but 'ARE') all superheroes if we believe in ourselves and do the right thing (whatever that means for each of us individually).Congratulations to Anders, Ammar and the rest of the team for pulling off this massive project. Well done guys! I truly hope this movie is shown to as many people out there and eventually wins some well-deserved awards (who knows, maybe even an Oscar :-) ).",False
24,10,Extraordinary story,psmhulsenboom,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing story that proves that limitations are perceptions. It shows how easily your mind can take away your dreams and goals but in the same time you and your company can achieve it when you just believe enough and surround yourself with the right people. Everything made possible by yes theory, one of my favorite YouTube channels. Saw the movie in a premiere in Amsterdam and met the crew and Anders himself, was truly a wonderful and inspiring event to watch it all together! Must see and really needs to win some awards. When you're able to watch it in Denmark of US in a cinema, go for it! Hope to see it again in the Netherlands!",False
25,10,Project Iceman (Inspiration),sschueler-06147,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredible documentary following Anders, directed by one of the most inspiring individuals Ammar. This film has something for everyone, it will inspire you to find your own goals and iceman in your own life. The film is a roller coaster and will leave you feeling like there's no time to waste to chase your dreams. The process of making this film was an incredible journey to watch as well, Yes Theory documents moments relating to Anders that resonate with not only the Yes fam community, but anyone looking to push past their comfort zone. You don't have to be a part of Yes Theory to understand the importance of this film. Definitely Oscar worthy.",False

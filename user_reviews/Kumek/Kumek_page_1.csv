1,1,"Very disappointing ""documentary""",moviefreak00,n/a,16/08/2025,"As this was supposed to be a documentary, I was expecting something much more documented, creative and definitely way more serious, so i was totally disappointed after watching it. This more or less represents author's own reflection and thoughts on the character and work of Milan Bandic and not much more than that. The documentary doesn't contain any information or details that weren't already covered by the media long time ago and if i may say in a much more professional way, there aren't any credible interviews, hidden footage, leaked documents, photos - anything ""juicy"" that would make the documentary at least a little more interesting. And because of all the above, the documentary does not leave any positive impression, nor any emotion on me as a viewer. The documentary seems unprofessional, cheap and unfinished, so I really don't understand why it took the author so long to finally finish it.All in all, I truly believe that this documentary is at the level of an average high school assignment, and by no means the work of a professional director.",False

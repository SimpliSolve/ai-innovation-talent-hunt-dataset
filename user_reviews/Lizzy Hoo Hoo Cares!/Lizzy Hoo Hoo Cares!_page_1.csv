1,6,Solid,ChrisaRafa,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was a solid first introduction to the world.She is a very likeable woman, who seems to really love comedy, really try to make it in this very hard industry.She lucks experience but I think that in time she will have it too and will find her place in comedy.I only have one thing bothered me.Well, actually not bothered, concerned is the more appropriate word to describe it.Her style kind reminded me of Ali Wong, especially the glasses.And it is unfair for Lizzy to compare her with another comedian and especially with Wong.And it's because I really find Lizzy more likeable and sweeter than Ali that I'm saying this.Lizzy seems to really love comedy so I hope that she will find her own unique style and conquer the world.We need more women in comedy and she could be a good addition.",False

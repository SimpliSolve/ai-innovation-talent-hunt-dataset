1,7,Poignant & Delightful: Just go in for what it is.,samxxxul,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just caught ""Where Are We Headed?"" and it's seriously good. I dig Ruslan Fedotov's works - ""Away"" and ""Salamanca"" were good, and this one's right up there. It's got this interesting vibe, like there's something magical hiding in the Moscow's subterranean arteries. There's a distinct, almost ethereal quality that Fedotov captures, revealing moments of quiet intrigue within the quotidian reality of the subway. More than the absurd and the magical moments, you also get to glimpse of melancholy, such as the poignant image of a solitary figure witnessing New Year's fireworks from the confines of the train.You see all sorts of random things happening - Santa showing up, even these paratrooper guys meeting American soldiers down there, which was wild. And there's this really nice shot at the end of an older couple on the train, which was both happy and a little sad at the same time. You get a lot of those moments watching all these different people, you know, locals, immigrants, everyone just hopping on and off the metro.Against the sonic backdrop of the train's rhythmic clatter and the announcements of approaching stations, we are afforded a voyeuristic glimpse into the subtle nuances of this underground world. The New Year's thing in the subway was neat to watch, and there are these little bits where people start playing music, which kept things interesting even though there's no real story or main characters. Oh yeah, and there's this quick shot of a dude walking with his cat just chilling on his head! Seriously, if you get a chance to check this out, you probably won't be bummed.",False

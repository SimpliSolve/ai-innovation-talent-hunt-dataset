1,2,Not worth your time really,lodger1313-782-58547,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an example of a bad, poorly made, poorly researched and downright cruddy music doc. There are lots of mistakes (they mis-identify Vince Taylor as the Legendary Stardust Cowboy, they play the 1967 version of Space Oddity while captioning it as the 1969 version.) The only thing this doc has to make it worthwhile is clips of Bowie talking (most of which you can see elsewhere), and Midge Ure also provides pertinent commentary. Also fun is watching the horribly mis-translated closed captioning... Most of what this says about Bowie is just wrong. Please do yourself a favor and watch any other Bowie doc - and - if you're feeling daring, watch Moonage Daydream... that's the Bowie doc with the most complex yet pertinent look at Bowie's life, career and, most importantly, thoughts. This is the equivalent of clickbait garbage.",False

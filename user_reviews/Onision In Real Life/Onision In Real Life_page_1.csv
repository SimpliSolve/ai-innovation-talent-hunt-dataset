1,5,Whh,deysivargas,n/a,16/08/2025,It ok. YouTubers have done better job at reporting on Onision. If you really have no idea what's going on them I guess this is a good heads up on it. Over all it's ok.,False
2,5,Important work but unethical methods,CRMas0n,n/a,16/08/2025,"While it is important to get the story of what this man has done out to the mainstream, the way in which Hanson's team has gone about this is questionable.
While consent to use the stories of his victims is not legally required, some of the people featured in this film did respectfully ask not to be included. Hanson did make an effort to disguise their identity but it is not difficult to work out.
If you want to get the whole story then a youtuber by the name of Repzion has been covering this for years. Jacklyn Glenn is another good source along with Blaire White.
Greg Jackson (Onision) is dangerous and twisted. Please check your daughters YouTube subscriptions and if they follow him take the time to sit them down and explain just how this monster manipulates his young female audience. If not you may find they are in very real danger of being exploited, groomed, manipulated and ultimately used.",False
3,7,"Don't believe all the ""1"" ratings",cydnier,n/a,16/08/2025,"The ""1"" reviews seem to be written by the same person or group of persons. The documentary is well done. The attacks on it are unfounded. The reviewers obviously don't like how Greg/James/Onision Jackson is being portrayed and their negative reviews have nothing to do with the documentary itself.In this documentary, you'll learn that Greg/James/Onison is a misogynistic piece of garbage that physically and mentally abuses women. He's done it to multiple women and should be held accountable.",False
4,1,"Skip, just go watch the videos on YouTube",noravalkrie,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is an absolute mess. It's so disjointed and just...awfully made. There were girls who didn't want their stories told, but they were disrespected and told anyways. There's better coverage of this issue on YouTube. Skip the paywalls and watch on YouTube instead.",False
5,1,Horrified,chaosbleeds,n/a,16/08/2025,"Youtubers have for years tried to tell this story and get justice for the victims. The victims interviewed by youtubers gave their consent to be filmed and interviewed. Then Chris Hansen comes along, gathers all the info and sells it forward. Victims asking, begging not to be shown on tv, not to have their story and trauma prodcasted on tv, yet no one cares what the victims want.And funnily, no mention of the fact that the evidence against Onision, the only proper evidence that could have put him in jail was misplaced by none other then Chris Hansen.A documentary that takes advantage of victims, promotes a girl with a serious eating disorder, takes clips of youtubers without asking and villainess the YouTube community and still Discovery+ has the nerve to send out emails asking youtubers to promote this?In the end Onision is the winner. He must enjoy this mess and being able to use this as ""evidence"" for his fan base how everything is twisted and filled with lies and corruption.Way to go Discovery+ and Chris Hansen.
If one of the victims who did not give consent to have their trauma be shown on tv ends up going over the edge and killing themselves from the forced reliving of the trauma and re-victimisation, the blood will be on your hands.",False
6,8,"Believe The Victims, Not The Predator",KittyKatPawz777,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes, this has been covered extensively on Youtube already, but Chris Hansen and others are working to get these women's stories heard in an even broader arena. The abuse the women and girls endured at the hands of Onision is a travesty, and Youtube is doing nothing about it, which is even worse. It is definitely worth investigating and the documentary was gripping, disturbing and infuriating. I hope there will be justice done someday. Although Kai may have been involved in the crimes, I am still very concerned for him/them. His/their disappearance is very suspicious and I hope he/they are safe and will be able to tell his/their side of the story one day. Onision appeare to be a narcissistic psychopath and belongs in jail. He's this generation's answer to Charles Manson and Ted Bundy in behavior as well as looks.
I rated this docuseries an 8 because I believe it is well put-together although slightly sensationalistic. I hope the victims will be at peace when this monster is finally put behind bars for life.",False
7,1,Chris Hansen disappointed me,fattyfatfatboytoy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would like for people not to accuse other reviewers of being Onision. He's, thankfully, not been active on the internet since he got demonetised. There's no reason for him to lurk in the shadows of this website.--------It's so so bad. Hansen takes cred for things he should not have taken cred for. YouTubers were misrepresented. The only good thing to come out of this is Onisions demonetization.In addition I would like to point out that those claiming that ""drama tubers are salty"" take the following into consideration: This is all about the victims, nothing else.I have seen some people submit misinformation to the trivia section. Do not do this.",False
8,8,so nice to see greg finally get his in the msm.,jinx_malone,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dramatubers and their one-starring stans aside, this doc does a great job introducing the general public to the dumpster fire that is onision. he always wanted to be famous, and now? he really is. just not in the way he intended. a sexual predator and serial abuser who was allowed to not only exist, but to thrive on youtube, greg is finally getting what he deserves-the spotlight.enjoy your infamy, waterhead.",False
9,1,Horrendous!!!,scentlessapprentice-12389,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't get me wrong, Onision is a human pile of garbage but the way they went about this documentary is nothing more than a political power move. Mostly to silence one more content creator on the YouTube platform and to give the irrelevant Chris Hansen a few extra bucks to pay off his never ending debt with the IRS.",False
10,1,False in Nearly Every Aspect,jenluvs-29000,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, this whole mess is wrong! As an avid youtube viewer, I watched YouTube creaters bring awarenesses on Oninsion for years before Hansen pretended he did it all! So that is false, Hansen did nothing but exploit victims and sell THEIR stories that they did NOT give consent to!
Second, Chris Hansen did nothing more than steal what the youtube community worked years on and sell it for a profit! If you want a REAL point of view where victims come forward WITH CONSENT, just watch Repzilla, Edwin's Generation, Jaclyn Glynn, and so so so many others who worked hard to bring awareness about this predator online and they actually have consent and speak truthfully about this situation.
All this is, is a lie, an exaggeration of Chris Hansen's role and downplay of the people who actually did the work that Hansen sold! That is all this is, a Chris Hansen glorified savior film that discredits the people who actually did the work and exploiting victims without consent! My take, just go to YouTube and watch the real interviews by real people with real stories and real facts, because this is not it!",False
11,1,Trash and Incorrect.,ives-59798,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some of the ten star reviewers in the comments appear to misunderstand where the 1 stars are coming from. I don't support Onision, never have, but everything in this doc is wrong, and it was likely made to stroke Chris Hansen ego instead of to support the victims. There are better places to find info if you want it (and for free too)",False
12,10,Do not listen to 1 star reviews,meljheiser-54253,n/a,16/08/2025,These are petty you tubers mad their videos on onision didn't get the same attention. The documentary is good and exposes a dangerous person on the internet who prays on young girls. It also has gotten onision de-monetized from YouTube. It's going good.,False
13,1,Money grab on the back of victims/survivors,FvckDH,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've kept with this story on YouTube for a while now; Nothing but misinformation very disgusting.
I recommend these YouTubers' for accurate information, Repzion has been covering it for roughly 9 years. Edwin Generations/Homeboy Got Receipts and Repzilla very good info and unbiased opinions with interviews with survivors.",False
14,9,"Disturbing, but well done documentary",reneemoehn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just finished this documentary and it was incredibly eye opening and disturbing. This guy's channel needs to be shut down immediately and criminal charges be filed. I follow makeup and beauty bloggers, so this type of account is foreign to me. His content and what he did to those girls is disgusting. You can't tell me all of that was just an act and not real. He even lied about his own father. As for the negative reviews, I don't understand--I thought the information was presented in a very compelling way, plus they interviewed all kinds of experts and victims alike. People who didn't want to be shown were kept anonymous. Highly recommend for parents to watch.",False
15,1,Lies,mcartoons-23620,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary lies about every little thing and there is much more wrong about it .i recommend dont watch it .watch a proper documentary not a documentary making profit out of soneones trauma,False
16,3,A Balanced View from an Outsider.,heratyplant,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone who's too old to have been an Onision subscriber, I was nonetheless interested to see this, as I've seen & heard of him, but didn't really know what all the fuss was about.The first half of the first episode was enough to get Greg's story & fill in the blanks I'd been missing, so if you're in the same boat as me, you can leave from around there, as you can feel it going downhill rapidly thereafter.As a European, I barely know Chris Hansen, but just enough to know what he's done in the past is highly dubious, regardless of his motives & hearing him talk, he makes me extremely uncomfortable & he seems very odd. Investigating Greg in this way seems quite excessive & giving him an importance that isn't warranted; this in the end says more about Hansen than anyone else. In Europe, all those concerned here are 'of age' so the accusations are meaningless & overblown in any event.Dip in for 15 minutes, then wash your hands & leave is my best advice.",False
17,1,Wtf,tabeeb-85352,n/a,16/08/2025,Go to YouTube and watch all the information there. Such a waste of time,False
18,10,This is a great series,ctschneider,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't know the motivation behind all the one star reviews, but as someone who had never even heard of this Onision person beforehand, this docu-series is fascinating. Terrible person, but the story is truly a ""truth is stranger than fiction"" tale. It reminds me of the Silk Road docu-series that A&E had years ago. Its well done and tells the story in a logical way.",False
19,1,Defamatory and containing unethically sourced material,maria-82365,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTo begin with, it contains many inaccuracies and exaggerations which have been debunked with credible evidence. Since this production depicts someone as a criminal in the absence of any charges, let alone a conviction, it is defamatory. Presumably the intention is to set a precedent, which should not be encouraged.Secondly, it lacks any structure and at least half of the participants have never even met the people discussed/targeted in this ""documentary"".Thirdly, it combines very serious accusations with irrelevant comedy skits, which is in extremely poor taste, leaving the viewer unable to take anything seriously, when such material is abundantly used.Additionally, it features unwilling participants, who had expressed their wish to not be featured at all, and were promised that wouldn't happen. It also makes use of deceptively redacted material (edited tweets) presented as original, which isn't only mendacious but also lazy.And finally, the ""piece de resistance"", Chris Hansen, is known to work with a deranged doxer, to harass his online detractors, scam his own audience and promote a number of fraudsters, in the past year alone.In conclusion, this is only worth watching in order to study the level of deception employed by its creators. It would be a textbook example of how not to make a documentary.",True
20,10,"Really compelling, I wish there were more episodes",kirkcollm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had not heard of this person or story until this documentary.I truly enjoyed learning more about both, I honestly wish there were more than 4 episodes. I could not get enough and subsequently have tried to learn more about the situation.A very interesting documentary with a storytelling arch that keeps you engaged and interested. I think the fact that the story itself lends to having lots of actual video from the individuals in the documentary helps to share out insights you wouldn't normally find.",False
21,1,Horribly Done,lizzywarnes,n/a,16/08/2025,Your better off just watching one of the many VERY WELL DONE documentaries done by people on the platform like The Right Opinion and j aubrey,False
22,1,Just Icky,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"Onision is a gross slob, but even worse is Chris Hansen; that he duped Lifetime into aiding him in his ridiculous tactics is nothing short of insane.Hansen has doxxed and threatened people, exploited victims and all in the name of 'journalisming, yay!'. Hansen does everything he can to detract from the facts of his own predatory behavior, along with hiring people who will follow right along with his unethical and illegal actions with no ramifications whatsoever.Hansen has never once had anything close to results when it comes to Onision, and Lifetime has now contributed to his coffers while doing nothing that contributes to the apprehension of a predator known as Greg Jackson, while bilking countless people out of GoFundMe donations, dodged the IRS, and skirted charges of illegalities.If you want REAL details on this debacle, go to YouTube and watch Jon Swann, or any of the other legitimate contributors in the ethos. Skip this nonsense.",False
23,1,Should Have Never Been Made,izarallialoveslevora,n/a,16/08/2025,This had the feel of one of Shane Dawson's documentaries. Not to mention it was full of so much fall information that has already been proven false way before the documentary was released.,False
24,10,Great documemtary,aspacenibba,n/a,16/08/2025,Please not take negative reviews with a grain of salt it's either some drama tube fan or Greg himself. If you unaware who exactly onision is the documentary gives a good primer as to what he is. Watch for yourself and come to your own conclusions,False
25,5,Go watch some actual evidence,thetomatomaster,n/a,16/08/2025,On YouTube FOR FREE is a three part series by The Right Opinion that does way better than this mess as breaking down Onision in all aspects of life. Nice try though D+,False

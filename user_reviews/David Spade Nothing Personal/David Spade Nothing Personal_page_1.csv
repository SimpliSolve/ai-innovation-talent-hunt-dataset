1,7,Spade is Always Funny,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"David Spade's hysterical return to Netflix, post Pandemic, is great. David is intelligent, funny, and self-effacing. This one has me crying. David tells a variety of stories. His attention to detail and his ability to craft stories about his life, his families, travels, and career make him very watchable. David has been around a long time but stays fresh and funny with new material.",False
2,6,"""Adam's not gonna like this.""",classicsoncall,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSandler, that is. But they're buddies, so he's probably OK with it. I was expecting something funnier from David Spade so some disappointment began setting in about the half way mark. He telegraphed his political leanings with observations on Covid vaccines and Dr. Fauci, and that's OK with me because I feel pretty much the same. But the timing felt off with some of his stories and observations; crabs in the hotel room was just one example. I wasn't counting on the free flow of gutter language either, so that was a minus. I think Spade is capable of so much better, but his static delivery seemed almost tired, and for a comedy special, a little bit more would be called for.",True
3,6,"Nothing Personal, David",nebohr,n/a,16/08/2025,David had some uniquely funny material. Just the right amount of angst. And most of the now mandatory self-deprecating material was OK. But my wife and myself are in agreement that this particular show was not his best work.,False
4,4,same jokes from 6+ years ago,rrivera646,n/a,16/08/2025,"David spade has always been a great comedian, but he's been using these jokes for years. If this is the first time watching spade, then these jokes are a hit. Thought this special was from 7 years ago.",False
5,1,Wow..... Hard to watch,sglow1972,n/a,16/08/2025,"Damn, I actually felt sorry for him. Barely any laughs from the audience. Every time joke didn't land... water bottle time. This was the best taped show for his Netflix special? Can't imagine the shows that didn't make it. I was actually embarrassed for him.",False
6,4,I guess you have to be a fan,Nevergivea10,n/a,16/08/2025,This is one of those shows where you have to be a David Spade fan to like. I think he's okay and that's basically my review of this special. I laughed a few times but the people in the audience were hysterical. To each his own.,False
7,8,Never Short on Comedy,estathena2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Only David Spade can make Covid funny & take shots at Fauci that make me giggle! Sarcastic, sardonic, & always the quick-witted charming school boy that propelled him to fame.David Spade is still naughty, topical, & thoughtfully funny.",False
8,2,Fame is wasted on the famous,rmmil,n/a,16/08/2025,"You know the old saying, ""youth is wasted on the young"", I'd like to add to that saying: Fame is wasted on the famous.David Spade has had a very long career.in the entertainment industry, but you wouldn't know it from watching this comedy special.It's like he wrote a set around 2003, and then just never updated it since then. Dick pic jokes, really? In 2022?The audience was as low energy as David's performance, it does not bode well for his tour if this Minnesota quiet audience was the best taping they had.David has dated some of the most beautiful women in the world, is best friends with Adam Sandler, spent more time with Chris Farrelly than any other human, but jokes about waiters overcharging for fish is the best he can do for anecdotes about his life. What a waste of fame.",False
9,n/a,Audience was garbo,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hey Spade, drop your agent or whoever had the bright idea to do this in MINNESOTA. The brainlets watching this at home don't know to laugh unless the live audience does, and will give up because that crowd was too sober and just not in the right mood to have a good time.I found myself cracking up at the moments you bombed despite the jokes being hilarious and well delivered. 8/10.",False
10,1,Absolute Stupidity. Terrible.,jamesawheat,n/a,16/08/2025,"Funny is great no matter what the subject, but this guy doesn't even know what he's aiming at. Too Short - He begins with talking about a hug - ""That's how Paranoid I am """,False
11,1,Never even smiled,anhaveit,n/a,16/08/2025,This was the biggest mistake ever. And a complete waste of time and money. Don't bother with this unoriginal jokes and just not funny at all avoid this one .,False
12,3,This was very mid,stylss,n/a,16/08/2025,Felt like only a few jokes landed and I laughed maybe once or twice. You can probably skip this one unless you're a die hard David Spade fan. This was very mid.,False
13,10,Genius,b4blue,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a huge fan. I mostly know him from one of my favourite sitcoms, ""Rules of engagement"". This is a standup that really shows his style of comedy. There is no political crap. Everyone can enjoy it.",False
14,2,I needed a laugh and watched 23 minutes and 20 seconds - not 1 laugh from me,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am beyond disappointed in this ""Special"". Nothing Personal is most certainly nothing personal - at all. I seriously watched it for 23 minutes and 20 seconds and absolutely nothing came close to being funny (for me). I gave this 2 stars because I expect a hella lot more from David Spade. And I got squat. Shouldda given him zero stars - same as the laughs I got.Did he really think he was funny??",False
15,2,Was this a repeat??,kmr-22308,n/a,16/08/2025,"What has happened? Covid, once again, ruining everything. Love Spade, but has he and Netflix forgotten the last special or two? So many jokes we've all heard many times before. Weird.",False
16,4,"Nothing new, low budget",kimberlya7,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely love David Spade. However, this is not his best work. From his clothing, to the material, to the filmography and the laugh tracks, it was a let down. I've heard 90% of this previously and you can tell not a lot of money for filming or editing was put into it. Sorry, I'd pass on this. Still a fan David!",False
17,4,Nothing Personal but Nothing Very Funny Either,seavu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I needed some good laughs and wanted to like this but . . . The humor was generally juvenile, sexist and dated, much of it simply fell flat, his timing and delivery were off and seem to need work. There were some laughs, but they were few and far between. Here's hoping he can up his game and material before any new specials.",False
18,10,Spade rocks!,billyllewis,n/a,16/08/2025,I've been a long time follower of David Spade and his comedy is always on point. Listen to his memoir on audio to really get to know the guys backstory. Humble beginnings and a comic for the every day man and woman IMO.,False
19,4,On par with a business dinner with a personable salesman,haveanothertwo,n/a,16/08/2025,"This whole set reminded me of the rehearsed stories and banter of old school software salesmen after a few drinks. It's entertaining from these guys, but I expect more from a filmed special.At least on Netflix you can pause or bail out at will.",False
20,5,Please someone explain what that sound is at the end ( 0:2:30 ish left),orcinussr,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, I do like DS, but this was an extremely poor special - retooled jokes and, to be entirely candid, more than a few were problematic - overall this was extremely awkward and clunky with very little redeeming qualities.",False
21,4,weak,faithless4734,n/a,16/08/2025,Story after boring story. If you are interested in elaborate but completely inaccurate stories about david's life then this is the show for you. However if you are looking for a laugh and some comedy then this is not the show for you.,False
22,3,Meh,bgar-80932,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis special had a few funny jokes but overall is uninspired. I had a good laugh about a couple of jokes but nothing special. I like the guy though so despite the 3 I didn't hate it. He's still funny but the whole COVID jokes and everything aren't hitting and then he did have a few good jokes but it just didn't do a whole lot for me.,True
23,9,Relaxed fun!,carterdante,n/a,16/08/2025,"David Spade is great! This is a quick, fun stand up special. Spade is clearly having fun and the audience is loving it! I would love to see him making more specials.",False
24,2,Painful,ShadowsBeneathTheLight,n/a,16/08/2025,"I used to like David Spade, but this was painful to watch. You know it's going to be a bad special when the first 10 minutes is about dealing with covid lockdowns and why we should never hug or shake hands ever again. I kept waiting for the funny. It never arrived, and instead I was treated to an hour of a middle age man telling mediocre stories doing bad voices. Even the audience was struggling through this. At most it sounded like maybe 20 people out of the 500 laughing. Like I said, I used to be a fan of David Spade, but this just seemed so divorced from his usual routine. Maybe he's trying to play it safe to avoid cancel culture but dang either find new material or hang it up.",False
25,1,What a trainwreck,GirlwithFlowersandBooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show felt like when there's nothing left in your fridge, so you eat that one can of beans you've been saving just in case.I've never seen a show of his, and I definitely never will again.",False

1,10,Great journalism on display,poppz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gary & Joel shed their normal extraordinary circumstances and potential debauchery to show a truthful, nearly-uncensored (can't show everyone's faces all the time) journey into the 2025 LA Area Wildfires. They mobilize from Texas and seemingly beat FEMA from getting to the area. They get information from those in the area that have been directly affected, indirectly affected, trying to help others, and all in between. Their camera and microphone capture real takes from the people living in the area, not some press conference with teleprompters and scripts. Very well done documentary about a crazy current event.",False

3,10,Amazing Documentary,cupper-04685,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGary and Joel are exactly what people wish the media still was-honest, upfront, and fearless. They never pull punches, never hold anything back, and always put everything on the line to get the real story. This documentary is proof of just how far they're willing to go. They drove all the way from Texas to California to uncover the truth behind the devastating wildfires, refusing to settle for secondhand reports. They even risked their safety by sneaking into restricted areas to capture raw, unfiltered footage that no one else could get. From their gritty, no-nonsense show Street Gonzo to this powerful and daring documentary, Gary and Joel deliver the kind of storytelling that cuts through the noise. Gary told me how proud he is of this project-and I am just as proud of them. This film confirms what many of us already knew: they're not just incredible filmmakers, they're the kind of good, genuine people the world needs more of. 10/10.",True

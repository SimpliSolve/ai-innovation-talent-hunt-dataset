1,7,Great family show,marnie-69760,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed the remote and special places they toured. It was awesome to see a father and son in their authentic relationship. I was happy to not be entertained, but rather on the trip with them.Hope they take another trip and make a season 2.",False
2,7,Good family show and a window to the world,jisps,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like this show very much. Mom and I sit together to watch it and we enjoy learning and seeing things we had never imagined about countries that we thought we knew about. While I enjoy the show, I feel the hosts demonstrate how sheltered and privileged our lives and our young people can be in the US. The hosts try to bring depth, but they don't quite manage to.",False
3,8,1 Season is good stuff,gygnxgmw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Father and son journey into countries we always hear negative and dangerous things about. Instead this duo try to show the other side of their host land. Ethiopia, Pakistan, Lebanon , Ukraine to name a few. I very much enjoyed season 1 and look forward to longer episodes and more of them in season 2.",False
4,9,Thru the lens,bb0118,n/a,16/08/2025,"If nothing else is gained from this series, at least watch it for the beauty of the places they visit. I have a deeper appreciation for the lands, people and customs of the countries visited.I don't find the hosts glib or remotely ""insufferable"" as indicated by a few others. I can't help but wonder how different any of us would be if we had half our head blown away. Or saw it happen to a parent. It's unfathomable.I personally liked that they didn't gloss over small debates or disagreements along the way. Like them or not, they take the viewer on an adventure we wouldn't otherwise get to participate in, even if only vicariously.Solid series that travel enthusiasts should at least check out.",False
5,10,Authentic travel,epace-03530,n/a,16/08/2025,"The themes speak for themselves. Outside of that it's authentic, which is the most important thing.",False
6,10,Travels and Tales,Sweeti6639,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed seeing so many different parts of the world explored. They visit Colombia, Papua New Guinea, Ethiopia, Lebanon, Pakistan, and Ukraine. I thought the host had an interesting story and it was nice to see him connecting with his son and daughter while they traveled the world.",False
7,10,Great Show!,ljcarlson-28239,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed seeing so many parts of the world that are not normally shown. It was wonderful to see the beauty in Pakistan, Lebanon, Columbia, etc that aren't shown on tv. I think the best part was seeing how Bob Woodruff interacted with his son Mack and vice versa and the people around them. The relationship between them and his daughter is amazing. The reasoning behind this show and why he kept doing his job after his accident was inspiring.",False
8,5,Great idea but hosts are lacking,sodapopevans,n/a,16/08/2025,"I agree with other reviews I have read. I really enjoy the idea on stories, however the hosts are not engaging or entertaining at all. Hosts in my view need to add value to the program, this father and son team are nice enough but they distract from the show in my view.",False
9,9,"a positive, fun show to watch",happy_quadruped,n/a,16/08/2025,"As somebody who occasionally watched Bob Woodruff as a reporter, I had a degree of nostalgia watching this. More than that, though, it's a great concept for a show - he spent a lot of time reporting on various problems in other countries, and now he's trying to highlight other countries' best qualities. It's a sort of righting of the cosmic scale, at least so far as he can accomplish.The itineraries are quite interesting and you feel more or less like somebody on the trip with them. Sometimes their reactions are not the most polished, so I see why others felt that they seemed a bit like privileged outsiders, but ultimately I think they succeed in the show's stated goal of showing the humanity of the people they're visiting. They're likable people too.The videos are sometimes quite stunning as well - now I really want to visit Papua New Guinea!",False
10,2,Insufferable Hosts,sophson-99740,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a shame that they go to interesting places and meet with fascinating people, but the hosts come across as glib, self-centered people who just try to be funny or clever (and fail at both). There should be way more focus on the locals, rather than on the hosts.",False
11,5,Yes but,jim-roupie,n/a,16/08/2025,Amazing videos but not real life. Big budget with luxury conditions,False

1,10,I don't care,Skylightmovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTo entertain any criticism of this film.The low rating here is irrelevant.The finger pointing at certain races, cultures and creed is irrelevant.What one should take away from this is a universal truth - trauma breeds trauma. Cruelty and abuse knows no limits. Evil will subjugate and shred the innocent. Evil has no soul and lives in the moment of the devil's playground . And it is in every establishment, every privileged group or exclusive club . Its members are protected by msm's mind control and fear propaganda directed incessantly at each new generation.The purity of youth and their gifts of creativity and sovereignty are quashed as the controllers thwart their lives and feed on their subsequent hopelessness and depression;until we get to the stage where the youth comply to evil willingly because they know of little else.Vega's documentary gives us much food for thought.To rage against the machine wastes our precious energy.To spread integrity, care and concern to everyone you meet is the only way forward. We are in too deep but an army of non compliance will, in time, set the next generation free.We are sovereign, we know what is right.We must ask and we will be rewarded with the power to self care. The information is out there. Seek and ye shall find.We do not need the controlling cult that takes our young without guilt, we do not need the controlling cult that encourages us to create a world for us to hate while we consume its poison.Finally , it is not for us to be judge and jury for what has been and gone. We must find our own tribe and protect what is pure and innocent. We are not evil. And the devil knows that only too well.",True

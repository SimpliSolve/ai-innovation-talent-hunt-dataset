1,8,A good watch,mrsOGB,n/a,16/08/2025,"I binge watched this and thought it was really interesting. They both are such sweet, even tempered people, not what I was expecting. I had never heard of Tom or Tokio Hotel until he got married. Had no idea he had a twin until this show. It was fun to watch, a nice glimpse into how they live, and balance a lot of work. I really think that they are both genuinely nice, humble people. Sometimes a little too nice, especially when they are asked inappropriate questions by the media, but that just shows how much grace they have. The closing song at the end of each episode is stuck in my head now, so I think I need to listen to their albums now.",False
2,8,Nostalgic,jose_hee13,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm an old Tokio Hotel fan and this brought me such joy to watch them all grown up, and happy in their lives. I was a teen when I was a big fan and had my room plastered with posters, and then they played snippets of their old songs, it felt nostalgic in the best way possible. I never thought in a million years I'd see Heidi Klum and Tom Kaulitz would be married, but I kinda understand and I love Heidi's comments on why she loves Tom and it all comes back to them being German and fully understanding each other.Back then, I thought the age gap was huge, now I'm older and I finally understand why they left Germany so many years ago. It was just too much for them... I remember Tom's stalking incident and the perpetrators being violent... who wouldn't just want to disappear after such incident.I love when they talk about the good old days and they stay humble about their early success and how it affected them into adulthood. I feel kinda sad hearing what they went through, but I'm just happy to see them happy now. They deserve nothing but happiness and joy in life. I never got to see them live when I was a teen, I hope to change that in my adulthood as they were my first real love and first loves always have a special place in one's heart.",True
3,8,"Second season, when?",razgarcia,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI enjoyed the series so much! Bill's laughter and personality is the star of the show.There's a few things I wish they fleshed out more though for the benefit of new fans: (1) Bill's journey to stardom since his It's raining men performance, (2) how they met Georg and Gustav, (3) Bill's decision to come out, (3) Tom's new life -- hope he will let us in more in case there is a second season. He's quite reserved here. (4) More activities between the twins - I love everytime they cook on their lives. Hope they can bring the chaotic energy as well in the series.Basically, most of the episodes revolves around Bill. Tom didn't allow them to record in their home so I guess it's because of that.I love the OST too called Home. I'll start streaming their new songs because of that.",True
4,10,Watching Bill and Tom makes me happy,mskatysleta,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew of TH, witnessed the love and hate, heard a few songs. All when I was basically a child myself.Watching them as adults and seeing who they have become is unexpectedly great. They are two genuine people, very witty, with open hearts and open minds. Their brotherly dynamic is interesting too. They are both very self-aware and aware of all the people around them, how they feel, what they are worried about. It was very refreshing to see two young men who are so different and living in the world where others people genuinely matter. We can all use a bit more of this.It was entertaining to watch them, and it made me feel good - something I really needed in the world of wars and presidential debates. Thank you, and I really wish Bill and Tom all the best. Let all your dreams come true.",False
5,10,It feels good and takes me to happy place,nicoinspace,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its a feel good show! Fun twin dynamic...with lots of loving banter and jokes. The Kaulitz Brothers give us a close look into their private live in Los Angeles. But its not only about LA, the twins travel to a lot of different locations, they show their celebrity lifestyle and in between you find some serious topics as well. Sometimes they seem like next door neighbors and sometimes they act very far from this world. You see a high production value like you would expect from a Netflix documentary. If you love the band Tokio Hotel its a must if you like light entertainment ...just enjoy! Hope they will get a second season!",False
6,10,Extremely Enjoyable and A Must Watch.,mandarintst,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just finished binge watching S1 and really loved their stories, challenges and above all, love of life sense of humor.A very well done first season and one of the best non-scripted series on Netflix.I had never heard of Tokyo Hotel before and unaware of their super stardom history in Germany and throughout
Europe. Need to see how Bill's life move forward as well as them spending more quality time together. Would like
to see a bit more of their concert performances as only a few glimpses.MUST be a S2 so Tom, please get on-board with this. Hope Bill's liver makes it through another season.",False
7,4,Voiceover horror,jaclynbilling,n/a,16/08/2025,"The constant voice over of this series was horrible and made it hard very hard to watch.Not one aspect of this show does not have a voice over, even the sit down interviews. Who ever decided to voice over the entire series made a mistake that wrecked it for me and I had to stop watching due to the frustration of this.It made me feel like I was watching a non English tv show that had been converted to English to adapt to a wider audience, not an American series.Show would be a lot better if this was just removed! At least then I might of made it over the first episode, even after giving it a really good go.",False
8,10,Absolutely loved this,brigitte-leroux,n/a,16/08/2025,"I want to join this family! I was thoroughly entertained by the Kaulitz twins. This series gave a fascinating glimpse into Tom and Bill's lives, showing their deep brotherly bond and infectious sense of humor. They shared stories and personal experiences with charm, making me eager to hear more. I just wish we saw a bit more of Heidi and her kids! Despite their fame, they came across as genuine and down-to-earth. The production quality was top-notch, balancing light-hearted moments with real conversations. It was a fantastic introduction to Tokio Hotel as I didn't know much about them before, and it showcased why they have such a dedicated fan base. I enjoyed every minute and am now a fan!",False
9,10,I absolutely love it!!!!,smartytart2002,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched the 1st 2 episodes of that series on Netflix last night & I really love it!!!!,I have been a Fan of Tokio hotel since 2008 & it's very cool that the kaulitz twins have their own reality series although there's English subtitles when they speak German & They been living their lives both in L. A. & Germany. Tom's wife Heidi have appeared in that series & It seems that Bill is looking for mr. Right while he's on the dating app,I think he's happy with his sexuality. I'll be watching it on Netflix after I saw the trailer on YouTube & I gave it 10 stars because The Kaulitz twins r very cute!!!!",False
10,10,Rediscovering Tokio Hotel - A Journey of Warmth and Laughter,avucic-44373,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a young teenager when Tokio Hotel first burst onto the scene, I never found myself particularly drawn to their music or their image. They were a significant part of the pop culture landscape, but they never captured my interest. Fast forward fifteen years, and I found myself scrolling through Netflix, when I stumbled upon a show featuring none other than Bill and Tom Kaulitz. This unexpected encounter brought a wave of nostalgia, and I decided to give it a shot, curious to see how my perception might have changed over the years.From the moment the show began, I was hooked. Bill and Tom Kaulitz, the iconic twins of Tokio Hotel, have evolved into captivating personalities who radiate a unique blend of warmth, humor, and authenticity. Their dynamic is a fascinating study in contrasts - Despite their differences, or perhaps because of them, they complement each other perfectly, creating a compelling and engaging presence on screen.What struck me most was the depth of their bond. As twins, their connection runs deep, and it's evident in every interaction. They share an innate understanding and a playful camaraderie that is both heartwarming and entertaining to watch. Their ability to balance their individual identities while supporting and enhancing each other's strengths is a testament to their close-knit relationship.The show itself is a delightful mix of behind-the-scenes glimpses into their lives, candid conversations, and moments of pure fun. It's filled with laughter, poignant reflections, and an overarching sense of genuine warmth. Bill and Tom invite viewers into their world with an openness that is both refreshing and endearing. They discuss their past experiences, the highs and lows of fame, and their journey of personal growth with remarkable honesty.One of the standout aspects of the show is how it captures their individuality. Bill's artistic flair and charismatic presence shine through, whether he's discussing his creative process, sharing anecdotes from their early days, or simply enjoying a spontaneous moment. Tom's wit and wisdom provide a perfect counterbalance, offering insightful perspectives and grounding the narrative with his more pragmatic approach.Their contrasting yet complementary personalities make for a dynamic viewing experience. There are moments of lighthearted banter that will have you laughing out loud, balanced with deeper, more introspective discussions that offer a glimpse into their inner worlds. This blend of humor and sincerity creates a well-rounded portrayal that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.What truly captivated me was the palpable sense of warmth that permeates the show. Bill and Tom's genuine affection for each other, their fans, and their work is evident in every frame. They exude a positivity and joy that is contagious, drawing you into their story and making you feel like a part of their journey. This emotional connection is what sets the show apart, transforming it from a mere behind-the-scenes look into an inspiring narrative of growth, resilience, and enduring bonds.Watching the show was a delightful surprise, reigniting my interest in Tokio Hotel and making me appreciate them in a whole new light. Bill and Tom Kaulitz have matured into remarkable individuals whose story is both relatable and inspiring. Their journey, filled with ups and downs, triumphs and challenges, is a testament to their strength and perseverance.In conclusion, I highly recommend this show to both long-time fans and newcomers alike. It's a heartwarming, entertaining, and insightful look into the lives of two fascinating individuals who have grown and evolved in the most inspiring ways. Whether you're revisiting your teenage years or discovering them for the first time, Bill and Tom Kaulitz will undoubtedly win you over with their charm, humor, and genuine warmth. Here's to many more seasons of laughter, growth, and heartfelt moments.",False
11,10,This makes me so happy,ninadekoning,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you need more positivity in your life, this is your safe space. I am not at all a big Tokio Hotel fan (in my puberty I was though), but I absolutely love these two. The dynamic is amazing and - if you have a sibling - relatable. It is fun that Heidi is also an active participant, since we see more of Bill than Tom and Heidi functions as the only vessel that gives us a small insight into Tom's private life without Bill.Really hope this gets picked up for a Season 2, I do hope that we see more of the other members of Tokio Hotel. It kind of looks like they hardly have any interaction when they are not on tour.",False
12,10,I Love it!,aslideremenci,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was so excited while watching it that I could have gone crazy when I saw the trailer on Netflix. Since I was in Turkey, I didn't know much about the twins. I spent my childhood with them, we grew up together. This reality series made me very happy. I'm grateful to be able to see you again. I'm looking forward to the 2nd season, don't deprive us of it (I'm telling you Tom) :) Bill, your energy is so good that I finished the series in one breath. I wish you continued success, you deserve the best of everything. Thanks to you, I watched a great show. Please continue, I love you so much! <3 <3 <3.",False
13,10,Waiting for second season,valentinavallejo-57429,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed it, all of the band members are super charismatic and just watching them on his adventures is very entertaining, love Tokio Hotel! I first heard from them back in my twenties and kinda lost trace but when I knew this was gonna air on Netflix, I got excited to see the band and the twins again, how they have grown up and how they have kept true to themselves throughout the years. No wonder they have fans all over the world and the music is amazing, specially when they sing in German, hope to get more insight about their life as band, maybe the ups and downs in the second season!!!!",False
14,10,Absolutely obsessed,brbjhwh,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a huge fan of Tokio Hotel in my teenage years, I was really looking forward to this and seeing how the boys have grown and getting a glimpse into their lives.I was always a fan but never really knew anything beyond the music. It's wonderful to see how different they are yet so close as brothers. I really enjoyed getting to know them. Bill is fun, honest and funny whereas Tom is chilled, mature and loyal. Two very different brothers but the bond is real.The show doesn't just show them at home, it follows the boys as they travel and let their fans into their day to day lives. The music throughout is also very good.Each episode shows you finding out something else about them. I watched the show with subtitles due to not being able to speak German and it made no difference whatsoever. I was still very much invested on finding out what was next for them.Would love for there to be another season.",False
15,10,Love this series!,barkahe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched all eight episodes and thoroughly enjoyed it. Bill Kaulitz is such a fun guy. Absolutely loved his flirtation with the model and look forward to seeing this relationship progress. Tom is more serious with a great sense of humor. He is a devoted family man, happily married to Heidi Klum. The locations were beautiful: Los Angeles, Berlin, Hamburg, Grand Canyon, Massachusetts, Munich, etc. Laughed so hard with Bill's experience obtaining his California drivers license. The Octoberfest was a blast and the camper trip with all the mishaps was hysterical. Looking forward to season 2 of this German series.",False

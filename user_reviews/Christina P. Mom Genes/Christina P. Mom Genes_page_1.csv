1,5,I'm a mommy,justinurraopg,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a mommy it hurts me to say this wasn't good, I was looking so forward to this but it's mostly reused material and basically everything discussed on your mom's house, NONE of this is new and also just doesn't feel right a bit. Like it's a bit toxic feeling vs actually being funny...the tone and feeling is a bit cringe and trumpish while someone like Chapelle can be riding the fine line of being out of bounds but is actually extremely funny and intelligent. She should keep that energy for the podcast and not a Netflix special. I LOVE Christina P so much but this special was VERY low and loose....verryyyyyyyyyyy disappointing, atleast her podcast is consistent and good.",False
2,6,Watch her podcasts instead,AfricanBro,n/a,16/08/2025,"Christina P is one of those comedians I like because it doesn't feel like you're watching stand up, it's more like just listening to an eccentric friend of yours. Just seems like a fun person to be around, and listening to her and Tom segura's podcast makes me believe that even more. Listening to her talk about her dad and growing up in this special also just makes it make even more sense. I would buy tickets to his stand up special too. I don't know if this is her best work but it is my favorite and I think that's owing to knowing her more after watching her in ""Your mum's house"" or ""Where your moms at?"". I think she's definitely better in her podcasts than when she's doing stand up though. I wasn't really a big fan of her shows until I started listening to those. She's naturally funny and witty in her podcasts while it feels like she's trying hard to be funny in her specials, but I kinda like this one. She's the person she is on stage she is in real life and I think that's great. I wouldn't say she says the wildest things but she does say whatever she wants to and I like that and her and Tom's relationship. She's a funny person in 'real life' but that doesn't seem to fully translate into her stand up specials.",False
3,5,Podcast fan,thanksforlettingmeknow,n/a,16/08/2025,"Have been a HUGE mommy for the past 5-6 years now. I grew up with my favorite comedians being bill burr, Bert khristna, Kevin hart, kat williams, Dave chapelle, Louis C. K. (Even named my dog after him before all that stuff happened, but was quickly changed) Eddie Murphy, Chris rock, and of course my favorite of all time Tom Segura. These people truly formed my sense of humor and were a huge impact of who I am today. LOVE Christina on the pod but this I've ever watched lmao. OH GOD I already think she sounds like my god d*mn mother on the podcast every week I don't want to hear more of it lmao. Jesus CHRIST this is my mom going on stage and doing stand up like word for word this is the exact stuff my mother complains about on a daily basis. So if ya wanna hear your mother rant for a solid hour than this the special for you!! Solid watch.",False
4,n/a,Not funny and awkward to watch,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately, it's simply not funny.In stand up, making fun of others works only when it's actually funny. Here, it feels like she is saying things for lukewarm shock value, but it simply doesn't make you laugh.",False
5,7,It's an okey watch,csaszidetty,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're one of those people who gets sensitive and offended, don't watch it. And if you do decide to watch it, don't give a 1 star just because you feel offended. It's not a ted talk, it's a comedy show. It's mostly mom jokes and if you have kids it can resonate. It's not 10 star, but it's a strong 6-7.",False
6,7,Not great but hit the mark,endlessnameless-92948,n/a,16/08/2025,"Read the reviews, tells you she was over target. People getting offended about making jokes about food allergies. No, you're right, we haven't gone soft at all lol.",False
7,6,"Ok, not her best work to date",jnkochjr-74672,n/a,16/08/2025,Kinda diff from her other stuff. More physical features than I remember her usually doing. Still funny but I rem liking her last special much more. I definitely think she can be better and will eventually be great.,False
8,1,Horrendously Bad,BABSBunny24,n/a,16/08/2025,"My husband and I consider ourselves big Tom and Christina fans and we could not get through it. It was so cringey and played out. It was like hearing your senior citizen aunt get drunk on too much wine and go on a tirade about how she's a part of the best generation and kids these days, amiright? Yikes. Idk what happened to her but this was awful.",False
9,10,Funny AF,toddrosewitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anybody that doesn't like this special is severely tocked. This is by far the best material Christina P has done and she is really on her game. She is louder, crasser, and more eccentric then ever adding an explosiveness and realness to her stories. The hospital story nearly had me tearing up. It was awesome.",False
10,1,Just not good,doug-78303,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love YMH and have watched all of Christina specials, this is the worst one yet. She goes on about how toxic her parents are/were without the slightest realization she's just as toxic. Makes jokes about nut allergies, people being poor, etc. She's just punching down. It's not clever, it's not well written, and most importantly for a comedy special, it's not funny. I still love the podcast but I think this is the last Christina P special I will be watching.",False
11,10,Laughed out Loud,laura_ann_murray,n/a,16/08/2025,Never heard of her...until tonight!üòä She really resonated with me. I laughed out loud...& also cried. She is an amazing talent & my new favorite comedian!! YOU GO GIRL!!üíÉüèº,False
12,1,Terrible-had to turn it off,cmriggs-89859,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was excited to see a female comedian, and she missed the mark big time. Making fun of people with life threatening allergies, just not funny. Even her delivery about giving birth were missing a solid punchline. No wonder Netflix stock is tanking-get better content, this is trash!Save your free time and watch paint dry instead of this garbage.",False
13,1,"Google ""tired boomer mom jokes""...",KurosawaAkeeera,n/a,16/08/2025,"And her entire set would be there. Just the most basic, low effort trash you can imagine. And I used to be a HUGE fan of Your Mom's House, her podcast with her husband who's also a comedian. Everything about this is bad. Mostly alternating between bemoaning how soft people are today, while then complaining endlessly about things like people who don't eat gluten. She sounds like a whiny old boomer who's past her prime and can't deal with the fact the world is changing under her feet. And all of this could be forgiven if any of the material was funny, but it's not. There's very little that didn't make me feel extreme second hand embarrassment, much less make me laugh. Wow. Spend your time watching something better.",False
14,10,Carina P's New Special Deserves 10/10,brunokrystin,n/a,16/08/2025,I can't believe Hitler got me to cry about her mom this special. I've followed CP for years and seen her 2019 where she worked out some material that pops into Mom genes! Really a wonderful woman who advocates for resilience and farts in the face of the Man. Tommy's really going to love on her big sloppers after this killer. Heyyyyy Christinnnaaaaa!!!,False
15,3,Meh.,ILikeFunny,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's just kind of worn out jokes at this point for her. Blah blah blah, times are changing, blah blah blah, kids are weak now, everyone who isn't Gen X sucks. Alright bro.",False
16,10,WATER CHAMP???,michaelscott-82681,n/a,16/08/2025,"I will start this off by saying I thoroughly enjoyed Jeans' new special. We laughed, we cried and we called Brett Kershaw fat but you know what we didn't do? We didn't drink enough water! Tina took one Yorkie sip at the front end and discarded that full water bottle the way Bart discards a diet. Sure you hate your mom suuure young boys are animals suuuuure Brad Kreischinger is fat...we know all this, but you know what we don't know??? IS MOMMY PROPERLY HYDRATED! This is just another example of Stolen Valor and I'm calling for a full review from the water board to challenge your claim to ""WATER CHAMP"" and to seek a more appropriate title perhaps ""Water Enthusiast""? I don't know, this isn't up to me, this is in gods hands now.Much Love, no Hate.",False
17,1,there is no way,keepitgoingtolife,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is no way these high reviews are real. This was simply dull and boring. It was a one sided conversation with the audience politely laughing like you do at stupid small talk jokes out of politeness. Barely any laughs in the crowd, zero laughs here. If anyone believes that people laughed nonstop and even cried from laughing so hard, i have a bridge to sell you. Im betting her husband has a contract with netflix that requires them to give her specials too if they want his. Without him, she would never be giving time on a comedy cellar stage let alone a special on netflix. Beyond average. Open mic night.",False
18,1,Gen X has become Baby Boomers,chuckdonaldson-54341,n/a,16/08/2025,Lots of hack jokes about people in the 80s were tough and kids today are soft. It's like people forgot how ridiculous our folks were when their walk to school was uphill both ways.,False
19,9,High and Tight!,zaphroz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before I sat down to enjoy masterpiece, I took 10-12 Benadryl and kept on featherin' it throughout the entire special, nahmsayin, nahmean? Keep them high and tight, mommies!",False
20,1,Cringeworthy bad,brianjsena,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a massive stand-up comedy fan, and I've given her material several chances. But, yeeeshhh, this is unbearable to watch - this special is the worst to date. The voice, the inflection, the writing, it's pathetic.What's most offensive about it, is that Netflix commissioned this and people are laughing. For what it's worth, anyone that needs to tell you how tough and not sensitive they are... yeah... they're projecting lol.Also, bullying and close minded softball jokes aren't funny - finding the ironic layer in a situation and building tension is. Avoid this special, so we can stop perpetuating tasteless opinions.",False
21,10,Lease and a Key...,jwinter-02580,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here's the deal man, is it the greatest special, no. There are moments that are high and tight, as well as low and loose. But listen Julia, I'm a loyal mommy and I can't double pipe classic all over it...Family is Family...just let me eat ya!",False
22,1,What Happened?,genious-35413,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge fan of both Tim and Christine and I've seen them both a few times separately, and together. Her previous specials were very funny but I don't understand what happened here. This sounds like she's doing material that Roseanne passed on back in the 80s. Maybe this material is an answer to the annoying woke garbage that has been put out by the likes of Hannah 'No Actual Comedy' Gadsby and the hour bu Illana Glazer that was nothing more than pandering for applause by announcing all that is wrong with the the 'non-woke' crowd and how she's not like that. Like Colin Quinn says: 'Applause kills comedy'. But this is doing the same thing by pandering to the other side of the coin. If you pay attention, the crowd makes a lot of noise but it's more cheering and hollering and applauding as opposed to actual laughs. And the worst part is, there's a lot of over-selling the material to the point of being theatrical. John Mulaney can somewhat get away with it but I see this from others that I find unwatchable: Iliza Schlesinger and former alleged comedian Whitney Cummings. Thank God there's a last Norm MacDonald special coming out at the end of the month.And just to be honest, I didn't see the entire special - maybe half of it because it just didn't seem like it was going anywhere.",False
23,1,So Disappointed,LeroyFitzpatrick,n/a,16/08/2025,"Long-time YMH podcast listener, big fan of Christina's previous work, but this was as lazy as it gets. One of the golden rules of comedy is that a punchline should never be a face or a noise, and that's all this special consists of. Interesting premises and good set-ups, just to fall flat. She spends most of the special just yelling into the mic and repeatedly scoffing instead of telling an actual joke. I'm fine with setting yourself up as the anti-rule comedy crusader, but you've got to follow that with actually saying something/anything. Keep them high and tight, but mommies gotta be honest.",False
24,10,"Very funny, great stories!",nabobowman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just watch this comedy special and found it to be hilarious. As a fellow Gen X, survivor of the 1980s I too am fed up with the hyper sensitivity of the current social climate. Thank God there's another woman out there willing to speak up and make fun of the funny stuff that's going on right now. Better to laugh than cry. Christina P. Is very funny, she tells a great story, and she put on a very good special. I laughed out loud a lot while watching it alone. Definitely recommend.",False
25,2,Yikes,phd-inmetal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Only 10's are from YMH fans. But unbiased standup fans will not like this. It's just some tired ass jokes that I've heard from women like her over and over again. Get for them Segura coat tails and do something else, because sweet Jesus. Did anyone actually finish this thing? The podcast is great, but it's 90% Tom, let's be honest.",False

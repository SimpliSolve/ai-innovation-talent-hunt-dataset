1,8,A Force for Change,p0700327,n/a,17/08/2025,"There's been a lot of controversy and attention around her, but ultimately, she succeeded in directing that spotlight toward a cause she's been relentlessly advocating for. Personally, I have mixed emotions - I value influence grounded in fact and research - but the fact remains: she's a force for positive change. And honestly, I'd rather have someone like her in this world than not.Her life, her choice. As the documentary pointed out, what better role model than someone who's fighting with everything they've got to keep focus on what truly matters in this tangled mess of life?Overall, the documentary had a strong rhythm, clear goals, and a compelling narrative arc. It hinted at a broader direction for the movement she represents. At times, it even felt like an homage to Steve Irwin - another passionate advocate for life and for extraordinary creatures that need our care, love and most importantly- our voice in action.",False
2,8,Great documentary,birdsonthings,n/a,17/08/2025,"I really enjoyed watching this. It definitely changed my view completely about sharks. I love animals. I love people that are so passionate about animals. Ocean is a remarkable person. The fact she dedicated her life to saving sharks and removing the stigma that sharks are not evil creatures. They're very smart and yes, they are very dangerous. But I don't think her message is that - hey everyone should start swimming with sharks, they're totally safe! I think she's just trying to raise awareness that these majestic creatures don't deserve the cruelty from fishermen poach them just to remove their fins. The filming was stunning. I really enjoyed watching this. I learned a lot.",False
3,7,Good show but remember the grizzly man lol,bubbadinkxx,n/a,17/08/2025,"I love animals and people who love them! But to push the limits will only get you killed! The crazy grizzly man tried doing the same thing! Ahh they are misunderstood, no they are predators! Nothing hard to understand. They are not your pets! Great filming though! Ocean did swim with deep blue years ago and that was pretty awesome! Highly recommend you watch this. Obviously you have to be a little mental to swim with these animals and get this close. Now I am just writing more letters here to fill my minimum requirement letters for a review haha! Only have thirty seven more letters left to write!",False
4,n/a,Shark Bait,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"The documentary aims to explore the world of sharks and those who claim to communicate with them, but ultimately prioritizes spectacle over scientific rigor. While the stunning visuals showcase these majestic creatures in their natural habitat, the film falls short in providing a factual representation, echoing the sentiment of one speaker who states, ""it's all for show and not science."" Personal stories of the so-called ""shark whisperers"" dominate the narrative, overshadowing critical issues surrounding shark populations and their ecosystems, and neglecting to incorporate credible scientific research or expert opinions. This documentary serves as a reminder of the fine line between storytelling and scientific exploration, raising ethical questions about portraying wildlife interactions as mystical rather than grounded in evidence, leaving viewers wanting more substance and authenticity in their exploration of marine life.",False
5,7,Fishy but good,maybeahottake,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerHaving no prior knowledge to Ocean Ramsey or any of this advocacy work, this documentary really opened my eyes to shark conservation and awareness.I must say, the first half of this documentary is very slow. Giving off 'Planet Earth' vibes but instead of switching to the next location, they stay in one dive spot. Although it's long and tedious, the videography during that first dive is beautiful. Not only of the sharks, but her and her partner Juan's dive.The thing that really killed the first half of this documentary is the unwillingness to educate. For being an educational documentary on sharks...they don't share much. Not only that, but they don't speak much into Juan or Ocean's personal story.""I was a quiet girl.""
""I ended a two year relationship.""
""Juan broke his back.""They would just say things - and instead of diving deeper - just cut to slo Mo shots of sharks swimming. Like...hello? Are you and Juan a thing, partners, coworkers...??? I want to know more!!!After the 'Planet Earth' prelude, the editors really made the documentary worth the viewers time. Great editing. Education. Fight for advocacy. Political tensions. Relationship tension. Something to actually watch the film for. One of the things that personally made this film a 7/10 for me was the shark Roxy and the Great White Shark dives. Tense and emotional scenes that make this a must see documentary for me. Especially Roxy, making me tear up at the beginning and end.A lot of controversy surrounds this 'Ocean Ramsey' person. Not sure why. This documentary didn't seem to help or hurt her image in any way for me as an outsider. The one thing that made me go, 'what,' is when she used her media platform to raise awareness for unethical shark murder....by swimming in skimpier clothing.Like girl, you know what you are doing XD. From someone who used a dive suit everyday to bikinis to swim with sharks...you doing it for the money.Otherwise, would recommend this film to any animal lover or lite political dramas.",True
6,7,Entertainment,MickyG333,n/a,17/08/2025,"7.4 stars.As any other logical person would conclude, this is a very dangerous profession. Her whole life is about sharks. The fact is, I applaud her dedication to her beloved pets. I feel she considers them pets, or just apex predator acquaintances, either way, she is rolling the dice every time she hangs out with these behemoth buddies.It doesn't change my feeling about this documentary. It's quite entertaining and actually endearing. I feel sorry for the sharks if I'm being honest. I would never dive and float around with these guys, because it's a huge risk. What if I am that one in ten-thousand human, and a shark happens to be in a mood that day, and takes my leg? I'll avoid the possibility of it, but I still feel that Ocean truly believes this is her destiny, so good for her. I think that if one of her shark friends ate her, she wouldn't mind. As she becomes a tasty treat, Ocean would exclaim that she exited this life on her own terms.",False
7,10,Good docu but don't jump in w sharks,MissRS-5,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a good docu, she is great. But people shouldn't just go swimming with sharks. There was a guy who did something similar for years and one day he was being filmed and a shark ripped off his leg. It's her life and if she knows the risks it's her choice. But it is valid to worry that social media influencers are taking risks more to promote themselves than help sharks. It seems like she genuinely loves sharks and cares about their survival. I think it is a beautiful film and shows how much they care about their survival animals. Though this is about her, she is really focused on sharks and you can tell she wants the film to be more about sharks and educating people and that really comes through. She is using her platform for shark conservation and risking her life to do so. I actually think she has made a big difference changing things for sharks. I also appreciate seeing sharks in a different light. Other influencers swimming with sharks are mostly men and it is mostly about how brave they are swimming with sharks, whereas Ocean makes it about the animals and I think that differentiates her. Before she became so well known people weren't really cari g much about this, so she has been a big game changer for shark conservation.",False
8,10,10/10. Couldn't have made this documentary any better.,noraaaaaq,n/a,17/08/2025,"Spoiler""Shark Whisperer"" is not just a documentary. It's a love letter to the misunderstood apex predators of the sea, and to the woman who has dedicated her life to changing the way we see them. Ocean Ramsey doesn't just swim with sharks. She connects with them, and this film captures that connection with stunning clarity.Every interaction feels like a conversation between species, built on trust and respect. Watching Ocean Ramsey underwater is like watching peace in motion.Ocean Ramsey reminds us that love, respect, and education can reshape our world. And that sometimes, to understand something deeply, you have to swim beside it.",True
9,5,Not sure,annamidlane,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerHmmm. On the fence with this. I have actually been to Hawaii and swim with One Ocean Diving which is Ocean Ramsays shark swimming excursion company and we loved it. Swam with 8 galapogas sharks. So I was so excited when I heard about this, so much so that I watched it first thing. I was very disappointed. It seemed to be more style less substance. Its fab that Ocean and Juan advocated and got the Hawaiian bill signed to ban shark killings but I would love to see less of her swimming with them and more on her fighting shark fin soups and inspiring others to fight it. It was interesting also how there was so much footage of her gliding effortlessly in the water with all the stunning sharks (fully agree that they are not monsters), but not once does she acknowledge that most shark attacks are by sharks rushing the person. Not just gliding near them or holding on to their dorsal fin, another thing that I didn't like seeing. At the end of the day they are wild animals, look and admire them from afar but no need to hold on to them. Im still a huge fan of hers but this show could have been so so much on the beauty and importance of what sharks bring to our planet.",True
10,9,Don't judge,murad-35936,n/a,17/08/2025,"Firstly, I was surprised to see people judging her based on her choice of outfit in a video that's being recorded. What she does is both dangerous and heroic-it's ridiculous to focus on something so superficial.People will always find something to criticise when they have complicated opinions. But what she is trying to announce and prove is fantastic. She is clearly aware of the danger of extinction facing these amazing creatures, and she puts in an incredible amount of effort into this work. She has truly found her purpose in life, while most people don't even realise why they exist.The documentary itself is amazing, with incredible and fascinating shots. My only negative was that the underwater footage sometimes went on too long, leaving less time for the events happening behind the scenes. Overall, though, it's an incredibly beautiful documentary.",False
11,2,Big fan of sharks but Ocean Ramsey isn't the answer,billskag,n/a,17/08/2025,"I've read a lot about the controversy around Ocean Ramsey. When actual scientists - actual people doing shark conservation work, people who really study them and collect data and publish research - speak out against Ocean, her legion of social media followers attack them. I've heard from many that they've never gotten as terrible death threats and attacks as when Ocean sends her army after them for critiquing what she does. She doesn't take criticism well at all.To quote an article on the subject: "" Ocean Ramsey does not collect data, does not publish research, does not collaborate with researchers who do except for a study testing the effectiveness of shark repellent where her role is not clear, does not present at scientific conferences, does not train students in research methods, does not have research ethics permits for her activities, regularly misrepresents her own expertise and credentials, and regularly shares unequivocally factually incorrect statements about background issues related to shark biology and conservation despite being repeatedly corrected. In my capacity as a scientific journal editor, I would never assign her to peer review a paper because she does not have the qualifications or credentials. And that's not counting the aforementioned coordinated cyber-harassment of legitimate scientific researchers and mainstream conservationists.""I think this documentary failed to actually break down the phenomenon of Ocean Ramsey. It was a PR stunt. It just felt like a long social media post from Ramsey. This documentary didn't dive into the real science. It didn't dive into the harassment she causes the real science community and the people really out there trying to help sharks.Ramsey cares about Ramsey. Ramsey likes being famous and diving. That's my take away.",False
12,10,Loved this documentary about sharks,belunders,n/a,17/08/2025,"Ocean & her husband Juan has been swimming with sharks for many years. The documentary shows stunning & breathtaking filmography & stillphotos of so many different sharks they have met & registered over the years. They have used so incredibly much time & energy on creating awareness, around the most beautiful & necessary animals in the ecosystem of our oceans across the globe. They have studied the way sharks behave & how the different species interact with each other. Since sharks are very sensitive to electromagnetic fields, they will also pick up on other type of energy. So if you are afraid & don't know how to behave around sharks, just look upon this as a beautiful experience film, to get to just know sharkbehaviour a bit better. Love that they work for bettering sharks conditions, considering 100 million sharks are killed every year. There are not 100 million people dead every year from sharks attacks, so who is the predators of this planet. We, the human beings unfortunately.",False
13,10,Neither very interesting or enlightening,jordan2240,n/a,17/08/2025,"Watching someone being interviewed for an hour and a half isn't particularly interesting, and none of the information disseminated in this film is new. Shark conservationists have been trying to get out the same message for years.Images of Ms. Ramsey swimming with the sharks get rather tiresome and don't prove anything that we don't already know about the animals. Statistically, it's well known that the chances of being attacked by a shark are very slim, so I'm not really sure what this film is meant to prove. I would suspect that those chances might actually increase if the number of people who start swimming with sharks increases as a result of this film.Personally, I think it's sad that someone thinks their purpose in life is to swim with sharks, but to each her own. Hopefully she doesn't go the way of grizzly man, who thought his purpose was to hang with the grizzlies, but became part of one.",False
14,5,Interesting but definitely done in vain,goransondevin,n/a,17/08/2025,"I really liked this documentary at first, but as it went on I became very aware of who these people were and what their main interests were, and I truly don't think it's shark conservation. Like others have mentioned in their reviews this seems more like an elongated Instagram post than it does a documentary. I really didn't like the fact that we got SO LITTLE time with the actual scientists, and they were made out to be the big bad guys out to get Ocean. I think it misrepresents their intentions and makes this ""documentary"" come off as very biased. I would have loved to have learned something from watching this, but the only thing I've come away from this documentary with is you really probably shouldn't go petting 20 foot long great white sharks in your bikini. It's a pretty bad look overall.",False
15,10,Yes!!,thevances,n/a,17/08/2025,"Enjoy this for what it is. She had dedicated her life to helping save sharks. The video is shot in a powerful way that you can feel the danger around her, but she is in control. She lives for what she believes in, and what she has already helped accomplish is amazing.When people have a passion and dedication, it truly shows. I loved Steve Irwin for the awareness he brought to the world, and I see the same passion coming from Ocean. I love that she brings facts about shark attacks and the dangers of being on the water. Less than 70 unprovoked shark attacks per year. You are more likely to be killed by a dog.",False
16,1,Self Indulgent,thejohninc,n/a,17/08/2025,"I had to switch this off after 20 minutes of inane voiceover drivel. I knew nothing of this woman however it became apparent that she must be some kind of social media persona, as most of the narrative is her crew, colleagues and herself waxing lyrical about how amazing she is and about how she has a unique connection with sharks. There was next to nothing in the way of informative dialogue, just some decent visuals and far too many vox pops about the connection she has with sharks and the ocean. The one thing I was impressed with was her free diving ability. Watch Instagram or a YouTube short, it will save you time and you'll get the jist.",False
17,10,An inspiring story,LillyA-41,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's hilarious to see the amount of people that think that by watching this documentary people are going to start jumping in the ocean to swim with sharks. As a long time advocate of ocean conservation and a scuba diver, I greatly appreciate Ocean's work and mission to protect these important predators. It's inspiring to learn more about Ocean's life and her passion for these animals as her fight to protect them legally. The videography is beautiful and captivating. I can understand the controversy around her but also appreciate her veracity. Side note that the cameo by Silvia Earl made this doc all the better.",False
18,3,Fast forward will be your best friend,Watcher_85,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI tried to watch this but I believe Ocean Ramsey is more interested in making money off of Instagram clicks than saving sharks. She is obsessed with these animals and would happily be eaten by one if it brought her more attention.There's just so much time you can spend watching her float around sharks. It gets old really fast and frankly you should just go look at her IG if that's what you want to see. If you fast forward to the other people and their stories and experience in the field, then the show gets much more interesting.I think the Shark Whisperer is more an ode to one couple's addiction to attention than it is to ""saving"" the sharks. To listen to her try to explain away a man's awful attack from her precious sharks is just crazy.",True
19,5,Sharks Aren't Pets: When Advocacy Crosses a Line,kmwehri,n/a,17/08/2025,"While it was fascinating to watch her swim alongside such massive sharks, I think it sends a problematic message. It's risky to personify apex predators like giving them names and suggesting a personal bond blurs the line between perception and scientific reality. What are her actual qualifications beyond being an advocate with a passion for sharks and diving? Throughout the entire segment, I couldn't stop thinking of the ""Grizzly Man,"" who believed bears were his friends. He named and interacted with them as if they were pets...until they ultimately killed and ate him.I'm not suggesting sharks lack sentience, and I fully support efforts to protect them. But this approach feels like playing Russian roulette. At any moment, one of those sharks could turn on her. Maybe it's my deep fear of sharks, but portraying wild animals as misunderstood rather than dangerous can lead to tragic consequences-just ask the tourists in Yellowstone who try to pet bison. Wild animals deserve respect, not familiarity.",False
20,4,All Fame and No Glory,seblivingston,n/a,17/08/2025,"Wished there was more substance here. Seemed heavily self-righteous on Ramsey's part with her and the rest of the cast talking about how great she is on top of most of the footage being of her. It was annoying to see her holding a GoPro with it literally glued to her face while 20 sharks swam in the background (were many shots like this). Felt very vain and footage was something you'd post on your Instagram for views.Throughout the documentary she had the mentality of a five year old who tells people 'dont hurt the sharks, they aren't monsters, animals are good'. Pretty much the same mentality that ended up with Grizzly Man in the stomach of a grizzly, and same attitude that got Steve Irwin killed. I love Irwin as much as the next guy, grew up learning about animals watching him but recently as an adult watched a video of him lie in front of an Inland Taipan snake (most venomous snake in the world, one dose of its venom can kill 100 humans) and it slithered up to his face and flicked him with its tongue. That's just stupid and it was obviously this behavior that got him killed.They're animals, they dont have human emotions and arent thinking what we are. Ramsey was portraying the same mindset while diving with the sharks talking about having these various emotions when she was beside them. Obviously domesticated animals have learned to form bonds and share human emotions but I highly doubt a wild shark is thinking 'oh its happy time with Ocean'. I guarantee if you starve that shark for a few months and put them in an enclosure with a person they arent going to last long.That being said I'm all for the conservation of animals and plants. I saw some extra footage for Planet Earth (PE 2 I believe) where they showed this small island with a vast array of species, only to show an image of what it looked like a few years afterwards being completely decimated by harvesting wood. An entire ecosystem gone, thousands of known and unknown species erased. That was heartbreaking because you can't regrow something like that.I wish the film had focused more on the conservation aspect with data about what is happening globally with sharks. At one point they did mention that 70-100 million sharks are fished each year which is an insane number. I agree that senseless killing of anything should be regulated; it either needs to be used for food and/or some product that benefits us. If a shark is killed just for a fin or another part and the rest is unused that is not cool. If we kill something we should use as much of it as possible. When I was younger I used to kill small birds with my BB gun just to test my accuracy (and just being a kid). One day my grandfather asked me why I just killed this bird, I didn't have a reason. He told me not to kill anything I didn't use, and I've never killed anything since.Certainly there are better shark documentaries out there, in fact just wait for shark week, you'll find plenty of educational videos that are less glam and more informative.",False
21,1,Foolish attention seeker,christopherstamp,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerHow many times must we witness people thinking they can treat dangerous animals like big pets. And they end up getting killed.This lady and the guy who is madly following her, are clearly not all there. They give off really hippie - the world is beautiful man - vibes.No matter how many people who literally live on islands with sharks tell them it is dangerous - she constantly thinks she knows better.Her arrogance will be her downfall.This documentary shouldn't exist - this lady should not get any attention. Will how easily persuaded kids are these days due to social media - this will do so much damage to the young who don't know common sense.Even when 1 guy lost his leg, she focused on the sharks.",True
22,4,Vocal fry and uptalk..,Badlands1,n/a,17/08/2025,"If only she could talk like an adult instead of a 12-year-old girl mimicking Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian. This would be a good documentary. Her boyfriend had also adopted that childlike affectation.Basically her message is all animals are cuddly and cute and evolution doesn't really exist. It's great they interviewed the surfer who had his leg bitten off.But her message to him is essentially everybody should stop surfing.There's 50 to 100 shark attacks yearly, mostly on surfers. So several are getting attacked every month. But yes, she's correct for the millions of people that swim. It's a small percentage. But it still exists.I really think she's too dense to understand Animal nature, which gives her the confidence to swim with great whites. Also, the sharks probably look at her like some kind of silly dolphin which they can't catch, versus looking like a seal on a surfboard.Great footage, but I recommend watching this on mute. The vocal fry and up talk is unbearable and it's becoming an epidemic, even amongst men.",False
23,1,Wildlife charlatan gets a movie,BenjaminB-85,n/a,17/08/2025,"This woman shouldn't be anywhere near wildlife, especially apex predators. She is not a scientist she performs zero research and all she will wind up doing is getting people and animals hurt and killed. This movie is glorification of animal harassment and the valuation of an influencer's opinion over actual scientists. Ocean is a a charlatan and con artist and in this latest film has apparently conned Netflix. What this movie does is hurt actual scientists and longterm science. While inlnow Ocena and her lackeys will deny this the fact that she has never collaborated with a scientist or published any academic work speaks louder than her looks.",False

1,7,Genre defying (and I don't know if that's a good thing),asevertson-43873,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only thing downloaded onto my phone for a 7 hour long international flight was the LITWTC commentary episode for this movie, which I listened to without even seeing the film (??? Can u even call it that) beforehand and I gotta tell you, it was an Experience. (They kept making jokes during the podcast about how you Should Not Do That but please mr. Wood and mr. Dunne I had nothing else to entertain me)
I watched the movie for real when I got home and. Yeah. That all makes sense now. 10/10 in terms of vibes, but I'm trying to be realistic with my rating here. Objectively a fine movie, I had a total blast watching it and I love that you can really feel how much fun they all had during the more ""act-y"" bits.",False
2,10,absolutely stunning piece of media it changed my life,gravityffan,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I first heard of this film I thought it was stupid. Boy was I wrong 2.45 seconds after I started watching I levitated off the ground and transcended time and space. I saw god, then became him all well this masterpiece of film played in the background. I watched the creation of the universe and the end of time flash before my eyes. I saw countries fall, be rebuilt, and fall again when it was all over the screen faded to black I was the only thing left in the universe the last black hole had faded and I was alone. When suddenly Will appeared behind me speaking in a language I couldn't understand suddenly I was surrounded by color my eyes burned Will's voice got louder then it stopped. I awoke back in my room just as the credits started to roll. Please Don't waist your time with any other movie. The Real Wood is the only thing you need to watch ever.",False
3,10,My thoughts,N3rdy-G7rdy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is perfect. This film Is a cinematic and masterful masterpiece. Never before have I seen such beauty and perfection in one two hour and seventeen minute masterpiece. This peice of art proves that God exists, because only something celestial could make something like this. I would happily sacrifice my mind, body, and soul to this film. Thank you, Christopher and William for blessing my eyes.",False

5,10,Entertaining Documentary,lilly_png,n/a,16/08/2025,"Usually not a fan of documentaries, but I am a fan of Will so I gave this one a watch. It was entertaining with it's whole plot and the silly cast who try to find out who exactly Will Wood is. When the movie opened with people breaking into Will's home, I knew I was going to be in for a treat.I like how this film includes snippets of live performances of Will's concert! I was totally grooving when the songs cam on, singing along, even!Overall, this film is very silly and entertaining. I think anybody who enjoys Will Wood will enjoy this movie. The cast and crew did a great job at producing this masterpiece of a movie.",False
6,10,Pretty alright,sznmakerdoom,n/a,16/08/2025,"My lord. When I tell you my head started breaking, I mean it. The second this documentary started playing, my primal instincts broke out and awakened my 7th sense. My claws were scratching everything, my brain was expanding, my mother was weeping. My dog called 911 to make sure I was alright. I bit and scratched and screeched, but they still took me to ""get taken care of"". At the veterinarian, (thanks so much for your service), they prescribed a comfy electric chair to strap into when watching. Now I can finally watch this MASTERPIECE without my claws and fangs. Thank the lord this movie exists.",False

8,10,Transcended my state of being through simple contemplation,shontina,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want a movie to relax on the weekend, this movie is not for you. I believe this movie could redefine what we call a ""cinematic masterpiece"" in the industry. Every aspect was done to meticulous precision to ensure the best product in the market. Upon first viewing, it sent me through a vivid state off the ground. I was perplexed by such a phenomenon but by the boisterous audio playing by the movie, I knew I was where I was meant to be. I ascended further while my eyes were shut, I believe it was a way to shield my last remaining ""ordinance"" to achieve true perfection. Angels were chanting mesmerizing hymns of such familiar work, piano filled that perpetuating emptiness of their repetitive chants. The darkness soon revealed their farewells, as my skin was bathed in incandescent light, my panick-stricken nerves halted to acceptance. Clouds with remaining mist grazed my skin and perhaps signaled the unredeemable, I knew there that there was no going back. My senses lost what little control they had left, as if my physical formation dissipated to further define a reverent mental state. Through the blazing light I could discern a single silhouette through my insular remaining eyelids, Will Wood.Could have been better though ngl ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£",False
9,10,It's beautiful you need to watch it please,scratchingoverit,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this movie was dumb till I watch it my eyes started levitating away from my face. My cat ended up calling my dead grandma, and then I started shaky very violently. This movie is a masterpiece 10/10 if you watch this you will be hooked. This movie is the only movie you should ever watch ever. It is such a beautiful masterpiece that you will regret not watching it. It is such an emotional roller coaster that you will be on the floor, shaking within minutes. Me and my friend want to watch it again so bad my friend named Mason had to go to a insane place I guess he was too mentally ill for the movie.",False
10,10,absolutely wonderful,williamcipher,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't think I'd care for this film. I had listened to the album many times but thought I'd be annoyed by the actual movie. Wow was I wrong. Very humorous and entertaining, this is the only movie I ever want to watch ever again. Will and Chris have blessed me by allowing this beautiful film to grace my senses. I'm honored to have experienced such a life changing event that will haunt my memories forever.",False
11,10,so good,imdbfan-5220449442,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie was so good that i started levitating out of my twin size bed like max from stranger things and it inserted its tapeworm parasite into my booty hole and turned me into a brand new person so my family could love me normally. This move changed me big time best ever. This fil stood out immensly from the recent vaculous mass of repetitive media that bores me all every the time all i need is the real will wood. After watching this all the lyrics of surburbia overture greetings from mary bell township vampire culture love me normally got carved in my hairy back and everytime i go to pick my back pimples i feel the letters like braille and i lovee it recomend for pride swindling neurodivergent only children please watch it.,False

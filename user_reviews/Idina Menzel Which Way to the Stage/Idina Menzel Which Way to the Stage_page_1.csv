1,8,"Not what I expected, but good!",mandyrstrickland,n/a,16/08/2025,"I expected this to simply be a live concert, and truthfully, that's what I wanted. I'm an Idina fan, and I would have been quite happy watching her concert.This is much more about the woman, and the concert tour serves as a backdrop. You do hear/see clips of her standards, covers, and original songs, but never the full, uninterrupted song. I do feel like I got a better understanding of her life and who she is.I wouldn't mind it if they'd actually put out both. This was interesting, but I would love to see the concert, too. Because I'm an Idina Menzel fan, it's fun to learn about her, but sometimes I just want to see her sing.",False
2,7,Interesting insights into life as a star,robert-kroess,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerActually, I'm no big fan of Idina - but this documentary shows a side, we typically not see from stars: The human sideThe way she tries to stay in contact with her boys and getting pregnant on tour. We saw little breakdowns caused by the pressure and one day she did not even know what city she was in. Showing the human side of her and the troubles she has like normal people do also have, makes her very sympathetic at the end.Besides this, it was also a bit of an advertising show for her, so overall I end up with mixed feelings about this documentary. But still more on the positive side, for sure.",True

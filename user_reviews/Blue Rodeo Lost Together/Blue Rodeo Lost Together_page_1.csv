1,8,for the fans,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a documentary of the Canadian band, Blue Rodeo. Jim Cuddy and Greg Keelor are friends since high school. Greg first hears Jim's singing at a mutual friend's funeral. After university, the duo decides to spend a year doing the music thing. The rest is history.Everybody likes each other. That is the big takeaway. There is some drama but limited conflicts. Mostly, this is a story of brotherly love and nice Canadians playing music together. They are one of my favorites. I assume that this is only compelling for fans. Most people outside of Canada wouldn't know this band or get that much from this. It's for their fans.",False
2,10,Beauty of a doc!,jacki-andre,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lost Together is a visually beautiful film - beautifully shot and put together. It mostly focuses on the band's early years and is based largely on archival footage and present-day interviews. Since they've been part of the Canadian cultural fabric for 40 incredible years, most Canadians should be familiar with at least a few of their songs. The band remains shockingly humble and scandal-free so it's more a story of friendship and the Canadian music industry rather than a tabloid-esque expose.Fans who have followed the band for a long time won't find a lot of surprises here. Some things have been omitted or perhaps glossed over although it is admittedly difficult to squeeze 40 years into a 90-minute nutshell. But it's lovely just watching the guys reminisce and chat. And, especially in our current geopolitical climate, it's a warm and fuzzy reminder of what makes our country so badass. Blue Rodeo is as Canadian as it gets - they've given us their hearts as they've crisscrossed this country so many times and we are very privileged to hold those hearts - and the music inside them - as we navigate this life.",False

1,5,JCS Criminal Psychology did it better,jbosnjak-15337,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you ask me, I think JCS did much better in composing this case and presenting it through the lense of criminal psychology.It highlights the most important aspects of the case - all condensed into what Jennifer really thought the solution was. Also, with the bonus of not including the dramatic music in the background that Netflix features in every single crime doco.I honestly thought watching the case again, this time around on Netflix, I might learn something more. However, after seeing it, Netflix doesn't measure up the slightest to what JCS presented.For those curious, it's called Jennifer's Solution on YT.",False
2,6,"Worth seeing, but a bit lifeless.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Police receive a 911 call from Jennifer Pan, who explains that her parents have been shot at their family home.First of all, what a drab production, I've just watched another Netflix documentary, Crime Scene Berlin, which was such a slick production, this one, for Netflix was so bland.The story, it's an interesting one, but the narrative is just off somehow, I don't feel we learned very much at all, very little exploration of Jennifer's relationship with her parents, no alternative theories explored.The actual footage of Jennifer's interviews is fascinating, and does make the film worth watching. You see some of the techniques used by The Police.Personally, it must have been tough for her, her parents seemed pretty strict, but what she did, as the title gives away...... unforgivably.It's a little overlong at 90 minutes long, you may find yourself yawning and fidgeting a little bit.Worth seeing, but don't expect to be wowed.6/10.",False
3,6,Just listen to Casefile: Case 50,ozzyc,n/a,16/08/2025,Overall i enjoyed the documentary just expected a bit more.I wondered why so many details were left out. Although I truly appreciated the actual footage and commentary I was surprised they chose to exclude some of the more interesting tidbits about the caseI had preciously listened to the 2 hour and 49 minute long Casefile (Episode 50) from 2017 podcast about this years ago and wish they would have included more into this documentary. Casefiles version was so good.I also recently watched the JCS: Criminal Psychology episode (Jennifer's Solution). It was good also.I would definitely recommend watching and listening to both of those to get your true crime fix.,False
4,n/a,Lame,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWell, what DID Jennifer do?We don't really get to know.She somehow set in motion that three men with (one, two, three?) guns could enter her house that she shared with her parents.Through her ex-boyfriend she got in contact with them. So he's a co-conspirator. We gather. Because there was a short bit about text messages between her and him.She unlocked the front door. She lied to the police.She concocted stories, and phone-harrassed her ex.That's what she did. Oh, and not go to uni but telling her parents she did. What she did instead was not revealed, though the officer SAID he'd like to know.When did she contact Homeboy (home invader no. 1), how many times, did they communicate afterwards.....no details given at all. No timeline, just Day 1, 2, etc. Until she is arrested.The police interviews were interesting, but I don't need Netflix for those. Some input of officers etc. Involved was interesting, therefore 5 stars.But not worth watching the whole thing for. There was no real background, nothing went in depth, nothing new revealed at all.It was sketchy, superficial, unnecessary. 48 Hours does it better. Much better.",True
5,7,Despite my criticisms it is a gripping watch!!,Guanche48,n/a,16/08/2025,"To begin with, the title does not seem well thought out to me at all, and it is not the only thing that is done poorly in this documentary.I think that this crime story from Canada will appeal primarily to people interested in true crime documentaries, but I must admit as a fan of crime stories, that this one is really dull. They are too many unexplained details, what a disappointment. DNA tests are missing in the house, etc etc..etc..etc .. The most frustrating thing is not having investigated her phone records earlier, incomprehensible! It makes no sense to me.There are also many repetitive things, to fill time I imagine.A great part consists of showing archival footage of interviews that Jennifer had with investigators at the Markham police station. Jennifer's father, who is still alive, spoke to police after he came out of his coma, but he's a very minor player in this story and it would have been fascinating to hear more from him. .. I can go on..There is much more material that they could have used to make a much more interesting and complete documentary, with more respect and responsibility as it should be in these cases. The end seems rushed and a little unclear for me.For true crime fans who are looking for a quick and interesting crime story, it's worth watching! . It manages to entertaing with some surprising details and twists into it's short running time.",False
6,7,Expected outcome but a good doc nonetheless,valacitymiller,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI have seen my fair share of docs. They become a bit predictable. I define a good documentary good if it can hold my attention. This held my attention because Jennifer was a really bad liar and I was invested on exactly how she'd start to crumble. I do feel bad that all the pressure she felt lead her to desperation was her reality but she really wasn't right in the head. The investigators did a good job at not giving up. I wonder why they didn't release photos of the other two involved tho? It gets a 7 because I didn't play on my phone much but predictable guilty verdict. It would be nice to get a follow up from the dad and get a part 2 out of this. Thats just my documentary addicted self talking tho. I'm sure it's too traumatizing to have him talk about it.,True
7,7,The long not short of it,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - the run time may not be the longest and yet this could have been way shorter. I think a one hour documentary could have done the trick (again no pun intended). Just tighten everything up and get faster to the point and the ""truth"". I don't think there is much doubt about what happened ... there may be questions about the why .. but we can't really look into other peoples brains ... so there is that.So short of someone giving us their reasons for their actions, we won't really know. We can take some educated guesses ... the title already suggest that there is more to the story that the start of the documentary suggests ... that said, maybe you already know of the story - I had not heard of it. So it was quite entertaining and had some interesting twists ... I may be cutting this some slack .. but I am known to be nicer than other reviewers I reckon ... and nice may not be the right way to go here I guess .. but that is another pun to tell ...",False
8,7,Pressure from Parents,DVK1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe pressure from Jennifer Pan's parents for Jennifer to succeed and to choose a man for herself that did not have a criminal record ultimately resulted in Jennifer Pan doing the unthinkable: to put a hit out on her own parents. I understand that the pressure must have been difficult. According to her friend, she was not a straight A student. The Pans expected her to be a pharmacist, but it seems like she did not get accepted into pharmacy, and then her conditional offer from Ryerson was rescinded when she failed Grade 13 calculus. I absolutely feel sorry that the pressure was obviously too much for this girl, but her actions are still pure evil. She wanted what she wanted: the loser drug dealer boyfriend, her parents' cash. Only a wicked, wicked person could stand in the same room with her parents' murderers and chat with them as if nothing untoward or evil was going on. It makes me wonder what came first, her wickedness, or her being influenced by Daniel Wong into a criminal life for from which she could never turn back?The end of the film says that she and her co-accused have been allowed a retrial. None of these reprobates she ever see the light of day. Ever again.",True
9,4,Watch the JCS video instead,noawareness,n/a,16/08/2025,"Astounding how a large studio with a substantial budget, can't do it better than one guy making YouTube videos. Look up the JCS video on youtube. It's around the same length but goes into this from the criminal psychology angle and absolutely nails it. Netflix tried too hard (as they often do) to ramp up the drama and cinematography and in turn essentially fall flat when it comes to actually giving you what you want from a story like this.The story of this horrific murder is organically dramatic enough that the erie music is completely unnecessary and takes a lot away from the organic darkness of this case.Essentially, it's too long for how much it leaves to assumption and too dramatic for how much it takes away from the incident.Watch the JCS video instead.",False
10,7,An average crime documentary,MidooAshraaf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good production design but with few story production material and this is the result!Only scenes from Jennifer's interview worth to be watched and contemplated, the other interviews is lifeless with few footage about Jennifer herself but only footage about the investigators and police chiefs that makes you feel the film is about their work and not an attempt to discuss a crime about a young girl and trying to get into her mixed, complex and deviant feelings which led her to commit this crime.The film doesn't have a lot of plot twists or introductory scenes and that's maybe it's forgivable for the crew because there probably aren't many archival scenes of the girl and the story is straightforward and not serving any twists.",False
11,4,Just watch JCS Criminology on Youtube,Justanotherme213,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really hope they gave him credit for this, because his was so much better, and they obviously ripped him off. I only watched this because I learned of this case due to JCS. However, after watching this, and comparing to JCS, well it really can't compare. I feel like JCS was more thorough and kept my attention. I also like how he explains Jennifers demeanor and everything, so that you know how the story comes together. He gave a lot more backstory as well. I usually love Netflix, but it's really hard when you watched a really good one, and then you see this one, it just can't compare. I really recommend you watching JCS Criminology on YouTube instead.",False
12,10,Asian parents,rdjoties,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was raised by Asian parents. So I feel for her. I know she is the victim here. One of her options was to kill her self. Another was to elope. I have seen both of these ""solutions"" nearby since I was 8. Some Asian parents even kill themselves if you want to live your life outside their box. If you want to keep your cultural ways do not have kids in a
liberal country.. I think her option was extreme... But she is not the first Asian Canadian who took this step.. please learn from this (Asian) parents. Give them space. You are in a free country because you wanted to. So your gonna have liberal kids also.Do not stop them in their liberal ways. They are the effect of the efforts you made to choose for a free country. Do not turn them in to the reason why you left your motherland.",True
13,6,Decent True Crime Story,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a decent enough Netflix documentary about the murder and attempted murder of a set of strict immigrant parents and the assault of their only daughter. While the motive appears to be a robbery, or drug related revenge killing there may be more. That is what this one is about. Mostly told through interviews and archival interrogation footage it is not too long and decent enough. Not a real brain twister, but if you like true crime it is worth a watch. I did not find it to be the best or the worst of the real crime documentaries but still very watchable. Telling more would be to provide spoilers, which we don't do.",False
14,4,What a spectacularly stupid title for a crime mystery,ryko25,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a spectacularly stupid title for a crime mystery - so stupid that the usual (understandable) concern of IMDb to avoid spoilers is surely not applicable in this instance.The title and ensuing structure of the documentary means that there is zero surprise, zero suspense, zero reason to keep watching. I can't think of any comparable case of self-inflicted spoiler which absolutly blows the opportunity to tell an amazing story in such a clumsy manner.The video of Jennifer's police interviews were originally the subject of an excellent Youtube documentary by JCS - Criminal Psychology, first published three years earlier. That was titled ""Jennifer's Solution"" - which is not really a spoiler because, on that channel, all of the cases are of interviews with suspects who turn out to be guilty.I'll click ""Yes"" for the ""Does this review contain spoilers?"" question but, as already explained, this is surely superfluous for this dumb documentary!",True
15,n/a,It's not fiction,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't understand reviews that complain about spoilers for a true crime story. It's not fiction meant to shock you. It's a riveting story because it's true. It's gross to me to use a story about real murder to entertain you in a movie. I also don't care about AI images They have nothing to do with Jennifer's story which is documented my the investigation. I just wonder sometimes if I want to be a true crime viewer when I read reviews that seem so callous and stupid and judgmental. This film itself is notable by how unhappy Jennifer was, and how ironic it is that her parents were so right about her boyfriend. He really was bad news. She is such a lonely figure in this movie that it's hard to watch even though she is guilty.",True
16,7,This Netflix Doc fills in Some Blanks!,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis case is well-known to me and, yes, I've seen the JCS channel on this.I've also watched Investigation Discovery ID and other true crime channels on tv about this case.This is what's good about the Netflix documentary: You get to hear from the detectives, see news reports, the highlights of Jennifer's interviews, interviews with the boyfriend, and crime scene photos.Of all the docs I've seen, I've never seen interviews with Wong, news footage, interviews with investigators, or crime scene photos. Just voiceovers about the strictness of the parents and the interviews with her. In at least one doc you did see camera footage of suspicious dad tracking the daughter to a workplace where she claimed to be employed and that's about it.Now maybe Netflix was aware of the takes already out there, so they went with another POV with the small amount of other footage available.The doc is short and can easily be supplemented through the ID channel on TV or any number of true crime channels on YouTube.If it delved deeper and longer, everyone would complain about padding and/or that it was too long and needed to be only, 90 minutes.Well this doc is just that, about 90 minutes.One thing of note is the lack of information about the other suspects. But they atleast showed Wong being interviewed and I've never seen anyone showing that. Never seen Nick on the other suspects either or even any court footage of any trials.The other thing I noted was, everyone was an idiot. I mean the parents were clueless and just never saw that their daughter just wasn't as smart as their expectations, although she apparently was very good with the piano, but that's a different skill set.Wong also was no genius. He gave everything away in his interview. Talked way too much, bringing up things that were never asked and directly making the cops suspicious of him and Jennifer. Neither asked for lawyers.As far as I can see, no genius was in operation here from the parents to Jennifer to the bf and the 3 clowns that couldn't even shoot straight.What a dumb mess. At no time did anyone tell Jennifer or did she tell herself, I'm an adult and I can walk away. The time and energy put into lying and creating false documents for 4 years could have actually gone into going to school and getting a decent job and moving out!Yes, I know about the issues with parents and kids in Asian and immigrant cultures, but guess what, millions of people go out on their own every single day.She had choices and chose the wrong one! Sad all around. Her diary indicated the pressures were more about her drug-dealing boyfriend than anything else. Abby parent would object!Also, I think the Netflix doc gave is enough information about her motivation. Also, is never heard she tried to do it before! Not sure how much more Netflix could spell it out. She maintains her innocence to this day so no more information is coming forth. They all won retrials, too!",True
17,7,What Jennifer Did is another solid Netflix documentary,kevin_robbins,n/a,16/08/2025,"My wife and I recently watched What Jennifer Did (2024) on Netflix. The storyline follows an Asian family in Canada who experience a home invasion where both parents are killed. The daughter, Jennifer, calls 911 and explains what happened. As the police investigate, some pieces of Jennifer's story don't seem to make sense.Directed by Jenny Popplewell (American Murder: The Family Next Door), this is a very well put together documentary that features key interviews between the police and those involved. Hearing the 911 call was also very effective in helping form impressions as the story unfolds. I also enjoyed the neighbor interviews where they always say, ""they were a normal family,"" which often means they weren't. The documentary is well paced, revealing the details behind the scenes that may have led to the events. The ultimate conclusion fits the events and provides a worthwhile resolution to the circumstances.In conclusion, What Jennifer Did is another solid Netflix documentary that I would score a 7/10 and recommend seeing once.",False
18,7,"Shockingly Disturbing, but lacking in Context and Nuance.",daviddcvs,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the title of the documentary one can deduce that Jennifer is fully or partly responsible for what happened to her parents that night. However, the documentary is solely told from the point of view of those involved in the investigation, painting a pretty black and white picture of the event and leaving out key details about Jennifer's live at home and outside her home. There's a few comments from a friend of Jennifer (who doesn't appear to be a close confidant), an older friend of the family, and a private tutor, but nothing substantial to paint a complete picture of who Jennifer is, and how complicated her relationship with her parents was. There isn't enough context and nuance for us to better understand what lead her to commit such an unspeakable...and though her parents were the victims of this crime, it feels as though they don't get a pass - since they're not the only victim here. I wonder what someone like David Fincher would do with this story if given access to dig deeper into Jennifer's psyche. We need her side of the story for better or ill.",False
19,6,A Sad True Crime Story,borhank,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis is a true crime stroy that you will be amazed on what occurs and how things turn around in this story about Jennifer a Vietnemise young girl that reports a tragic story of her parents being harmed from home invaders.All this is done in a small town in Canada and you think we have some bad people going around ready to kill people all for money.The underlying storyline of being from an Asain country and having the over the top preasure is something that is true and honestly could have been explained more via this documentary for other cultures to understand the level of preasure this young woman had. I am not condoning the actions all I am saying its should have been a valid point as part of the documentary and not just palmed off.The other aspect that is surprising to me about this is its all done for a boy and nothing special in that department either however you may have to say its this one girl that fell in love with the first ever boy that he liked her and she liked him and then this triggred some deep dark triggers for Jen.The fact that she was not academically smart is also a major point and this is a embarrasment for her an d the family is a sad truth as well.I would like this doco to have a follow up and see what occurs in the next few years with the follow up legal challenges.This aint suitable for kidies at all.,True
20,4,Not that good,mauricepuhlmann,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThere are much better videos covering this case on YouTube. I can recommend Jennifer's solution by J C SThis Netflix documentary has a very black and white approach to the case and down plays the reasoning of Jennifer Pan tremendously... Even though it's the most important part of this story and should also be considered by many parents that are pressuring their children.It also feels like this documentary doesn't have that dynamic touch we usually get from netflix documentaries. It's very bland and feels rushed.I guess they are mass producing these nowadays since true crime is getting more and more popular on YouTube and such. I am going to stick to YouTube if the quality doesn't improve.,True
21,7,Repeat,brummieman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is without a doubt a captivating story if you havent heard or seen it already.The story, case study and outcome has been all over social media ever since it happened and the Netflix episode offers nothing new, if anything it edits things out!However Netflix does have a great way of rerunning a story in a coherennt and compelling way, Just as it did with several other crime documentarie such as American Murder (the family next door) and the Sins of the mother. Netflix just gathers all of the youtube footage that many of us have seen and throws in a couple of new interviews to beef the story up, it does a good job here but id like to see fresh and new evidence rather than rewatch all the footage thats avaliable free on youtube.",False
22,3,"Agreed...watch JCS Criminal Psychology ""Jennifer's Solution""",deanna-perkins,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came here after watching the documentary on Netflix to read others reviews and saw a couple mention this YouTube episode ""Jennifer's Solution"" by JCS Criminal Psychology. I was wondering how much better it actually could be and it's a LOT better. More footage of the interviews and explaining the psychology behind what she's doing. How you can see from the beginning she is putting on an act. I also think it does a better job of diving into her life with her parents. While Netflix's scratched the surface and was a good intro, the YouTube one really dives in deeper. I also think the Netflix doc provides more of the thoughts of the police/detectives on the case...but there were things that didn't make sense. There were clear consistencies in her 911 call and her in-person interviews that never appeared to be questioned in the interviews on the documentary. I would highly suggest the YouTube episode over Netflix's if you're interested in this case.",False
23,9,What did Jennifer actually do?,sadmansakibayon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know I sound really twisted but this is one of my favourite crime stories! I got hooked on this case from the moment I became aware of it through YouTube videos. This case is definitely worth watching and I promise you it will send chills down your spine!The story starts from the moment when Jennifer, a young lady in her early twenties, calls 911 to inform that some intruders broke into their house and shot both of her parents. She says she cannot check on them as she is tied up against the bannister upstairs. After the police arrive and rescue her, she is taken into custody. She tells the police as she cries profusely that three men entered their house and rummaged through their stuff for money. They shot her parents because they did not tell the intruders about the exact location where they could find cash. But the detectives questioning her seem to be utterly confused as they listen to her.Why did the intruders not take a lot of the cash and valuables still remaining intact in the house despite the fact that these could be easily detected? And most importantly, why would the intruders leave Jennifer alive even though she is a firsthand witness of their actions Things take a rather bizarre turn when it is discovered that Jennifer is not the only witness alive. Her father, who was shot and remained in coma for days, is taken out of coma and he gives an astonishing account of the events that took place.Highly Recommended.",False
24,6,Bizarre True Crime,RussHog,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the story about the interrogation and investigation into Jennifer Pan, who hired men to murder her parents and staged the crime so it looked like she was a victim of the home invasion. As the story unfolds, you def can see she was good at lying and smart, but also that her parents put too much pressure on her to be someone who she wasn't and the left her with nowhere to go but into a downward spiral.This kid was a great piano player, why would you want her to be a pharmacist. Why not encourage her to follow her passion? I understand not wanting her to be with the deadbeat boyfriend, but that is also a situation you need to learn to handle without being so controlling. Kids have to be given the tools to make the right choice.I don't think her parents brought what happened onto themselves, but I do think that they put too much pressure on her and the thing is...you're in Canada you're not in Vietnam. Your daughter is going to want to be Canadian. Let her be herself. Love her for who she is.As for the ex-boyfriend, he and his friends absolutely should have known better. What the heck were they doing? Killing her parents so they could get some insurance payout from the home? No excuses there.In the end, I feel bad for Jennifer she never got the help she needed, but there really is no excuse to hire people to take out your parents. I hope she can get some healing and closure.",False
25,4,Netflix Fails At Telling The Most Important Parts Of The Story,cadillac20,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere's an interesting story here, one which numerous YouTube videos have covered, about a girl living in a suffocating home with high expectations who was clearly broken by the life she was forced to live. Instead, Netflix ops for the usual shock and awe, telling a fairly black and white story about a good girl living a life of lies who does everything to be a with a guy she couldn't be with. There's a lot of liberties taken with the story, to the point they don't even mention she has a brother. In the end, she's painted as this horrible monster when the story should have been focused on her home life, her relationship with her parents, and how this played into what happened. It feels dishonest, cold, and lacking. If you want to learn about this story, check YouTube and skip this doc.",True

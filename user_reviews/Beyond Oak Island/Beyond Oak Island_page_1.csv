1,7,Yay,darkdementress,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm excited for this show, i really love these old crazy men and the history and the stuff they find. I really hope they actually do find some sort of treasure! They gotta make that money back from oak Island lol! The only thing i don't like is its only usa stuff and considering they are on Canadian soil for most of the year and oak Island is all about Canada and is in Canada they should include stories from Canada or from around the world. And they don't mention women from history. The first episode was about pirates and there was several well known successful female ones and no mention at all about them..",False
2,6,Aury's Treasure,eastricheyequipment,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anclote island is NOT in Tampa (Hillsboro county) but in Pasco County or New Port Richey by the Anclote Power Plant. Please get your facts straight. Though many people are interested in your show, the location should not put the spotlight on Tampa. There are many protected and un explored area's in our County and the Credit needs to go to the correct site / County and location. The story line is good, but you still have yet to find treasure oa any of your locations. Oak Island was a bust. Good editing, clear and simple. Your show needs a little more. Let's see your treasures. How about an episode with that.",False
3,10,New episodes are much better,bluelaser-82709,n/a,15/08/2025,"The new episodes are great! They are actually fuming a lot of stuff on the show and does not feel staged. Return to poverty is a good one as well as the Fischers all I'm season 3. Rick is the absolute best. He is kind and sincere and matty is full of e very as well. It would be great if they made a spin off show with the Groleau's because the husband and wife team was great to see and a great dynamic to be showcased, it stands out. And the fischers, wow! They are finding treasure and could have their own show as well. It will be great to see what the parent show has in store for us on the new season which airs soon.",False
4,1,Padded out,dmack-5,n/a,15/08/2025,"Only seen the first episode, but it seems to be padded out even worse than the Curse of Oak Island.
They are using the same contrived reactions where anything they need to emphasise shows the same reaction (sharp look sideways to whoever is nearby). This is boring now.
The Oak Island series feels overstretched now and this feels like a step too far.",False
5,2,"Just recapping mysteries, theories and history.",Galdhr,n/a,15/08/2025,"I actually, maybe foolishly, thought they'd be delving into the mysteries and trying to solve some stuff but nope. They just go over the history of each treasure-mystery, then for about maybe 10 minutes end up going to the site and look around and ponder, maybe do some metal-detecting, look at some rocks, find a rusty bullet-casing or carving and go ""Oh! There must definitely be something to this mystery if we'd keep digging!"" and then they leave.Major disappointment. Major bore.",False
6,1,A Waste of Time,TheShiningGuy,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched the first episode of this and I have absolutely no desire of ever returning to it. Everything felt a bit like padding and there was no actual treasure hunts until the end in a place called Hendrick's lake. But the worst part is that it didn't have a bloody ending. They all got excited over what they think could be a wagon full of silver at the bottom of this lake, saw irregular shapes on a solar scan and a diver found a part of a wagon wheel but they couldn't investigate further because a random storm suddenly happened that apparently they knew about before but didn't mention. And then, it ended. They literally said they'd go back in a couple days but no, there was absolutely no resolution. They didn't even just pull up a bit of junk, there was nothing to close it off. It was just like, oh, we can't do it today? Okay, I guess we end the show then. I really don't recommend watching this, just watch something better. There are probably better things exactly like this on the history channel, so watch those.",False
7,1,Filler not associated with the episode,dmurray-32819,n/a,15/08/2025,"While watching the Midwest millions episode, they show a picture of Harper's Ferry, WV, while talking about a ""wall of silver"" from a peninsula in Michigan. Why a picture of Harper's Ferry? Not even a mention of like hey, maybe it was treasure from Harper's Ferry??? No reason at all for a picture of Harper's Ferry when talking about michigan. Totally disjointed.",False
8,1,Staged,aprilcary,n/a,15/08/2025,Don't waste your time. The show feels staged. Just watched one episode where some over actor named Matt went to Utah with some couple who ate treasure hunting the knights of the golden circle. They staged a truck drive by and the guy Matt is literally thee worst. His responses to everything is fake. It's like he tries to overly hype up everything. If I never saw him on TV another day in my life it wouldn't be a day to soon....,False
9,2,Expected More Modern Day Searching,mailfilter-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I know. This is on the HISTORY Channel and should be about history, but I was expecting the folks to spend more time in the present 'digging' up history. In the second episode, they spent almost 30 minutes talking about the exploits of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (and even the Dalton Gang), but less than 15 minutes of Gary Drayton being on location searching for anything. Seems like they need too much filler material in the episodes somewhat like they do with The Curse of Oak Island and fill it in with old material from previous seasons",False
10,3,A Roll of Gorilla Tape Will Quickly Fix Beyond Oak Island,wilmafingerdew,n/a,15/08/2025,"Someone please Gorilla Tape Matty Blake to the boat seat. And while you're at it, put an extra large piece of it across his mouth.Matty makes these BOI episodes extremely uncomfortable to watch. He just comes off as a total sycophant. Hey guys. Can we go diving yet? Can we? Can we? Can we?When they finally do, you can see the trepidation in the other crew members when the divers hit the water and Matty takes the comm and becomes the man in charge. It's like these divers have been on the bottom for 10 seconds and Matty is already hounding them. Everything all right down there? Find anything yet? How's it going?Diving is serious business. If I had some jamoke hounding me on the comm line every 15 seconds, I'd be very tempted to surface and promptly toss him overboard. TV show or no TV show.Nothing ruins a documentary faster than a producer that inserts himself into the documentation. Give the basics of the story and then get out of the way and let the experts take it from there.",False
11,4,Welcome to the Business Plan,A_Different_Drummer,n/a,15/08/2025,"THEIR business plan. Not YOURs. On paper this makes sense.What started as a simple search for treasure on Oak Island, supposed to last a season or two, has become a multi-year never-ending story. In the BUSINESS of syndicated TV, the only way to cash in on that is to spin-off something with the same actors, crew, producers etc. Big bucks. As long as the customers ... err ... viewers ... go for it ....?",False
12,3,Not a treasure hunting show,bitbucketchip,n/a,15/08/2025,"The premise here is two brothers who can't find anything on Oak Island have some insights to offer other treasure hunters? Who thought that was a good idea? Unless those insights are ""save your money"" it's difficult to see what the Laginas bring to the table.Each episode presents a treasure hunt in the US. The intro voice over promises a worldwide scipe, but in three seasons the world has consisted of Arizona and Florida.Occasionally an episode is on a professional salvage effort, but mostly it's amateurs with a story about as believable as Oak Island. As you might expect, the professionals find something (minor) during the course of the show while the amateurs find nothing but more ""clues"" to the ""mystery"".The Lagina Brothers are the draw here, but rarely do they appear in the episode beyond being an audience for some cockamamie treasure story and a recap of the failure to find anything at the end. Instead, we're treated to Matty Blake, the obsequious lap dog mascot from the Curse of Oak Island show. He's hard to watch, if only because he brings literally nothing to the proceedings. It would have been much better to field a geologist or archeologist or established treasure hunter or even just someone you'd like to have a beer with.The major failing of the show beyond Matty is that the amateurs never find anything. Each episode with them ends on a preposterous note: it's going to rain, it's getting dark, we need a bigger shovel. All problems readily solved the next day. But no, the episode ends. This is an insulting plot device to hide the fact the audience has been duped and the treasure story was fabricated nonsense from the outset.Three stars for a couple episodes where we learn of actual salvage efforts. No stars for the amateur stories and for Matty Blake. Three stars.",False
13,3,"while the premise is interesting, the show isn't",laineyd-15587,n/a,15/08/2025,"Too scripted, with Matty being such a blatent brown-noser and the two Lagina brothers so full of themselves, it's difficult to take seriously.I had it at 4 stars, but while writing this, decided to drop to three.",False
14,1,Lies lies lies,bagadonuts-34221,n/a,15/08/2025,"An absolute joke of a show that has no basis in fact, fiction, or reality!! Constant misquotes of clearly fact checkable items such as $20,000 in 1892 being worth 20 million today!! Absurd statements like a guy in a canoe scouting for alligators and water moccasins behind the boat he's scouting for!! Episode after episode reaching no conclusion and moving on to a new story the next week!! Absolute trash...please do not waste any of your time!!! Oh my review does not have enough characters...well allow me to continue!! The nerve it takes for the history channel to put out trash like this with history in their name is unforgivable!!",False
15,1,Very disappointing and appears staged.,tombartho-98299,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have watched every episode of The Curse of Oak Island because I remember reading the same Reader's Digest article in the 60's and fantasizing about finding buried pirate treasures. When I learned about this series I thought I would check it out.First episode they find something on sonar, dive on it, recover what they said could be a part of the wagon wheel, and go in because a storm came in. They talk about going back down to it but that is where it ends, no follow up.Episode two mostly talks about wild west bandits and spend only a few minutes of the show searching finding a horseshoe nail and an old rifle cartridge casing. Now, at times when watching The Curse of Oak Island, when they ""found"" something I questioned if it was found or planted. When they showed a close up of the casing it was clearly seen that it had been decapped (the primer was removed). A spent casing would still contain the primer unless someone removed it to reload it. That pretty much convinced me it was planted there. Very disappointing.",True
16,1,Love Curse of Oak Island but Beyond Oak Island Fails :(,kathyfuller-80766,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love the original Curse of Oak Island and was really looking forward to this series to fill time in their off season but this series is lacking. I don't care for the host, Matty. It feels like he is acting and not doing a very good job at that either. There is also way too much conversation up front and not enough searching. They need to just let Marty, Rick or even Alex host the show. Actually anyone from the ""fellowship"" on the original show would be better than the current one. It has a lot of potential and I really want it to make it but it needs work and a different host or it will keep going downhill.",False
17,1,It's getting old...,randy-53583,n/a,15/08/2025,"I keep getting suckered into the *hunt*.. It ALWAYS ends up the same. Ooops, the wind is bad...Oops, the weather is bad...Ooops, we are getting low on air in the tanks...Ooops, it's getting dark.... Ooops, we ran into water so we have to stop digging.. COME ON GUYS!!! FIND SOME GOLD AT LEAST ONCE!!!! For all the hype and all the constant repeating everyone's names, you could at LEAST give of something to look at. But no, you keep stringing us along, for reasons I do not understand. We are here, hoping for you and you team, to find some old treasure. But you let us down, with stupid excuses, every week. At least you could give us follow ups, if the team found something or not.",False

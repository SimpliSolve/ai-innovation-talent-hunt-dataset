1,2,Absolutely shockingly bad,iangeorge-29018,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is what a documentary produced by chatgpt would be. Absolutely no soul and it's actually hurting my ears listening to the documentary as I type.It's purely a rehash of what anyone would find on Wikipedia interspersed with some standard footage of the band.There's no behind the scenes footage or interviews, no insight into what drives the band or how they've stayed together for so long.The narrator is completely wrong for the subject matter, and American for an Irish band. I'm a big fan of U2 but they can't surely have agreed to this rubbish.I've switched off after 40 minutes because it pains me so much to see such a poorly put together pierce of work for such a good band.Shame.",False
2,1,"Great band, horrible documentary",lifeflightdoc,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're looking for anything halfway insightful or revealing about U2, look elsewhere. This rolls out almost as though someone skimmed the band's Wikipedia page and then declared themselves qualified to make a documentary. Another reviewer says it sounds like the text came from ChatGPT, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised with gems such as:
""Four boys from a small town become worldwide superstars,""
and, ""With hundreds of thousands of fans worldwide, U2 has sold over 170 million records.""Um, Dublin, Ireland may not be NYC or Tokyo, but it's not some unheard of hamlet out in the middle of nowhere. And how do you figure a fan base so small with record sales so big? Each fan owns some 200-1000 U2 records???The 1985 LiveAid performance was without a doubt the tipping point in launching U2 to superstardom, but it gets about 10 seconds of attention here.It's a cheaply made movie, seeming to just piece together meaningless clips and photos of the band at various stages while a moronic narrative drones on. Perhaps most telling of all - THERE'S NO MUSIC BY U2 IN THE UNDERSCORE.Garbage filmmaking all around.(Review based on about 25 minutes of watching, so perhaps some of this doesn't reflect latter portions of the movie, but that's 25 minutes I'd have preferred to spend getting a root canal without any anesthetic)",False

1,7,Shockingly painful to watch.,loracharvey,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe all wonder to an extent if our partners are loyal to us when they are away fo long periods. I never asked my husband as I couldn't stand the pain of knowing. Jlloyds mother has a lot to answe for, she knew about his deceit. She covered for him, she made it possible for him to dupe his wife and his children for seven years. There's a crime that should not go unpunished. Are you happy now after helping your son to decieve so many people. Three women lost the love of Jlloyd that day and the children had their dad taken away. This film cuts deep to the bone. We all need to be able to trust our partners when they are working away from home. Mummy dearest.... you have a lot to answer for. I hope you are teaching your grandchildren to be honest.",True
2,3,Typical WAG,chezzamacmurphy,n/a,16/08/2025,The wife didn't want to lose any of the money or glory what was stopping her getting a job? Continuing to have kids?He was an absolute loser and she is still defending him.Two different families leaving everyone in debt.Why didn't she make him get help for his gambling instead of just leaving him to it. I guess she thought he would have a big win and she could spend more of his money.No sympathy for people like that.The wife didn't want to lose any of the money or glory what was stopping her getting a job?

3,9,A fool and his money are easily parted,medic061076,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerClearly never thought that a footballers playing career isn't for long, but they spend like the Â£1000s a week are never going to end. The WAG needs to recognise that all the flashy showing off is only for a few years. No forward planning no plan B. It's a lesson to all those whose ego is bigger and belief of playing career longer than it ever will be. They are only as good and worth the money until the next young spark arrives and they arrive each and every day.And I'm afraid his true colours and his addictions ruined what could have been a comfortable life, nothing extravagant but decent however blinded by his own self importance destroyed many others lives.",True

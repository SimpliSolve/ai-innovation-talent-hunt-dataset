1,9,Another jewel from the Coens,AlsExGal,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie opens with the words ""This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred."" I never challenged these words, but apparently no such incidents as depicted in this film ever occurred. The movie plays out quite believably - A middle-class car salesman gets in over his head financially by embezzling from his employer, thinking that the business deals he is making with the money will allow him to replace the stolen goods before he is detected. When his schemes don't pan out he must find a way to replace the money. The salesman's father-in-law - and employer - is wealthy but distant and indifferent towards him, so he hatches a plan to fake his wife's kidnapping with the help of two felons he doesn't know at all who are ""vouched for"" by an ex-con mechanic that works at the same dealership he works for. He figures his father-in-law will pay the ransom, he'll split it with the felons, and his problems will be solved. This is not to be the case. It turns out that these felons are more violent and uncontrollable than the salesman counted on, and they leave quite a body count in their wake. Also, in another clever twist, what becomes of the ransom money over which so many greedy people in the film have fought and died is quite ironic to say the least. Although I wouldn't exactly say we read this story in the paper everyday, we all have read something similar - someone who has lived an ordinary life for several decades suddenly gets tempted into some criminal activity that quickly escalates out of control.The person who unravels the mystery of the crimes is the most unstereotypical of police officers - Marge Gunderson. She is the extremely pregnant chief of police in the small town where the first murders occur, and her combination of brains and folksy charm masterfully handle witnesses and trace the crime back to the car salesman and his dealership.I've never been to Minnesota, but if the Coens' rendition of that state and its people was as spot-on as their parody of the American southwest in ""Raising Arizona"", then they have really done their research. I highly recommend it.",True
2,8,Thank's a bunch for this one,Stibbert,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!",False
3,7,Cold-hearted,paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it.",False
4,10,Don't Forgo Fargo,rmax304823,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBoy, is this a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.The performances, for instance, everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent, a very pronounced accent, let's say. So when characters are doing wicked things on screen, it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things. It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously -- only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys, but no more than that.Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully. They never swear either. ""You're darn tootin',"" they say. The casting couldn't be better, with Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Macy outstanding.The script is likewise splendidly done. It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs. Without taking the space to describe them, I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school. Why is it in there at all? (My God, those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly.) Well -- among other things, such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy, it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature. When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily. When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay. She is polite, a little distant without being unfriendly, completely practical, and absolutely iron bound in her values. Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe. Further, this scene is a set up for a later one. After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies, she wakes up to the fact that, yes, people can tell untruths -- and she returns to interview Macy a second time.In another scene, when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview, he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car. She exclaims, ""Oh, for Pete's sake, he's FLEEIN' THE INTERVIEW."" It's impossible to improve on a line like that, or on MacDormand's delivery of it.The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction. The pauses come at the right times. A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV. Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach. He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar. He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside. Now in an ordinary action movie, by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway. Not here. The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door, half horrified and half curious. ""Who is this guy? He's not the meter reader, is he?""Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too. Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition, but Dad offers him only a finder's fee. We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in. Cut. Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another, and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness. Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it.Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie. People die in it, drive off the road because of it, stand shivering in it. Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow. The shoveler stops, gazes up at the sky, and remarks that it ""ought to be really cold tomorrow."" Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow. MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a niveous white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him, saying something like, ""Why did you do it, for a little bit of money? It's a perfect day, and here you are."" (A perfect day!)There are seven murders in this movie. Only three take place on screen. The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands.""Fargo"" is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD. It's an original and refreshingly adult picture. Don't miss it.",True
5,n/a,You're darned tootin'!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"""What'd this guy look like anyway?""  ""Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.""  ""Uh-huh. In what way?""  ""Just a general way.""  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coen's finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation  with Gaear and the wood-chipper.  Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H.  Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, ""He's fleeing  the interview!""  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.  If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent  life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you.",False
6,10,The Best Effort From A Number Of  People,ccthemovieman-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't see this in the theater but saw it the first week it was out for rental, and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.About the story: first, it is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie. That's a lie. It's a fictional kidnapping-turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a comedy. Yup, this is pure ""black comedy."" It's dark humor mixed in with a parody about the way the Scandanavian people in the upper Midwest supposedly speak.Both William H. Macy and Frances McDormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents. Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three ""are a trip."" Macy is hilarious; the best character in here, in my opinion. The more I watch this film, the funnier he gets. It's also the best role, I assume, ever for McDormand who was never a star before - or since - this movie. Her character in here, ""Marge Gunderson,"" elevates this movie from just another modern-day sick crime movie, to an original. It's nice to see a wonderful husband-wife relationship, too, as is shown here with her and husband ""Norm"" (John Lynch).You have this clean, old-fashioned lady cop (McDormand), a middle-of-the-road bungling car salesman (Macy) and two extreme low-life killers in ""Carl Showalter"" (Buscemi) and ""Gaear Grimsrud"" (Peter Stormare) all combining to make this story a mixture not only of people but genres. Other minor characters are strange, too, led by one of Marge's old high school acquaintances ""Mike Yanagita"" (Steve Park). Add to that some equally-bizarre music (slow violins) and you have this unusual story that brings out the morbid fascination in us viewers.So, I guess what I am saying is this movie truly is an original, the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors, McDormand, Macy and Buscemi.",False
7,10,A masterpiece of Shakesperean proportions,retroman85,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter ""What's this?"" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s.",False
8,8,It's such an entertaining film.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jerry Lundegaard is sick of working for his father in law, sick of his wife, and decides it's time to get rid of his challenging relatives, he employs hitmen, but things don't go according to plan.Fargo is one of those films that didn't finish with time, arguably it gets better with subsequent viewings. Yes it's a thriller, but it's way too comical to be a straight up action thriller, the humour is prevelant throughout, it's a black comedy, and for my money, it's one of the best of them, some of the situations are outrageous.It's almost a little surreal at times, let's be clear, this is not based on any real life events, what it is however is thoroughly entertaining. It will make you want to watch the TV series.I will never tire of hearing the word 'Marge,' and if you're watching for the first time, you'll hear it a lot, you'll also hear some curious accents.Very well acted, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi nailed it for me.I'd have gone crazy at that lake too!8/10.",False
9,6,Fargo - Review,Muelko,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't really think, about what to expect from this movie, but ehm - it was good, but I don't understand the cult status here. Absolutely not. It has some interesting ideas and some bizarre moments and it's fun and all, but not a single twist or some kind of thick character development - I don't know, wasn't bored, but it is just a mediocre crime thriller with some nice moments here and there, but certainly nothing more. Francia McDormand was very good, and so was Macy and Buscemi and that blonde guy, but I don't really know what to love. I appreciate it, of course I do, it's not a trash movie and the cinematography isn't bad (omg it's Deakins), but 4.2 on Letterboxd? That's quite a lot for this movie. But finally watched it, because I remember I started a watch long ago but didn't watch it so yeah, glad I finally did and - it wasn't excellent. Just a fun little crime movie, nothing more I'm afraid.",False
10,9,Reflections on a second viewing,bob.gladish,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis should stand as the Coen brothers' tour de force, although I found  ""The Big Lebowski"" to be an even more satisfying film. I look at  ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""Brother, Where Art Thou?"" as being  the Coen's three best movies. I hope there is more from them in the  future that can rival these three; though recent offerings such as  ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", could be proving their  peak creativity is behind them.  ""Fargo"" is beyond a doubt, their masterpiece. IMDb's ratings bear this  out - 8.2 for ""Fargo"", 8.0 for ""Lebowski"", and 7.8 for ""Brother"". For  sheer entertainment, ""Lebowski"" or should I call it, ""The Dude"" wins  handsdown, but ""Fargo"" has all the elements of a true classic. Beyond a  doubt, I have never seen such a dramatically-obvious portrayal of good  vs. evil, and never, never, have I seen such gut-wrenching violence.  Oh, the violence, beautifully believable, in it's grotesque way. This  movie is proof that artistic freedom to portray such violence should  never be denied. Steve Buscemi's bullet-grazed face becomes almost as  painful for the watcher as it is for his character; Steve Buscemi's leg  in the wood chipper is as horrific a scene as you are ever going to  see. Enough to give Marge Gunderson morning sickness all over again.  And the good vs evil thing: so obvious in the contrasts between Marge  (the good), Buscemi and Stormare (the evil), and poor Jerry Lundegaard  (William H. Macy) squeamishly caught in a trap in-between. I could only  handle the violence because of Marge. She is the rock of normality, who  continues trumpeting the virtuous life, when all hell is breaking loose  around her. She knows all-to-well that ""you know what"" happens, but  always knows ""you know what"" can be flushed down the toilet. Frances  McDormand, as Marge, deserves every acting award she ever got for this  role. Marge, to me, is the most perfect cop I've ever encountered. She  is polite, non-judgemental, yet able to ask the tough questions that  gets her the information she needs. You can see how thoroughly she  sizes up those she interviews: watching every nuance of their body  language, and hearing ever inflection of their speech. Now here's a  woman who can spot a lie when others can't. Unlike so many cops in  movies, she doesn't have to beat information out of someone; she can  charm it out of them, all the while appealing to their moral  responsibility, no matter how immoral they may be.This is so well-shown  in scenes such as talking to the two young hookers in the bar, and  putting Jerry on the hotseat in the car dealership interrogations.  I elected not to watch some of the scenes on my second viewing.  Somewhat oddly, I skipped almost all the scenes involving Jean  Lundegaard (the kidnapped one) - I couldn't bear to watch what was  happening to this woman, knowing full well her fate. I felt so sorry  for her; she was the true victim in this - the most innocent, yet the  one who suffered the most. I guess a case could also be made that her  son, Scotty, suffered equally, but most of what he went through was not  presented on camera. Maybe he would suffer the most, for he had to live  afterward. Even Marge would suffer from this catastrophe, but you know  her suffering will be tempered by an unwavering belief that good  triumphs over evil. As the last scene shows (Marge getting into bed  with her husband): despite the horrors that might go on around us, we  must seek solace in the everyday beauty of the things that are nearest  and dearest to us all. And this message is conveyed to us all by the  Coen brothers without any allusions to religion whatsoever. But I'm  getting into a personal bias of my own here - if you take solace in  religion playing a part in morality, so be it.",True
11,6,WTF?!,Bored_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie ranks in the IMDb top 250 and has won two Oscars out of seven nominations, not to mention its cult status. If I didn't know all this, it would have left me without a special impression. But this way, it left me completely shocked. I honestly wonder who's crazy here. ""Fargo"" won an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Okay, on paper this story really has great potential. I can also understand William H. Macy's nomination somewhat. But nominations for Best Picture and directing?! Really, WTF?! All the characters in the film, except the cold-blooded sociopath, are portrayed as slightly falling behind in their mental development. Both their actions and how they are portrayed by the cast cause chronic embarrassment transfers throughout the film. Something like that would work in some types of comedy, but with such characters and acting, to call this movie a drama or a thriller ... WTF ?! Directing also has nothing to do with these genres. Drama and tension do not occur even in trace amounts. The story may be a true event, and in reality it was probably a drama and a thriller, but the way it is presented in this movie is totally frivolous. It had the potential for upsetting drama, for a suspenseful thriller, and even for a morbid comedy, but this mix of the Coen brothers looks like a clumsy result of their hesitation to opt for the genre. Watchable, but probably the most overrated movie I saw in years.6/10",False
12,9,The Coen Brothers come up with another winner.,Ceetee,n/a,15/08/2025,"With no major stars or well-known names, the actors outshine many more familiar personages.  The story is well thought out.  The criminals don't try to ingratiate themselves with the audience which adds to its reality.  The acting is most convincing and the writing is excellent.  Even the cold of a North Dakota winter comes across.  Every film course should make use of this movie to demonstrate how to make a very good film without relying on a bottomless budget.",False
13,7,"Okay, but what was the fuss all about? Accents??",lestewart,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw this film in 2004, long after the Oscar buzz had died down. I suppose it's a victim of its own hype. I enjoyed the film, but it seemed somehow smaller than I expected. Frances McDormand's Oscar-winning performance seems so trivial, seen through the perspective of eight years. The story is okay, though I again wonder about the Oscar the Coens received. (The 1996 Oscars were a somewhat weak field.) I spent most of the movie wondering if people in Minnesota and the Dakotas really talk that way, or is ""Fargo"" as much a travesty of regional accents as most ""southern"" movies are? Overall, the whole film was a nicely filmed, tight little story with apparently overdone regional ironies.",False
14,4,YEP!  I AM THE ONE GUY WHO DIDN'T LIKE FARGO!,Keyser Soze-12,n/a,15/08/2025,"Okay, I know I have just made more enemies than I can count.  But, I ask, what is so funny about Fargo?  Really, I never laughed through the whole movie, ever.  I have a really twisted sense of humor, but anything can make me laugh.  I loved O' Brother Where Art Thou.  I loved Happy Gilmore.  I loved Clerks.  I loved Dr. Strangelove.  I loved Blazing Saddles.  So there, I love a very diverse amount of comedies.  But I did not love Fargo.First off, the accents.  People say that these Wisconsin accents are hilarious.  Well, they're not.  I grew up in the South, okay.  I have never met a person with a Wisconsin accent in my life.  But I do see them in movies and on TV a lot.  These are just normal accents.  There is nothing satirical about them.  They aren't that funny.  Get over it.Okay, the plot.  Is it just me or is the plot to this movie mediocre and boring?  It's an average crime movie.  I know crime movies.  That's my forte, you could say.  My favorite movie genre is crime (Pulp fiction, Leon, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Heat, etc...).  But this movie is just an average movie.  The plot is pretty predictable too.  I could have guessed the entire movie from the word go.Now, I will give credit where credit is due.  The movie isn't all bad.  The acting is good.  The dialog is quick and edgy.  The writing is intelligent. And the direction is sharp and nice.  But there is nothing funny, groundbreaking, or remotely interesting about this movie.Okay, one last gripe.  If you haven't seen the movie, avert thy eyes, because the ending is about to be told.  Okay, you still here?  Good, I warned you.The wood chipper scene is one of the most famous scenes in the history of movies, or so it has become.  Honestly, I see nothing funny about it.  It's not that I'm against throwing people into wood chippers.  I liked Evil Dead 2.  Gore doesn't bother me.  But what is so damn funny about throwing a human corpse into a wood chipper?  It makes sense to me.  If you wanted to dispose of a body and a wood chipper is near by, well hey! IDEA!  THROW IT IN!  But is it funny?  Not really.  Is it gory? No.  Is it bad?  No.  But is it deserving of being called one of the greatest scenes ever?  HELL NO!I am really trying to understand people's love of this movie.  I wasn't the biggest fan of The Blues Brothers, but I understand why people love it. Fargo isn't funny, nor is it very interesting.  The acting is the only thing that kept me interested.  I love W.H. Macy.  All the actors and actresses are good in this movie.  But is this movie the work of genus that people make it out to be?  No, ohhhhhhhhhh God no.In conclusion: This movie is an ""okay"" movie.  There's nothing bad about it, but it isn't great.  I hate it when people make movies out to be better than they really are.  I found The Untouchables, The Blues Brothers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Being John Malkovic, and Fargo to all be overrated movies.  They're not bad, they're just not great, or even that good either. (ESPECIALLY CROUCHING TIGER!)  People, please join me in the crusade to bring the truth out and bring down the overrated movies!My rating: 5/10PS:  Go ahead, send the hate mail.  I welcome it.",False
15,n/a,One of Those Rare Gems in the Cinema,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny, wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as ""Fargo"".  It's one of those films that you just have to see.  William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominated performance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one a know-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap his wife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father. Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day.  I won't give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen this inventive film.  ""Fargo"" was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved.  In this age of by-the-numbers film making, this film was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the 1970s such a great decade for movies.  5 stars out of 5.",False
16,10,What a flick!,mccartnist_lennonist,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it. It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness. At times scary (not in the horror movie sense) and quite rich in dark humour, this is one of those movies that gives you a weird felling inside even an hour after its over. The music is quite appropriate and unlike Scarface, is timeless. The camera work is usually quite basic but whoever directed the photography had the enjoyable habit of giving us interestingly artistic segways between scenes. This is the first film so far that I've given a 10 out of 10. I was going to give it a 9, but I couldn't think of a reason to take any points from perfect.",False
17,9,High quality tongue-in-cheek film,julieshotmail,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some may argue that this film is too violent. Some may say that this film is offensive to those who live in Minnesota or North Dakota due to the exaggerated accents. Nevertheless, this film is superb in that it has just the right amount of mix between comedy, horror, and police procedural antics. I recommend it because it does flow well, and you get to appreciate the talents and commitment the actors put into this film. Rewatching this in 2023, I have come to appreciate why this has become a cult classic that has spawned its own TV series dating back to 2014, with a season 5 just dropped, paying homage to the movie with neat Easter eggs. If you enjoy the TV series, you'll do yourself a favor with a rewatch of this one.",False
18,10,Tragic Comedy Amongst Demure Characters,cmkdakota-65369,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of those movies that emotes nostalgia from the viewer....even years later. I score very few movies a perfect 10, but this one is even kiel to Three Billboards over Missouri, also with Frances McDormand rocking her role.The fascination of the personalities, voice and diction of the residence of the northernmost portions of Minnesota, and North Dakota provides a fabulous foundation for this iconic movie.This movie is broken down into various scenes that might give you a moment of disconnect when they start, but they flow perfectly once you realize what is going on.Put very likable people in tragic and murderous situations and you have an almost Shakespearean tragic comedy....and that is hard to emulate.",False
19,10,My favourite Coen brothers movie,Leofwine_draca,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Coen brothers can always be guaranteed to deliver a quirky, diverting, off-key movie experience, and FARGO remains their most successful movie to date; a story of small-town life, dead cold temperatures, and a bloody crime wave. As with the majority – if not all – of their films, it's a densely-plotted, intelligently-scripted story, with a cold grasp on reality throughout but nevertheless some absurd situations to enjoy.Things begin small and gradually build up to a blood-spattered climax, propelled by tons of originality and irregularity which propels this past most similar genre fare. Frances McDormand deservedly got an Oscar for her excellent performance as the pregnant cop, but William H. Macy is equally good as the nervous car salesman whose life spirals out of control. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are also brilliant as the two psychotic criminals who begin by kidnapping and end in  well I'll leave it for you to find out. In parts touching, warm, funny, frightening and shocking, FARGO is an example of the crime thriller at its best.",False
20,7,"Good, but it did not connect too much with me.",exzanya,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really appreciate the stripped-back style and the characters are wonderfully unique, but this film unironically left me a bit cold, and I don't find the Coen style of quasi-quirky humour all that funny, i.e Hudsucker Proxy. But still a relatively fun and decent feature",False
21,10,You have no call to get snippy with me.,blanche-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since.What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.This film was a real high point for me. It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses. What can I say, except I'm heading out to the wood chipper.",False
22,7,A black comedy based on facts where petty crime leads to terrible events,ma-cortes,n/a,15/08/2025,"Coen film with ace performances , thrills , emotion , humor with tongue-in-cheek and some very off-killer dialogue . A riveting mixture of giggles and gore , not without its dull patches . Stars Jerry Lundegard (William H. Macy) , he is in an unknown financial jam , desperate for money and wants his father-in-law's money to solve it . His scheme to get the money involves hiring nasty criminals , Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaer Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) , to kidnap his own wife for a million dollar ransom , leading them to believe it's only a small proportion of that sum , and then splitting the ransom with the delinquents . However, this quickly falls apart when his father-in-law , Wade Gustafson (Harve Presnell) , meddles into the twisted happenings insisting on delivering himself and after three killings and the persistent work of chirpy but efficient police chief, the six-months pregnant Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormad) who's very much more cunning than her staff and is soon on the trail of the truth . A homespun murder story !. Small town !. Big crime !. Dead cold !. A lot can happen in the middle of nowhere !. An ordinary place, an extraordinary thriller !.A riveting mixture of black comedy , drama , violence , gore , giggles , and some very outlandish as well as excessive dialog , not without its dull patches . While this may seem like plot-a-plenty , it's mainly a showcase for the Cohen brothers' unique texturing of style and quirky but deep roles . Includes the Cohen's pithy dialogue , it looks and sounds marvellous . The film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of Barton Fink or Blood Simple but it is still a prime example of the Cohen's effortless brand of stylistic and storytelling brilliance . Starred by some rare characters suffering several Coanesque adventures ; what the protagonists encounter along the way are a number of surprising situations and off-the-wall characters that , when all is said and done , seem like just that individual incidents that never really add up to a whole plot . Stars the Oscarized Frances MacDormand giving a very likable acting as the headstrong officer of the law , while Steve Buscemi , Peter Stormare are two botcher evil-tempered , short-fused gunmen and William H. Macy as the desperate husband. Followed by Fargo TV series (2014) , it is one of the best TV surprises of the last years by co-opting the tone of the Coen Brothers' classic film, but still adding a unique stamp on the material .Thanks to Roger Deakin's gleaming camerawork the film expand a colorful and luminous cinematography. As well as sensitive and agreeable musical score by Carter Burwell , Coen's regular . This fun and entertainining motion picture was well written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen . They have shared these duties on all of their films, but Joel has always been listed as director and Ethan as producer . The first Coen brothers film where both he and brother Ethan Coen are given directing and producing credits was Ladykillers (2004). Both of whom are part of the prestigious group of individuals to have won Oscars for writing , directing and producing in the same year, for the film No Country for Old Men (2007). Their career is splendid from first film : Blood simple (1984) to Arizona Baby (1987), Miller's crossing (1990) , Oh Brother ! (2000) ,Barton Fink (1991), the great Lebowski (1998), The Man Who Wasn't There (2001) , Intolerable Cruelty (2003) , Burn After Reading (2008) , A Serious Man (2009) , True grit (2010) ,among others . Rating : 7/10. Well worth watching , better than average. The flick will appeal to Frances McDormand fans and Joel/Ethan Coen followers.",False
23,9,Excellent Film,Cpartak,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFargo is one of my favorite films of all time and in my opinion deserves to be in the top 10 films of the 90's. From the onset of the movie, with views of the snow covered North Dakota landscape and the beautiful and haunting music of composer Carter Burwell playing in the background until the very last scene, Fargo never lets up. This film is Joel and Ethan Cohen's masterpiece, a truly original and one of a kind work. Every aspect of the film is handled with the utmost precision and care. The screenplay, written by Joel and Ethan, is in my opinion flawless. The dialog is at times serious and at other times hilarious, but most importantly always real and believable. The screenplay would be worth nothing, however, without the superb cast of the film that truly makes the characters come to life. Frances McDormand is perfect as the pregnant sheriff who is assigned to the murder case involving Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare. Steve Buscemi is excellent as always, playing a sleazy kidnapper who is perfectly described in one of the best lines of the film as simply ""funny looking - in a general kind of way"". The best performance, however, comes from William H. Macy who is absolutely brilliant as a desperate man who has everything to lose. Macy completely envelops himself in the role and captures perfectly the essence of a broken man whose world is crumbling all around him. The final scene in the motel when he is caught is incredibly powerful because Macy makes you feel the pain and sorrow that a man must feel when he knows that he's going to prison for the rest of his life.One of the things that I loved about this film is the colorful characters that are a trademark of every Cohen brothers film. In Fargo, these characters include dim witted hookers, psychopath kidnappers, a very pregnant sheriff, and a lot of snow. No matter how long or brief these characters are on the screen, however, they are all incredibly entertaining and fun to watch. That is one of the reasons that I enjoy films by the Cohen brothers. They have a great style and sense of humor that is all their own. They aren't afraid to be different from the Hollywood norm, and they make films on their own terms. Also, as evidenced by this film, they do a great job of getting the best out of every actor. I personally feel that William Macy and Frances McDormand have never been better before or since Fargo. I urge everyone to see this film and compare it to other great works of the last decade. I think you'll find that its place is right near the likes of Pulp Fiction, L.A. Confidential, The Usual Suspects and other great 90's films.",True
24,6,"Excellent acting, but smugness hangs over the whole thing like a frosty pall",moonspinner55,n/a,15/08/2025,"Minnesota car-dealer arranges to have his wife kidnapped in order to get his hands on his father-in-law's money, but the plan goes awry. Another blood-soaked black comedy from the Coen Brothers (Joel directed, and he and Ethan wrote the screenplay from a ""true story"", which won them Oscars). Frances McDormand, William H. Macy (in a star-making performance) and nearly everyone else in the cast give funny, credible and memorable performances, but the film itself is wobbly (purposefully, yet often irritatingly so), padded, and at times brutal--but nearly always undermined by a quasi-comedic tone which is both tiresome and tasteless. Despite strong scenes, it is over-scaled and cut very broadly, and cannot escape the Coens' penchant for self-reverence. **1/2 from ****",False
25,2,What Did I Miss Here?!,jrfranklin01,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOkay, so I've heard of the litany of accolades this movie has received. I've heard how this film is a ""black comedy"" by the Coen Brothers, who supposedly are geniuses in the film industry. And I've listened to friends discuss how creative and wonderful the film is. But none of this, I repeat, NONE OF THIS, is apparent in this movie. What I watched was a film confused at whether to be serious or comedic. And in making up its mind, both elements are fused together in a twisted fashion with an out-of-place Canadian humor.Basically the story is about a car salesman who needs cash...fast, so he pays a couple of guys to kidnap his wife so that her rich father will pay the ransom, thereby getting him the cash he needs. Well, all goes to hell as the kidnappers end up on a killing spree with a cop questioning all possible leads, including the car salesman himself.If in fact this film was based on a true story (as indicated at the beginning), I would be horrified if I were close to one of the victims. The Coen brothers make a strange mockery out of the deaths of the victims portrayed and deter the audience from taking the film seriously, instead giving them a quasi-mental hypothermia with the serious/humorous dichotomy. And even if this film is not based on a true story, it is so poorly directed that I just felt like I had wasted my time going around in circles. But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash. Sigh. What did I miss here?!",True

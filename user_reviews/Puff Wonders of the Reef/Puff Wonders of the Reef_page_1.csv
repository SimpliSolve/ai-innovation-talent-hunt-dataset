1,8,Amazing Imagery!,foy-rizla,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first thing to be said about Puff is how astonishingly beautiful it is. We are given a glimpse into a microscopic world that is endlessly fascinating and colorful, and the images themselves are a miracle of modern science. Added to this, we have good pacing; Yes, it does feel a little slow at times, almost as if it's happening under water (lol), but there are also some genuinely tense moments and the filmmakers should be commended for the way those moments are crafted.This movie has been accused of having an agenda and and maybe it does, but it's far from preachy. It simply shows us the realities of a world we forget exists and informs us of our effect on it. The truth is that any modern nature documentary has to record the human affect or it's not doing its job; it's incomplete, and anyone bemoaning this fact probably has an agenda of their own.Either way, Puff should be a good watch for documentary lovers, especially if they're interested in underwater life.8/10.",False

3,7,Great images but clumsy climate moralism,bydonc,n/a,16/08/2025,"A view into a fascinating world with really impressive visuals. Has just the right running time as well. Some genuinely bizarre and scary creatures can be observed in great detail.The sudden turn to tedious moralism towards the end leaves a sour taste though. Using the identifikcation with and sympathy for one single fish might work as a manipulation technique for children, but is much too blunt for adults. Surely the authors know that there are other factors except human misbehaving that influence the development of reefs.I would recommend to turn off the movie after the snail chase scene.",False
4,10,Beautifully filmed,adeena_20381,n/a,16/08/2025,Amazing colorful images from the Great Barrier Reef. Beautiful insight in the life of the reef from the eyes of a puffer fish. Hopefully those that see this understand the damage we can inflict on the planet and how serious the global warming is.,False
5,10,I love that little puff,GungunhanaKFCtm,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a stylised documentary, portraying an important message. It's better than any animation for learning like that. Incredible visuals, colour corrected to our sight. I can't see anything wrong with that. The reef has just respawned too, which is very great news! We have to help these funny little guys x.",False
6,10,"Gem of a ""must see"" docu-story for all; engaging truthful beauty",cgtam,n/a,16/08/2025,"This new fascinating film is SO underrated, found in Netflix's ""kids"" section. Photo pic looks like it's for kids but it's a true Wondor world of essential incredible microscopic life on Great Barrier Reef, and relevant to all reefs. The breathtaking colors, details, & film quality are exceptionally lovely, exceeding BBC earth at times using latest tech.Narration is told mainly from a colorful tiny puffer fish's point of view & how he must survive in a thriving reef. One is quickly engaged & developes empathy for this adorable tiny newly hatched fish, & ALL magnificent micro organisms that create & surround his ocean world.Majority of Film presents stages of struggle & humor for puffer fish and many weird & wonderful tiny micro lives surviving the reef world in stunning fascinating manner. Then it becomes heartbreaking as viewers see results of a warming ocean from climate change, the destruction of corals & billions of lives within.This film is proof NOT to take our seas for granted as humanity continues to act despite decades of widespread hard science. Narration delicately teaches, not preaches, & allows viewer to decide the issue of adverse climate change affects by showing time lapse destruction of a once vibrant reef beyond imagination, then its death - the ocean's foundation, building blocks for all life including humanity. It motivates one to care , protect & think about hidden biodiverse ecosystems that benefit all humans.For those critics desiring original eye opening docu film with true under cover scenes & causel science, displaying insatiable human greed fueling global mass commercial slaughter of all sea life since 1920s, unenforced laws, real culprits of plastic ocean poisoning, its sea life incl ppl who eat them- watch Netflix's ""Seaspiracy"". That docu also shows how consumers daily choices can stop secret greed based ""unseen"" plunder that threatens humanity's health & future.",False
7,10,Stunning,Roma73,n/a,16/08/2025,Stunning visuals. I watched this with my 9 year old daughter and we both loved it. Loads of cute little creatures ðŸ˜‰. And with a short but clear warning and explanation what us humans are doing to (future) sea life.,False
8,4,Beautiful but shallow,keikoyoshikawa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not sure why this documentary was made. It's not really about a pufferfish named Puff (cute but not very imaginative); nor is it really about corals; though both are featured prominently.The film is beautiful to look at, no doubt. But there just isn't all that much new information or even interesting information to justify another documentary about global warming.Best that I can say is that this was a good idea that was not well executed.",False
9,9,A beautiful film,traceysincavagets,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such captivating beauty that was expertly filmed alongside an interesting story following the life of one the most adorable creatures on earth. A great watch for the whole family that teaches the basics about the coral reef food chain along with all of its inhabitants, from microscopic to super sized. It also has a brief moment informing us about how the warning oceans are causing more and more of the coral reefs, asking with its inhabitants, to die. It's sad that another reviewer was upset about this being included. I guess they don't understand the severity of what's truly going on here and that not including this information in a film about life in the coral reef would be pretty ridiculous to say the least. They followed this puffer fish throughout its life... it's home is destroyed and you think they're not going to include it because it hurts your feelings? Get real. Puff is adorable and I highly recommend this film for any science or animal lovers out there.",False
10,10,life changing,covidisntreal,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film changed my life. Puff is my god and also the goofiest, quirkiest phish.

11,10,Brilliant doco,elsamorganmua,n/a,16/08/2025,Amazing story loved this doco Puff was so cute and the cinematography was incredible. And Rose Byrne's voice was mesmerising. The whole family loved it.,False
12,8,Great Food Chain Documentary,whitejra1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows the Great Barrier Reef on a microscopic scale. Told through the vein of a baby puffer fish, Puff, we are introuduced to myriad other creatures which Puff shares his marine ecosystem with.",False
13,5,Tree Huggers Under Water,bsant54,n/a,16/08/2025,"See Puff.See beautiful Coral.See things get eaten.Then see dead Coral.Puff sad.Not as sad as I am to hear and watch Netflix Eco Warrior can't leave well enough alone and leave people alone so they can just enjoy visual delights.Just STOP IT for the Love of God Netflix.If you want to Eco Advertise, give discounts on your charges. If not JUST STOP IT.",False
14,10,Awesome! Glad I Watched!,compjazzca-68116,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thought this was going to be an ani-kid's show. Thank you for showing me what I'll never be able to see in real life. Here in the North the coral reefs aren't talked about over coffee. CBC Quirks and Quarks is likely where we learned about their ill health - for lack of better term.It's fine with me if there was an ""agenda"" here; after all, many documentaries have them.This film shows one aspect of the many diverse eco-systems on this mind-blowing planet, each of which is intrinsically linked to all the others. It's not a Super Hero Fantasy show. It's a real reality show even if they may have 'shopped' the main character for clarity and continuity. I'll be watching this again. It's beautiful.",False

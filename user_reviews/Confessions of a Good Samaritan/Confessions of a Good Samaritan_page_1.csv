1,8,A Intriguing Documentary about the Nature of Altruistic Behavior,JustCuriosity,n/a,16/08/2025,"Confessions of a Good Samaritan was well-received in its world premiere at the SXSW Film Festival. Penny Lane takes us on circuitous journey through her decision to make an altruistic kidney donation to a stranger. She explores the nature of altruism in a humorous and revealing manner. Strangely, the journey seems a bit self-absorbed as she tries to explain and justify her own altruistic behavior. Her actions are laudable and selfless even as she seems deeply neurotic and insecure about what she is doing and why. Still, the documentary is entertaining and engaging. It would be a useful supplement for Philosophy classes on Ethics. Recommended for those interested in reflecting on the nature of self and selflessness.",False

3,10,A personal documentary of generosity,jppac-48863,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an excellent movie. It presents all aspects of what is widely thought to be the ne plus ultra of altruism. At times it is deeply personal and intimate documentary of a difficult and profoundly generous action. Penny is neither neurotic or insecure as those requesting consideration for non directed kidney donation are rigorously screened during the extensive pre-donation evaluation. Nor does the this seem self absorbed as the majority of the film is about the life with renal failure, the need for donors, the process of becoming a donor, etc. It is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, informative and inspiring.",False

2,10,A wonderful film showcasing the magnificent wildlife of Karnataka!,ConfusedRoulette,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the privilege of watching this film at an exclusive screening at the Bengaluru Palace Grounds in March last year. Each frame in the movie is beautifully captured with the aerial, panoramic and macro shots setting up the mood. The film is narrated in Sir David Attenborough's magical voice which gives the touch of finesse to it! All in all one should not miss out on this amazing experience!",False

5,10,Unbelievable glimpse into Karnataka's Wildlife,noxplayer,n/a,16/08/2025,"The trailer when released did exactly what a trailer should do.. make you wait like mad for the full movie, in this case a documentary. Amazing work done by the young gang of nature enthusiasts. And David Attenborough's legendary voice narrating the scenes and occurrences is just a treat for any Nature Documentary lover's ears and eyes. If paused at any shot.. YES ANY SHOT, it would give an amazing wall paper..!! The way wildlife is projected here is like never before. Many places are seen with a new view.
To add to all that is mentioned above is the BGM by Ricky Kej, which accentuates the overall video to a totally different level.",False
6,9,Marvelous,meetvikram,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just Watched This Documentry. Before this, I knew Karnataka just For Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Jawagal Shrinath, K.G.F. and Bengluru. After this i came to know that Karnataka has a rich rain forest almost like Amazon. I am not saying David Attonbrough said in narration. Background music feels like movie. Watch this and feel pride i. Being Indian. Its Availble in Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Telugu and English.
Thank You Discovery+..",False

8,9,A brilliant one,faiyazhawa,n/a,16/08/2025,"The best wildlife documentary in India. Loved the cinematography, sound design, background score and everything else! Just brilliant. Not very technical and hence involves and engages everyone who are not wildlife enthusiast as well. Universally appealing",False

Superb movie",False
10,6,Wow,gurujee1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was dying to watch it after seeing the gorgeous trailer. Finally got to see after its arrival on discovery plus.I must congratulate and thanks immensely the filmmaker and his entire crew for such a remarkable job. The attempt is really larger than life. The love of the filmmaker and his vision to bring legendary people like David Attenborough is certainly praiseworthy.I gave 6/10 as the film is formulaic. I would have loved a fresh take on the story telling. I must say I can feel every wildlife filmmaker is inevitably inspired by those BBC series and must be dreaming all life to make one himself like those British series. But it left me to desire for more.The colour grading of the entire series is what something should not attempt if he is a naturalist. Several shots look like Instagram photos of amateurs.Lastly, while I do love the score of the film as pieces of music but they are absolutely distracting. Again the composer must have seen Human Planet like series and has tried to imitate but the Wild Karnataka lacks the subtlety of those series as far as music is concerned. Yes, Nicky Kej has done a remarkable work giving the film local Indian flavour but I think music is over done for a 52 minutes long film. The uplifting music is too much which kills the suspense before it builds up. The theme kicks in every once in a while feels like film comes to the end.The director duo with camera crew has captured numerous intimate pictures of the wild Karnataka and with a certain posh and grandeur that has made me elated. I love the shot of revelation of the Royal Bengal Tiger by panning from behind to front which I think is very original.I would thank all the crew and the department of forest of Karnataka for give permission and encouragement to to carry out such a timely task. I hope the filmmaker will continue producing films like these.",False
11,8,Wonderful Shots. Worth a Watch,OnjiMooteDaMarle,n/a,16/08/2025,"At 5 minutes short of an hour, this journey of Karnataka's Wild Life is a MUST for budding kids specially toddlers. The 'film' doesn't have any moments of animals devouring animals except for shots of eating fish, crabs and the likes and that's why it is the best wild life film you can show it to kids.If it is still in theaters, take your kid now. The shots are beautiful. The narrator, Attenborough is Attenborough.Here is the sad part. The film is short. It ends sooner than you want it to. As someone from Karnataka this made me smile more. The film doesn't show anything new to learn but watching animals on big screen with some really melodious BG music, makes a calm and joyous environment for an hour.Kudos to Amoghavarsha and team. Super proud of you all.",False
12,7,Breathtaking documentary,Rajivsm,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is such a wonderful feeling to watch a documentary of my home land in
David Attenborough's narration. The documentary showed a different perspective of the beautiful Karnataka forest and it ecosystem. His other documentaries like 'Our Planet' on Netflix and 'Victoria Falls' were absolutely mind blowing too.I would have given it 10 stars but for the low res borrowed scenes which often spoiled my viewing experience.",False

20,8,Wish it was longer and slower,TheOtherVignesh,n/a,16/08/2025,"When i first saw the trailer of Attenborough narrating wild Karnataka i got excited very much, and i finally got to see it today.Even though it doesn't match the production and technical quality of BBC shows it's still amazing, i got tolearn lot about Karnataka's wild life and amazing natural wonders of Karnataka.I wish the narrative was slower, it kinda felt like very fast paced and i wish it was longer in multiple episodes with each Episodes showcasing different seasons with more content of each animals.Still this is the first show i watched that's from india, thank you for that and hoping for more in future",False
21,10,Probably the best documentary on screen!,ajith-v-m,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know Karnataka is beautiful but after seeing this, I can say it's heaven on Earth.

23,10,Superb,safenoe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI discovered Wild Karnataka recently through BBC Earth, and what a discovery. I've been to Karnataka a few times (Rabkavi, Sankeshwar and Belgaum) but never could I have imagined the wildlife of Karnataka is so stunning.Amitabh Bachchan would have been a worthy narrator to keep things Indian, although I guess David Attenborough has a connection through his brother directing Gandhi.",True
24,8,Stunning look at India's Karnataka!,pritol,n/a,16/08/2025,"As always any nature documentary narrated by Sir David Attenborough is going to have a lot of fans and rightly so!This 1hr special doesn't focus on any particular species or herd of animals, but it does cover many facets of the beauty of the Karnataka region.The cinematography is incredible, capturing in detail the incredible actions of many animals, such as a leopard running up a tree trunk, and the music is very tasteful and honours the Indian region it is covering.Well worth the hour! Happy to watch it again!",False

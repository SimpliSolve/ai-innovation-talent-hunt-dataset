1,10,Unlike Anything You Have Ever Seen,steveweller-66524,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is funny how sometimes you feel compelled to do something. I didn't understand it at the time, but I felt compelled that my wife and I needed to see this documentary. It is an amazing story of how one man decided to do something that God told him to do, and it didn't matter what the cost was. He did it, and he changed things in a way that can never be undone.This is an amazing story that my wife and I, who watch a lot of news had not heard about at all. We were shocked and amazed at how the MSM did everything they could to hide this story. We went to the theater in a rather sour mood because of things that were happening in our lives. We left it praising God for how amazing He is and how He is able to take the things that evil men use to destroy us and God, and He twists their evil plots to bring glory to Him.We left with a renewed vigor to strive forward in our ministry. I've seen movies that were fun, that were exciting, and that made me think. This is the first time I have seen a movie where I knew God was speaking to me, and where I saw what an awesome God we have in Jesus Christ.Do not miss this. You will not be sorry. We drove an hour to see it, and it was well worth it.",False
2,10,Better Than Expected,paulablade,n/a,16/08/2025,"Superspreader, with a named donned by those in direct opposition to the cause it espouses, is not afraid to include quotes and much open conversation from those contesting its mission.From this backdrop of opposing views, and an outlining of contradictions inherent in Covid lockdown policies, the film gives an accounting of the organic and passionate groundswell that became the Let Us Worship movement. Engaging and well-paced, the film is a piece of visual documentation that will either find you ebbing along with the flow of insistent, radical, and open devotion to Jesus, or offended at the idea that God would desire such corporate expressions of praise during an epidemic.",False
3,10,A story of hope...,ajim-21539,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary paints an accurate picture of the toll that was taken on the minds and hearts of the American people during the covid lockdowns. It gives great insight into the world of those that dare to challenge the mandates of government meant to keep people away from people yet allowing for some to gather(bars, liquor stores, restaurants frequented by the governor, etc.) while others(churches) couldn't. It displays the power of people coming together and the necessity to do so, which study after study is now revealing to us as we look back at the damage done by many covid era policies. There is great hope in this story as told by the many that benefited from the gatherings portrayed in the film. This will be a significant contribution to the historical record when future people look back and try to understand and evaluate the decisions made by our generation and what some did to stand up for first amendment rights in America.",False

1,9,I'm enjoying it,johasse,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm on episode 6 and so far I've really enjoyed this show. I'm a big fan of Jeremy Wade and although it's strange not seeing him reel in river monsters, he's a good host for this show. I do see what others are saying in that it can sometimes be a little confusing because it jumps around a little bit from topic to topic but overall, if this type of stuff intrigues you, I would give it a chance. Don't deprive yourself of it because of some bad reviews. Watch it and judge for yourself!",False
2,10,I'm giving this a 10 because of the haters,mckeen-13639,n/a,15/08/2025,"Is this original? No. Have most of the stories been told before? Maybe yes, but there's quite a few mysteries in an episode, not just one, quite a few that I've never heard of, it's not shoddy or rushed together, and it's Jeremy Wade!, it's still worth a watch. It's actually a 6/10, good effort, it could be better, but worth a watch!",False
3,3,Sensationalism and missing facts,dlvaldez,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love this show. Don't get me wrong. But it tends to lean towards sensationalism much like the national enquirer. After watching several episodes I have noticed That facts are often left out. They kept showing a ""famous"" picture that has been long scene proven fake. But wasn't mentioned during the show. And survivor under water. Air bubble.",False
4,10,Brilliant!,dkbjerring-52516,n/a,15/08/2025,"He is so calm and knows how to present whatever he wants to present... alot of the bad ratings is only based on old viewers... dont forget that there are alot of young people watching these kind of information programs who does not know about these things... Apart from David Attenborough, Jeremy Wade is next on my list of favorite TV presenters... everything today is a copy... its all about how you do the job and if you get out to the new and younger crowd... and Jeremy does that perfectly... yes he is not as involved in this as he is in his other work like River Monsters etc. But it was also his dream to be able to teach about freshwater monsters and the environment. Mysteries of the deep is awesome!",False
5,3,Dissapointing,wayneclarkephotography,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a keen watcher of Jeremy in his river monsters series I had high hopes for this. Sadly he's just the front man really.
You get Jeremy intoducing the ""mystery"" (he's always standing on a rock in what looks like Cornwall) then you get the usual regurgitated, endless done to death Discovery type mystery story.
You wont be much the wiser for watching this series, and you wont see much of JW either.
It's ok if your bored, but if your hoping to to learn anything you'll be better off watching something else.",False
6,10,ALL HAIL KING WADE,mgc-80490,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jeremy Wade can do no wrong, his sparkling personality allows him to not only be incredible in everything he does but to also captivate audiences with his charm and swagger! ALL HAIL KING JEREMY",False
7,10,Enjoyed every episode!,Guille-43,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm a big fan of Jeremy Wade although I've not watched all of his shows but this one caught my attention because of the mystery element to it. I love a good mystery and this series had several of my favorite tales as well as some new ones I had not heard of. Every episode was entertaining and several experts brought their own unique perspectives to each story adding to the mysteries. I also liked how they didn't stick to one single mystery per episode and instead chose to introduce a few related mysteries as well. And as usual, Mr Wade brings his usual magic to draw you in and listen closely. Jeremy Wade doing what he does best!",False
8,2,"Why, Jeremy? Why?",Bert45,n/a,15/08/2025,"I happened upon this series purely by surfing channels and heard the unmistakable tones of Jeremy Wade narrating a story of an undersea archaeological discovery. ""Great!"" I thought. ""I like Jeremy's stuff"". But as it went on, my expectations began to sink. Jeremy Wade, for reasons best known to himself, has decided to risk his whole credibility by going down the gosh-gee-whiz-amazing-mysteries route that has been flogged to death by so many other presenters. What little valuable new information there may be in this series is wrapped up in a script that insults the intelligence of the viewers (well, most of them anyway). Why did you do it, Jeremy? What's next on your agenda - aliens?",False
9,2,The act of regurgitation,jdat-71010,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nothing new or compelling here. It's all been done before and better. This is just a money grab, as they know there are people that are easily led. If they liked Wade in one show, they will watch him wipe his backside. River Monsters was very interesting and watchable, if overly melodramatic, and with way too much loud music. His other show, Dark Waters, though not close to River Monsters, was even better than this thing. Too much repetition within the show, too many ""experts"". They quick cut from ""expert"" to ""expert"" and allow each one to utter one sentence before moving to the next. The ""experts"" do not seem like ""experts"". Should stick with River Monsters format, as there are thousands of ""presenters"" out there that can review historical events and speculate.",False
10,3,Disappointing,mwtkn,n/a,15/08/2025,"Never did I ever think I would turn off a Jeremy Wade show but 10 minutes in on episode 1, I did just that. Do more Mighty Rivers, that expanded on the fishing elements and was really informative.",False
11,4,"Entertaining. But, the things he investigates have been done over and over in similar shows.",collectorofsorts,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a fan of Jeremy Wade and wasted no time in watching when this popped up with his name attached. But, it's kind of old and stale. Trying to prove out old bible stories. Telling us about the hunley that was done to death last decade. Etc, etc. If you're a nerd (like me) who enjoys this type of programming, you've already seen it over and over and over. And, while it is somewhat entertaining because of Jeremy Wade, I'm not a big fan of ""hey, this series was popular 5 years ago, let's get Jeremy to do it with the same played out stories"". Give me something that hasn't been done 50 times in other shows of this type. The format is fine, just give me some original stories.",True
12,2,Mr. Darcy Doesn't Go Fishing,woolncathairs,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Mr. Wade's programs from day one and he and I have exchanged a few emails about fly fishing, tying flies and Percy Fawcett.This program is a huge disappointment. We occasionally see him standing or sitting on various rocks talking us through real life sea mysteries that have been discussed for years on other programs. Don't these people watch educational television? So far, every single subject has been raked over by other 'explorers' many times.This, literally, looks like he's doing the program because he needs the cash, he just can't tear himself out from the front of the camera or his die hard women fans don't care what he talks about as long as there are plenty of 'up his nostrils' close ups.Mr. Wade, it's time to retire or be a little more careful what jobs you accept. Sir Attenborough you are not.",False
13,5,All good things must come to an end!,tjb16,n/a,15/08/2025,This series makes me miss Jeremy's hands on investigating and offcourse fishing. It had to happen at some point offcourse! Will always have the memories and offcourse repeats!,False
14,2,Terrible,tarnzhema,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Jeremy Wade but stick to River Monsters... The only theme in this series is water... Thisseries is a flop with an episode consisting of a mash of several known water related stories lasting about 10mins each.I barely made it past episode 1 before realisation that not even Jeremy Wade can make this better content.Jeremy needs to either make it about fish related mysteries or go back to fishing for river monsters.First epidssode went from Loch Ness to surving under water for 3 days, to floating footwear with feet inside to Jonah and the whale biblical story etc.Like I said no theme made it a terrible watch.",False
15,1,Mysteries,tqmjjcxcb,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIts good, fore me satisfying to watch and created better than others his shows but i really dont understand how u can allways...but always say that something bad did russiansðŸ˜€ its stupid..what if it was americans...u judge without real proof..wtf which sick head is creating it??? No proof no reason but russians did it... i think its good but its so ""american"" to blame russiaðŸ˜‚ dont do it...",True

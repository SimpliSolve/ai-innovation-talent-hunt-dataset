1,6,An American Review,Foutainoflife,n/a,16/08/2025,"I actually liked this documentary. It was just very short and I was wanting more. I did find out a few things that I had not known about Her Majesty and a couple of events that have taken place during her reign. One event being the Aberfan colliery spoil landslide. That was long before my time and I did not know of the tragedy. However, I really would've liked to have seen a more personal look at the Queen herself but this was a more general look at her overall reign.",False
2,6,Short but interesting...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Being the Queen"" is a documentary in which we watch an intimate glimpse into the life of Queen Elizabeth II, exploring her role as both a monarch and a person behind the crown. The documentary provides interviews, archival footage, and insights from historians, aiming to give viewers a deeper understanding of her long reign and the personal challenges she's faced.I enjoyed this documentary because it contained many interesting facts about the life of Queen Elizabeth II while it also offered a solid overview of her life and legacy. Despite that, it feels more like a surface-level exploration than a deep dive into her experiences or the complexities of her reign mainly because of its short duration. The archival footage is fascinating, and it's interesting to hear from those who have been close to her, but the documentary doesn't offer much new information for those already familiar with the Queen's public life. Lastly, I have to say that ""Being the Queen"" is an interesting and informative documentary and I believe everyone can learn something from it and even benefit from its deeper approach to the subject so, I recommend everyone to watch it.",False
3,9,Great short documentary if you're interested in the royals,abinewx,n/a,16/08/2025,I think this came at the right time since the popularity of the crown is so high. Covered a lot of her in different eras and fascinating to see how this lady has become the longest standing monarch. Long live the queen!,False
4,10,The Complexities of the Crown,howsoonisnowbb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Came across this documentary on Disney+ the other that gives you an insider view into Queen Elizabeth II. It draws parallels between the Queen and her Royal relatives, from Edward VIII to Margaret to Diana. Seems to hone in on her personal relationships and the most ""dramatic"" moments of the Queen's life and how she navigates through them. I 'm a Crown superfan and I feel like this is a concise documentary version of the Netflix series.Really makes you respect her in a new way. I like how the documentary uses the ""insider"" voices like Prince Philip's private secretary Michael Parker who reveals a lot of insightful information.My only complaint is that I wish it was longer!",False
5,2,Confusing,yrn-54671,n/a,16/08/2025,The timeline is continuously confusing. A part will go from the queen in 1954 to prince charles in 2015 then back to princess margaret in 2001 to continue the story from 2015.,False
6,5,Short documentary too short to justify it,momomojojo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well done on the documentary but the story went very fast as they do highlight details but also went too fast through it meaning how they pick elements for making this movie and what the purpose is.It gave so many real life pictures and clips make the distance between the story close to you. Like sitting on the front row of the happening.The flow of the movie is not great as it gives all the time glimpse of the queen's life, making it hard to follow as you need to recapture what timeline it is and what it is happening at that moment.",False

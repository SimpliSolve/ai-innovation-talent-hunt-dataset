1,10,Episode 1 - Delicious and Cold,leegloverholloway,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I first started watching I thought it was going to be some little elementary style
review on ice cream. But as Ms. Carla went further into the details of ice cream, and it's background outside of the United States, I became much more fascinated, and although people might say ""Oh, it's just ice cream"", its deeper than that.Mostly, everything that the United States has in-hand comes from other people outside of it. I am so grateful to Carla whom I love seeing; this beautiful woman still sharing with us Foodie stuff in an international level.To hear about the history of African American men who were enslaved, least we not forget, who brought what we have through their studies. Their desire to create something that not the masses, but the elite would enjoy. Yet now everyone can enjoy ice cream, water ice, gelato and Douradum.I can't wait to watch more of Ms Carls and her food travels. We need to see more Mature and Beautiful African American women scouting the globe. Thanks Carla!!!Carla and the world deserves a
SECOND SEASON OF HER AND CHASING FLAVOR!",False
2,n/a,The picture in Episode 1 is incorrect.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watch this episode of Chasing Flavor for several reasons. I love ice cream and have become a fan of Carla Hall. I was surprised when I saw the picture of Mr. Augustus Thomas.As an African American catholic woman, involved in the Catholic Church, I was surprised to see that you have the wrong picture of Mr. Augustus Thomas. Mr. Thomas may have invented the process of making ice cream, however the picture displayed is that of Venerable Fr. John Augustus Tolton of Missouri.Rev. Tolton is currently on the Road to sainthood in the Catholic Church. I was surprised that additional research was not done to ensure that the correct picture was obtained. The picture displayed on the episode is that of Rev. Tolton in his priestly garb.A little history of Rev. Tolton. Venerable Augustus Tolton was ordained a priest in Rome at age 31 in 1886 and returned to the US to serve the black community. His first mass was held in Quincy, IL. He was the first black priest in the United States.Please google Rev. Augustus Tolton and do additional research and find the correct picture of Mr. Augustus Thomas. Thank you.",False

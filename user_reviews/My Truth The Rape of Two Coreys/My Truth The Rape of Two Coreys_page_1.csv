1,6,"Besides being heartbreaking, there is some informations that are at least questionable",jlukssabino-38675,n/a,15/08/2025,"On paper it's nice to see feldman's great effort to bring out the truth, but when you do a little research work, you'll find that there are many things in this documentary that are simply not true. To be clear, I would never doubt the abuse Corey Feldman says he suffered, and I just felt sorry for him, but when he talks about Corey Haim's life, by the way, half the documentary is about him, some things just don't add up. , that said, the scenes in which it shows the 80s and the fever of the two coreys are really nostalgic and sad to watch, another thing that should be mentioned is that in no other galaxy this documentary needed 10 million dollars to make. On top of all that, I have to admit that the final scene is heartbreaking. I can recomend this, but be aware, that there are many lies in this documentary.",False
2,8,The dark side of Hollywood,joe_mcelwee,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIts heartbreaking to think that Corey Haim was befriended by adults he trusted and was given drugs which probably made him think they were cool. Only for them to steal away his innocence. I can imagine the guy had serious trust issues as a result. I feel there may be shame from his mothers side which leads to denial as, comforting lies are easier to accept. I don't think his mother would have deliberately put him in that position, but then I do know there are people who can do despicable things for cash. Before I watched the documentary, I was under the impression that Hollywood was riddled with paedophilia . Having seen it I think the problem may be a minority who are being protected by the majority also out of shame. In the UK there was the Jimmy Saville scandal which it appeared the BBC may have covered up which I believe to be the same logic used by the USA broadcasters. It is easier for me to accept that shame makes people and corporations cover up these terrible crimes rather than the alternative, that they are implicated. That being said some serious things to consider for me. They say some of the abused go on to abuse. Maybe Corey couldn't go on because he despised become one of the monsters who ruined his own life. Maybe Charlie Sheen was also sold the story of the boys club as a child. Maybe he's scared or ashamed to come out about his own truth, 1 because it would be painful and 2 it would implicate him. For me paedophilia is everywhere and no matter what industry or profession, each business or corporation seems to try and cover things up to protect their reputation. Whether that be the church, the media, schools etc. I think it is shameful that the cycle is allowed to continue out of selfish actions. We need to change the way we think and act in society because it will always continue... if we allow it.",True
3,1,2 Stars Specifically for Ricky Garcia,bensonscarny,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerRicky was the only honest person in this. People need to research Corey Feldman but few do & I can't blame them. This doc is full of lies & false accusations. I supported Corey Feldman until I did some due diligence. The FACT a woman witnessed his r@pe a you woman in the period he was raising money to speak out about abuse, should speak volumes about his true nature. He demonised Corey Haims mother for years because she named her sons abuser without cashing in on it. Corey Feldman waited till 2020 to name Dominick Brascia, who is the only man Corey Haim named himself. Dominick was Corey Feldman real best friend & he protected him. Dominick died peacefully in his home while Feldman begged for $10 Million to name him. There's so much back story to all of this & none of it was in this Documentary. Corey Feldman failed to release ANY information that wasn't public knowledge & he wanted $10 million to do it. And don't forget he already sold the promised of naming Pedophiles twice already & obviously he failed on both of those occasions too. This doc isn't even available because Feldman pulled it due to the backlash. People forget Feldman pitched this as a 1 time PPV event, trying to squeeze as much money as he could out of Abuse him & his friend caused. Do some research about all of this. That 1 star's for Ricky, at least he was genuine. It's a tragedy that Feldman didn't do the right thing. He never does.",True
4,10,Once In a Lifetime Must See Film,marisadw,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBefore Corey Haim passed away he asked his best friend Corey Feldman to tell his story if he should pass away before he was able to do it himself and that is exactly what his brother did for him, kept that promise and made this documentary. You will hear the names and details about who molested Corey Haim and Corey Feldman. You will hear about how Haim had spiraled down the rabbit hole of bad choices after years of living with his pain and secrets and how much Feldman wanted to help him. You will hear several others speak as to what they witnessed between the two Corey's and their own stories and experiences. You'll also hear about how people have stalked, harassed and tried to silence Corey Feldman for years and how badly it's still being done to this day. You'll hear how his life and the lives of his family are in jeopardy for exposing the truth. You'll hear how his supporters and the FELDFAM are also constantly harassed and threatened for supporting Corey Feldman. You'll see and hear about how hard Corey Feldman has worked to preserve the innocence of children and to give voices to the victims of childhood sexual abuse victims. Corey works with Child USA as an ambassador to make a difference for children who can't fight for themselves to keep them safe and bring them justice when their innocence has been violated. Please don't watch it by illegal link or sites that trick you into buying on scam pages. Do not let the bad reviews fool you into not seeing and hearing the truth for yourself as they are the people working to silence and defame Corey Feldman. It is one of the most informative and important films you'll ever have the chance to watch and time is limited.",True
5,1,Corey Feldman Is A Lying Sneak!!!!!!!!,Clusium,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOn the eve of the 10'Th anniversary of the death of his supposed ""best friend"" Corey Haim, Corey Feldman releases a documentary that belongs in a garbage heap. In the years since Corey Haim had died, Corey Feldman has published a book, made a TV movie, and now this piece of rubbish, all slandering the late Corey Haim, who is no longer here to defend himself, and his bereaved mother. Hollywood led the entire world to believe that Haim and Feldman were the greatest of best friends (the 2 Coreys), when in reality, nothing could have been further from the truth. Both Haim and Feldman were much closer to other people both in and out of the Hollywood industry. However, Feldman continues to ride on the lie that he was Haim's best friend for his own agenda. In this so-called ""documentary,"" Feldman accuses an actor of attacking Corey Haim on the set of 'Lucas.' However, Corey Haim never told any of his family or friends this. Rather, he has accused Corey Feldman's friend of attacking him, and was upset at Feldman for remaining close friends with this particular individual. Although Feldman does acknowledge this in the documentary, he claimed that the incident was consensual. That makes no sense. Corey Haim was 14 years old at the time, and this individual was about 15 years older than him. Corey Feldman is not interested in seeking justice for Corey Haim nor anybody else. All he is interested in, is lining his own pockets. Nothing more, and nothing less.",True
6,10,Very Brave Thing To Do:,shortprincess-81361,n/a,15/08/2025,I think that this doc was such a brave thing to do on Corey's part. He threw big names out there that needed to be heard! Honestly I am so glad I didn't become a child actor after hearing all the terrible things that were done! It's quite sick and I'm so appalled at the hate towards this film and Feldman.He was NOT trashing Haim's name! He was telling the side of Haim's story that Haim couldn't tell! (Rest In Peace Haim)! I think that this film needs more attention on it. If things are going on in a business that is harmful to children things need done and fixed! CHILD PREDATORS NEED TO BE PUT IN PRISION!! Feldman is trying to make it known what happens and what happened to him!I applaud you Feldman! Thank you so much for this film!!,False
7,10,Worth it 100%,vasilikopoulost,n/a,15/08/2025,"Its simple as this. Its a story worth telling from Corey Feldman and its worth watching it. The story is heartbreaking. Nothing more needs to be said.
Watching it will open your eyes as An Open Secret did.",False
8,10,Insightful and Informative!!!,ons-62359,n/a,15/08/2025,I am glad someone took a notion to expose predators in Hollywood. This should give a broader and larger audience more perception of the real issues at hand. Corey has earned my respect on a much grander scale thanks to this documentary. I hope other people see this and decide to speak up not just in Hollywood but around the world. Thank you!!!,False
9,10,Heartbreaking,AshlynnBea,n/a,15/08/2025,"Every individual can take something different away from this. It is not one story or one person's story. It is several heart-breaking testimonies, and shots fired in a bigger movement that pushes us all forward for what we will not tolerate. Giving us a bigger perspective and hopefully giving our youth a louder voice.",False
10,10,The Best & Most Important Doc Ever!!!,viciousv-89051,n/a,15/08/2025,"Corey did a phenomenal job with this! He told his and CH's stories, and has helped so many survivors come forward. It's emotionally gripping, real, raw, and something you'll never forget!",False
11,10,A must see documentary for everyone,antoniamusgrave-07952,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is heartbreaking and eye opening. This documentary sheds light on how pedos operate within Hollywood. This film includes heartbreaking testimony from individuals who are brave enough to tell their story. This film is a must see!! Not only does this film tell the truth, this film helps to push a bigger movement forward which is kids2. This film gives a voice to the voiceless and takes a stand on the atrocities that are happening everyday. Corey Feldman took a stand not only for Corey Haim but for survivors of sex abuse everywhere!",False
12,10,Informative yet heart breaking,sleepyam,n/a,15/08/2025,Informative yet heartbreaking story of what happened to the 2 Coreys. Highly recommended.,False
13,10,from roger or froger :),mystery_caper_2010,n/a,15/08/2025,This is movie is absolutely heartbreaking and revealing corey did what he said he would do and more he brought to the table everything he said he would im part of the feldfam I support corey a million times over this right here is the evidence that Hollywood needs to wake up and take these animals down corey keep on fighting his love and justice for haim is amazing well done brotha well done,False
14,10,We Need All The Truth We Can Get,bobbydeekhakeh-98441,n/a,15/08/2025,I'm very happy and proud of Corey Feldman for creating this film.He shied away from releasing it for a long time but ultimately did the right thing by filling the world in on the truth.There's no doubt in my mind at all that Corey is telling the truth.Anyone who has been following the story can obviously see the truth. Haim's mother has never wanted the truth to be told so she's denying it.I just hope that this can become available online for more people to watch. Hardly anyone is talking about it and it's because no one can find it.,False
15,10,Essential - Must Watch!!,Afk11,n/a,15/08/2025,"My Truth is the most important piece of Art the world should see! This masterpiece of Truth finally gives a voice to those who have been silenced because of a crime they did not commit.
I highly recommend ""My Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys"" especially to all the parents out there as it teaches you how to protect your own children from sexual predators.
I am a mother and I had no idea that there are people preying on children literally everywhere nor was I aware of Hollywood's secrets being this dark! This movie really opened my eyes and I am sure it will do the same for you.Corey Feldman is one of the most honest, sincere, caring and selfless people I know. He has a heart of gold and his courage is truly commendable. He risked everything to be able to share such crucial information with the world. Don't miss it!!",False
16,10,well done but could have been better,e-1529,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first part of the documentary was the most interesting in my opinion. Towards the end it felt like they had run out of things to say.
Also even though the story was presented in a chronological way, sometimes it felt like it was jumping back and forth. But overall I really enjoyed watching this, it was well done, and Corey is a courageous man. Well done!",False
17,10,Difficult couragous story to tell.,kathrynerskine,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an Excelent film which was well worth watching and should be supported by all. It takes real guts to put yourself out there and talk about your vulnerabilities at the best of times; to talk about childhood abuse openly like that in a public way takes real courage. Corey is very brave to step up to making this film and be a voice for all the innocent child abuse victims whoes voices haven't been heard.All paedophiles should be exposed and no children should ever be harmed like this ever there are some really sick men out there. Children's innocence is to be protected at all costs and it's no coincidence that abusers of children are punished in prison as these crimes against them are sickening and unacceptable under any circumstances.Corry is extremely brave and heroic man to take on this project and make this film knowing the threats , abuse and the predictable onslaught of slander and smear campaigns that ALWAYS follow all truth tellers and whistle blowers.Considering the content is a sickening theme of child abuse and pedophilia, although clearly distressing at times to hear , the film was very easy and enjoyable to watch, not least because of understanding this truth needs to be exposed and there is something deeply satisfying about knowing he has accomplished this. Well worth watching and not as bad or upsetting as you might have thought.",False
18,10,An Emotional Roller Coaster - Genius Filmmaking,crowes-18865,n/a,15/08/2025,"Corey Feldman is the greatest actor of his generation! His resume speaks for itself folks and now he has crossed over into the tricky world of documentary filmmaking and his debut is nothing short of breathtaking. He chose to film in low quality, cell phone camera style to give a gritty look, almost like anyone could have made this in their own living room or parent's basement and that gives it realism beyond any which have come before it. The movie itself is an eye opening, visceral journey, a smorgasbord of feelings and raw emotion which will leave you reeling from the enormity of it all. The part where he talks about why people in real life called him Mouth was touching, disturbing and funny all at once. Feldog is the only dog for me!! I'd love to see a documentary about his humanitarian work with Corey's Angels, maybe call the film ""Touched by An Angel Who Was Allowed To Eat Yesterday"". Here's to one tenth of what made the two Coreys so Wonderful! You rock Mouth!!",False

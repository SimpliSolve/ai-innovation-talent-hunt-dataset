1,7,When Harmless Jokes Turn Harmful Realities,SonGoku540,n/a,16/08/2025,"Directors Arthur Jones and Giorgio Angelini take us on a chilling journey in ""The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem,"" a documentary exploring the dark underbelly of online culture and its unintended consequences.The film tackles a highly relevant issue, tracing the evolution of memes from silly jokes to tools for manipulation and the erosion of truth. Millennial interviewees, once active participants, offer a unique perspective on how their online actions spiraled out of control. The documentary masterfully weaves early internet memes with news clips and social media posts, creating a vivid timeline of events.While focusing on the rise of 4chan, the film could delve deeper into the broader impact of other anonymous platforms. Some interviewees seem to romanticize the early days of the internet, neglecting the inherent toxicity that always existed.Editing is sharp, seamlessly transitioning between interviews, memes, and news footage. The score is subtle yet effective, adding tension without being overly dramatic. The interviewers guide the narrative effectively, drawing insightful commentary from participants.""The Antisocial Network"" is a must-watch for anyone interested in the internet's influence on society. Despite some limitations, the film serves as a stark reminder of the responsibility we hold online and the potential for memes to morph into real-world mayhem.",False
2,7,"It's crazy how stupid people are, but also very interesting.",VeggieVader,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this documentary interesting. I was never into 4chan myself, but I remember when it started and got big and I had a few friends who used to be there. I learned a lot in this documentary. For example, I didn't know that Anonymous originated in 2003 on 4chan. I learned more about January 6th with the attack on Capitol, the evolution of memes, Qanon, maga, etc.It was also interesting to see these hackers being interviewed. They are not very likeable people most of them. It is also so very crazy that people are so easily fooled by what they read on the internet and that they believe it fully. Someone says something on the internet, and it can turn into a very large real movement/demonstration. It's crazy how stupid people are, but also very interesting.",False
3,6,Not a Great Documentary,atleverton,n/a,16/08/2025,"But it managed to be educational and present its thesis quite well. The thesis is that the infamous 4chan led to such social movements as OccupyWallstreet, Anonymous, Gamergate, and the rise of Donald Trump and finally, to January 6th. It showed how these groups morphed together and separated. It shows very clearly how the alt-right latched onto meme culture and tried to hijack the political discourse. I was never on 4chan, but remember seeing their productions out in the wild. It's a cautionary tale about two things, the first about how just because you create something, that does not mean you can control it as the creator of 4chan discovered, and the second is never to underestimate the stupidity of the masses. They will beieve anything as long as its in a visual form with some white text.",False
4,n/a,"Starts strong, ends sideways",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""The Antisocial Network"" takes its name from the 2010 biopic ""The Social Network,"" which was about Facebook. As you'll come to learn, 4chan and Facebook are vastly different corners of the internet, yet they converge through the effectiveness of propaganda, the diffusion of collective responsibility, and rage-baiting.The documentary starts strong, establishing credibility by showcasing figures from the site's early years, as well as some people who were part of Anonymous' hacking group or the spinoff LulzSec. Matt Alt explains the origins of 4chan, noting that it was an English-language version made possible by copying 2chan's source code. The focus on Japanese culture (which branched out to general forms of entertainment) and of course, the /b/ - Random board gave it a strong community and made it a hotspot for memes. He also explains that, like 2chan, 4chan's anonymous user base and lax moderation made it susceptible to extremist messaging.Later, I'll describe how, starting with the 2016 U. S. presidential election, the documentary gets off track and focuses solely on the political board /pol/, as if it overshadows the rest of the site. But it all came from somewhere, and the documentary begins 4chan's notoriety streak with the Habbo Hotel raids, aka ""Pool's Closed.""Of course, the pranks have a dark side. The film pivots to footage of Habbo Hotel users forming a swastika and people at Otakon doing the Nazi salute, and it served as a stark reminder that the userbase was playing on maximum offense at the time.The documentary then covers other raids done by 4chan users, such as Hal Turner's broadcasts, The Oprah Winfrey Show's web forum, Project Chanology, and Occupy Wall Street. With each successive raid/movement, however there's less of an established link back to 4chan's userbase per-se as there is a delineation towards political activism done by people not from 4chan.Speaking of, the activism/hacktivism aspect of Anonymous and LulzSec is covered by 420chan's Kirtaner, as well as Jeremy Hammond. Both seem pretty astute in their political views and relay those beliefs in their association with Anonymous.The frustrations in not being able to effect change quickly enough in Occupy Wall Street, I think, led to a splintering of many in Anonymous' hacktivist set to LulzSec, which is barely even covered in the documentary. Things go from bad to worse as the target of documentary's ire shifts gears again and covers GamerGate.To its credit, the GamerGate section is relatively brief and accurate. It explains the origins as a ""disgruntled ex-boyfriend publish(ing) a blog post about Zoe Quinn having a relationship with a games journalist"". Yet much of the misogynistic groundwork and sentiment had been built up years prior by public figures like Anita Sarkeesian (Tropes vs. Women in Video Games), Brianna Wu (who is also featured in the documentary), and clickbait journalism. Despite the tenacious relationship between games developers and gaming publications' ad divisions, the documentary decided to light a match for old times sake and blame the channers for this one too.Frederick Brennan (who founded 8chan and experienced an influx of users when 4chan banned GamerGate discussions) speaks in the documentary. His libertarian background and believes are all too ripe for the picking, as the documentary's producers exploit his about-face stance on not deplatforming hate speech to drive home an all-too-familiar message. More ""freedom"" - ""rules"" = more extremism.After this inflection point, the documentary's creators start to really play fast and loose with the facts. Namely, they make a preposterous assertion that moot left because of the 2016 U. S. election, easily refutable by the fact Moot announced his retirement on January 21st, 2015 before either party's candidates announced their candidacy.Then they double down by showcasing Gregg Housh saying: ""With moot, I did find it really funny that when we all started to leave and all he was left with was the Nazis... that he quit.""The film then cuts to archive footage of moot at the 2013 Repulika Festival, pre-2016 election, pre-GamerGate, in which he doesn't mention Nazis but rather the challenges of ""having an angry mob of 25 million people who disagree with everything you do.""Moderating a site is tough, and 4chan's culture and moderation islargely invisible and impersonal, as was the userbase it governed. Being the ""face"" of the moderation is not easy, which is why the site uses a system of volunteers known as ""janitors"" to supplement its moderation staff. Given Fappening and aftermath of GamerGate were closer to moot's departure than the 2016 election, the increasing scrutiny of the site was arguably more a significant factor.If you listen to part of ""moot's final 4chan Q&A"" on their YouTube channel (admittedly, the full recording is nearly 8 hours long), moot says he left because he had been considering it for a long time, but wasn't ready to leave the site until he had contingencies in place to keep it running. The Q&A addresses the aftermath of The Fappening (which isn't even mentioned in the documentary, likely because it's not political enough), banning GamerGate/invasions, and other topics.But because the documentary is so centered on the notion moot left because of ""the Nazis,"" it goes down this rabbit hole like Alice in Wonderland.After Trump is elected, the film focuses on the QAnon posts that seeded on 4ch/8ch's /pol/ boards, then how it spread to mainstream social networks like Twitter and Facebook. He holds these networks into account for the greater financial incentive to sell targeted ads and maintain high engagement by any means necessary, despite higher moderation standards.Since you know where this is going, it's time for the grand finale of the documentary... the storming of the capitol. January 6.Almost as if they were answering a Rorschach test, Dale Beran discusses how people had different motivations for being at the Capitol. None of which had to do with imageboard culture. The populist discontent that fueled anti-establishment, anarchist movements like Project Chanology and Occupy Wall Street a decade ago shifted to the far-right towards election denialism. And as argued earlier, the link between posting on imageboards and going to the capitol is strung wire-thin by the documentary's presenters themselves: that people who stormed the capitol were not users of imageboards but traditional social media and motivated by personal beliefs versus a defined political movement.The documentary then ends with a multitude of depressing events: Kirtaner getting raided by the RCMP for figuring out Trump's Twitter password, Fuxnet regretting their past actions as a member of Anonymous, and an overall negative narration on the potential of internet culture. It basically reads like, ""Don't go our way, we're all screwed up."" What a bleak way to end an 85-minute documentary (which took two years to make and was originally over two hours long when submitted to SXSW).I'm not beyond anyone or any concept being given a fair shake. But this wasn't so much a shake as it was a Netflixified documentary that uses a multitude of Videohive graphics to convince you going to an imageboard is a pipeline to radicalization. Don't get hoodwinked, and always lurk moar.",True
5,7,Harrowing,johnspringer-95440,n/a,16/08/2025,"The internet's influence on culture, politics and media is ubiquitous. But who influences the internet? This documentary answers that question - or starts to - by focusing on the rise of 4chan, the anonymous imageboard website that served as a surrogate online community for grassroots activists and agitators on both the left and right. This documentary exposes (perhaps unintentionally) the harrowing fact that the 4chan community was full of the most wretched, hateful and inadequate people you're ever likely to encounter. If you met any of this documentary's interviewees in person you would dismiss them as pathetic crackpots or worse and you would promptly ignore them. But ensconced in the anonymity of a signal-boosting online echo chamber they were able to exercise a grossly outsized influence on the 2010s. The internet (supposedly a means of democratizing discourse by giving a globe-spanning voice to virtually anyone) has actually given the loudest and most prominent voices to cabals of unaccountable weirdos who spend all their time on the internet.",False
6,6,Excessive Rush of Images,ZeddaZogenau,n/a,16/08/2025,"Informative and enlightening documentation!For people like me, who have only been able to delve deeper into the world of the Internet after a long period of family responsibilities, documentaries of this kind are helpful in understanding what has actually happened over the past two decades. The effects of the developments described in the film are visible to everyone in everyday and professional life. I didn't really like the excessive rush of images, but I admit that it fits the protagonists and their actions quite well.The global streaming service NETFLIX certainly does educational work with such films. We should also remember the documentary about the CYBERBUNKER in the small German town of Traben-Trabach.The question remains what to do now with the knowledge gained. The troll armies around the world remain active and have long been taking care of the next generation.",False
7,7,Great watch,Bmore-Hero,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem"" dives into the chaotic world of internet culture, examining the power and pitfalls of memes and their influence on society. The book offers a comprehensive look at how memes have evolved from humorous images to potent tools for communication, activism, and even mayhem.Author Sarah Frier presents a well-researched narrative, weaving together interviews with meme creators, cultural commentators, and social media experts. The exploration of meme-driven movements, such as those influencing politics and social change, is particularly enlightening. Frier's writing is engaging and accessible, making complex topics digestible for readers unfamiliar with internet subcultures.However, the book occasionally falls into the trap of sensationalism, sometimes overstating the impact of certain memes. While the anecdotes and case studies are compelling, they can feel repetitive, and the book could benefit from a tighter structure.Overall, ""The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem"" is a fascinating read for anyone interested in the intersection of technology, culture, and society. It offers valuable insights into the digital age, even if it sometimes overreaches in its analysis.",True
8,8,"The Antisocial Network Memes to Mayhem: Well made stuff, though the subject matter is impactful",Platypuschow,n/a,16/08/2025,"PlotA group of lonely teenagers formed an online community and bonded over their isolation, but their collective beliefs warped reality.CastSadly those interviewed are for the most part far from decent human beings.VerdictJust to confuse myself this was the second documentary of its sort within a very short period of time, the other also featured hacking and anonymous. This however was the superior piece by far and was an entertaining though damning subject matter that unfortunately I'd experienced the consequences of first hand.It looks at the history of 4chan which though I'm very aware of, didn't know some of the eccentricities and found them very interesting. It shows the snowball effect of online extremism and how badly even simple ""Mean words"" can escalate.The trouble is the people interviewed are not good folks, they glamorize hacking, they defend trolling, most appreciate by the end that their behavior was foolhardy and escalated granted but it changes nothing.The anti-social network is very well made, devastating subject matter and entirely fascinating.RantsI see word within the reviews as usual spouting agenda/propaganda, those words have lost all meaning. It's not attacking one political side, it's examining one subject and it just happens to be one side that's responsible for all the consequences and side effects.You see I mentioned I'd experienced this first hand, my ex was a rational decent human being then she came across the online hive of hate, right wing extremism and conspiracies and over the course of two years she changed in ways I didn't even think was possible. She became racist, homophobic, transphobic, anti-immigrant, anti-benefits claimant, a seething ball of hate against every minority. She grabbed hold of every conspiracy going, flat earth, chemtrails, the LGBT agenda and planet X (She loved that one). She lost her mind, and funnily enough yes she become a Trump fan. The internet has a great power to change people, and make them completely unconditionally lose the plot and that leads to further unpleasantness and spreads like a plague.The GoodVery well made

9,8,How Trolls Have Poisoned the Internet and Politics,revchristodd-138-985726,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem"" is a documentary tracing the evolution from 2 chan, a Japanese anime website, to 4 chan to Anonymous to 8 chan to nihilism to Q Anon. It also shows how the business model of stirring up anger and fear spread to the mainstream social media. It interviews key people in the creation and development of this phenomenon. And it shows how even they get horrified with what they have unleashed. I knew some of this but the documentary connects the dots. It also shows how this has bled into the real world. But this isn't anti-technology. Behind this is people, some well-meaning but naive, some immature, some hateful, and some cynically using all the others.",False
10,2,Losers and very unethical people are elevated to heroes,colomba87,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary tries to tell a story that is not true. 4Chan has always been considered an unethical platform by ""normal"" people. The documentary not only trivializes the behavior of the members but also gives them even more supposed influence in the historical narrative. They show trolling of the first 4Chan generation as a relatively harmless practice. But remember these are the people who had fun by for example spamming homepages which are meant to help people suffering form epilepsy by posting pictures that could actually trigger an epileptic seizure, which is life-threatening. All this is totally trivialized in this documentary. Only half-truths are told. Everything that doesn't fit into the ""storytelling"" is ignored.",False
11,8,Interesting,sljmakio,n/a,16/08/2025,"As one could expect, a documentary about people on the Internet gets very mixed reviews from people on the Internet.This documentary raises many thoughts when it goes through some of the history of 4chan, Anonymous, Qanon, and MAGA, and how they link together. I found it personally very interesting, well-made, and I learned some new information. As a viewer, however, you need to remember that this is still just an edited Netflix documentary about the Internet and, well, you can never really know the whole truth about that. Do some people make themselves seem more important than they truly were? Who knows. Maybe, maybe not.In whole, this is an important topic especially in today's world and I'm glad I decided to watch it. And you conspiracy theorists, you live in a made-up world.",False

13,10,Must watch,psfilipe-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally someone took the time to address this more or less properly.So... Is it perfect? No.But at least it tries to tackle the absurdity of the times we live in.Going much further than other documentaries or books in unveiling some of the people that spawned the whole toxic internet trend - albeit leaving aside the vast influence of a certain current belligerent super power - it gives a simple, but credible, history lesson on why we are in the current political situation.And no, I'm absolutely not talking just about the USA.What happened there is ground zero for other 'experiences' that are starting to materialize in other countries (they even mention what happened in early 2000's with 2Chan) and that continue to occur in our age of misinformation.The simple fact that some people are so desperate (and plainly stupid) as to be able to believe these pranksters should be enough to make us stop and meditate about what being online really means.Just one more thing: this is a documentary and my rating is not based on the formal quality of the film.This is a presentation of part of an important story.A story that should be dissected and investigated much, much further. That said, as first efforts go this is a 5 in terms of usefulness and overall importance.",False
14,5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler2024's The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem represents a bunch of teens, hovered around their computers, hunkered down in their basements, and creating online memes meant to I suppose, skew real-life situational outcomes. A meme by definition, well it's an image, video, or piece of text that is copied and/or spread by Internet users. So yeah, you see a lot of these so-called memes throughout ""Antisocial Network"" yet they're on and off the screen faster than a speeding bullet. I mean at least give the viewer a sense of coherency and/or interconnection with each passing beam or likeness. ""There was definitely a lot of stuff that was... super edgy."" Jeez, you could've fooled me.Some smug interviews here, some recent archives there, Donald Trump nearly everywhere, The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem splashes onto the screen with a ton of Pokemon colors, remnants of The Lawnmower Man, and some Anime-style animation. Yeah it all looks great but uh, where's the story? And what exactly did these Microsoft nerds do, as they ate their Cheetos and didn't leave from their lower ground floor for weeks? As a documentary, ""Antisocial Network"" contains a lot of techie info that unfortunately seems edited into a jumbled mess. Instead of having said info spoonfed to the audience member, it just sits there in the cinematic tidy bowl, getting soggy. ""You didn't want the party to stop"". Are you sure about that big guy?Cheesy snacks and sci-fi horror aside, The Antisocial Network: Memes to Mayhem does two things that a docu should never do, give a platform for Internet young-ins who don't deserve it and then try to make you root for those same young-ins who should otherwise be looking for a real job and not sponging off the esse of others.

15,8,Sympathy for the Devilish,theknownames,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerImdb is review site not an opinion about content site. As a documentary should document facts, this does well ( just go fact check it ..it takes a while though) so anyway ,however, it is presented as the the inception of mass misinformation when another angle is how certain sites and practices can incite and we're proven to do so. How internet use blew up during the pandemic at a rate that could not have come with enough warning . Yet another angle would be the human psychology of how often we see false information factors into how we process credibility and so on. No doubt people are offended ( especially as beliefs are challenged) the real concern should be our own mental health and the effects on young minds going forward if there is anything to be done.Its not a surprise. No one dismisses the Pam and Tommy tapes or JLo dress or the blue white dress and the developments of our internet but they aren't the whole story . So this felt rushed and packaged into a bow when it really could have been a series and with careful attention to the audience, it could have been presented in a way that was less divisive or more coddling.The leap to the election and Q and Trumpers made sense and even earned the movement some sympathy yet anyone already there may just see propaganda and miss the point as there is in incredible amount of misinformation including medical and DYI , even hair color remover as the unregulated 'wild west' of the information highway ( not long ago) continues into the now.Where is it headed? Have we been warned ?Even this review , the minute I wrote Trumper I am sure people tapped out .History teaches us so much but most of us need to make our own mistakes to learn no matter the costs. I liked the optics and the progression of this documentary and overall it delivers on thought provoking and hopefully pushes fact checking rather than adamant appall.I started this review with how the emphasis here should be on the quality of the film and not content however the reviews got under my skin insofar as the emphasis on content ( which did give me more to look into, yet in the end, appear gravely misinformed....which i think reflects the point of the documentary )",True

The story is a great primer if you're new to the topic, but it also fills in a lot of gaps even if you think you're well-versed. 4chan history is an elusive and contentious subject, but the filmmakers managed to carve out a narrative and tone that is clear, incisive and fair, especially considering the story spans a couple decades - from its roots in Japan's 2channel to recent events we all watched spill out into the real world.

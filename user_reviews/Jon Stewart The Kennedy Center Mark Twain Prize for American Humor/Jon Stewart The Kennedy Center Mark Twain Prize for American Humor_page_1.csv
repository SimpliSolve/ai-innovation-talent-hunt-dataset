1,9,Jon Stewart - more than a humorist,interactbiz,n/a,16/08/2025,"A series of entertaining and amusing segments featuring stars who've been inspired by Stewart or had their own careers launched through association with him. But also entertainers like The Boss were there to appreciate Stewart's work. The opening with Springsteen and Gary Clark Jr. Featured a superb cover of a Beatles classic.Stewart talked about the hope we are getting back to normal, and getting back to honoring non-essential workers. The show is typical of Jon Stewarts work: a mix of comedy and talk with serious purpose.Stewart says, ""Democracy is under threat. Authoritarians are the threat to comedy, to art, to music, to thought, to poetry, to progress, to all those things..."" This program will offend supporters of authoritarianism but should be a pleasure for the remainder.",False
2,2,I feel like the entire award show was politically endorsed,fmpxgkmgz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like this guy, but somehow I feel like the entire award show was politically endorsed. I'm tired of having politics pushed onto us. Plus, he didn't seem to care much for the award itself; almost a joke to him. I still think he's funny, but I was uncomfortable watching this. I felt like I was watching the Oscars again-plenty of cameos of politicians and political motivation bias late-night talk show hosts. Someday we'll look back at this and see all the propaganda added. It's too bad because he was once someone who spoke out again that. They stole this moment from him. I would never watch this again. But that's me.",False
3,1,Mark Twain wants his name back!,raymondguy-00166,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a horror show to see Jon Stewart speak put against authoritarianism yet never mention Assange. No mention of a complete CIA domination of the MSM in Ukraine coverage. Now I know I don't miss Jon when Noah, and Colbert will keep shilling for war criminals of their political liking.When Jon retired he said that 17 years of mining turds was enough. Well that stink is all over this sell out!If Twain was alive seeing the destruction of the first amendment, he'd want his name off this award.",False

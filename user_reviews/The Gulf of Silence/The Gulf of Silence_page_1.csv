1,3,A beautifully rendered painting of a pile of excrement.,artistwriter-54705,n/a,15/08/2025,"As someone who has been involved in the UFOlogy and disclosure movement for about the last 25 years, I had hoped that this was not yet another work of fiction. Sure enough with a cursory search of the internet, it is 100 percent fiction.I am disappointed in the fact that this person did such a great job of putting this together only to have the rug pulled out from under me with it being a complete fabrication. That is the problem with a lot of these things, is that they don't help further the cause, or create more curiosity. This is almost worse than the Stan Romanek fiasco because this was actually watchable, and had a lot of heart behind it.20 minutes into this film I figured it was not quite right and with a simple internet search could not find any Laura Gale PHD, nor could I find any books or writings by the person that the actress portrays.As much as I would like to give this praise for what it does, I have to be critical of what it is not. It is not real, it is not factual, and amazon and other outlets tout it as being real, or at the very least, involving the real people who experienced these things. Irritation does not even begin to describe the level of contempt I have.I actually hoped this was real, and factual. Thanks for making me even more skeptical than I already am.",False
2,3,A Very Good Acted Mockumentary,KoalKoalson,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerBefore watching I did not do any research or watched any trailer. First I have to say I had to skip the first 4 minutes since they were just lights in the dark. From then on it went sloooowly but steady. The actor (Mandy May Cheetham...foreshadowing?) was very convincing and I enjoyed listening to the story. Near the end I was curious and wanted to look for the book by the main protagonist Dr. Laura Gale, PhD but couldn't find anything - strange, but I watched on and the real thing that threw me off was the book cover for ""The Frog People"" by someone else which looked fake af.
After all the credits which included a statement that 4 included videos were real (they showed at least 5 though) and everything else was fabricated.
All in all it was a slow but nice try for a mockumentary, mostly for the work of Mandy May Cheetham.",True
3,4,"Sci-Fi Definitely Not, Just Another less than average Documentary about UFOs.",bjackson-739-450552,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is actually a UFO documentary, sort of, and a very dry one at that. With Mandy May Cheetham playing the part of Laura Gale being interviewed, I'm left wondering why not use the actual footage of Laura being interviewed? If it even exists, it might have been an improvement. After about 10 minutes of watching, I just couldn't handle any more, overly long pauses, voice from a black screen, and slow drawn out speech, so I started over at 2X play speed. About 30 min in I slowed to 1.4X because it started to get interesting. That's the way it stayed till the end, barely interesting even at 1.4X playback speed.",False
4,1,Seriously Flawed (Pseudo)Documentary,thatistaken,n/a,15/08/2025,"One highly opinionated woman holds forth melodramatically for what seems like forever. Even a half-hearted attempt at editing out the interminable ""dramatic pauses"" would cut the length by 75%.
As a veteran of watching dozens of UFO documentaries, I can tell you there is nothing here that hasn't been included in other films, and more interestingly, I might add. There are more UFO documentaries to see than most people will ever have time for. Skipping over this one will most likely lead to seeing something much more interesting and informative.",False
5,2,Unwatachable,ellvis-40548,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had a good crack at watching this but!
The whole Cruella DeVil thing going on plus the continual black screen effect just seems lazy. Not broadcast quality I'm afraid.",False
6,1,Not worth a fraction of your time.,I_should_be_reading_a_book,n/a,15/08/2025,"My rating sould be 0.1/10.
If curiosity really gets the best of you go find and get the subtitle on the web and read it. You will get the whole of the plot without investing more than an hour listening to a monotonous narration and watching a black screen with flashing lights. It's an excercise in moronic depression caused by the pandemic quarantine.",False
7,1,Create this yourself at home,albanread,n/a,15/08/2025,"Instead of watching this film make your own pointless monologue about how you worked for a secret organization with a friend, let's call him Paul.
Describe lights you saw in the sky and sea.
Stand in front of a black curtain while you speak.
Include some shots of a lava lamp.",False
8,1,Do not waste your time. Nothing here.,kevin-howland,n/a,15/08/2025,"Horrible background sounds, blurred lights, no footage, no interviews, no validation of any claim. The first 4 minutes is just an annoying sound. This is an utter waste of time. Story telling at its worst.",False
9,10,A great way to spend an hour and a half,xinrus,n/a,15/08/2025,"I quite enjoyed myself while watching this, it's well written and worth the watch!",False
10,1,Dreadful...,eskimosound,n/a,15/08/2025,I couldn't stand more than 10 minutes and I fast forwarded 7 of those. The obnoxious story telling of the actress was driving me insane. I came to this thinking it was real but it became immediately apparent she was an actress. I very rarely give a 1 but sorry I would have given this a 0. Conceited and self important. Do not watch this movie.,False
11,8,Loneliness in the increasingly connected 21st century by way of UFO phenomena,Snatchr,n/a,15/08/2025,"Because it's not that we're alone in the universe - that much is a statistical impossibility - but that we are not alone, and nobody cares. Humanity is the ever-present blinking light of an unread message in the dark corner of the room.Obviously fiction (I mean, if the explicit disclaimer in the credits didn't tip you off, or the presentation as a whole then I worry for your brain!) but it doesn't matter. The Gulf of Silence isn't made to deceive, unlike the majority of UFO media, but rather to strike to the vulnerable, fleshy core of the phenomenon and the people most affected by it. Not with a sensationalist, smooth brained and popcorn gargling farcical take, but something utterly personal and heart breakingly relatable.Whether you're involved in this field or any other similarly maligned by the greater populace, provided you're not some soulless grifter that is, chances are you've been in some of the places Laura Gale has been. Endured the same jokes, snorts, the deaths of social units and the crippling, anxiety induced self sabotage in response. (insert alienation pun here?)If The Gulf of Silence achieves anything its the absolute realisation of a relatable, grounded protagonist divulging an account so credible within a genre so often bogged down in trashy, tabloid junk more concerned with making its viewer feel special, chosen and important. Maybe that's why it's currently being brigaded with one stars and being ""reviewed"" by filmgoers that unironically watch things at 2x speed and call people ""females"".Also its very funny.",False
12,6,Documentary of innovative fantasy,mcleodbf,n/a,15/08/2025,As a science nerd I was intrigued by the simplicity and sense of plausibility to the plotline. There is no book and I can find no existence of Dr. Laura Gale Phd. I think this was a very artistically innovative way to make a movie during the Covid19 pandemic to feed an audience begging for input to dull their insanity. So kudos to director for finding a way to make a buck in 2020 and distract us for a few minutes. I can honestly say after watching I wanted it all to be true but in reality suspect none of it is.,False
13,1,"An exhausting level of tedium, and a puddle of complete pointlessness.",marylh-48102,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a Mockumentary and a poor one at that. The actress playing the part of a Marine Biologist should not give up her day job and needs to tone down the purple lipstick, eye-rolls and waitress outfit. The first 60 minutes was a ""poor me"" saga of nonsense being spouted by the so-called ""actress"" about how she was shunned by the scientific community for blowing the whistle on UFO's. They even managed to bring in a lesbi@n love triangle, her alleged female boss being in love with her. This script could have been written by a 9 year old who watched too many episodes of the x-files and Days Of Our Lives. There ARE a few small nuggets of truth:
a) Rick Doty is a fraud and a disinformation air-force agent who drove a decent man (PB) to madness. He is a disgusting human being who now goes on the UFO circuit shilling his wares.
b) Roswell was a weather balloon and not a UFO crash with alien bodies. Project Mogul was real.
c) There are no underground alien experimental bases at Area 51 and there are no captive aliens who eat strawberry ice cream, and
d) Alien abductions are not real, they are a form of sleep paralysis which is absolutely terrifying - something I've experienced for myself many times especially when I've taken melatonin for jet-lag. Its a hallucination and paralysis that feels real but is not.
Those hypno-regression quacks who prey on the vulnerable and plant thoughts of alien abductions into the minds of troubled individuals are cruel and very wrong.These little kernels of truth in the mockumentary are correct. The rest is pure hogwash. Don't waste your time watching this ridiculous drivel - doing a good house clean or mowing the lawn is a better use of 90 minutes. What was rather ironic was that the actress who played the part of the wronged ""scientist"" is Mandy May Cheetham. I cannot help but wonder if she is affiliated with the law firm Dewey, Cheetham and Howe??? Buyer beware, you have been warned!",True
14,1,Not worth your time - and it asks for a LOT of it.,joe6629,n/a,15/08/2025,"An hour and 25 minutes of a slow, nasal, condescending, self-important woman fantasizing how she was ""selected"" to become some kind of UFO expert by ""the government"". She also claims to give the viewer the ""truth"" of what's gone on here on Earth ... and she basically regurgitates a few months' worth of high school ""science"" class factoids including how life on Earh formed (cough).If you came to this looking for a genuine whistle-blower, you should know that it's all fiction - and very sloooow fiction at that. I watched it at 1.5X speed to get through it faster. It probably would have been easier to stomach without the amazingly annoying soundtrack ... like 80 minutes of someone running their fingernails down a chalkboard - but there you have it.There are much better ways to spend your time and attention.",False
15,1,NOT Real,paulquick-75828,n/a,15/08/2025,"Full of miss information. Claiming Roswell was not an alien crash site. Try telling that to all of the folks in Roswell .,",False
16,1,CRINGE WORTHY,jgraley-73285,n/a,15/08/2025,"First off, Robert Bigelow should sue the hell out of this desperate production. The actress is CHINGY makes you want to fast forward most the time. Stay away from this one.. trust me.",False
17,1,WASTE OF TIME!,zeascarlett,n/a,15/08/2025,"I actually wasted 32 minutes of my time, I believed it was an actual documentary but its a mockumentary! The only thing this actress was great at was getting the audience to dislike her arrogant personality I literally stopped the film when she said Bob Lazar was a fraud. People don't waste your time ,her obnoxious voice gave me a headache.",False
18,1,HORRIBLE editing!,ronniactor,n/a,15/08/2025,"I could only manage 12 minutes. The picture kept cutting out every few seconds, to the point where I actually thought there was a fault with my streaming service!Just a horrible, horrible format. It's like watching a slow strobe light. Who the hell edits like this?!",False
19,10,"Don't mind the smooth brained haters, they just don't understand the concept of fiction",scottkelston,n/a,15/08/2025,"A cursory google will tell you that the main character of the film doesn't exist, so why is the film getting reviewed badly by people who feel like they're being lied to? Bruce Springsteen never worked a day in his life, but his dad worked in a factory for decades. He took what he saw and ignored the small truth's to try to tell a big truth. Would these reviewers begrudge The Boss' working class credentials in the same way that they're begrudging this film for its ambiguous relationship to reality?",False
20,2,"Great, fake",MFBOS42,n/a,15/08/2025,"Science fiction is great, but this is more of a mocking of the UAP subject. It would be nice if this type of thing actually happened. Senior scientific members of the establishment coming forward and sharing what they know, risking their careers to share life altering knowledge with their fellow man. This is NOT that. The content is well written, but simply a semantically different spin on the same old data.",False
21,10,Great movie to enjoy,corrosiveblade,n/a,15/08/2025,I greatly enjoyed this especially during this times.,False
22,7,Genre: NOT Documentary.... is a Sci-fi,calmirio,n/a,15/08/2025,"An intelligent, a novelty and curious way of expressing facts, fiction, and your own thoughts on this subject. Brilliant and refreshing; and again NOT a documentary, but a sci-fi fiction!",False
23,1,Nothing to see here.,Opinate,n/a,15/08/2025,An extremely boring woman who apparently went on to be a UFO expert telling the least interesting UFO sighting story I have ever heard. The graphics are pathetic and there is nothing remotely interesting about this video of a woman talking. She could have shot it herself with her phone.Some reviewers have stated the movie is fictitious. That makes the it even more of an abomination since someone took the time to make up the nothing. Fiction should hold our interest if nothing else.,False
24,2,Definitely not a documentary.,liquidstar-08582,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf you re actually interested in ufological phenomena and are looking for new data then don t bother watching this; it says at the end its all fictional. It seems to have been a summary of the directors views. I for one am very tired of seemingly clever fake documentaries covering paranormal and ufological subjects. The main, nay, only. actress is very good, too good actually, as one would expect more hesitance in a genuine interview. Said book has not been released as yet; and in truth, a book would have been preferabl(as would the movie had its status as mockumentary science fiction been self-declared; although by someone who obviously has some informed opinions on the subject. As it stands, it is can only be taken as deliberate disinfo muddying an already muddy discipline done purely for the sake of entertainment. There is some interesting ""effects"" perhaps meant to simulate a ufo sighting perhaps; which is maybe where the best part and the worst part of the movie lies; as the continual blacking out of the interview becomes very distracting and annoying. I do like perhaps the approach to a maybe trans-moderne sublime with these attempts but they would need to be taken further, more explicitly.",True
25,n/a,SHE IS THE MISINFORMATION,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"ABOUT HALFWAY THRU IT BECAME CLEAR THAT SHE WAS IN FACT THE ONE BEING DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING ABT WHAT SHE BELIEVES. CLEARLY, THIS MOVIE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ALLOED TO BE MADE IF SHE STATED THINGS TO BE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT SHE CLAIMS.... MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE, NO LOGIC TO HER CLAIMS AS SHE DOES A COMPLETE 180.ONE SH KEEP IN MIND THAT IN ORDER FOR SOMETHING TO B BELIEVEABLE, THERE HAS TO BE SOME TRUTH TO THE MATTER AS SHE PURPORTS TO BE.DO NOT WASTE UR TIME.",False

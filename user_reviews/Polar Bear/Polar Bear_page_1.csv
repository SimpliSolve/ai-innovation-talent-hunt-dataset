1,6,ice bears and climate change,ferguson-6,n/a,15/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. After filming their award-winning documentary PENGUINS (2019) in Antarctica, co-directors Alastair Fothergill and Jeff Wilson re-teamed and headed to Norway, not far from the North Pole, to capture life and the fight for survival by polar bears in this feature for Disneynature.As we would expect, the adult polar bears are majestic and powerful, while the cubs are just about the cutest things on the planet. Also, as we have come to expect from Disneynature, the photography is stunning in its clarity and ability to take our breath away. Unfortunately, much of the story here is focused on climate change and its impact on these creatures. Filmed over years, we follow a mother ""ice bear"" after her two cubs are born. We watch as the mother first hunts for food and later trains her cubs. Seals are the preferred dish of the day, but seals have become harder to find due to the warming waters and reduced ice.Three other segments feature Baluga whales, walruses, and an incredible few minutes of birds flocking along the side of a steep cliff. A dead whale gives us a look at the fearsome male polar bears and their intimidating force over females and cubs. Disneynature doesn't shy away from the harsh realities and mortal danger faced by polar bears, as we witness both death and separation ... though, as the circle of life indicates, these are offset with new birth and arrivals.Two-time Academy Award nominee Catherine Keener (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, CAPOTE) uses her distinctive voice to capture the wonder of the bears and their harsh environment, as well as the overall challenges occurring due to climate change. We are informed that the Arctic circle could be 'ice-free' by 2040, which means the polar bears must adapt quickly or face the dire consequences. Hopefully it's clear that this is not one of the warm and fuzzy Disney docs that many of us grew up on, and therefore, not for the youngest kids (no matter how much they love polar bears).Premieres on Earth Day (April 22, 2022) on Disney +",False
2,8,[8.5] Not all males are alike!,cjonesas,n/a,15/08/2025,"A semi-great documentary on polar bears, being a little too soft and lollipop, having a narrator who's asleep half of the time and sort of failing to fully and adequately deliver its alarming message throughout the course of the story. Nevertheless, it is instructive and I liked it.That is not David Attenborough quality, that's Disneynature one!",False
3,6,Awful voice over,wrenchmebollix,n/a,15/08/2025,"For such an accomplished piece of animation it's assured that the script is so lousy and the narrator so dreadful.Nothing else to say. Needed a proper voice actor, not a celebrity or whatever she is.Ended up turning the sound off. Poor show!",False
4,n/a,"Recycled BBC ""Spy in Ice Den"" film scenes; fictional narration for toddlers",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Disney nature simply buys film rights, enhances it to HD, & inserts new narration / script. It's sanitized so ppl can believe lies that wildlife do not die or experience bad things. Even if they do, they're not human so it's impossible for any other creature on this planet to be sentient.Script is written for kids & barely touches on how tough life is. When cub loses her brother, no mention of grief is hinted. BBC's Frozen Planet 1&2, the Hunt, & ""7 worlds 1 planet"" narrator, Sir David , describes how polar mother & twin cub stayed dying cub's side, protecting weak twin cub from our changing planet's increasing frequent sudden below freezing prolonged violent blizzards. Both Mother & twin cub remained next to dead cub's body for 2 days despite their own hunger. Those are facts but omitted from this film. How is that behavior not grief? They did not eat the cub despite both were starving.1 reviewer states ""no proof ice is melting"" & spewed lots of same propaganda that puts humanity's future in jeopardy. Have u been living in a cave? Space & satellite images prove 1/3 of both polar ice caps have permanently melted. This ice has NOT melted in millions of The yrs. Polar bears are now endangered- many adult polar bears drown at sea.Scientists who tag & count remaining global polar bears , see mothers abandoning cubs before 2 yrs- far too early. Or worst, cubs die when still on milk bc mother bear has NO seals to eat at all = no milk for cubs. Largest iceberg on planet is cracking off huge chunks size of empire state building & falling into the sea bc sea is warming.Only science model needed amending were the ones created in 1970s , who stated this climate crisis will be evident by 2010. Ppl ridiculed them. Not anymore.Narrator sounds like Scarlett Johansson with sore throat.1 star for choosing best shots of BBC films.Zero stars for nonsensical entertainment written false script.All wildlife is being pushed to extinction due to PPL.",False
5,6,Emotionally attached,ks-60500,n/a,15/08/2025,It's great documentary and let our next generation how human destroy the globe and how we direct and indirectly make species extinct. It's really good material to let kids watch this and educational. Polar bear probably the most lonely animals in this planet.,False
6,9,Disney's take on Polar Bears and Global Warming,wadams-13692,n/a,15/08/2025,"Since it was released on Earth Day you would expect some take on Global Warming. Not to discount previous reviews and opinions, it is a well presented documentary that I enjoyed watching. I plan on sharing it with my students in the near future. The film follows a mother Polar Bear and her two cubs through the perils of growing up and hunting in the polar north. There are comments made periodically throughout the film of the effects of Global Warming on the ice regions. Critics on both sides will argue for and against the presentation and validity of Global Warming in Polar Bears. I urge you to watch for the Polar Bears.",False
7,10,An Incredible Ice Tale !!!,Syed_Abuthahir,n/a,15/08/2025,"An Incredible Ice Tale from Artic Islands...It's Cute, Funny, Heart-warming, Touching, Inspiring...It's a shocking truth that Global warming could take away these beautiful nature in few years. Hats off to the team who took all the risk in ice to film this documentary,we able to witness the lives of these ""Great Polar Bears "". Thank you so much. Many shots are so beautiful and stunning.Must watch Documentary..",False
8,1,Disgustingly Insipid and over the top TOO sweet...,bruceacim,n/a,15/08/2025,I have been a member here on IMDb for over 15 years and I have never left a review nor given any movie a 1!!Sure the movie tugs at the heartstrings as that is the entire intention of the film. I perused the other seven reviews and somehow they were able to glean from this outrage of a movie something meaningful about global warming.I was at minimum expecting a brief message at the end of the movie where the audience could go to read the multiplicity of scientific evidence that the polar caps are melting at an alarming rate!!All of the studies done in the last decade have indicated the data used was to say the least inconsistent and mostly wishful thinking. All of the scientists who participated in these studies have confessed their error in establishing the models used to predict the warming of the polar caps. Many have requested and begged mae colpa as they now realize their models were off by no less then 100%!!Nowhere in the movie is there any solid evidence given of the particularly dire straits the polar bears (now called Ice Bears and what kind of doublespeak is that!!) in adapting to a much more challenging environment where food during the summer months is particularly scarce.The only hint given is the narrator says they will learn to adapt which is not proven in any study!! If you listen with a good pair of headsets you can't hear micro wavering in the narrator's voice when she feels emotionally distraught with the script.I am greatly perplexed at what Disney was attempting to accomplish with the movie as released. They certainly are not making an Impactful environmental statement!!The movie about the making of polar bear it is a much better movie overall!! Not that it gets into great detail about what faces the polar bear in the next 30 to 50 years but at least there is some discussion about the early melting of the ice shelf as well as the diminishing glaciers which helped contain the ice shelf.I would not in good conscience want any impressionable children to watch the polar bear movie BUT I would certainly encourage parents to have them watch the making of the movie which is infinitely more informative and raises questions a parent can discuss with their child about the dangers the bears face.,False
9,10,Great film!!!,austin-46918,n/a,15/08/2025,That was a real tear-jerker. I hope everyone who watched it signed the petition at the end. I know I did. People should care more about these issues then their dogs or celebrities or other Hollywood drama's when the real ones unfolding right in front of their eyes.,False
10,1,Waste of time and really innoing.,TC6,n/a,15/08/2025,"This could have been a good documentary, if they hadn't instructed the narrator to speak as if she was one of the bear cups.You don't know what they are thinking and you only seem more ignorant, when you act like you do.",False
11,10,Well-made film,edgarjacob,n/a,15/08/2025,Really unique film on polar bears and their experiences. Films looks like it took years and years to make and a lot of effort. Very much enjoyed it - save the polar bears!!,False
12,10,Inspires us all to create the environmental change that can save our planet,rannynm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Have you ever watched a film that left you filled with so much emotion that it rendered you speechless? Disneynature's new Earth Day film Polar Bear has done just that. As a huge advocate for nature, I appreciate this film so much and truly believe that this just may be the film that inspires us all to create the environmental change that can save our planet.This nature documentary follows the life journey of a mother polar bear and her two cubs. This brave mother navigates through some of the roughest and most dangerous ecosystems on our planet while teaching her cubs all about survival. Environmental changes over the years, however, have negatively impacted these ice bears resulting in an even greater struggle for existence. If these creatures are to survive in this modern world, they must learn to adapt and to pass new survival skills to their offspring which we are able to witness in Polar Bear.Although the film is so heartfelt and difficult to watch at times, its footage is exactly what we need for a call to action because it creates awareness. If people are unaware of the causes and consequences of climate change, we can't fix it. Directors Alastair Fothergill and Jeff Wilson have created a masterpiece filled with the most breathtaking scenes with each one serving to educate viewers. The cinematography is so captivating, and I especially love the aerial footage. Actor Catherine Keener adds a special touch to the film with her first-person narration of the female cub who shares how the memories of growing up alongside her courageous mother helped to shape her own motherhood.The message in Polar Bear is about conservation awareness and a need for global commitment to make change. I'm hoping that this film's message inspires others to think more about nature and what would happen if ecosystems were lost forever. Polar Bear also sends the message of the importance of strong family bonds and how for some species, these bonds are critical for survival.I give Polar Bear 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 18. Adults, especially nature lovers, will also love this film. Polar Bear begins streaming exclusively on Disney+ on Earth Day, April 22, 2022. Mark your calendars and spread the word, this is a film that you don't want to miss!By Dominic D., KIDS FIRST!",False

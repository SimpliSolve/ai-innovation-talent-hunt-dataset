1,6,Nostalgia Lane,tributarystu,n/a,15/08/2025,"On my last 1hr+ flight, I suddenly remembered I had downloaded this documentary off YT, and so its time had come. Half-Life was a pivotal game for a whole generation of gamers, who, probably like me, also faced the reckoning of two and a half decades passing since they were young(er).As far as corporate documentaries go, this one's got a bit of heart, but it doesn't go into any serious depth. It does however manage to document the origin story of one of the greatest PC games ever made, with its chapter structure, a kudos to the game's own structure, easy to follow.What makes it in some way stick beyond just a YT video is the time warp enjoyed with all the protagonists telling their stories, which are usually interesting details from the production process. The odd personal moments elevate what we're watching and I was left wishing there had been more of them.Its limited scope doesn't allow the Anniversary Doc to shine, but it did leave me with a nostalgic craving. Or maybe I'll finally install Black Mesa.",False

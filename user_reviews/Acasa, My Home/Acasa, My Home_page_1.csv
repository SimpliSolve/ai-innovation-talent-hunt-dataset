1,8,the Delta of the Bucharest,dromasca,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Acasa"" or ""My Home"" as translated in the title of Radu Ciorniciuc's documentary is a very special film that accompanies for four years a social program related to an unusual family. Gelu Enache and his wife had settled with their nine children in the the area, closed and abandoned area for over two decades, of the Vacaresti Park, also called the Bucharest Delta. In the park where nature had gradually regained its rights by creating a unique natural ecosystem within the metropolis populated by over two million inhabitants, the Enache family lived outside urban civilization, in harmony with nature, but without social, health or education services for their children. When the Vacaresti Park came to the attention of the authorities, the family was displaced and became the subject of social assistance - a traumatic change for adults and children who had not known another way of life, but also a potential chance for future social integration. ""Acasa"" is an involved documentary and a documentary about involvement.Radu Ciorniciuc, who is an investigative journalist, worked with the assistance programs, but at the same time managed to gain the trust of the family, which made him a participant and allowed him to accompany and document in the film the transformations and crises they went through. Implicitly, important topics such as ecology, urban progress and their impact on people's lives are addressed. His cinematic style combines well-filmed reporting (the urban landscape take filmed from a drone that locates the park and its surroundings is memorable) with social investigation. Humor is not missing like in the scenes where we witness the visits of Prince Charles or of the then Prime Minister in the park, but it looks like what primarily characterizes Ciorniciuc's film is empathy for the destinies of the film's heroes. It is remarkable how he managed to gain their trust and make from purely documentary materials a more coherent narrative and a more exciting film than many fiction feature films.The ecological implications are not lacking, although they are not the main theme of the film. For many inhabitants of Bucharest, the existence of an original ecosystem so close to the center of the Romanian capital was a surprise. Its introduction in the tourist circuit was traumatic not only for the Enache family but for the whole natural environment, and the success of this urban integration will be appreciated only over the years, if the fauna and flora of the area will be protected from the influences of the metropolis and of its inhabitants. Issues related to racial discrimination and the methods of integration as a solution to eliminate social disabilities are not ignored, but they are not the focus. The Romanian audiences probably know most of the issues, the international public might miss many nuances.""Acasa"" is a powerful film whose impact is mainly due to the sincerity, empathy and lack of prejudice with which the problems of social and personal integration of the Enache family are addressed. It would be interesting to follow the evolution of the heroes over the years. Director Radu Ciorniciuc did not deny in the discussion - webinar that was occasioned by the film at the DOCAVIV festival a possible continuation. To follow, like any other creations coming from this interesting Romanian journalist and film director.",False
2,7,Warning; contains animal cruelty and child neglect,Euthanasiated,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary should have a warning for animal cruelty and child neglect. I was not ready for how the family treats animals, it made me uncomfortable. On the other hand the documentary is immersive - I could only focus on the subject matter. Emotional in a lot of ways; I was angry, frustrated, disgusted, sad but also gratified. Life of the family is far from my own life, I got a peek into a totally different reality of life. But the values are very different from my own. It may be that I'm too judgy and pampered for this kind of subject matter to fully appreciate it. Can't watch this again even though I think the film itself was well made.",False

4,10,The fall of a complex human society,coicifer,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film showcases more than the drama of the daily life of the Enache family. It shows how selfish and desperate we are all as a society.Even if social assistance intervened and attempted to help Mr. Enache and his wife, there was there never an attempt to offer any mental health support for all the children involved in this life style.The Enache family was just told that they can no longer live the way they used to live for more than 20 years, but with no guidelines, support or any proper analyze of how they ended living this way.Mental health care is still a 'taboo' subject in most Eastern European countries and Romania continues to ignore this.Sadly this documentary manages to highlight the emotional drama that the children are going through and the idiotic and continuous refusal of Mr. Enache to embrace living in a society.The action is not taking place 50 or 40 or even 20 years in the past. This is as modern as it can be. That's why it's absolutely hearth breaking and mind blowing.",True
5,1,Gypsies and animal cruelty,buggy807,n/a,16/08/2025,"Instead of focusing on the natural ecosystem formed in the middle of a metropolis, the director chose to follow one of the worst aspects of Romania: gypsies that do not want to get integrated into society and perform animal cruelty.The biodiversity in Vacaresti Natural Park is very similar to the one in Delta Dunarii, this in it self beeing an impresive thing. Yet, 5 minutes into the movie they show us a family of gypsies torturing a teenaged swan, basically showing how humans distroy nature.My only question for the director is ""why?"".Just go watch Wild Romania or Untamed Romania.",False
6,1,Made for the western audience,pezevenchiul,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary is just following around a homeless gypsy family living filthy and abusively in a natural reserve in the middle of Bucharest, acting like it's their birth given right to do so.The american equivalent would be a family of illegal aliens setting camp in New York Central Park, acting like it's their property and right to do so.There are no words that could describe the hypocrisy and double standard of the filmmakers/producers and NGOs involved in perpetuating this clown show. If it was a family of white romanians acting so ridiculously, absolutely nobody, and rightly, would have taken their side.",True

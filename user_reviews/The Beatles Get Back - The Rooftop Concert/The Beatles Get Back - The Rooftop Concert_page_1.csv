1,10,The Best Thing I Saw In IMAX,adamhacia,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was one of the best hour in my life. It was so great to see that band again with incredible sound that IMAX theatres offers. The funny thing was that I'm 22 and when I entered the theatre there was a group of some older men and they said ""God it's great to see some young people enjoy their music like we did"" ðŸ˜Š",False
2,8,Unforgettable 'one-hour plus' live-concert from the legends,witra_as,n/a,16/08/2025,The most unforgettable 'one-hour plus' live-concert that took us back to The Beatles' era. Peter Jackson used split-screen effectively to capture natural reactions from seemingly random audience. Each members lit up the screen with their own persona.,False
3,10,Loved it but...,amazon-03156,n/a,16/08/2025,....it ended too soon!!! I would have gladly sat through another hour of concert footage. Especially loved the short historical intro to the band and how their career led to this moment.,False
4,n/a,"What an unforgettable atmosphere, MY IDOL!",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Isn't it a crazy feeling when you still have appreciable energy for the band who doesn't even exist anymore?I thank for these legendary, I've been spending my whole times by listening to them. Oh, Beatles.",False
5,10,"If you're an OLD Beatle fan, you will love it.",bluetulip-84703,n/a,16/08/2025,"By an OLD Beatle fan, I mean- you 1st saw The Beatles on Ed Sullivan and watched them evolve both personally and musically. We all kind of grew up together. You remember the songs, the girl friends, marriages, divorces, new songs, old songs, concerts- all of it. You will also see and wonder about Yoko's weird presence in the recording sessions: really weird and why is she there? Probably to control John. What I found particularly interesting is how they composed songs- FASCINATING! All playing off each other- all a tune to one another and could feel what was needed to make the song work--and watch a song grow. That in itself if interesting for any Beatle fan!",False
6,10,Outstanding Footage and Music!,pynerb,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a lifelong Beatles fan this is a dream come true to see old pictures from the 1970s come to life in great cinema quality with all the back stories on how the famous ""Beatles Rooftop Concert"" came to be! It is truly amazing that 53 years later the songs still sound great and that the Beatles still look cool! To me this was by far the best part of the Peter Jackson 7 hours ""Get Back"" footage, this final rooftop video concert is what really matters! Just one little tidbit of information, this ""Beatles Rooftop Concert"" was filmed in London, England at 12:30pm on Thursday, January 30, 1969 the weather that day was 45Â°F and cold! -Brad Pyner.",False
7,7,Slight Piece which...,philipmagnier,n/a,16/08/2025,"...makes you wish that they'd played more concerts together. I love the interaction with Paul and John; the two very much out in front and centre of the band.What a fabulous voice Paul had and possibly has. And what a live wire and joker John was. And of course the music, but so few songs! Get Back is repeated three times (hard to believe they hadn't rehearsed any more), plus maybe three others.I enjoyed the crowds peeking and gathering below in the 60s London of mini skirts and city gents, and the London bobbies who are probably embarrassed to this day.But even at 65 minutes it's hard to get past the feeling that there is lots of filler material inserted with this film.However I'm glad I saw it, being someone who is old enough to have listened to the Beatles at the time. Can't wait to see the Peter Jackson series.",False
8,3,Revisionist history,dclarke-28979,n/a,16/08/2025,"He took an exceptional insight into the world's most influential group and completely sanitized it. Yes, the Lindsay-Hogg movie was sad but it also portrayed life and relationships as they were at the time. Now that's what documentaries are supposed to do. Shame on Jackson. Why was the development of tensions city from how it really was? It's critically important to understand how and why the relationship between John and Paul fell apart. It's equally important to see how other relationships were affected. Paul was a control freak. Even his influence on Ringo was damaged. George was an extremely talented musician and just outgrew Paul. Why is that edited out of the original? It's also very important to provide the context of Ono's ever growing relationship with John. Much of the documentary hinges on watching that develop.",False

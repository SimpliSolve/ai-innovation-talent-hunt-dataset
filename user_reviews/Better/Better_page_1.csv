1,8,An Earnest Portrait of the Diabesity Epidemic (diabetes and obesity),rannynm,n/a,15/08/2025,"With a crucial message but somewhat monotonous delivery, Better is an earnest portrait of the ""diabesity"" (diabetes and obesity) epidemic by author and speaker Jonathan Bailor. The honest interviews with diabesity survivors, relatives of these individuals, and health experts really drive the point across, but the documentary does drag a bit.Better explores the diabesity epidemic and proposes a new solution to the issue. Diabesity refers to a type of diabetes often developing in later life and accompanied by an increase in weight. The film explains that neither weight coaches nor fitness plans or calorie-counting are truly the answer to this issue; balance is. Jonathan Bailor, the man behind the documentary, recommends eating SANE (Satiety, Aggression, Nutrition and Efficiency) foods. Limiting starchy foods and increasing intake of non-starchy vegetables, nutrient-dense proteins and whole-food fats can help maintain the homeostasis (balance) that our body needs to stay healthy and fit. Along with this premise, it proposes new ideas about exercise and other activities. This is an intriguing documentary that is sure to give you some food for thought.The documentary cuts seamlessly between interviews, graphics, and scenes from Bailor's TED talks. The delivery of information is so rapid and so efficient that little room is left for the viewer to truly take in the information, which is when Better drags and lags a bit. It feels a bit like a big advertisement, rather than a story. Still, Better truly moved me. The black-and-white scenes of survivors telling their stories, compelling others to do the same, and the ending sequence of the film especially tugged at my heartstrings.Better is a film about showing grit in the face of an uphill battle and having hope through trying times. It's also about trying new things and changing a part of yourself for the better. It's truly an interesting documentary.I give Better 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults.

2,9,I was headed for diabetes until this project came along.,dougmorris-09809,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've always struggled with my weight, which hadn't been a problem in my youth but as I grew older my doctor grew increasingly concerned with my chances of getting Type 2 Diabetes. Blare Media, the production company that produced ""BETTER"" asked me to produce some illustrations and, while I was paid for my efforts, I benefitted much more from what I learned about how to approach the foods I put in my body. In a short period of time I had dropped 20 pounds. And now have a new perspective on what it takes to live a SANE lifestyle. Special shout outs to Jonathan Bailor and Justin McAleece who guided the production and gave me the inspiration to avoid the complications of Diabetes that was surely coming my way. I can give it my personal endorsement because I actually applied the teachings in the documentary and found them to work. Lose the weight the smart way... and live BETTER.",False
3,10,a BETTER way to lose weight and gain health,cmattice-28573,n/a,15/08/2025,"BETTER is the best food documentary I have ever seen. It combines interviews with REAL Harvard doctors who discuss how the metabolism and setpoint really work and why traditional diets have failed most of us. They along with New York Times Bestselling author Jonathan Bailor reveal a BETTER way to lose weight and be healthier that is based on science, not on the ever-changing and profiteering diet industry.This documentary also features testimonials from real people who have struggled with diabesity issues and suffered the shame, humiliation, and torture of trying everything they can to lose weight only to gain it back time after time. These testimonials are touching and heartbreaking and empowering. I don't remember seeing a food documentary that took the time to really talk to people affected and devastated by diabesity issues (obesity+diabetes=diabesity) and do so in such a compassionate manner.Everyone can benefit from watching this film. For those struggling with their weight, BETTER offers a scientifically proven, stress-free, easier way. (Yes, this film offers actionable steps you can take TODAY to lose weight and keep it off!) If you've never had a problem with your weight, there's a good chance you know someone who does...and you can help them.Either way, this film will change the way you view the obesity issue and those who suffer from this condition.Good job!!!",False

5,1,A very long documentary to tell you absolutely NOTHING new,tt-stingray,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt starts promising talking about many ""new"" scientific findings about the Diabesity Epidemic. Talking about ""setpoints"", new ways to understand the role of gut bacteria etc. And it comes up with the ""new"" magic formula SANE to tell you what to eat to loose weight.Guess what? You should eat a lot of vegetables, fruit and healthy fat but no fast food, sugary drinks and sweets. THAT'S the ""new"" scientific way to loose weight.Save this 100 min of your life. You got all relevant information from the documentary already in this short review already...",True
6,10,So inspiring!,patachon,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you or someone you love has been suffering from
""Diabesity"" this is a great documentary. You will learn a lot about how to improve your health and lose weight even if you aren't obese and aren't suffering from diabetes. I don't have any of those conditions, but I learned a lot. It inspires me to make Better decisions everyday to improve my health.",False
7,2,Basically a stage lecture from a guy named Jonathan,jake_fantom,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm posting this review mostly to temper all the 10-star raves. What this is, is a guy named Jonathan, standing on a stage, delivering his standard lecture about the benefits of a zero-carb diet for people who are overweight or have diabetes. (There are also some filler interviews by people who think Jonathan is the cat's pajamas, but basically, it is Jonathan's stage lecture.) It's not really a documentary in the sense of a balanced investigation into anything, yet I am sure people who are seriously overweight and/or suffering from diabetes will find much to ponder here. I have no quarrel with Jonathan's point of view, just writing to let filmgoers know that what you get for your money is essentially a stage lecture by a guy who is touting the benefits of a zero-carb diet.",True
8,10,The Science and Doctors are Awesome!,matthewpreuninger,n/a,15/08/2025,There is so much information in here that I didn't know.

9,2,Awkward,ubergarbage,n/a,15/08/2025,This documentary is one of the worst ive ever seen. They do reenactments with horrible actors for no reason when the actual subjects could just be interviewed. The entire doc seemed like some ego boost for the main guy. The whole tag phrase is silly. Nothing is new. You could sum up the main points in 2-3 sentences. Eat veggies. Dont eat carbs and sugar. Zzzzzz.I rated this 2/10 because the ego on the main guy is so huge is comical. Its so bad it turns back to good. He starts crying throughout the movie because he figured out carbs are bad. OK i'll stop.,False

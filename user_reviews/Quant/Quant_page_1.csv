1,6,Quant,CinemaSerf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately this is rather a dry look back at the life of this visionary and entrepreneurial lady. It certainly offers a feast of archive film, VT and photography but for the most part, the narrative is relayed in a slightly adulatory fashion by her co-workers, and with the exception of her godson Jasper Conran, the majority of the contributors will have little traction with any but the most closely involved in the industry amongst the audience. The chronology itself is interesting enough, depicting well the whole vibe of London in the 1960s: the ""scene""; the music, the first real throes of post war liberation, the commencement of the process for real gender equality, and the soundtrack is used sparingly to illustrate that. Sadly, though, and perhaps because so many of her contemporaries are no longer alive, there is just something remarkably static about this. You are shown images time and time again in a quickly framed, wham-bam sort of fashion, but somehow it doesn't resonate, or stick - it's like looking through some old editions of ""Vogue"" - there is little sense of the character or the personality of either her, or her larger than life husband. It's just all too one-dimensional to captivate - and for me, anyway, it just didn't.",False
2,n/a,Decoupage con Carne,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The clipperdie clip, cut, clint of a pastiche might incite a sentimental momentary brain bleed. Nostalgic electronica is yet to hit a mark of authenticity that is remotely reliable. Memory is problematic in so far as artificial intelligence had loads of time to catch up on the down times of quarantine's and quantitative times downloading clips from times decades looking into marvel comic hemispheres and stamp collections. Retail is better spent at petrol bowsers where wages are anti inflationary, but negotiated by Sally's in Canberra as an afterthought of an index instead of a cologne. The 7/11 can influence any cologne or ice cream that Mary may well have endorsed, influenced and consumed, but not likely. Thus show let Mary down sideways, said Sue Menger via the satellites elongated for a solar sale.",False

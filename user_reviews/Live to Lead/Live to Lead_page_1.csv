1,4,Nice work if you can get it,jgreco7,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's good to know the Sussexes have found useful work. Being a name, as they certainly are, has value in itself--the series, we're reminded, is ""presented by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex""--so it's admirable they've used their fame to serve a noble cause. A documentary series that showcases remarkable individuals who've accomplished something, contributed to the betterment of humanity, and/or made personal sacrifices is a project of merit, without question. Unfortunately, it's also derivative hype in the service of unpleasant self-promotion. The series' featured guests are allotted a cursory 30 minutes to relate their stories (most of them familiar to anyone current with events), underscored with music for the appropriate sentiment: they're mostly talking heads, accompanied by background footage (an off-screen voice, British, poses questions occasionally). Watch each episode (seven in all) and you become aware that they are, more or less, thinly disguised highlight reels. The question remains: who is being highlighted anyway?The Sussexes ought to have learned by now, at least, a modicum of humility, or the the value of humble service. What makes them obviously compatible is that neither shrinks from the spotlight. Perhaps it's unavoidable for them not to appear sanctimonious on camera--maybe it's her natural gift for pretending, for ingratiating herself effortlessly, or his plummy tones of privilege, but they're both well advised to serve best behind the scenes, like eminences grises, and heed Gloria Steinem's claim for ""authenticity."" The flaw of this otherwise well intended series is their driven need--unmistakable from the outset--to justify themselves to their critics. They have, after all, acquired a legion of them. They might believe it's through no fault of their own, but that, they should realize, is precisely the problem.",False
2,5,"Extraordinary Guests, Disappointing Portray of their Stories",espaillatcarolina,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was truly disappointed with this series, the people highlighted are extraordinary in their fields; yet, I couldn't help but feel that their stories where butchered. I believe that it was expected to actually know the biography of all those involved, in order to feel connected; their live stories felt incomplete, and in spite of their extraordinay experiences some episodes ended up being boring; which really impacted me, how could someone belittle these people's lives to the point of boredom? When they are everything BUT boring, so disappointed.Also, don't understand the need to include Meghan Markle and Prince Harry in each episode, in my view, it diminished the quality of the show; and for the first time in my life, the constant mention of Nelson Mandela made me cringe to a point. I would have respected them more, if they would have given the light to their guests, if they would have taken more time to create their stories with the impact that they possess; the constant need to try to remind everyone that they're ""trying"" to do good, only reinforces their constant need for attention and validation.If there's going to be a secon season, I truly hope that the respect that their possible guests deserve, comes through... Handing the torch to those who actually have a message to deliver. Even though, I don't think a second season with this same team is needed.",False
3,8,The Haters gonna hate,misterybee,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm surprised by how the propaganda from ""the firm"" (the Royal family) against Harry and Meghan that made its way into various publications over the years has evidently infiltrated the minds of some who post here. Harry and Meghan have an interesting story to tell and I have no reason to not believe their experiences or their understandings of what was going on to control, undermine and punish them. I appreciate their determination to do good in the world and their journey into WOKENESS together. If the Haters can't move past their names and brief appearances to introduce the interviews then the Haters have a problem, but the problem is not Harry or Meghan. The problem is who looks back at them when they stand alone and stare into a mirror.This docuseries is a good introduction into the lives of some inspiring people we should be more familiar with: Bryan Stevenson, Greta Thunberg, Ruth Beta Ginsberg and Gloria Steinem, for example. We are taken along on their journey into becoming who they became and we are treated with their self-assessments of who they became. Their summations of themselves. Their philosophical realizations. Their humanity. Ruth's deep and abiding love for Marty was particularly touching. I fell in love with Marty too. We learn some of the things they learned as they followed an inner calling that was much louder in them than in most. My complaint is, for me, the bad use of music sometimes that distracted more than enhanced. Annoyed more than complimented.",False
4,9,Enjoyable,Praetorius1980,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed watching this series. The interviews are well done and personal, giving a better view of the people being interviewed.The stories presented are meant to inspire and they do. They are meant to remind us that human are capable of great things, things that connect us to each other and make the world better.I know some people wont watch because of the producers and that is unfortunate. The people highlighted are worth a watch and a listen. I highly recommend this for anyone in need of a little positivity and inspiration in a world that seems lacking of both most of the time. Give it a chance!",False
5,10,Incredibly inspiring series,aliciaakuajohnson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though each episode is approx 30 mins it still felt like very informative, intimate portrayals of the leaders. My favourite episodes were on Bryan Stevenson, Albie Sachs and Siya Kolisi who i didn't know as much about. I liked how Bryan talked about the importance of having open dialogue about race & how African Americans had been treated. That silence had prohibited progress.Siya talking about the awful poverty he had experienced coupled with the domestic violence he witnessed was so heartbreaking. And showing the impact of apartheid laws in Albie's segment & how the spirit of ubuntu helped Albie forgive people who caused him such a painful injury was such a reminder that these issues are so fresh & live.Incredible stories. A must watch especially if you are in need of inspiration.",False
6,1,"Great title for click bait, but....",srestifo,n/a,16/08/2025,I thought that the use of Nelson Mandela's name and what he inspired was a way H and M used once again a platform that wasn't their original view. Then to see both of them giving their insights was enough to just wish some credible individuals were used than these two. The interviews were not current but seemed H and M were brought in to use their names and figure heads for millions. So no I didn't feel like watching all the episodes as the first one was enough to show the pattern.Enjoy and if I could...I would wish I didn't spend the time on this documentary with interviews from 3 years ago.,False
7,1,UnOriginal Left-Wing Propaganda and Cringy,smorales78,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched and been in Live to Lead conferences hosted by a great leader, coach and mentor, John Maxwell. You can meet real life-changing leaders offering their humbleness in greatness and their hard walk to get where they are. Real people. Its a true representation of the varied leadership styles, objectively presented, inspiring for all kinds of people and the leader in you. It focuses on leadership and not leftists nor right-wing propagandas. I encourage you to search John Maxwell if you are looking for inspiration in 2023.But this, short of a docuseries, short of inspirational, is a well-edited, music-enriched global leftist propaganda of what the elitist crowd wants you to think is good. Its nothing about leadership, but everything on gaslighting and opportunism. Only high ratings comes from leftist trying to boost the series. In any case, it reveals the benefits of aligning thoughts with the right, powerful, elitist crowd. Full of ironies that almost seems like they are laughing at our faces. How can a child enviromentalist that hides behind autism to demand pity, endorse two world-class spenders of fossil fuels. Those elitists she loves and admire. The hypocrisy! How can a governor, President of her country, endorse two royal brats who has not experience what the poor endures and dares talk about poverty. Feels so fake and hypocritical. I can go on, but the show is to promote the World Economic Forum ideas and scares. I recommend visiting their webpage.I've watched and been in Live to Lead conferences hosted by a great leader, coach and mentor, John Maxwell.

8,1,Chilling celebration of blind leaders,b4blue,n/a,16/08/2025,"Road to hell is paved by good intentions should be a subtitle of this show. These are the people that create a climate of irreversible damage to local and global society. Their talking points are pure demagogy and their actions are against international human rights and anti-science at its core. This is pure demagogy of the ruling elites that governs societal collapse all around the world. The worse aspect of these people is that it is possible they just don't know what they are doing but the narcissism is obvious. The age of extreme religious views cloaked as ""science"" has started few years ago and things might get much worse before they get better.",False
9,10,An inspiring watch,rubychunn,n/a,16/08/2025,"In only 30 minutes, you've given an incredibly in-depth understanding of these inspiring leaders, how they overcame, at times unimaginable, challenges and found motivation for the remarkable things they each achieved.Starting the new year with the advice of the likes of Gloria Steinem, Bryan Stevenson and Ruth Bader Ginsburg echoing in my head is certainly one way to get motivated about a new year.Each episode is so thoughtfully put together. A perfect blend of each persons story alongside the lessons they've learned in reflection. Plus, the mix of leaders interviewed reinforces the notion that true leadership can come in all shapes and forms - an important reminder for us all.I couldn't recommend this series more. My only piece of advice is to have tissues on hand!",False
10,10,"Educational, Inspiring and a MUST WATCH *****",Labradorlady,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whatever you choose to think of the royals, this series really impacted me. It achieved the ideal blend of authentic stories and inspirational characters within a manageable timeframe. I've seen them all, with my favorites being Albie Sachs and Bryan Stevenson. What struck me the most was how genuine the interactions were; they didn't feel manufactured or ""Hollywood,"" but rather natural and easygoing. I believe these would be excellent teaching tools to show middle school students at school; we should be more acquainted with the majority of these folks than we already are. It would be cool to see more of them come out with new people every so often. Couldn't recommend it enough.",False
11,2,Bite-Sized Motivation for those with short attention spans,sm-03902,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are truly remarkable interviewees in this series who deserve well-researched individual documentaries each. However, the target audience for this must be the 15 - 18 year old demographic or those with short attention spans who would never sit through something like that. Many if not all of the interviews were taped 3 years ago and well before Harry and Megan had anything to do with this project from the Mandela Foundation. Shame on Netflix for trying to pass this off as being engineered by the Sussexes, it takes away from the credibility and makes the Mandela Foundation feel absolutely used for the fame gain of the Sussexes who did very little work on this. The first the Prime Minister of New Zealand new of their involvement was when she saw the trailer. I wonder how many of them would have wanted to be involved if they knew up front...",False
12,10,Leadership learning at its best!,rosiestevens,n/a,16/08/2025,"Live to Lead is a must-watch for anyone looking to take their leadership to the next level. The show's host, John C. Maxwell, is a great interviewer and facilitator, leading thoughtful and engaging conversations with each guest. The series is packed with practical advice and real-life examples that are easy to apply in your own life. The show is inspiring and motivating and will leave you feeling empowered to be a better leader. I highly recommend Live to Lead to anyone looking to improve their leadership skills and to anyone interested in personal growth and development. Live to lead has amazing insight from people who we may not normally have access to and allows us to absorb their wisdom.",False
13,n/a,Greatness From The Least Expected,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fantastic documentary series! Each of the 7 people were least expected to get beyond their foundational lives, yet they did. With great passion to help make a better world for everyone, they achieved greatness. Greatness that would have gone under the radar until some future historial wrote about them ~ but for the leadership of the producers. It is a reminder to everyone, to stop focusing on being negative & turn to be more positive despite the obstacles. Starting with our own families, neighbors, co-workers, etc. ~ whoever they may be. Their message was simple: KINDNESS BEGETS KINDNESS & GOODNESS.",False
14,10,Very good,jaxon-62907,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary series shows you an inside look at these many inspirational people. From many different countries, genders, races, ext.The only people rating this show low are very right wing or climate change dinners or gun lovers. BUT this show is for everyone to see and listen to. Especially listen to what Greta Thunberg has to say. And Jacinda is so inspiring.This documentary shows us people who are making a change in this world and it's wonderful. Yes having harry and Megan host it is a bit contrast, however the message still holds. Even if you have doubts you really should try it out.",False
15,10,Heartfelt and Inspiring....food for the soul in an increasingly jaded world,verushkalawrence,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow these reviews, if you don't like the content for whatever reason that's fine , preview it on the basis of the content and move on. To watch something with the intention of finding fault and reasons to bash it cause you hate Meghan and Harry, it's just sad. How do you feel good about yourself or experience any joy when you are this invested in hating two people that are not doing anything to you personally. You could literally choose not to follow or consume any content related to them. The irony is that these type of people need this type of content the most because it could inspire them to move away from a hateful existence and find purpose. It's never ceases to amaze that the people who scream out "" Free speech"" really believe it only applies to them , they can vomit out their miserable vitriol and the people that's it directed too must ""go away"" and cease to exit.Thankfully Harry and Meghan are are far too strong and will continue to inspire and share their values with the people that matter.Live to lead is excellent , the stories are short enough to be on point and impactful. Each interview had value and this type of content is so needed. People are becoming increasing negative and overwhelmed. It's understandable to some degree , if you look at problems globally it can feel consuming. This show was a reminder that it doesn't have to be , these leaders have very simple thought processes and their stories remind you that you can make a difference and find purpose in simple ways with your circle of people, community , country. It's about finding a shared purpose and connection to others. I hope to see more content like this from Archewell.",False
16,10,Outstanding!,suzannehurleysue,n/a,16/08/2025,"Live to Lead touched my heart in a big way. I didn't know most of the people featured and I loved hearing about each one of them. I also cried my eyes out. One thing I really liked, was that each segment was only 30 minutes long. It packed a punch and got right down to the nitty-gritty and the essence of each person. I liked that a lot. Sometimes documentaries can be too long and exhausting but this series was short, to the point, and centered on each person's contributions and gifts. Siya's story of growing up in poverty really got to me. And how his grandmother would bring him home cookies she was offered, so he would have something to eat. I hope to see more documentaries like this. Each person featured was inspiring and left me feeling that I, too, can make a difference in my part of my world. Thanks to the producers, directors, interviewers, and to all who created each segment. Thanks to Harry and Meghan. I follow all the good work they do and they inspire me, as well. Thank you.",False
17,10,Inspiring,sprokopuk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Use your life to better the world. Find purpose in helping others. Love. These are the messages of this show. It gave me chills, it made me cry, it gave me hope.Those rating this as a 1 appear to be angry conspiracy theorists.The rest of the ratings are where this should be. Amazing.There is beauty in living your life not just for yourself, but for others. There is beauty in caring about the world, and trying to make it a better place. It gives us hope and purpose. We all need to look at ourselves and ask how we can best use our own gifts, strengths and abilities to give back and make things better. This is what this show is about. Inspiring.",False
18,9,Absorb the message from each leader,reeenasingh-10160,n/a,16/08/2025,"How does it matter who produced the series or who speaks the introduction? That is less than 2 minutes of each documentary in the series. Take home the message instead and concentrate on what these leaders are really saying. If people do not like the series it is more because they are uncomfortable with the message these leaders want to convey rather than the fact that Harry and Meghan are part of the production team.I have already seen the first two documentaries and am mid-way through the third one in the series. Once the focus is on the person who is speaking, there is no mention at all of the producers. So, take home the message. That's what will benefit each one of us.",False
19,10,So Inspirational!,esperance-33000,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is amazing! Listening to and watching the motivations, challenges and triumphs of such great people, who were driven to change the world and make it better, is nothing short of inspirational. Each segment focuses on a different trailblazer and touches on various issues from their perspective. A common thread across the different segments is 'Kindness' and 'Helping Others'; I believe these two threads are excellent guides for us to follow and to share with the next generations.This series gave me the opportunity to learn more about important issues and I am grateful! I hope there will be more content like this provided across many platforms.",False
20,10,real values from real poeple,martindekker-25102,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great series about real people who step out, step forward to help others by practicing what they truly beleive in. Not for haters, not for sofa critics, not for keyboard loosers. For people who do real, postive thinsg on a regular basis (which affects ALL OUR lives daily - even if many don't wanna admit cuz they can't cross that mental bridge). If H&M do intros on this .... doesnt bother me at all (you can skip the intro anyway).One could easily see a 2nd season of these profiles. There are many people of all races and ages and sexes doing amazing work out there for a community, anation, a region, the globe.I had heard of all of the characters in this lovely series but to go deeper in who they are and why they do what they do/did, was very heartwarming and informative.",False
21,10,positiveness the world needs more of,turnleftatthetjunction,n/a,16/08/2025,"Positively surprised by this series! The Sussex duo intro (and executive producer involvement) gets the attention (too much attention sadly) because the real content are the real people doing real things positively and importantly. That's the story that one needs to remember, not who Netflix used for executive producers.It is about real people changing real people's lives for good. I knew all of the people highlighted except Bryan Stevenson, and what a man he is. Respect!And the haters, well let them eat cake. Would they hate a - let's say - Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt blockbuster because of who the exec producer is? No they won't. Case closed.",False
22,10,Inspiring,ddzoretic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Inspiring series focusing on the people that need to be a part of all of our future history books. I love the stories of what these leaders have had to overcome. Each episode is a different leader from movements all over the world. I am an avid reader of history and I learned new insights into different stories that I had already read about. I also was introduced to people that I had not learned about yet. I will be looking for more books, lol. I would love to see another season.(Harry and Meghan have very small narration parts in the beginning of each episode, so those complaining in the other reviews never watched the series.)",False
23,10,A must watch documentary to inspire,mariludel-05690,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is truly special and an inspiration for everyone who want to make a difference in this world. Meghan and Harry presented seven leaders to inspire future generation to do better to be better for this world that desperately need people of action to inspire this generation. I really enjoy watching this documentary. All seven guess speakers tell their stories and it was interesting specifically the one of late Supreme Court justice Ruth Badger Ginsburg, or learning about climate change activism of Greta Themberg, or learning about Bryan Stevenson human rights project. There is a little for everyone in this documentary. It was well made and went to the point. The point was to inspire people and I believe Meghan and Harry did a great job. Hopefully they will add more episodes but totally happy with their work.",False
24,10,Very inspiring!! A must watch,onlinequeen,n/a,16/08/2025,"The amount of hate in these reviews are insane...Mainly aimed at H&M who serve as executive producers- don't miss this docuseries based on their hateful reviews!.. every episode was inspiring. RBG was my favorite- the world misses her!! The story of Jacinda was also amazing ...
I was unaware of the existence of a couple of the subjects.. both from South Africa.. amazing people helping out mankind ( unlike these immature trolls that taunt H&M)
I wish people would just leave this couple alone.. the bullying just has to end... these are people just trying to navigate through life for their own family.",False

1,9,Amazing experience,marcosarferreira,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to witness this concert live and I was mesmerized by the spectacular screenings and image and sound ... but, what took me by surprise was her amazing voice. I'm aware she has being protecting her voice lately and not going that high on some songs, but maybe because it was meant to be recorded, she delivered such a powerful performance from the top of her lungs to the deepest of our hearts.The choir was so powerful too, but the biggest applause is to delago and the other musicians that were at Björk's level.On a less positive note: the setlist was a bit let down - I do insert the concept, but come on Bjork, we can't forget 40 years of being a musician and only focus on the last 5 / 10 years .",False
2,10,we assigned her to protect the lantern,tishinai,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had been waiting to have this exqusite eperience of watching Björk in a cinema!Each second of the piece got me mesmerized and entertained. She gave us everything in those 2 hours. There's no diva excess - just everything she needs to show us a piece of her tender yet vivid self that went through so much and placed herself on the place she still has the right for. But she's not sitting there enjoying fruits of her phenomenon, she reaches new peaks and fighta for the planer, fights for you and meFor as long as there's toxic tumour bulging underneath the ground, Björk and her art will be there to purify, purify, purify, purify toxicity.Warmth

3,5,Matriarchal Madness,torrascotia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been a Bjork fan since debut and now having seen her twice in concert, I was interested when the marketing email about this concert film arrived. It seemed like something brand new and suited to the bug screen. Although I did pause at the £18 ticket price. Within seconds of the start it was clear I had seen this before. As this is the same show which has been touring for five years. It said so in the opening credits.For anyone unfamiliar with this tour it apparently uses novel technology and instrumentation. However this doesn't make the experience any better. Some of the visuals are odd, some disgusting and others just plain weird. It was Aphex Twin who when asked about her music, gave the response ""some of it is just weird for weirds sake"". Coming from him that's a statement. What cements this idea is that the lyrics are there as subtitles throughout. And some of them make zero sense while others are just clumsy. Some laughs were heard during the screening. Another downside is the eco feminism which I could do without. I remember when the Greta Thunberg statement was played in Glasgow, and Glasgow let her know what they thought about it.Speaking of the eco message, just how eco friendly is a 5 year global tour? Or what about the computer power this show hinges upon?And for all of the technology on show, the highlight of the concert is actually the track she does acapella with a choir, where not just her song writing and performance shines through, but also her personality. Her stage mask slips and her interaction with choir is the most human aspect of the concert, when she simply says enthusiastically ""yes"". There isn't enough of this on show throughout and it can feel quite emotionally detached.As for the setlist, it's new track heavy. Which shows up the fact she peaked around post. The further you go from there the less accessible the music is. She is better working with producers, male producers who offer a balance between her weirdness and a mass audience.She makes much of ""male mistakes"" in relationships and family throughout the performance. I don't like female artists using their platform in this way as it comes across as one way bullying. The other side has no ability to respond. Its the musical equivalent of her attacking that journalist at the airport, with Bjork full on aggressive and the other side not responding. I have even read some reviewers claim they stopped listening to the album these tracks were on, because they found them uncomfortable listening. What is also strange are her performing tracks about no going back to the past traumas, but that is exactly what she does with her anti-ex songs.This show Cornucopia is certainly a mainly female mistake as its production is on her. It seems to ramp up the feminist angle up to 11 and misses the point that concerts are there to entertain an audience, not just be about ""artistic expression"" or shoehorning political ideas to people who just want to enjoy music. It will likely leave most watchers unsatisfied unless they are huge fans of the new material or simply like weird things because they think its somehow intellectual to do so. The political stuff will also alienate half the audience.I'm not a fan of the aesthetic of the show or even her costumes. I am not sure who is apart from her? For some reason she now obscures her face. Her main outfit looks like she's come second best in a punch up with a rack of wedding dresses. Another is an odd lattice structure she wears while saying something about building a matriarchal dome, which also serves to hide her form, which is quite a standoffish position to take when fans want to see her.My advice is to check the setlist before forking over the best part of £20, as it was a long 98 minutes of Bjork at her least accessible, most self indulgent and with too many flutes.",False
4,4,Old hat avant-garde,tread-12728,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGenerally speaking I like the music of Bjork; it has a certain signature to it that cannot be duplicated by others. The music of this show was rather subdued and less melodic than many of her other songs I have heard in the past. I get the impression also that she may have some body dysmorphia as her face and body were covered by costume most of the entire show. I'm used to seeing an eclectic and sort of haute couture costuming. This concert film seemed to follow that standard . Certainly the computer graphic generated images added a never before seen texture to the performance. If you're a big Bjork fan this is a do not miss. However, that said, I would not recommend this film. It's basic Bjork with computer graphics. Nothing special here, but that's my opinion yours may vary.",True
5,5,< In The Style Of PSYCHEDELIC & MEDIEVAL > >,paulscudder,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched> Wednesday, 7th May, 2025 @ The Backlot Cinema, Blackpool. Rated 3 * * * Good < Cert. Would be a 12A > Know the name Bjork, but not familiar with the music. After 1 hr 54 mins of the concert, I realised this is not my type of music at all. The show was extremely 'psychedelic' in style, going back to the 1960's/70's, with the amazing colours and shapes throughout, along with the different style of sounds, as the back drop, happening on the stage, quite theatrical, which goes back hundreds of years to the 'medieval times' in the court yard of the kings and queens, as the poor put on carnival style acts and dances. Back in the day of the 60's/70's, the hippies and college students would be crashing out to the sounds, the colours and animated shapes, as they smoked their weed and ate the magic mushrooms. The rating of GOOD or the 6 out of 10 is given for everything going on, but not for the singing, sadly. This is most certainly a Required Taste, and just for Bjork serious fans. Overall, it was very artistic. I am glad I didn't pay £18 or £20, and only had to pay next to nothing, as I am a triple AAA member at the Backlot Cinema, Blackpool, which costs only £16.99 per month, and for that you can see as many films as you want, including the expensive IMAX Screen, which you can pay up to £16. You also get 10% of food and drink, and 3 hours free parking. So, after two to three films or one IMAX in the month, all the rest is free. Of all my 54 years of going to the pictures, I have never ever had a deal as good as this one. Brilliant if you love going to the pictures like me, as I have seen 26 films in the month of April, first three came to the cost of the membership, and the other 23 films were FREE. What other cinema in the country does a deal as good as this. I am so lucky. It also helps to be retired, which allows you to go anytime, day or night. (ps)",False
6,5,Time to grow up.,h-maslon99,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mb that's a harsh thing to say. I'm
a creative and have always loved Bjork for her outlandishness and fantastic voice. And I don't like giving harsh reviews to artistic sensitive prior. But I was really disappointed. I guess I hadn't been paying enough attention. I'm
About 10 years older than her and being saved by love, and complete immersion in the senses- some of her main themes, are tired for me. She seemed childish and if as she sometimes implies she is caught in a loop I see why. So when she makes a plea for the world I say save yourself first. The impact, artistically was for me rather boring after a while. . She seemed to stay on the same level.the songs sounded too
Similar. After an hour I had to leave the theater.",False

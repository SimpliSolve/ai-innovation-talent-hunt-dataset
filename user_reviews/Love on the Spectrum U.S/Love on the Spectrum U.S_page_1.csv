1,9,It is unbelievable sweet...,hoboss2806,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like the original.It's decently portrayed without mocking or shaming anybody. And it's raising awareness for autism.It's so unbelievable sweet and heart-warming, it really soften your heart. And it's a reminder that you will never know the whole story of someone's behaviour.",False
2,8,A beautiful thing to see,jamiekressinger,n/a,15/08/2025,It's extremely heartwarming to see how people can be so caring towards others.I come away from watching this show thinking hoping the best for those involved as they truly deserve the best things it life.Great little watch.,False
3,9,"great watch, super insightful",soniaacacerees,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really, really wholesome and heartwarming. Loved the aus version, and the us version is just as good! It's been a while since I've seen some good non-toxic reality tv.",False
4,10,Rare treat,noveltylibrary,n/a,15/08/2025,Just as delightful as the previous version from Australia. Life affirming and lovely. I only wish I could be friends with them all! Only disappointment is that there aren't enough episodes. Please keep making this show!,False
5,10,Absolutely incredible!,olson-64848,n/a,15/08/2025,"Growing up with a mom who devoted her life to working with children on the spectrum I may be a bit biased, but this show is just incredible! To see these beautiful people searching for love is astounding. My mom always worked with very young kids who I rarely got to see grow up, sadly. This show is so pure and perfectly produced. Letting these amazing people find themselves and hope for love and a partner is just so heartwarming. I love this way this show gives us an inside to autism and people in the spectrum that we normally don't get to see. It's amazing how much you can identify with these people as a neurotypical. They want and fear the same things as everyone else, especially in dating. It's beautiful to see these people come out of their shells and face their fears. It actually gives me more confidence in my own life to see this show. I hope it never ends and we see more like this.",False
6,10,So refreshing!,atilajames-686-309540,n/a,15/08/2025,"No lies, nobody being fake to impress, just complete honesty. It was so refreshing to watch a dating show where there was no one making drama for the sake of drama. I was only disappointed at one point and that was when it was over. I wanted more.",False
7,10,Heartwarming,aliciageorges,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love how this show portrays austim as it truly is, a diverse spectrum. No two people on the spectrum are alike. There are a lot of stereotypes and ignorance out there and I feel this show along with the Australian version will help shed light on how truly unique each and everyone is on the spectrum.",False
8,10,Wonderful,chriscupo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't say enough good things about this series as well as the original show from Australia dealing with adults on the spectrum looking for love. The filmmakers treat all participants with respect and caring and we the audience become fully invested in their happiness. This series emphasizes that no matter what difficulties/disabilities a person has, we all have the right to love and be loved. Bravo Netflix!",False
9,10,The most lovely experience,matthewreid-95654,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an absolute lovely show. These people are so sweet, and their families are so supportive. I believe the producers handled this show with such care, it's truly a special experience. We binged the entire season and by face hurt from smiling for so long. To see a dating show void of the disgusting antics made popular in the 21st century is so refreshing. I loved the characters and was excited to see where each story went. 63-year old Steve's story was my favorite. Even after all these years, the need for love and companionship was still there. If you want to smile, laugh, cry and feel good, I honestly can't recommend this show enough. Truly lovely.",False
10,7,Who is playing matchmaker here?,nikmac12,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really enjoy this show, but whoever is matching these folks up is doing a poor job. In a season 2 episode, they match an extremely talkative gentleman, who expresses his desire to want to date another talkative person, with a woman with Down Syndrome who primarily communicates in single word monosyllabic answers to his questions. In a season 3 episode, they match a young lady who expresses her desire to want to date a man who enjoys traveling and going out to public places with a man who is extremely uncomfortable in noisy public places. The gentleman is so uncomfortable on their first date that he has to wear earbuds that play white noise in order to drown out the background noise. This makes for an extremely uncomfortable situation for the young lady who is desperately trying to hold a conversation with the man.I feel like the producers are basically picking names out of a hat for these people to go on dates with instead putting forth the effort and matching them up with potential partners who share the same interests. Are they being lazy or is it somehow supposed to be more entertaining to the viewing audience the more awkward the dates are?",False
11,10,Neurodiversity,edwin-wks,n/a,15/08/2025,"With so many great minds and inventors being neurodivergent, including Albert Einstein himself, it seems strange that neurodiversity, also known as the autism spectrum, remains largely misunderstood by the majority who are neurotypical. Many neurodivergent people go through life without being fully aware of their neurodiversity and some never reach diagnosis in their lifetime because autism was not well-understood and widely diagnosed in children until the 1990s.Love on the Spectrum brings much needed awareness to the difficulties faced by neurodivergent people in a neurotypical world and humanises them. With increasing visibility of sexual and gender diverse populations, it is time for greater understanding and acceptance of neurodiversity. Successful neurodivergent people like Jennifer Cook, who makes an appearance as the autism expert and whose book ""Autism in Heels"" I have read, are shining examples of what autistic people can achieve when they allowed to express their creativity and individuality in spite of the bounds of the neurotypical world.",False
12,1,"As an autistic person, I can clearly see this is inspiration p*** for neurotypicals.",imdbfan-11745,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's incredibly telling that any of the reviews that aren't fully positive (that seem to be written by people who either have autism or are actually familiar with it) are downvoted. This is not a show for autistics, nor is it means to represent us well. This is exploitation of autistics for the entertainment of neurotypicals. We are perfectly capable of dating normally without having to be paired with an intentionally awkward match to another autistic person. Speaking for myself, it is not difficult to have relationships with neurotypicals. This is insultingly exaggerated to reinforce stereotypes, and they rejected autistic people who auditioned for the show for being ""too high functioning,"" which is not even a term that should still be used. I have yet to see any autistic people that are okay with how exploitative this show is. And the crew did not intervene when a woman's boundaries were not respected and she was kissed again after saying she felt it was too soon. Not sure what the neurotypicals are finding heartwarming about this, but I assume if you feel this way, you should probably do some research.",False
13,10,Need more episodes!,parisajensen,n/a,15/08/2025,I'm so pissed there are only six episodes in this season there should be more! This is one of the best reality show so far. Pure and innocent people trying to find love.,False
14,10,The greatest show ive ever seen and I will tell you why,mkarnazes,n/a,15/08/2025,"I myself have been ignorant as a child and adult to the diffilcuties people in life that I dont share myself. This show really opens your eyes to the beauty we share as human beings wanting love and connection regardless of phsyical or mental differences we have as people. We all crave to be loved, embraced, cared for and wanted, this show really opened my eyes to understand that we all need to be more patient with one another as humans because we all have different backgrounds, experiences and cognitive abilities.This show has made me tear up more times then I will admit, lol, but its because of how beauitful it is to see people overcome challenges and love life so unconditonally. The people on this show and their families inspire me to have my own family one day and give them at least 1/10 of the love these parents show for their kids. If you have a heart you will love this show and smile and cry because its amazing to see the power of adversity and compassion can play in our world if we just try to understand each other more.",False
15,10,As good as it gets,speizer-59517,n/a,15/08/2025,"Heartwarming series which beautifully shows how much we all want to love and be loved as told through several lovable individuals on the spectrum. You root for everyone in the series to find love, some do while others keep trying. Each story is so well told. This is my favorite series on Netflix and I've enjoyed every season.",False
16,10,Speechless,Tarmo-37,n/a,15/08/2025,"The final episode of season 3 was the most beautiful and emotionally moving television experience I've ever had in my life.It was an intense roller coaster of emotions-from laughing along with them, to deeply feeling their anxiety, to shedding tears of happiness at their fulfillment.Every moment felt incredibly genuine and meaningful, the culmination of countless stories, struggles, and triumphs. To truly experience this full spectrum of emotions and stand firmly in their corner, one needs to have watched every season and every episode, building a deep connection and investment in their journey. All of this builds perfectly toward the masterpiece that is Season 3, Episode 7, leaving you with an overwhelming urge to embrace the entire world. It reminds you that there is hope-that pure, genuine, and beautiful love truly exists.",False
17,10,So sweet,primalrunner,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMy heart is overwhelmed, im love that this documentary is taking off , thanks Australia for starting it.I like the cast, it's a very good mix , like the original. I like how they integrate the family in the narrative.",True
18,10,As someone on the spectrum I find this show very inspiring,dexteriot,n/a,15/08/2025,"Both Australian and US shows are simply excellent. I love everything about them - music, directing, camera work etc but most importantly I love all the characters because I can relate to each and one of them. It's like in all of them I see bits and pieces of myself. I totally understand when they say they don't like certain sounds, smells or tactile sensations, I understand how anxiety is part of our everyday lives and how routine is super important. And despite all those ""limitations"" being able to find someone who likes you and who you like for who they are is simply beautiful. I'm so grateful these shows exist because they inspire me to look for love and give me hope that it is possible.",False
19,10,BEAUTIFUL,nicnerren,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show is amazing! I had a smile on my face the whole time! Such beautiful souls just wanting what all humans want, a true loving connection with someone! This taught me so much about autism! Such awesome people!!!",False
20,3,Insulting garbage,justanotherguyontheinternet,n/a,15/08/2025,"What I hate about this show, as well as many of the reviews, that this show continues to ""other"" people on the spectrum.This is a voyeuristic exercise, with the insulting premise that maybe these people deserve love too and they definitely need help from someone elseOf course they deserve love! And they do it without the help of condescending TV shows that exist to publicize their relationships and failings.And the condescending reviews of ""I love them all"" or ""I want to be friends with them"" are disgusting. Go out into your community and actually meet people on the spectrum, they won't bite.I can't wait until the sequel shows ""Love in a Wheelchair"" and ""Blind Love"", where we give those other poor disabled people a chance at love that they can't have without the help of those strong able bodied people. The only reason I give 3 stars is because the participants are just stuck here, but the show around the whole thing is repulsive.",False
21,10,I'm neurodivergent and loved this very much.,lauinia,n/a,15/08/2025,"So often, ASD is presented in film and TV as bluntness, or savantry. Sometimes both. It's such a lazy caricature.The participants who featured in Love on the Spectrum are a wonderful example of just how diverse the symptoms and implications of ASD can be. They also do a great job of highlighting how one person's 'simple act' that they take for granted, can often be a massive challenge for someone in a different situation.I loved hearing all of the different expressions of what love means and what the participants are looking for in a partner. There was so much hope and joy in this show that it's impossible not to be drawn into rooting for everyone!The production team did a great and respectful job that helped to retire tired old tropes and, in doing so, showed us that we have more in common than that which divides us. Bravo to all of you.",False
22,10,Wow!!!,emmybug26,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had seen this floating around Netflix but I wasn't sure if I'd like it so I ignored it for a while. But then I realized Abbey from TikTok was in it so I thought.. why not, I'll give it a shot. WOW. I mean, WOW!! This show is pure love. As someone who lives with disabilities, this show has completely warmed my heart. Every single episode makes me laugh,smile, cry, and feel so heartfelt. I want everyone of these people to be protected & find love & happiness. Some of the things they each talk about, (fears, struggles they had growing up), it all hits so close to home & I felt not to alone in life while I was watching! I'm halfway through season 2 & really hoping they come with more seasons. I watched all of this in a day and a half and I'm craving more. One day, I hope I'll find love & happiness!",False
23,10,Best Love on the Spectrum Yet!,gracechrista,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a wholesome cast, I'd love to see their stories continued in Season 2. It was so heartwarming and I loved them all! Finished Season 1 in one day!!",False
24,10,Pure joy,harmonyjb-99997,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was going through a massively crappy phase of my life when I watched this. I even tried looking into self help books etc. But I get bored easily with all that stuff. I was distracting myself from thinking too much and just looking for something light and entertaining to watch. I watched this and instantly had a new, joyful perspective on life. It truly warmed my soul and lifted my spirit.That's not to say it should be perceived as a counselling session.It's just pure and beautiful and no matter who you are or whether your life is fantastic or dire, the very least this series will do is bring an instant smile to your boatrace before you even realise.Just watch it.",False
25,10,So wholesome!!,mosleynikki,n/a,15/08/2025,This show rocks! I found myself smiling the whole time that I watched this. It's so pure and wholesome. I'm rooting for everyone on here. This show really opened my eyes on Autism.,False

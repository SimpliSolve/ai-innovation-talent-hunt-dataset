1,1,"Dull, distorted view for self interest.",jamesmcwhirty,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA dull story about Andy Swallow, a football hooligan who avoided jail on a technicality, formed a record label and emigrated. The Film doesnt show the true impact hooliganism had on the sport and the nation, meaning regular fans were deprived of watching games as England were banned in Europe. There is some sentimentality about only caring about each others opinions, not societies, and there love for the East End - by men keen to appear in a self publicising film, and the main character loving it all so much he emigrates. Irvine Welsh is in the film for no apparent reason than to offer a social commentary, though about what it isnt quite clear. If you want to know about hooliganism you will be dissapointed, if you have an interest in West Ham you will be dissapointed, if you want an understanding of the social and rave scene of the late 80s and 90s you will be dissapointed.",True
2,1,Cor blimey guvna!,mauler5-888-616739,n/a,15/08/2025,"No spoilers because there's not really much to tell.This is an EXTREMELY local dull and uninteresting tale about a West ham fan that thinks he's Tony Wilson. The anecdotes are boring, hyperbolic and you'd be bored if someone was telling you then down the pub.The movie is described as a story about the most interesting influencer you've never heard of. You aren't missing anything. The people in this are very small names in the music industry with a local radio station. How did this get made?I'm sure if you lived in this very small area of east London at this very small moment in time, then this is your trainspotting. But as someone who isn't I found this documentary really dull.",False
3,9,Authentic and relateable true rags to riches story,melaniereidgordon,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is definitely one for UK movie goers, our US friends might struggle a little with the accent - the Cockney is strong in this one! If you're a fan of movies like Cass, and Rise of the Foot Soldier, the first part of this documentary fills in a lot of blanks in an honest and authentic way. Amazing to hear these football firm legends discussing the old days, and I loved the conversational sets in the pub - Cass Pennant seems so much more laidback than the media has us imagine!In response to the previous review, I was not at all disappointed. This is the life story of Andy Swallow, founder of ICF and Centreforce 88.3 Radio - it's not meant to be a social commentary on football hooliganism, nor West Ham; nor even the rave scene - they are simply parts of the story. It's a story about working class folk, so I guess it's not for everyone; but being a Gen X from a UK council estate background myself, I found it really relatable and amusing in parts. An understanding of UK council estate/working class culture is probably essential to enjoy this documentary fully. To see someone come from 'nothing' to being one of the most influential names you never heard of in the UK music industry is inspiring and uplifting, and by the end I was clapping. Good for him, making it, and moving his family from the UK to an island paradise, who wouldn't?!! It's an incredible true rags to riches story, which by the end is essentially all about family and community. The title 'Underdog' fits perfectly.",True

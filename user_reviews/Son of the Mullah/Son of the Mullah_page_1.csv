1,10,Pretty much made me cry,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI am typically not one to get too emotional during films - I have seen a lot of them, and generally consider them from a more logical and artistic standpoint.This one, however, brought lots of emotions, and is ever dark and bleak.It is an expertly made documentary by the ever stellar Nahid Persson, investigating corruption, fanatism and how human lives are thrown aside callously.The idea of good people in the end being punished for standing up for their beliefs and helping others, truly saddening.The film is very nicely cut and edited, as always - very expertly paced. It maintains interest throughout and really gets you closer than you might expect from such a film.Highly recommended and ever important film!",True

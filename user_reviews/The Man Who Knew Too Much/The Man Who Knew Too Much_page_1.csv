1,5,"Missed opportunity. Fun story, but mediocre product.",JurijFedorov,n/a,16/08/2025,"The case is very interesting. I really feel for Colin Wallace and am angry about him having been framed. It's extremely unfair that the state threw him in prison for 6 years on a false murder conviction just to punish him for something he did against the state. They found a dead body as a man had been killed by a boat propeller. So they forced the investigators to conclude that a karate chop killed the guy and framed Colin Wallace. That's obviously an amazing story and would make for an excellent documentary. His propaganda projects against Ireland are also interesting as we see how they planted fake stories in the news about satanic rituals and other weird claims to make IRA look bad. These were the claims he spread that somehow backfired and put him in prison, but it's never explained who wanted him in prison or why.I had to say all that before reviewing the documentary because I don't want to be accused of hating the topic or ideology of the documentary. It's just not good. There is overly loud music over everything so you have to listen carefully to old people with heavy accents tell us technical details while the music is blasting. Obviously for someone from Ireland this can still work, but for outsiders this is just needlessly noisy and hard to understand. They also focus on talking heads just staring into the camera. Not really that exciting. They don't use 3D recreations of the murder scene or maps. Just talking heads. How did the murder happen? I frankly don't know. Was the guy responsible who admitted to the killing ever found guilty? They don't say. What about the wife and family to the victim? Did they sue the government? We don't know as they are not interviewed. Apparently the state claimed Colin Wallace karate chopped the guy to get rid of him to be with his wife. What happened to that story? What happened to the wife? Did the wife know Colin and think he did it? Has she giving interviews in the media? Did Colin hit on her afterwards? If he didn't then the story obviously is not true and they should have mentioned it.What a huge mess. You have a guy who has an important story to tell and you create this musical video where the murder is mentioned for the first time like 40 minutes into the documentary and then never even explained. I'm frankly offended on Colin's behalf. It still has a lot of interesting factoids and big claims. But it's just too noisy and unfocused to be a great intro to the topic. I don't even know how much of this is true because they never interview anyone from the other side. Usually I can spot liars in such documentaries or just understand both sides of the issue, but since they didn't give them a single interview I don't know how much of this is rumors and how much are facts. I'd like to know more about the guy who confessed to the killing, but we don't even learn his name I think?",False

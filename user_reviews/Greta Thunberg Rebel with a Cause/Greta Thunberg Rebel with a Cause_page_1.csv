1,6,An Adequate Doc About Greta,DavoZed,n/a,16/08/2025,This is an adequate documentary about Greta and her work and certainly doesn't deserve the 2.1 rating it has at the moment. Always fascinating to see adult males who are threatened by a teenage girl and deal with that by slagging things about that girl.It's disappointing that the narrator here mispronounces Greta's last name every single time she says it. Surely it should have been possible to get the correct pronunciation of her name and get the person narrating to say it correctly.A better / far better doc about Greta is I Am Greta.,False

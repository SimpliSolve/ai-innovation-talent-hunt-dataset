1,9,Wonderful journey,Jimmc2990,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a Led Zeppelin fan for the past five decades, this was an amazing trip, hearing all the stories of how four incredible artists happened upon each other to make rock history.With genuine and thoughtful interviews from the survivors of the band and a really sweet and funny interview from the late John Bonham, (a happy voice from the past) this exciting and well crafted doc had wonderful historical footage and photos showing us how Led Zeppelin became Led Zeppelin.If you can see it in IMAX, it's amazing. Some of the live footage is absolutely fantastic and the sound quality is remarkable.Overall, this was a really fun ride down memory lane. I just wish I were 10 years older so that I had had a chance to see Zep before John passed.Definitely a must see for any Led Zeppelin fan!",False
2,9,It will get LOUD.,johndbaileyjr,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFor serious fans of Led Zeppelin, the rare live audio alone makes this two hours of pure bliss. The archived footage is also a treat, and you can tell even Page, Plant & JPJ enjoyed watching it. What really separated this doc from all the unauthorized versions was not just the interviews with the actual band, but the amount of time dedicated to John Bonham. You could particularly see the emotion of all three of the surviving members listening to him, and the documentary revealed a side to Bonzo that had never been brought to light before in addition to showcasing his unmatched talent.For everyone complaining that they stopped at 1970, the title of the film is BECOMING Led Zeppelin. It wasn't intended to cover the entirety of their run. However, with that being typed, I don't think anyone would object to a sequel. There is still so much left to be told. I hope the film is a success and we get another one...not sure Plant would agree, but one can dream I suppose...",True
3,8,Good Times. Bad times?,southdavid,n/a,15/08/2025,"2025 has been the year of musical biopics so far, though this film about the early years of Led Zeppelin is a documentary / concert film, unlike any of those.Looking to break away from his comfortable life as a session guitarist, Jimmy Page established his own band, bringing in fellow session player John Paul Jones as well as two prodigious talents from the West Midlands in Robert Plant and John Bonham. Their chemistry is immediate and they head to American to tour on preexisting contracts for Page's former band The Yardbirds. Their first album is a commercial success, though not well reviewed. They resolve to come again with everything they have for their second album.The documentary has the full co-operation from the three surviving members of the band who all appear in talking head style interviews, explaining their story themselves. This is intercut with footage from various different sources showing the band performing, or home videos. There is also inserts from an Interview with John Bonham, that never aired anywhere previously, but cover his early life, and time spent with Plant before the band came together. It's quite emotional when they play the interview to the rest of the band, particularly a section when he talks about how he feels about his bandmates. It's a very well researched documentary, though does only get the bands opinions on what's going on, with none of the supporting characters offering any thoughts.It's a criticism that you see in all the reviews, but it is valid. Ending where they do, with the release of Zeppelin 2, does mean that they can avoid all of the contentious topics that a full documentary would cover. So, there's no spiralling into heroin use, no talk of what they may have gotten up to with groupies and there's no actual discussion of Bonham's death, even how they feel about it. Maybe with the trust that Bernard MacMahon has established with them, they could come back and do a follow up ""The End of Led Zeppelin"".If you don't have any interest in the band it's perhaps unlikely to change your opinion, but I enjoyed it.",False
4,10,(Huge Led Zeppelin Fan) - 10/10! I want a part 2 :(,alexbeachboard,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved it. The second album was always my favorite, and I'm glad they went into depth on all the songs. Ramble On & What Is And What Should Never Be got the love they deserved.I wasn't alive to get to see them perform (I'm 18 ðŸ˜­) but in the middle of high school I discovered all of their music and fell in love with them. This movie gave me everything I wanted, and there was a lot I didn't even know about. I as I stated before, I really hope they make a 2nd part, just because I want to see them go into Physical Graffiti.Anyways I wanted to write a review to support the movie and tell you all to go watch, you won't be disappointed! I'm sure it's the closest you can get to being in one of their concerts.",False
5,8,A WHOLE LOTTA NOSTALGIA,Always_Loved_A_Film,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went to the cinema to see 'Becoming Led Zeppelin' with my brother and saw it in IMAX. Didn't really know what to expect but I found the experience thoroughly enjoyable. I'm very familiar with their music catalogue and was a bit of a hippy myself in my teens, though post Led Zeppelin in the late 70's and early 80's, so I never saw them live (although I did go to a cinema 'all nighter that included 'The Song Remains the Same' movie!). I don't listen to them much these days but it was great to revisit their first two albums, hear their amazing music again and see the rare footage and listen to them talking nostalgically about those exciting formative days.One of the things the documentary impressed on me was how stripped down those early performances were. There is hardly any lighting, the stages are often the size of a postage stamp and some the audiences on their first US tour were really tough (check out the kids putting their fingers in their ears - hilarious). This gave me a real appreciation for their dedication to the music as they give it 100% regardless.So, I know there's been a lot of water under the bridge, and even though Robert, Jimmy and John Paul (and even John posthumously) are interviewed separately for this documentary there's a whole lotta love for the halcyon days of energy and creativity of the sixties. The documentary brings the era alive with some well chosen news reel footage and even rare footage of the band members playing pre-Zeppelin. In regard to this - a special moment is when they are reacting to video footage that they had not seen before - priceless.On the picky side there is plenty of 'lick and stick' editing going on - you know, putting clips together with music from a different recording and making a less than convincing hash of it - but its a forgivable conceit really (for fans) and worth overlooking to make the most of all the archive material.All in all we had a great night out at the cinema and I can say with some confidence that if you were ever a fan of the first two Zeppelin albums your gonna love this trip down memory lane - it's a whole lotta rock n roll nostalgia.",False
6,7,Becoming Led Zeppelin,CinemaSerf,n/a,15/08/2025,"I grew up in an home where folk music reigned, and a bit like with those folks at the Newport Folk Festival who recoiled in disgust at Bob Dylan's shift from acoustic to electric, my parents wouldn't give this band house room in their collection. Therefore, save for the odd rendition of ""Whole Lotta Love"" or ""Stairway to Heaven"" I knew precious little about this band when I watched this documentary. It starts by introducing us to each of the members, and rather poignantly uses an interview with the late John Bonham as all four take us through their own musical influences before they met and make musical history. There's some serious archive research gone into this film providing an astonishing array of material from not just those who inspired these men but of some of their own early appearances. There's an especially enjoyable scene from London's Roundhouse theatre where, already having had success in the USA, they perform to a bemused collection of Londoners - some with their fingers in their ears! I didn't love all of their music, and as one journalists quoted here declared - they can be a bit self indulgent. So what, though? That old adage about serving others best when you serve yourself springs to mind. If you can't enjoy making music your own way, you can't expect others to enjoy listening to it - and that search for a musical style that resonates with an audience is clearly important to these blokes. Interestingly, after fifty-odd years, they still appear to respect each other and look back fondly not just on their days touring and making music, but also display a touching affection for their lamented drummer who's comments elicit a genuine emotion from Messrs Plant, Page and Jones. It features very little by way of noises-off comments, instead focussing on the band's own insightful narration as well as plenty of actuality material - including some long form performances from their gigs up until the release of ""Led Zeppelin II"" where our history rather abruptly concludes. These are three erudite and engaging men who who have clearly lived life's ups and downs fully and energetically, and emerged remarkably sanely out the other side of a music industry that they refused to be consumed by. There music won't be to everyone's taste, but as a history of an industry, a band and a genre-busting style of rock this is an easy film to absorb for two hours.",False
7,10,Superb,Denno1972,n/a,15/08/2025,"I did chuckle to myself watching this when the band talk about the bad reviews they received from the music press but how the fans ignored it anyway and through word of mouth the band became bigger and bigger with much adulation. Seeing the media reviews of this film against the fan reviews it seems nothing has changed in over 50 years.But here's the thing. This is clearly made by a fan, for the fans. It's not for casual rock fans. It's almost 2 and a half hours covering only two years of the band (with the birth of the band covering the first hour or so) and it's power is in the build up, the interviews (only with the band and not the usual snippets from the cleaner and famous fans we've hardly heard of, which is the usual fare for these type of documentaries), the wonderful Bonzo audio and the phenomenal performances, some of which the band hadn't even seen. I can't wait for the inevitable (I hope) follow up. It's all I could of wished for when I first heard they were doing this, and more.",False
8,7,What Should and What Should Have Been,john-bachak,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIm a Led Zeppelin fanatic. I have all the albums, DVDs, numerous t shirts, a Sunburst Les Paul, various books and magazines. So I was very much looking forward to this film.The documentary centres around the formation of the band in its early years. Their individual stories, personalities and musical influences are laid out for us succinctly. Leading to each of the members meeting for the first time and discovering their primal rock energy and synergy as a band. Their massive American tour to the culmination of their second album and their eventual recognition in their home country.There is some great new footage that has been restored & remastered. There is some great rare photos scattered throughout that put us in the era. However any hardcore Led Zeppelin fan has seen such footage on their Live dvd release and other media. It's a shame that the documentary relies mostly on the studio versions of the songs that we have heard millions of times rather than take the opportunity to surprise us with a Live, bootleg or demo version that we haven't heard. Furthermore footage from a Communication Breakdown video is used repeatedly in the background for various other songs which is a bit jarring.Led Zeppelin was a band renowned for their Live shows and magnetic presence. The live footage reminds you of how powerful Bonham was on the drums, the golden demigod Plant with his soaring vocals, the melodic timing of JPJ on bass, the crunching riffs and virtuoso lightning that Jimmy Page brought to the guitar. The live versions of How Many More Times, Communication Breakdown, Dazed and Confused demonstrates why they were a rock phenomenon. Surprisingly for a band that toured so much, there is little official footage of the band. But the world is plentiful of Led Zeppelin bootleg live audio and video out there. The directors should have leaned into that more.It was great to see the surviving 3 members, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones be so informative, funny, charming and witty during their interview parts of this documentary. There is even newly found interview from John Bonham who rarely gave interviews. It was particularly touching to see each surviving member react to the sound of Bonham's voice as he spoke about each of them and the band as a whole. Robert looked particularly on the verge of holding back the tears.I would have liked for the documentary to gone a bit further exploring up to album IV when they were at the very height of their powers and rock debauchery at Madison Square Garden concerts having conquered America and toppled the Beatles. I doubt they would want to explore the painful moments post Physical Graffiti era for the documentary. Led Zeppelin's history has always been a sore point for Robert particularly, suffered a car accident, his young son passing away and then losing his friend in John Bonham.Supposedly the originally cut of Becoming Led Zepplein was 4 hrs, so hopefully we get to see that version on streaming or Blu ray/dvd. I'm glad this film exists and plays on your nostalgia, even if you were not even around when the band were performing, like myself. I'm keen for anything new from Led Zeppelin. But the film really leaves me slightly unsatisfied.",True
9,9,Whole Lotta Zeppelin,escapedj-20471,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thoroughly enjoyed Becoming Led Zeppelin. Keep in mind this is about how the band rose to fame quickly, the old-fashioned way by touring relentlessly. No Internet, just word-of-mouth, kind DJs and radio play. What they achieved the old-fashioned way in less than 15 months was simply amazing. The film reveals how four people who virtually never played together discovered a magic within themselves and the vision Jimmy page had for their future. Never before seen footage and audio clips were awesome. Keep in mind this documentaries about the bands rise to store them early in their Career. Try to see in an IMAX theater or equivalent.",False
10,7,Starts Off Great But Then Slowly Fizzles,briled-37531,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jimmy page has always been something of a (rightful) control freak when it comes to his 'baby', Led Zeppelin; and while their 12 year output is largely untarnished, there have been a few missteps following the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980, like the ill-fated Live Aid reunion in 1985, so it's no surprise he, along with Plant and Jones, were initially a little tentative about a proposed 'official' documentary.On one hand, 'Becoming Led Zeppelin' does live up to its title. This is not a band chronology, but the how and why of it all coming together, from their post-war childhoods to becoming infatuated with American blues, r&b, jazz, and rock music as teenagers. While it doesn't touch on every single influence, there is enough of an overview to get the cultural picture. All three surviving members provide an adequate narrative through new interviews. Although it's Page who is the most lucid and engaged, Plant and Jones are also informative, witty and affable.Of course, the music does speak for itself, and is given plenty of screen time to do that, presenting live clips of complete songs with original audio. It would be easy to complain that most of these clips were released in 2003 on the 'Led Zeppelin Live' DVD, but they definitely benefit from the Imax treatment. One nice surprise, though, was the inclusion of unreleased footage from the Fillmore West, San Francisco in 1969, among others.It all seems to add up to an engaging cohesive story, that is, until the director gets a case of montage fever and decides to recycle clips and songs we've already seen, in a ham-fisted way more than a few times, which just comes off as filler, and really cheapens the overall tone of the film.So, does this film actually do justice to the mighty Zeppelin? It does accomplish its objective in cohesively covering the early years, and keeps us engaged with interviews, unseen clips and photos, but somehow manages to stray without a satisfactory conclusion. Still, I'm glad it exists, but could use a re-edit.",False
11,9,Thank You,rocman-17007,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is well made with incredible restorations of old Zeppelin shows, and completed with a rare voice from the grave supplied by John Bonham. The documentary focuses on the early years of the band, ending with their live show at Royal Albert Hall in 1970. Hopefully the documentary gets enough support for a second to be created. Another film telling the rest of the story would be thoroughly enjoyable. The documentary goes over the members and their respective musical influences and beginnings, as well as a complete story on how Led Zeppelin rose to fame, and how it changed their lives.",True
12,n/a,Great Rockumentary. Smart and sharply produced. Rock Feels NEW.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an excellent music biography. The history of Led Zeppelin feels historic and extremely well-planned. I did not realize the role of Jimmy Page. As with most bands, we focus on the lead singer (Robert Plant), but the doc makes it clear this was mostly Jimmy Page. John Paul Jones is also incredibly smart, witty, and grounded. What a gem. The interviews are spectacular. The ""found"" tapes of John Bonham are pretty cool too. The great videos and restorations make it feel ""NEW"" despite being 50 years old. The heavy Yardbirds influence and role is interesting. Two missteps. 1) Despite really focusing on LZ coming from the Yardbirds, we learn nothing about the other Yardbird members and their music. It's all about their breakup. What a miss! 2) The final 40 minutes of the film are too slow and bloated. Folks in my row at the theater fell asleep. (Granted, the average age at show is 50-70). But, they dragged out too much live long tracks at the end. Make that a directors cut and keep the film crisper. But overall GREAT.",False
13,7,Exciting Little Documentary Only Covers Up To Zeppelin II. But Bonham Coverage Is Treasure.,MichaelFab,n/a,15/08/2025,"I expected a little more, like the complete career of Led Zeppelin. But it is entertaining and worth seeing if you grew up listening to great rock music. Instead of seeing the full progression of the band through the 1970's, the film shows pre-formation of the four guys from childhood and their first performances. Most of the live footage uses studio recordings over it, but there is a lot to enjoy in this remarkable period of rock music.By age 19, we see Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones had become solid, working session musicians in London's top recording studios.Most interesting is rare film of Jones' early sessions. In a short time, he is a full-time working bassist. He could have stayed in that profession and recalls contemplating leaving solid employment to join these guys.It has rare footage of one of the greatest rock drummers, John Bonham, up close. While they are recording their 1969 debut album, a camera is filming them in the studio, right over John's head. We come right up close to him as he lays down his massive kick drum beats.Even Bonham's sound-check on-stage was a performance, attracting everyone working at the venue.Robert Plant discusses disapproval of his parents of him giving up on college to be a singer, how he lived in poverty before he met Page. But when he sang, he had such a powerful voice and knew how to use it like an instrument.We hear John Bonham talk about his experience through recorded audio.Jones mentions another fact: Page and Peter Grant financed and produced Zeppelin's first album. They didn't need to pay producers and record executives, giving the band total control over their albums.Their business skills led them to start up their own label, Swan Song, although the film doesn't cover that.Page discusses his sound effects on ""Whole Lotta Love"" using electric guitar and amplifier feedback with engineer Eddie Kramer. Unfortunately, the film ends there, before their 3rd album.It is an enjoyable film with rare footage, just not comprehensive.",False
14,5,Lacked the Earth-Shattering Raw Energy of Zeppelin's Music,AmericanFemale-99JM,n/a,15/08/2025,"When this showed up on Netflix, we clicked on it right away. Since it's ""been a long time, been a long time"" since we rocked out to Led Zeppelin (sorry, had to be a geek there!), we thought ""hell yeah!"". As others have said, though, this is not a complete biographical rockumentary about Led Zeppelin but a focus on what influenced them and what lead up to the four musicians becoming the band we all know. Kind of like that ""what you haven't heard"" approach.This is for super hard core music junkies. I feel like there have been more of these movies lately that get into the minutiae of a subject picking a specific area to focus in on, meant for a certain subset of viewers rather than the full and complete experience. And that's cool that these things exist. They actually had a lot of interesting unknown facts about the band. But from a documentary standpoint, it was hard to follow.I think they needed a narrator to tie the whole thing together. Seriously, don't have rock stars narrate their own story! Interview them, then have someone walk you through. Also, was there an author they could have interviewed who wrote about the band? Journalists? They did a great job with a compilation of videos and images. But the way they put the soundtrack to the images had too much of an AV club quality (sorry, don't mean to be a B, but that's what I thought of! And I love documentaries, biopics, etc and watch a lot. But this wasn't as tight as it could have been).They could have done more as far as the soundtrack. This is LED-FREAKIN-ZEPPELIN!! I was set to rock out to the sultry syncopated funkness of their many, many amazing tracks. A bit of a bait and switch in that way. Their music wasn't used in the way I had envisioned it would be. Maybe it's that this is for the Led Zeppelin aficionado and I am more of a biography/documentary aficionado who happens to like Zeppelin so it was a wire-crossing on my part. Netflix is more of a general audience market, we aren't perusing book shelves here, drilling down topics to greater specificity, (tighter future algorithms will probably get us there). I do know someone who probably will love this approach so I'll recommend it to him. It was made for IMAX, it seems, so this could be an issue with the experience. You know what, I actually almost found it just as satisfying reading other users reviews about how much they love this band, their favorite songs, where they were when they first heard their favorite song. A great band does that and elicits that kind of reminiscence and story swapping. So that unintended effect is cool. But Led Zeppelin is an experience. They're deserving of a documentary that tries harder to emulate that experience.(Ok and just an addendum here, but when you scroll down the page on the parent guide for this movie, it says ""sex and nudity: none, profanity: none, alcohol, drugs and smoking: mild."" LMAO! Is this or is this not about a classic rock band?)",False
15,10,An Engrossing Immersion in Music & Musicians,tom-26466-23649,n/a,15/08/2025,"The ""Way Back Machine"" takes us to Jimmy Page's skiffle performance as a kid on English TV, Plant's early bands, Bonzo with Tim Rose (making good money), Jones doing fabulous arrangements & initially working with his musician parents. YARDBIRDS are central to my view of music & Glimpses sounded fabulous along with Dazed & Confused (I think); original lead guitarist Top Topham was asked to join Zep but that's not generally known & wasn't in this flick. You'll probably want to see this in an IMAX facility since ours had fabulous sound.Generally recent interviews with band members make up about 20% of this.So, the 4 guys click immediately & are excited. The Yardbirds still have concert commitments but all but Page are simply worn out. Page takes the new ""Yardbirds lineup"" on the road to play these last gigs as the New Yardbirds. There are super video clips of early performances. The very early USA show in Denver opening for Vanilla Fudge is mentioned but the drama there could have been discussed: The Fudge knew Page from Yardbird days & gave up some of their fee to pay Zep a tiny fee to play & the next morning Denver radio stations were inundated with calls asking WHO THE HELL OPENED FOR THE FUDGE LAST NIGHT???More relevant Yardbird notes/suggested listening: No Excess Baggage (Jones on BOSS bass), How Many More Times (played in the middle of Smokestack Lightning - Last Raveup in LA), Think About It (pieces parts of a lot of Zep & HOT), Knowing That I'm Losing You (Zep's Tangerine with fab guitar tone), White Summer (in this movie & sister piece to Black Mountainside), ""violin"" bow, Spanish Blood.",False
16,9,Fantastic Documentary for Led Zep fans,philvallade1,n/a,15/08/2025,"A brilliant and insightful documentary, saw it at the Olympic Studios cinema; watching footage in the actual room they recorded Led Zeppelin I was fantastic, (In Dolby Atmos too it's was LOUD!) Their love of their craft shone through and the archive footage is phenomenal, the editing and montage sequences have painstakingly been put together and gave a real sense of a place and time, the raw live performances also hit hard and showed what fantastic musicians they were individually and as group, the candid interviews and audio clips of John Bonham were really powerful, just wish they'd make one for the next stage of their career.",False
17,7,"Covering Led Zeppelin August, 1968 to January, 1970",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Becoming Led Zeppelin"" (2025 release from the UK; 121 min.) opens, Jimmy Page reflects on life in Great Britain post-WWII, and how he got into music at a young age (we see a 1958 BBC clip of a band featuring the 14 yo Page). Robert plant reflects how mesmerized he was with Little Richard, and America in general. John Paul Jones reflects how his upbringing with his parents, vaudeville performers, influenced. Then we get a never before hear John Bonham audio clip about the early days. At this point we are 10-15 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is directed by UK director Bernard MacMahon (related to Peter Grant, Led Zel's longtime band manager). As the documentary's title indicates, this focuses on how the 4 band members found their way in the music business, what music influenced them, and how they ended up together in Led Zeppelin. Led Zeppelin formed in August, 1968 and this documentary covers roughly the initial 18 months, up through their legendary Royal Albert Hall show in London on January 9, 1070. In other words, this covers not a minute past Led Zeppelin II. I have to say that initially I was apprehensive of this documentary, as it was made with the full cooperation of the 3 surviving band members. But then I found out that this covers strictly the earliest period of the band, and focusing only on the music. The reason for seeing this is primarily the rare concert footage that it includes, including the Fall, 1968 shows at Teen Club in Denmark and at the Roundhouse in London. A live clip of an early ""Dazed and Confused"" is equally a mist-see.""Becoming Led Zeppelin"" opened in theaters last week. The Sunday early evening screening I saw this at today was attended so-so (I counted about 15 people). I grew up as a Led Zeppelin fan in the 1970s (and saw them live in Brussels, Belgium in 1980, just months before Bonham passed away). Their music has been played to death by all the classic rock stations, and I rarely listen to them anymore. But this documentary thankfully focuses on their earliest works. If you are a Led Zeppelin fan, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
18,8,"It's Called ""Becoming....."" for a Reason",jimalba-87887,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPeople seem to be upset that this film does not cover the entire history of the band and only addresses the early years and to that I say it's called ""Becoming Led Zeppelin"" for a reason, it details the earliest years of the band members and shows how the band was formed, how those members became Led Zeppelin. There is nothing wrong with this aspect of the film, even though many of us would like to see the entire history of the band documented on film and who knows? Maybe that film will be coming someday.I really liked this documentary, it was great to see the guys discuss their childhoods, families, and how they became musicians. I never knew Jimmy Page was such a prodigy at a young age, but I can sure see why- the man is a genius.I think my favorite part of the film is watching the faces of each member when the footage of John Bonham speaking is played. Robert looks like he might cry, Jimmy looks delighted to hear the voice of his long lost friend, and JPJ is stoic, but moved- just as a bass player would be.The film plays a handful of songs in their entirety and it's great to hear those songs, but for anyone who is in a hurry (I watched it on a plane) you can forward through some of the songs and it will probably take you an hour to watch this.All in all, I'm not disappointed, but it was different than I expected.

Does anybody ever check and maybe normalize the amplitude of productions like this? I can listen to ""Good Times Bad Times"" at any volume I want, any time. Maybe it would have been more important HERE to have heard what the people involved had to say. Absolutely ridiculous, and it ruins an otherwise fascinating story.

As someone who does understand what Zeppelin means to music I enjoyed listening to the band explain what it was like to... Become Led Zeppelin. It was an interesting story. I especially liked the band's respect for what came before them. Where I come from it is a running joke about how Led Zeppelin stole black music, but thinking about it in the eyes of someone living in 2025, I see a group of Brits living at a time when the American Dream was still alive and they herd it though African American music. It's just a respect for music that I don't see anymore. An Excellent band with an Excellent Rock and Roll story.",False

My bad.IMHO it was like extended ""60 minutes"" episode, very underwhelming and, at times simply disappointing as it only gives us sanitized story of the band. The film gives us only yarns of now 70+ band members and some concert and production footage. The ""Sex & Drugs & Rock'n'Roll"" component is entirely missing, us the old guys, now knighted and noble, don't want to go there.BTW, sound is a bit lazily produced, volume fluctuations and inaccurate fadeouts are a bit distracting.Finally - despite all that, it's compulsory viewing for ""Led Zeppelin"" faithfulls, me being one of them.",False

To be honest some documentary films bore me, too much waffle and not enough action. This is very different. As the title says it's the becoming of, so the formation & what came before, and what came before is fascinating. Quite where they dug up the archive footage from is beyond me, but some of it is amazing quality. Watching the three surviving members talk about their stories is very revealing but watching them listening to John Bonham's tales is even more so. It becomes clear that this was a perfect collaboration waiting to happen. It does also show how fantastic it would be to see a Zeppelin concert at the cinema - I so hope it happens.This is an amazing film, so if you want to find out more about the very early days, do yourself a favour and go see it!",False
23,7,A Small Taste of the Live Experience,weinstockdanny,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was exactly what I expected and wanted it to be. It was fun, it was rockin', I learned some facts I had never known before, and there was previously unreleased footage and audio. I was particularly pleased by the multiple full length audio and visual recordings of live performances. This turned the documentary from a film into an experience, as advertised. By my recollection, there is more music than talking.I don't know how this documentary will stand up over time and outside of IMAX, but if you like live music, Zeppelin, even remotely, going to see this in IMAX is a fun time and well worth it. My theater was packed and the crowd was engaged; clapping along, cheering at the end of songs, reliving old times. This is a fun couple hours!If any of that does not sound good, do not spend the IMAX price to go see it you will likely be disappointed.",False
24,4,"Very dull, expected way more",edfox-44818,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMaybe one of the dullest rock documentaries I've ever seen. A lot of talking about not very interesting things, and then they just play almost entire songs through most of it. It just never gets going. There are a few new shots of the band and backstage video but nothing new will be learned here about the music or the band. No interviews from the early days, no contemporary commentary, no interviews with other musicians and their take on the band. If you are a die hard Led Zep fan you will be as bored as I was, if you don't know the band you may enjoy it but even then it does not tell you much.",True
25,10,We're not a singles band,silas123,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was a freshman in high school when John Bonham died in 1980. It was around this time that I went from a casual listener to a slightly obsessed fan intent on buying all their albums. While my listening tastes have gone in many different directions since high school, I've never lost my love for the band. And why is that when so many of the other bands from this era have lost lost their luster for me? Well, it's all right here: traditional blues, folk and what gets lost in their ""hard rock"" categorization, the tremendous r&b funk from the rhythm section. Some reviewers have expressed disappointment with the documentary's limited time span (ending with the release of Zep II), I had exactly the opposite reaction. For one thing, I love deep dives and archival footage so getting Page, Plant and Jones talking about their formative years and early start in the music business was amazing. Second, what other band or artist would have the audacity to have their first authorized documentary be ""Becoming ...""? No one. Anyone else would have given you the whole thing at once. But then again, as the documentary points out, Page knew enough to not make a demo for Zeppelin I, instead self financing the finished product and telling record companies, take it or leave it. Likewise, in 1968/69, who was going to say, we don't release singles, albums only. So, in-other-words, I had to laugh at their continued brashness, here are the first 2 years leaving out the stratospheric successes of the 1970s. MacMahon's idea/execution and the band's approval really felt apropos. That, and how amazing to see both the live footage as well as recent interviews with all 3 surviving members so articulate while lending real insight and not just typical rock n roll swagger - I loved it!",False

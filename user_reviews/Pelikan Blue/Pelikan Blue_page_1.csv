2,10,A Nostalgic Ride Through '90s Hungary,batyuatesz,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerKék Pelikan is one of the most original and heartfelt Hungarian films I've seen in years. Directed by László Csáki, this animated docufiction takes us back to the chaotic yet exciting 1990s in post-socialist Hungary, a time when the borders had just opened, and freedom felt like something tangible... even if you needed to fake a train ticket to get to it.The story follows three friends who discover a way to forge international train tickets using carbon paper and ingenuity. What begins as a small trick quickly turns into a larger journey, not just through Europe, but through identity, risk, and rebellion.The film is based on real interviews collected over many years, and it shows. The characters feel authentic, the situations relatable, and the moral ambiguity refreshingly honest. The blend of animation with live-action inserts (like scenes of money counting or vintage footage) creates a unique rhythm that draws you in both visually and emotionally.The strongest aspect for me was the atmosphere. The music, the objects, the grainy textures: all perfectly capture the aesthetic of 1990s Eastern Europe. And in a beautiful final touch, we even learn what happened to the main characters after the story ends.Verdict:
A touching, creative and highly nostalgic gem. If you grew up in the '90s, or want to understand that strange and wonderful transitional decade, Kék Pelikan is an absolute must-watch.",True

1,10,One of the most important films I've seen in years.,timjoanne,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching this movie last night, I feel like I have a new mission, which is to get as many people as possible to see this movie. That's a hard ask because between the Anglicized title of a Japanese word, Omoiyari, which loosely means feeling compassion for others, and the fact that it's a documentary, I worry that it may not get the audience it deserves.K, as the central figure, an accomplished musician set out to tell the story of the dark period of American history, the Japanese internment during World War II. But it turns into something much more broader and beautiful than that. It talks about the difficulty of maintaining two identities in this country and what one loses, when one assimilates. Given that so much of our country is within one or two generations of coming from elsewhere, this is a theme that will resonate with almost everyone.The music, the visuals, and the way the story is knitted together are extraordinary, showcasing not only the creative wonders of Kishi Bashi, but tying that poignant music to a story of history and personal identity.In a few days, this will be available in Paramount+ and gather your family and watch it together. I promise, based on the in person audience and the tears that were shed that you will be moved. While the history is brutal, the promise brought around by Omoiyari, is hopeful, and needed in a time where our country is so divided.",False
2,6,"""They just grabbed all of us""",evening1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAfter Pearl Harbor, came Heart Mountain.The forced internment of 120,000 Japanese Americans -- ""viewed as the enemy"" -- transpired in such remote locales as the barley field-surrounded Wyoming butte.Japanese-American violinist Kishi Bashi takes a trip out West to explore this shadowy chapter of our history, promulgated by FDR after the infamous attack of Dec. 7, 1941.Kishi presents interesting research, illustrating his tale with original music. He shines while performing on his own, or with others -- most stunningly with a Taiko drum line.The documentary falters toward its conclusion, when Kishi compares the unfairly interned Japanese Americans with latter-day migrants detained by ICE on the US southern border.I caught this film at the annual convention of the American Psychological Association in Seattle, and I'm glad I did. Its subject deserves more attention.",True
3,n/a,SO TIMELY! SO NEEDED!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a firm believer that our stories connect us! This was a beautifully told story of thousands of American citizens and their families who were wrongfully incarcerated for years, robbed of their properties and businesses that they had worked so hard to create and build, held in brutal conditions. They went peacefully. They endured and they came out determined to rebuild and not fight back for the injustices done to them. This is especially meaningful to me. My mother is of Japanese Hawaiian Chinese ancestry and was a child when Pearl Harbor was bombed. I am heartbroken and so upset to see our nation turning against ""immigrants"" again, forgetting that we are ALL descendants of immigrants in this land! I am grateful for all who peacefully resist and let their lights shine for others to be guided by! Light will always dispel darkness. Love is always greater than hate.",False

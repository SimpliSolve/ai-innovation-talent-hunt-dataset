1,10,Respect,urbanswami,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Goruck team set out to help civilians understand members of the military. Well, they succeeded. They've been organizing endurance events for years worldwide. This documentary just serves to reach a bigger audience and raise awareness. It's very educational. Though the Selection event is just a watered down version of the actual process that people looking to serve have to experience just to start their military careers, it's still brutal. It takes courage just to show up, and an insane level of determination to get through it. The cadres' cruel behavior during the event is just a training tool, they're compassionate and deeply appreciative of others. As a final lesson, you learn, that the grand prize for getting through the finish line is a cold beer, a pat on the back and comradery. To the participants, that's worth the ordeal. Watching this documentary, you get a sense of the type of people that serve and of the personal growth they go through by doing so.",False
2,5,Paying to be tortured by a backpack company,knbx-71521,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Standard is 1 hour and 32 minutes of watching gym bro civilians grunt and squirm in a Florida swamp while being yelled at. These people have paid to get yelled at military style by the veteran owners and operators of company that makes really nice backpacks.They're not contractually obligated. They haven't sworn an oath to defend their country. There's no war. They're in an office parking lot, a beach, and then a park and they're getting yelled at... and they paid money to be there.Guys who used to be in the military but now make fancy backpacks scream at them, and tell them to do random exercises while talking smack and throwing dirt at them until they quit. They yell helpful and encouraging things like ""why can't you do this!"" seemingly oblivious to the fact that they, the backpack makers, have arbitrarily not allowed these people to eat anything or rest for hours on end while subjecting them to intense physical demands.Is it because the candidates are mentally weak or physically unprepared? Or could it be they're completely tapped out of glycogen from not eating and the chemical energy necessary to keep moving their body longer exists. Maybe it's all of the above.That's it. That's the whole movie. The guy who does make it gets a beer, a group hug, a Velcro patch for his fancy backpack and a store discount. Hooray!I get subjecting yourself to this kind of physical test when it's to be in the military... which is a paying job with health benefits, prestige, and a community. I really get it when it's to survive a war. Or when it's to escape poverty and terror or to try to save your family or make a better life for your kids. But these are tech bros and mechanics and random civilians using their disposable income, their vacation days, and their own health insurance for the privilege of being tortured for 48 hours just to see if they can hack it.Spoiler alert- most can't because really, why the hell should they?We are strange animals.",True

1,10,Beautiful Film,bverner-94435,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a beautiful, intelligent and insightful piece of work. An illumination of, arguably, Ireland's greatest artist. Moved me to tears. Especially, his painting, "" Death for Only One"". A film so beautifully crafted... it will stay with me for the rest of my life. Anyone with an interest in the arts and painting in particular, for them it is a must see. Thank you. A milestone in documentary film-making.",False

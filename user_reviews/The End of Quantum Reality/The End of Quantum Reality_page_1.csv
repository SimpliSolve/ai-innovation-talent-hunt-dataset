1,5,Interesting up to a point,PaulsLaugh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sadly, I am unable to take Professor Smith's thesis seriously, not because of his ideas about the nature of reality, which I am open-minded about, but by the inclusion of Olavo de Carvalho in this film. Look this person up and you will understand my disgust.That said, in the first part of the documentary, Smith does explain his position simply enough for educated laypeople to understand his quantum physics insights...which are not new, but similar to the New Physics popularized by acid dropping mavericks such as Fritjof Capra and others in psychedelic 60s Berkeley and Haight-Ashbury Days.Beyond that, it becomes an apology for conservative Christianity and pre-Cartesian, Western traditionalism. Therefore, I've split the difference between the 1s, who rightly point out this should be recognized as pseudoscience and ultimately propaganda and the 10s, who are dangerously non-skeptical and rate this 5 stars.",False
2,1,Suspect from the start,sholby,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started watching this movie because I'm interested in Physics and science. I had no preconceptions about it, yet, from the very start I began to suspect it was a vessel for an unholy, if you will, purpose. What with the permeating cheesy music and the sparkly graphics superimposed on largely meaningless accumulation of words, it soon became obvious this was only trying to sell God, of whatever ilk.As another reviewer said, sheer garbage.",False
3,1,Garbage documentary,ajblues-19333,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing but garbage pseudoscience trying to prove god with bad arguments. This is not how science works, you don't start with a conclusion before the experiment begins. They start with the assumption that god is real without first proving it to be true and then takes science and tries to fit in god. You must first prove god exists before you can say he did anything.",False
4,10,Based and redpilled,rafidoyon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Crying material for soyjaks. One without any knowledge of quantum mechanics can not criticize this. Most of the skeptics never passed high school science and believes everything that starts with ""Study says .""",False
5,3,Very disappointing,diegotarabilla,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a documentary with due quality in its manufacture; however the content is disappointing. The real point of the whole film is to point to the mess in which Physics have fallen into, and one can easily agree with this as it is referred by many other concerned physicists. But the solution proposed, the return to medieval philosophy (Aquinas and Averroes) is so odd that the show should have made so much more to, first, argue why Science should become ancilla theologiae again; and second, why a return to naïve realism and geoccentrism would help us understand Mother Nature better. Even if I were a religious person I´d be disappointed, because the documentary will not really help me defend that anti-copernican shift. I want to stress that what I find disappointing is not the thesis itself, but the poorly argumentation that can hardly help to stir a debate in society about the real need to go beyond quantum relativism.",True
6,10,Makes you think,avotanu-56371,n/a,16/08/2025,"A brief history of the development of the quantum theory, its weaknesses, and a biography of the man who brings both deep science and philosophy to the debate. The movie explores the implications of quantum physics for humanity, and if you do not come out with a lot to think about, then you were not paying attention.",False
7,1,Absolute rubbish.,brentonl-26702,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing but a thinly veiled attempt at selling god by trying to baffle the viewer with pseudoscience. So many of the premises/assumptions presented as 'fact', and then used as the basis for his so-called conclusions, range from highly suspect to laughably incorrect. Save yourself the time/frustration and go watch Kurzgesagt videos on YouTube instead.",False
8,10,Simply beautiful!,armchairskeptic,n/a,16/08/2025,Simply beautiful! This film reminds us that everything we know cannot be reduced to only a simple materialist perspective. It eloquently explores the intersection between science and philosophy. Bravo.,False
9,8,Thank you for introducing us to Wolfgang Smith,chris-67060,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was well worth the 4.99 rental, Dr Smith is the real deal in terms of teaching at top North American universities, so if you have 90 minutes and an open mind you wont be disappointed.
The narrator is well informed and enthusiastic - and if i read the credit correctly sings the final song!",False

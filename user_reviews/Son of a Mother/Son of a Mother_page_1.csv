1,9,"Loved it, but there is important information missing",anelassard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a fan who closely followed Paulo Gustavo's career, I loved the movie and got emotional several times while watching it. Producers did a great job compiling new personal archives and telling his life story while portraying an amazing spectacle of his genius personality and work.However, for a documentary, the production skipped too many facts, for example, he only got sick when Brazil was already relaxing the rules (too early!), so he had to work, shoot at Globo studios, etc. Sorry to say that (I know everybody wanted to say goodbye), but the burial was way too crowded too. This film doesn't include that event... Anyway, everything was a big mess at that time, all across the country, so the people weren't the main transgressors.",True
2,10,Untouchable,marcelosventura,n/a,16/08/2025,"One of the most interesting movies of the year. The relation between mother and son has now a ""true"" chapter proceeded by three fictional ones (Minha mãe é uma peça 1, 2 and 3).When I saw the first movie, was one of the times that I understood my mother from another perspective, and we laughed a lot together at the movies. After that I began to mimic her more and more as we were facing difficult times in our family.Speaking about this movie again, it has a lot of cool and interesting backstages scenes between Paulo and his mom, that corroborates everything shown from last 3 movies and even more. Brazilians are hard working and generous people, Paulo Gustavo was a truly example of a hard working and a role play to everyone in the world. The movie begins with a lot of cool scenes about him and his mother going on stage, after that movie sets the tone for new people that helped him to reach his professional level. In the near end, main focus is the pandemics, without any explicit note about politics, given Paulo was a happy person of attitude not words.A well deserved movie to someone that helped an entire country to laugh and understand their moms a little better.",False

1,7,another sad reminder that capitalism & colonialism destroys everything,stylss,n/a,16/08/2025,"No narration, just Yanomami indigenous people vibing in the forest telling us how they lived peacefully before the gold prospectors came along and put their entire existence at risk.Powerful, devastating, beautifully shot, important, and yet another sad reminder that capitalism & colonialism destroys everything.",False
2,7,Intriguing docu introduced culture seldom seen or understood by civilized people,awvknj,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBeautifully filmed it was a bit confusing how it jumped back-and-forth between actual footage and staged footage explaining mythologies and during sequences of beliefs held by the culture so it was a bit like putting together a puzzle to watch it a certain point they just quit subtitles and that was very disappointing because up until then they had been Translating, but once the Shaman started smoking, there was no more translation and that was really disappointing because I didn't have a clue what was really going on and that sequence at all and it would've been nice to get a little bit more explanation about what they were doing and The purpose it is sad to think that this tribe is only one example of native people who are not protected and allowed to live without interference if they choose. Since they've managed to survive in their culture and customs over so many years, it seems like living history and they should be allowed to continue without civilization encroaching upon them just as we protect other endangered species after all these are human beings.",True
3,10,Truthful,isabeltoralbo,n/a,16/08/2025,"A much needed documentary. The photography is insane, Pedro did a wonderful job. And I was amazed at the folklore tales, narrated and played by the natives themselves. I can't see anything that faults it, it's raw, it's pleasant, it's humanity at it's best and at it's worst.",False
4,10,The non native is the disease,schlagzeugplayer,n/a,16/08/2025,When the ore is dug then the disease comes from the ground. So it is in their creation story of two brothers etc...Almost prophetic in what happens to these tribes on the Amazon. Gold drilling and digging brings mercury to the water supply and so we have the skeleton of this film but there is so much more. Everyone should see this.,False
5,9,Genocide against indigenous,mounsieurlapao,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are several indigenous peoples in Brazil, each with its own peculiarities and characteristics. This documentary shows as the Yanomami see the issue of ore and ""garimpeiros"".Deforestation starts with the gold prospector (garimpeiro), flowed to the wood seller and finally the big farmer, all on the same idea but at different scales of exploration of the Amazon.Genocide against indigenous peoples has to stop!",False
6,10,Perfect! Decolonize your perspective.,gabrieldread,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic, perfect! Yanomami indigenous people tell their own tale about the arrival of gold diggers invading their territory.",False
7,4,Clothing versus customs.,deloradalton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Honestly, I couldn't finish it.I watched the first few minutes of footage of the men and a family and then the tribesmen running off 3 white men gold prospectors.I expected to see their clothing to be minimal, as their customs have bead works and body paint.It just bothered me immensely that this dramatized documentary seemingly had probably altered their dress to give them a voice. Seeing these tribesmen in modern day basketball shorts. And yet, the women wore only beads and bands of cloth.....
Did the filmmakers change their customary clothing (or lack there or) for our view on modesty? It just immediately & jarringly made me feel 'this feels wrong'.",False
8,10,Immediate and Startling,davebrendon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Understatements. Everything I could say about this powerful sharing would be an understatement. It is beautiful, devastating, poignant, hilarious, haunting. It is us. What we should be. I dare you not to see the world and your life differently after watching this.",False
9,10,"Give it a watch, though I doubt most ever heard of it.",rchosen-193-5535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sadly documentaries on tribes (that are still around) don't seem to get much attention anymore. Most people see the photo and think ""Eh, tribal people. Sounds boring!"" But you would be wrong.You are missing out. There is no narrator. No non-tribe people (well aside from the people filming). Just the tribe showing us how they live. And more importantly how modern man is killing them off but figuratively and literally at times.Their lifestlye is well... tribal. But its almost peaceful and calm compared to how most people live today. It's ashame gold diggers and others get onto their land and put them at risk. Some from causing mercury to poisoning their waters from gold digging. Others literally trying to hurt them because they just want their land.To note for those who all worried about ""Is this some bashing you over the head thing about nature?"" Well it is an issue of course, but this documentary is about more then that. It's about the tribes. Deforestation is another issue that affects them greatly.I'm glad I checked this out. There's nothing really offensive in this for you to worry about. Unless your against nudity. But this isn't nudity as we see it today. This is just a tribe being a tribe. Remember, we modern people are the ones who see butts, breasts, genital's as sexual things that need to be covered up.Seeing there are only five reviews for this makes me sad. I hope it get more exposure.",False
10,10,The Final Forest.,morrison-dylan-fan,n/a,16/08/2025,"After finding Under the Concrete (2020-also reviewed) to be an intriguing feature film debut by Roy Arida,I was excited to enter the forest and catch the third,and final title in the 2021 WOW Film Festival features line-up.View on the film:Going deep into the heart of the Yanomami community in the Amazon rainforest on the border between Venezuela and Brazil, director Luiz Bolognesi & cinematographer Pedro J. Marquez wise decision to not have an English language narration, allows for a rich, immerse atmosphere to grow, via Bolognesi's delicate, spectacular tracking shots and striking close-ups in natural light, capturing the untouched by industrialization balance of the practical daily routines, and the deep spiritualism that the Yanomami's hold dear.Treating the beliefs of the Yanomami's with respect, Bolognesi inter-cuts the daily lives documentary footage with shimmering re-enactments, as the tribes-people play themselves in excellent sequences which dramatizes the mythology that they live their lives by.Detailing during the end credits the horrific mistreatment and murder that have been committed by prospectors in recent years, Bolognesi fills the screen with the passionate voices of the Yanomami's , who detail the distraction which the brutal outsiders have brought with them,as the Yanomami fight to save the last forest.",False
11,10,It's important topics make movies like this one..,sasharoben,n/a,16/08/2025,It's important to give indigenous communities a voice. They are there lung of the world. They know how earth works as they in harmony with her. Modern men usually don't know the cycles of nature anymore. Hence they don't know the impact of their life style on the planet.Watching this movie I learned that it is hard to understand the rituals and although I have had some education in regard to indigenous life.I fear that the message of the movie will not be understood by those who should.It would help to include in movies like this what rituals they are doing and for what reason.Including their understanding of spirit and their communication with the other world.,False
12,2,Takes no talent to make,ocacia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boring, same scenes back and forth, sparse narrative of typical dialogues. Seen this all before nothing new here. Just footage with music and a lot of smoke.",False

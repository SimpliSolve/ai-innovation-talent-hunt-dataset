1,10,Required watching for everyone in fashion,cmcfwfrr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you wear, buy, sell, market or promote clothing, this film is a must watch. Animals are so intentionally left out of conversations around ethics and sustainability in fashion so often and this film spotlights those hidden issues. These are the stories the fur, leather and wool industries don't want us to see.Every single fact and statistic in the film was peer-reviewed and is referenced and available to view on the film's website.The film is not overly graphic so don't feel put off watching it because of that - there are some upsetting scenes but nothing overly gory and nothing that lasts a long time. It balances animal, environmental and human issues well.",False
2,10,After having seen this film you will see fashion with different eyes,acavegn-47695,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film shows the great disconnect between the shiny glamorous world of fashion and the cruel and destructive practices of this industry. It unveils how animals, workers and the environment is treated through the whole ""value"" chain. It is rather a ""chain of cruelties"".This documentary analyzes how most of the big brands are trying to make us believe the fairy tale that what we buy is sustainable and was produced under fair conditions. Every day we consume food or fashion we make choices. After having seen this movie you will may be rethink your daily choices and leave out all animal products.The film takes you on a trip through five continents behind the scenes of fur, leather and wool producers. You meet activists with breathtaking messages, infographics explain complex topics graphically and the soundtrack is amazing. For me, SLAY is the most emotional documentary film - it get's under your skin.",False
3,10,"All the gory truth about leather, fur and animal testing",srikanthvijay,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary that has come out right in time when everyone is talking about the role of animals in our lives, for food, fashion and what not. Disclaimer: There are some graphic videos showing how fur animals are tortured, electrocuted and killed. Same with leather and other things in fashion. Most people are comfortably unaware of the goings on in the fashion industry where animals are unnecessarily tortured when there are non-animal alternatives that are a lot more sustainable. Everyone should definitely watch this documentary as it affects one and all.It is high time we leave animals out of our plates, clothes and cosmetics and this documentary definitely provides the impetus to do just that.",False
4,10,A brilliant film that will help end animal cruelty worldwide!,argedrich,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bless God and all involved in the creation of SLAY for so brilliantly revealing the hidden cruelty, trickery and lies that have gone unchecked in fashion for far too long.As confronting as it is to face the gore behind the 'glamour', it's time to know the truth. I consider myself a relatively well-informed individual but knew little about the extent to which systematic and utterly unnecessary abuse - to animals, the planet, humans - is inherent in the leather, fur and wool industries.The Innocent - billions of them, including babies, suffering right now - cannot speak up for themselves. SLAY is their voice. May it be watched, shared and acted on far and wide and urgently. The animals need us!",False
5,10,Eye-Opening,hacenetaibi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great demonstration of what is happening. Entertaining, in the format, and chilling in the content.It's great to have access and see what is happening ""behind the scene"". It walks you through different businesses and different continents looking for the source of what we wear everyday, what we have on our skin.And it does a very good job in getting under our skin.Hopefully more brands and citizens will see this documentary to be better informed, and take better decisions for their future (and ours).I sent the link to watch it to several of my friends to spread the knowledge. After learning more about what we put in our plates, it is high time we know more about what we put on ourselves.",False
6,10,Must watch,realrachelfirth,n/a,16/08/2025,"Slay is a great documentary film that not only features people talking to the camera but also covers a lot of ground work for fur, leather and wool in several countries like India, China, Australia and Europe.One thing I really appreciate as I am quite sensitive, is that despite the topic being about animals (and planet and human rights) there is nothing graphic on the screen. I used to think leather and wool were fine and okay for the planet, and I was shocked by the facts, the data and the images that came from these industries. I am really recommending it to anyone interested in fashion, sustainability or simply making better choices.",False
7,10,Uncomfortable but important viewing,mkzrpwr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another Inconvenient Truth, Slay diligently unpacks a compelling case against animals in fashion. Fur, wool, leather are shown as being far from 'natural' by the time they are on our clothes or accessories and the revelations of animal - and human - suffering are shocking and distressing. But this is no 'outside' job wanting to kick the fashion industry - this film is by the fashion industry and for it and its kinder future. The film may be laser sharp in exposing the cruelty hidden in our clothes but it also shines a light on the hopeful way forward. An uncomfortable but important must-see film.",False
8,10,"Incredibly powerful, informative and provokes change",heizema,n/a,16/08/2025,"A worthwhile watch for anyone wanting to understand these industries, the truth behind what we wear and how we live. Emotional, empathetic and visually a very well done film by a passionate team. Especially poignant following the journey of filmmaker Rebecca from fashion lover to animal rights activism. This film has been thought about thoroughly - it was factual whilst also telling a story, one of which without a happy ending but leaves you feeling like we can and must do more to protect the animals, our planet, and humans involved in the production of materials. The world is changing and it's amazing to see people so passionate to pushing the change. Very well done.",False
9,10,A must watch for all who wear clothes!,judeclegg,n/a,16/08/2025,"An outstanding film by fashion lovers that uncovers in a very watchable, informative and inclusive way, the shocking hidden truths of the cruelty, exploitation and environmental destruction involved in fashion. It has many uplifting, forward-looking messages on how fashion can be changed for good.Well researched with detailed facts that even those who are well-informed on sustainability may find to be shocking and revelatory. There are also inspiring case studies on the trailblazers who are embracing ethical and sustainable fashion.Let's pray this film ushers in a kinder future for fashion, animals, people, and the planet. Global compassion in fashion is needed urgently!",False
10,10,Surprisingly Informative and Well Shot,alexvciccone,n/a,16/08/2025,"Slay is a very informative documentary about the fashion industry's darkest kept secret: the impacts that our clothing has on the earth and its inhabitants.Most documentaries are primarily focused on the content, but this documentary is also very well shot and thought-out. Often documentaries can come off as agenda-pushing, but this documentary was very balanced and presented the viewer with all of the right information to make informed decisions in our own lives.I'll certainly be reevaluating my clothing choices having learned a lot more about the impact of my clothing purchases on the world.To paraphrase a quote from the film: we all wear clothing, so we should all care about fashion and where it comes from.",False
11,10,The greatest documentary I have ever watched,vladonguyen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the greatest documentary I have ever watched in my life. I learned so many things about the fur, leather and animal skins industry. Although I knew many facts especially about the fur industry, there were much more even to find. This is a film that I would recommend to every of my friends and people who want to know really how something simple as clothes may affect not only animals but the life of every person on the planet as well as the environment itself. The people included, the music even - everything is so precise in the film. There are not bloody cruel scenes but definitely there are scenes that might touch you and cry.",False
12,10,"Once You Know, You Know.",cleanandcozycondo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SLAY shows a compelling narrative that unravels the facade of the fashion industry, exposing the harsh realities of its impact on nature and animals. In this eye-opening journey, the film invites viewers to see disturbing truths and empowers viewers to rethink their relationship with fashion and make conscientious decisions.SLAY serves as a wake-up call, urging viewers to question their role in an industry that too often sacrifices nature and animals for fleeting trends. This documentary is a must-watch for anyone who believes in the transformative power of knowledge and the potential for positive change.",False
13,10,Everyone should see this,simonekrelius,n/a,16/08/2025,This film shows you the reality of using skin and fur in interior and fashion without being pretentious in any way. The terrible consequences of the animals suffering and the environment. It's all very well thought of. I would highly recommend that schools and universities shows this for their students to.Even though I worked many years in fashion myself trying my best to avoid animal products and slavery I found myself in that situation that buyers pushed hard on me to use certain materials in order to create a balance of aesthetic in my collections.The fashion industry is a toxic environment and I'm so happy I got out of it before too late. However I learned so much from this film. See it and stop using animal products in whatever you do please.,False
14,10,Please Watch this over some random popcorn flick.,adityavoleti-96920,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone needs to watch this. More documentaries like this need to be made. We're 8 billion people continuously consuming, creating and not recycling or reusing. Every unit of demand is a sentient voiceless life that's just bred for our amusement. We're all so smart in this age of technology yet we fund something so dumb. Please watch this and think what you're buying.In this age of social media and influence it's easy to sell a fashion item than save an animal or be a part of positive change to this planet. We're the smartest species on this planet... We're supposed to protect the others not abuse them. Watching this and thinking about our choices is the first step. 10/10.",False
15,8,"Wear leather, eat meat? You need to watch this.",bkt41tx,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only criticism I have is that although the narrator of this film clearly speaks French and Mandarin there are no subtitles when native speakers of these languages are being interviewed. Otherwise, this is a very well researched examination of the moral and environmental costs of the fashion industry, as well as the marketing methodologies that major brands employ in their attempts to overcome skepticism of existing and potential customers.In the end, what we see is an industry like any other. One that values profit above any consideration for the welfare of animals, people or the environment. Some of the footage is truly shocking but that's the point - the disgusting realities of these unseen supply chains need to be made visible.",False

1,9,Wonderful documentary,khairulmustapha,n/a,16/08/2025,"The context of love is pure, love make you stronger, love gives away loves is good. And the power of faith of God make you stronger yes it is no matter you're christians, muslims or other religions. It's the same. Religions breeds peace.",False
2,7,A great insight into a war torn world.,masoncheek,n/a,16/08/2025,I really felt for all the people in those countries. A great documentary.,False
3,7,Very Revealing Documentary,colton_slayallday,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let's be honest, going into this documentary, I didn't have high expectations as I'm not a person who typically enjoys documentaries. But this one blew my expectations. I'd heard about what happened in Burma and Iraq but this documentary put a view on those issues that I never thought I could see. It's brilliant how much first person real-life footage was put into this film. I would definitely recommend this docu to anyone looking to see a first person account of what happened in those places.Note: this docu has a very Christian point-of-view and much of the dialogue talks about David Eubank's relationship with God.",False
4,10,The best movie ever made probably. Everyone must see!!!!,dandan-dandan,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie leaves me in shock and amazement. It cannot be described. The way they documented it is the most realistic experience you can ever have of a real war situation and everything is happening in front of you, with real life people in deep need, and Eubank can be seen trying to make life and death decisions by relying on God's grace and deliverance in the real face of evil and destruction. After watching this you probably would not want to watch another Hollywood movie again. Such power, heart, love and truth in this entire documentary. The cruelty of war will make you confront what life is, how evil this world is and how God's teaching to love our neighbor is worth fighting for - yet only made possible by a truly faihtful and obedient heart towards the God of Love. Jesus Christ is written all over this movie. He is the Lord over all evil. No matter how hard, if you trust Him and follow Him, He will make you to do some of the best work in the world for humanity. This movie should win all the awards out there. It is the most beautiful and honest and eye-opening movei I have ever seen.",False
5,10,Powerful,kbil1999,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such an amazing and beautiful document. These men are so brave and courage's. Highly, highly recommend people to watch this.",False
6,10,Excellent movie About Compassion,janisjs7-183-844120,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was an eye opener for me as it showed scenes that so many of us are ignorant of--the tragedy of war. But there was a man and his family who made a difference, along with all the others who helped, showing love and compassion where there was only war and suffering. Every part of this documentary is heart touching and motivates one to do more to help others in need, and pray for those who are trying to make the world a better place.",False
7,10,When all you have is faith to get you through impossible situations.,rolandholloway,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazing story of faith, love and humanity over coming evil in an insane situation. I'll need to watch this a few more times to really appreciate what is going on. The Eubank family shows us what it means and looks like to live the talk and walk the talk.",False
8,10,You have to see it.,raquelebatista,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is so gripping and real fearless Christianity. These parents and kids have spent 20+ years rescuing, providing medical assistance to and sharing Jesus with internally displaced people in Burma and Iraq. This is a sober dose of reality for those of us comfortably living American lives in the first world. I love the plentiful real footage in full gritty, chaotic glory. These Christian missionaries captured news footage of the humanitarian crises and shared with international media, which was able to expose it. The UN used their footage to defend human rights. This documentary also showcases what is possible with collaboration amongst diverse people groups with common goals. God works in the chaos! Jesus asked us to love the people like we want to be loved. Make more documentaries like this!!",True
9,10,My favorite movie,eric-07645,n/a,16/08/2025,"It seems odd to list what is technically a documentary as my favorite movie ever. But it is. I've watched it a number of times, and shown it to many other people. I've found they always need time to ""process"" it at the end, as it makes a deep impact. As a real-life documentary (no re-enactments) it presents reality in a way that is irrefutable (save for abject head-in-the-sand denialism), and that can be hard for some people to accept. For everyone else, there is a lot to learn and be inspired by in this work.",False
10,7,Great Insight,mirielle_canovas,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great movie about love and how nothing is impossible. They maybe talk about themselves a little too much and I would have liked to see a little more about the civilians caught in the war's lives. Other than that it is an amazing move and brings great insight into what is happening in other countries; even if there are bad times and evil, good will always overcome it. Some parts of the movie are not totally realistic; like where are they getting all the supplies and how is their power, so I would have liked if they went a little bit more in-depth overall. I recommend watching it if you are into that.",False
11,10,Incredible - Can You Choose Love and Compassion at all Costs?,jordan-314,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredible movie that touches on many parts of the human experience and the events in our world in a graphic way - it is a must see that will leave you with a sense of hope and possibility.The work of the Free Burma Rangers needs to be recognized globally, as do the realities of the conflicts in the regions where they operate. The love and faith between the FMR, the people they help, the family at its core is unbelievable. Love, compassion, forgiveness, and service to others seems so foreign compared to the self absorbed, nihilism of every day where people's beliefs and opinions aren't shaped by experience or with opened mindedness and understanding but through the echo chamber of touch screen devices.",False
12,7,Great documentary ...but,121mcv,n/a,16/08/2025,"He and his brothers in arms are selfless people, that is for sure, however, he talks like he has a relationship with God which is palpable almost like a prophet I find that a little condescending. We all knew he prays to Jesus with in the first 15 mins, he didn't have to make it 90% of his dialogue.",False
13,2,The anti-Gospel and Social Justice on Steroids.,fitforfaith-ministries,n/a,16/08/2025,"PROS+ The baptism of one of the formerly brutal soldiers is very beautiful to see.+ Great music sessions with local kids.+ They are shown to save several lives.CONSThey ""have no program to arm our teams. We are not pacifists, but if they are gonna be armed, they arm themselves.""> This is contrary to the New Covenant, which clearly teaches that we are to search for peace (rather Pacifism). It is also problematic that they expect their members to be armed, and the movie does not reveal where the money for those weapons comes from, for people who have lost everything and are without income and probably not savings in order to purchase arms.While they fight in Burma, we do not only see arms, but one scene shows them also how they wrap together half a dozen of grenades. This is truly shocking. Later in Iraq, we also see a team member throw a grenade.Min 32 ""Dear G-d, I am so sorry for those girls (2 missionaries raped and murdered), and their family. I do want to kill all the Burma Army, no question in my mind. Help me know how to - I don't know how to forgive them. I only dare to do that because you commanded it. I don't even want to forgive them. I just want to kill them. But I will obey you Lord. So help me to forgive them and to love them.""Min 33 - ""It would be really simple if the world was just like 'lord of the Rings'. Here's the humans and the elves and the dwarves and the hobbits and we are pretty good. And there is the evil orcs and they're all terrible. And so, the line of evil is here.""When they drive in Iraq, Dave is shown sitting on the back of a driving truck with a long arm ready for combat.Min 50 - It is shocking to see Dave smile when saying the following line: ""The volume of fire was incredible. I think probably any given day in Mosul more shootings happen than any year in Burma."" (at this point he smiles which is deeply disturbing).Min 53 (bombs exploding, tank screeching) ""All right, Dave Eubank, Free Burma, Free Kurd Rangers. We are going to a town that IS*S has held for 2 years now, to be part of the group that liberates it. All in Jesus' name. And thank you for all your help and support and prayers.""Now we see them praying for a family, and shortly after they leave them, the family gets into a mine. When they hurry back, Dave prays for the life of the girl in IESOUS' name and she dies. I am not sure what message the makers of this movie want to transmit with such a degradation of THEOS.Not only do they paint such a negative picture of THEOS, they use this episode also to manipulate the viewer in justifying the American war on IS*S:""We evacuated the wounded the best we could. And I turned to Monkey ... That's it man. We're gonna hunt down IS*S from now on. This is why, the reason we fight IS*S is because of this. Killed that little kid. Blew up the family. People who do that, you have to kill them until they decide they're not going to do it. And we pray for them to surrender. But when they stand and do that, then they have chosen to die. We are going to share the Gospel of Jesus.""[...] We are going to go after it. And that's justice. What do you think? I think it's right. Let's ask G-d. So that night I said, Lord Jesus, show me the truth of what happened today. Open my Kindle up to the Bible. And I put my finger, and it said: Vengeance is mine. Oh what I thought justice, was (actually) vengeance.""Min 63 - Dave is shown with a small bleeding on his arm.Then a team member says about Dave: ""And he killed three IS*S. Three Daesh. Terrorists. He (Dave) killed them.""Dave now justifies his killing: ""What do we gotta do? Can we find another way? A lot of us had near misses. Our vehicles were shot up.""Min 68 One of the group members is supposedly shot 8 times and brought back to life by IESOUS: ""I see a dream. I told her, which dream did you see? She said: I see you, you are dead. In the white room. And came to you, He wore white clothes. He is very handsome. And He said to you 'Wake up.' And you woke up.""Min 72 - Here the producers translate what a local women is saying: ""Thanks to G-d for sending your team here."" But one can clearly hear that she is not thanking G-d, but Al**h.Min 76 Dave makes one call and the American army drops several bombs. At this point it is crystal clear that this is not a Christian mission, but simply a group of soldiers who believe in Christ and do some good things in between.Min 83 Dave uses the Muslim 'Isa' as name for IESOUS: ""So I grab Zuhair's hand and I just wisper this 'G-d help, in Isa's name' In the transcript, the producers filled in 'Jesus' instead of what Dave actually spoke.Francis Chan is Executive Producer.",False
14,10,I don't think my life will be ever quite the same. . .,lachlanwarrell,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has to be one of the most powerful examples of what it means to truly love that I have ever seen. Anyone can watch this and be profoundly changed. If you are deciding whether or not to watch it and pay the $20 it currently costs, I can almost certainly guarantee if you paid less you would desire to give $20 after. I say to you friend, this is so much more profound than you can imagine. And brilliantly done as well",False
15,10,Simply Incredible!,gipsonbeth,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like many Americans, I was completely detached and quite unaware of the horrific suffering experienced around the world. This is a must see.

21,1,Religious propaganda.,krusty-23,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like others I fell for the high rating but it was nothing more than religious propaganda, so much so that I did not watch it all. Just how many times can you refer to the miracles of god. For those that believe in faith it is meaningful but for me it was just so far into this that I found it just too full on. Some great footage but not my thing.",False

23,1,Lame and lousy,karagoz-emre,n/a,16/08/2025,"The trailer promised it would look into the lives of people during wars, how brutal isis was, how the people suffered... But this is just them praising themselves, not a lot of humility going on here.Americans suck with maps and geography, and mostly history too. They showed Sinjar as Mosul on Iraq map, lamest thing ever, at 41:43.",False
24,5,When all hope is lost,VanBooter,n/a,16/08/2025,"When all hope is lost you can either look to others for help, re-assess the situation, or pray to some fictitious person and start quoting from a book written by man and re-written by man many times since.
This was looking to be an excellent documentary which was sadly ruined for me when if started spouting the god stuff so much so it seemed like all the atrocities in Burma and Iraq had been pushed to the side to make a pathway for the christian faith vehicle.",False

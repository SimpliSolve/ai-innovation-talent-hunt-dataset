1,8,just that arousing...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFeeling of treasure exitement lying here on the sofa in spring smitten norway, Norway, where the usual treasure is a viking item, a robbery lot or downdug coke, its like putting wings on the ribbed butterfly (google maps) , yet again making chaos fluttering its wings of mayhem, over the great nation of u.s.of a. To find this modern made treasure search, that logically ( or as many will say ''its llogical'') was meant to draw people roundabout and into the bushes, just to reexperience the greatness of of one of gods creations namely rocky mountains of america...hot springs or not, a redneck and any graded or degraded individual who got THAT dollar sign($) stamped on both corona radialis (eyes) heaved around, spun out of a poem criss crossing the countrysides everywhere to smell the hunch... just like a modern day pokemon hunter or geocatchers for those old enough to remember that...as a viewing product its pure entertainment for that is what it is for us that mocks down on people doing nerdy things like this, so go have a look its something to dwell over, like the ''gold'' i recovered in the months and years after i broke my spine, rehabilitating using mother nature as my workout , climbing the hills and wading the marshes of my little beloved island to regain might and health .So a recommend a view to this joint venture allthough being a grumpy old man, just short enough to never become boring.",True
2,n/a,watch it until the very end,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Okay. So I love documentaries and especially weird documentaries and this certainly falls into that category.It's about a treasure hunt that goes spectacularly off the rails... including causing the deaths of four people.That's assuming this is, in fact, true. I do have my doubts.Seriously, the people we meet are so bizarre one almost has to wonder if this isn't scripted. The doofus rednecks, the tough retired woman, the obviously wealthy dude who has a lot of time on his hands, the upright 747 pilot with his upright family.That's not to mention the crusty old creep who buries the treasure the others are trying to find.Thank god I don't have that treasure hunting gene. I saw it in action when I was growing up in St Paul during the ""Winter Carnival"" when they would bury a medallion and put clues in the newspapers. But I digress..On a serious note, this is a bit long. It could have easily been shortened to one or two episodes. It gets a bit boring and slow.But it is watchable and entertaining. The ""characters"" I mention above are interesting if over-the-top.AND... AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. You need to watch the ending. The very ending. And then decide for yourself... is it real??? It is quite a thing at the ending and it took me by surprise.You will need to decide for yourself, and if you ARE one of those people who has the treasure hunting gene -- beware.",False
3,10,Exciting,imdbfan-7532482764,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile watching my son started trying to find the treasure he got pretty much the same stream as the family of backwoods guys. I was impressed an 11 year old did that good not even paying full attention as some people had the wrong state altogether! I think it's exciting to think you could find a treasure. I do think it was quite sad some unfortunate souls lost their lives.I could see ending the treasure hunt prematurely for sure as what is worth more than your life?I think for the usual American we don't have as much free time as lot of the searchers on the show. It's still a fun idea for those of us who do tend to enjoy nature when we have the money and time and those of us with kids can join in on the fun! I hope anyone wanting to enjoy nature in this format does so with wisdom and intuition and preparation.I do wonder how complicated the future of this show will be they decide to have more ""seasons"" as the treasure enthusiast is quite intelligent and financially capable how accessible are these types of fun adventures? Either way I hope to have some fun researching and getting out into nature in our state! And who knows what our adventures will bring!",True
4,9,"Greed and a great,white whale.",chucker22,n/a,16/08/2025,"As much Moby Dick as Treasure of the Sierra Madre, this is one of those spellbinding docs that expands its canvas the further it gets. Starting as a real, life treasure hunt initiated by a narcissistic, old man in an attempt to "" stay relevant"" in his old age, the story quickly evolves into one of human obsession, imagination, hope and, in the end, reconciliation. It is the story of America and her sense of destiny, desire for something better, determination and heart as big as Montana. Easy to dismiss as the foolhardy misadventures of a bunch of sad, delusional misfits but that would be a mistake. Each of the four "" hunters"" we follow have their own personal reasons for putting themselves through the trials they do. Their stories are crazy, delusional and utterly admirable in some ways. An extraordinary and compelling series. Highly recommended.",False
5,9,A one of a kind documentary,goransondevin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I could tell just by the information about this docu-series that this was going to be right up my alley. I absolutely love mysteries, treasure hunts, intrigue, etc.. I was certainly not disappointed by this! It's a one of a kind story that kept me on the edge of my seat until the bittersweet end. Nothing is more interesting in life to me than a good mystery and this encapsulates all the great things that can go along with a good mystery. A hunt for something/someone, thousands of sleuths who will stop at nothing to find the answers, and what's even better yet a treasure at the end of it. This was an absolutely amazing watch and I can't recommend this enough to documentary lovers!",False
6,5,One of the....,SGSypult,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is one of the dumbest that I have ever seen. It's the new, ""Tiger King"". Characters that you love to hate but still watch. I felt embarrassed for almost everyone. And I had no knowledge of the entire thing.It is an incredibly sad story. There are so many mentally ill people involved in this mess. It's also sad that media were all over this. They promoted the madness.I can't say whether or not someone should watch this or not. If ""Tiger King"" intrigued you, then watch. It's a similar feel. And why in the world IMBD requires such long submissions is beyond me. Maybe not all shows need a lengthy review.",False
7,n/a,Very Tiger-King'esque!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"A not-put-together-very-well catalogue of how far some people went to find buried treasure in the hopes of improving their lives. Particularly the family of 3 men who spent two years trying to excavate a boulder. I couldn't watch them recount their experiences, but I couldn't look away either. Overall my heart was sad for them because you could actually feel their train-wreck determination, followed by the pit of despair.Much was left unsaid, especially by the aloof family members of Forest Fenn. You couldn't help think they were full of BS.Perhaps I dozed off with sheer frustration, but there is a big gap in the the facial-recognition guys offer being accepted by the auctioneers, to it not. Huh? Yet the dragon bracelet and other things were in HIS re-hide box? Wtf?It was poorly filmed, and had many nut jobs akin to Tiger King. It's the kind of thing that by the end you want kick yourself for watching the whole thing.",False
8,10,Absolutely amazing!! Unbelievable plot!!,beckyhines,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is awesome!! I highly recommend watching! This show kept me on the edge of my seat. Just when you think you have the outcome figured out, the plot turns upside down! It was non-stop excitement. The ending was really a surprise. I cant believe what some people went through to find a chest worth millions! This was defined a unique documentary on an unusual event. I've never seen anything like it. I also highly recommend reading the book Beyond The Map's Edge to find the next treasure! I really hope the author writes more books. Hopefully I'll be able to go hunt for this new treasure soon! 5 stars!!!",False
9,3,A gold rush of bad decisions,Ulimaroa,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started this thinking I'd get a quirky treasure hunt tv show. What I got was a front-row seat to the slow, painful meltdown of logic. People sobbing over rocks, detonating boulders like they're in a low-budget Bond movie, and treating vague poetry like gospel. I swear, every minute I watched, a brain cell packed its bags and left. This wasn't a hunt for treasure-it was a televised mass delusion. By the end, I needed a map just to find my will to live. If common sense was buried out there, nobody found it. But hey, at least now I know how not to read a poem. X marked the spot where sanity died.",False
10,5,"Decent Documentary, Incredibly Stupid People",chrisfield3,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting docuseries about Forrest Fenn and his buried treasure in the Rocky Mountains. I have no problem with Mr. Fenn. He seems like a genuinely good person and I give him credit for the life he created for himself.My problem is with the arrogant, mind-numbingly stupid people who call themselves treasure hunters. The ignorant hillbilly Hurst family. What a joke these people are. They really believe they're intelligent, important individuals. This couldn't be further from the truth. They thought Mr Fenn would leave them something in his wiland were crying when the lawyer said he had no idea who they are. The Hursts are the perfect representation of what's wrong with America. Too much ego, no brains.The Meacham woman is basically an admitted whore. She's disgusting.Justin Posey is a spoiled rich brat who surrounds himself with things to make him look smart, but unfortunately, his ego gets in the way, just like the others.Good docuseries if you can stomach the ignorance and ego.",False
11,3,As disappointing as the true story,Read_this_review_B4,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a story I didn't know, and could have been told in a 2 minute long article. Seriously. And you can tell there isn't enough footage because several time throughout the three episodes the reuse footage, and try to make it seem like it is chronological. Except you can tell that so much of it is out of order as people get older and younger as the talk, especially the one family.Watching this made me as disappointed as all the people who never found the treasure and never got closure. None of the people this documentary follows are the people who find it, and they DO NOT interview the person who did. They attempt to give you closure as one guy finds the spot it WAS buried, and tries to compare sticks and leaves to a photo of sticks and leaves. Then you think the one person is going to buy it at auction... but he doesn't. What a waste of time.Save yourself several hours, because this is a documentary about people who wasted 10 years of their lives and are crushed but pretend they aren't at the end. Save yourself hours.",True
12,1,More Netflux Garbage,TomatoesareRotten,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tells you more about the contemptible attitude that the aforementioned company has for its perceived demographic . To look at the characters ( mainly in the whole ) who chase this nonsense around the same area you , can see that the perpetrator is having many perverse episodes watching this mayhem unfold . There is nothing surprising about how low ( individuals with low IQ's ) will demean themselves in pursuing these whimsies . Some of them are arrested for trespass , stalking , threats to life , etc . Then you have the guy ( who wears a professional uniform in his career ) get bit in the face whilst goading a snake ?!The race to the bottom begins here folks .",False
13,2,A bait and switch,MichelleB-91,n/a,16/08/2025,"The preview shows an exciting story of a stalker thinking the granddaughter was the treasure within the story. The first 2 episodes was a dull boring mess on people deciphering the clues... it is boring and not what I signed up for. Dull characters, how they guessed what the clues were. I came her for the stalker story and not people who keep failing at deciphering clues. It is a snore fest and recommend avoiding, unless you are intriguing about how people waste their lives on solving treasure clues, and are just not the smartest of individuals of an old man acting like a cat and playing with the mice. Never got to the episode about the stalker... it was not worth it.",False

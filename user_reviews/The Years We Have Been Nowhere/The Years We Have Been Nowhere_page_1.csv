1,10,Impressive,felixsiriano,n/a,16/08/2025,"An insightful and moving documentary about migrations and deportation between Europe and Africa, several stories of human beings pushed to leave their country and then to come back, without nothing. A narration of the horrible hypocrisy perpetrated by EU and the West, where human rights appear to be the privilege only of few elected ones. The story of people who try to survive in a world in which the richest oppress the poorest, covering all this horror with the mask of order and civilization, progress, and burocracy. This should be shown in every cinema and every school, to show at least to the new generations all the hypocrisy and mistakes perpetrated by the previous ones, in particular by the West. With the hope that this can change in the future.",False
2,10,Best documentary to understand the current immigrant situation,matteolabate,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lucio and Mauro were able to describe throught the stories of the force repatriations of three African immigrants a more complex and a more scary/sad/worry situation.It is not only a documentary of immigrants but a great and well made report.You can understand how badly and (sadly ) voluntarily it is handle by the Western and African country.What consiguence there are for this immigrants and their family for something that for us westerners it isn't even an issues but simple a choice.They show some aspect of this situation that you will never thought about it. How easily and without much problems the politicans are able to wipe out humans rights. How everything it is going so unditective in our so called ""freedom and humans rights society"" if it wasn't for the amazing jobs and passions of the two directors and the associations that collaborate on this wounderful documentary.It is a must to watch.Just to tell you that after the protection, that I had the fortune to watch, there were a debate with the co director Lucio, but all the peoples in the rooms, me included, were speechless and unable to ask anything for few minutes for all the amount of informations and the shock we expirenced of how bad the situation is.I would love to go in more details but I don't want spoil this well shooted documentary.Do not miss the opportunity to watch it.Thank you again Lucio, Mauro and all the people and associations that helps to produce this piece of arts, for your job, your passion and to fight this unjustice and human rights abuse.",False

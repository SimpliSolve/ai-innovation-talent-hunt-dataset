1,7,Tech bros need a hug,MeadtheMan,n/a,16/08/2025,"These bunker boys may be very intelligent in certain fields, like programming and building things, but oh boy, they're severely deficient in many fields of thinking, such as philosophy, social studies, humanities etc... or maybe just a hug. So, so many holes in their thoughts (whether or not they actually believe them is a separate issue).Example: Sven's counterargument, comparing pictures of armed robbery with another crime, is so absurd that you fail to understand how someone so smart - he was capable of bringing at least part of the internet network to a halt - could exhibit such a lack in reasoning skills. Pictures of the former couldn't do more harm to the robbed while those of the latter could continually wreak a trail of devastating havoc, for one...And freedom? Honey, sorry to disappoint you but pure freedom is a myth. You don't have to look far for that, just look at that bunker of yours, could you do anything that Xennt fundamentally disagrees with without facing any repercussions? No.This kind of toxic libertarian thinking has unfortunately infiltrated most parts of the tech world, and unless we get to the root cause - giving kids a comprehensive education, attention, and placing more emphasis on things that on the surface do not show much monetary or practical value etc - we will have another Xennt, another Musk, another SBF. Nobody is born a tech bro, they're men conditioned to believe that they're saving the world even when they're not.",False
2,1,It should be illegal to claim someones guilt in a doc before the trial and verdict.,brijoh-68529,n/a,16/08/2025,"The first glaring issue is that it is really only a 30-45 minute story, but theye dragged it out to almost two hours with long repeated visual shots and music, showing the same thing over and over sgain. Also, oftentimes the interview topics felt like they were sometimes taken out of context and shoehorned into the narrative the director/producer wanted to portray, which subequently threw off the pacing as well. An example is Sven (no spoilers) being an extreme radical, and their example is a DDoS attack... which is childs play for hackers. Yeah, he committed a DDoS attack, but in terms of hackers thats childs play. If people knew how vulnerable their private information truly is, they would probably advocate for more privacy and security (I found this out the hard way when my identity was stolen), and yet governments are trying to BAN encryption! The movie definitely seems to advocate for a 1984 style ""big brother must see everything to keep us safe"", when people like us law abiding citizens are the ones that get affected the most... Im sure you've all noticed criminals don't care that they're committing crime, therefore its only going to affect us normies. The straw that broke the camels back, us they don't just insinuate but the outright explicitly say he's guilty, and he hasnt been tried in court yet. That should be illegal, but im sure there's a loophole based on their regional laws that Netflix exploited in order to be able to do it.In summary, as a doc buff, I say skip it, unless you want to see if what I said was true. Its uninspired, 2X as long as it should be (or more), its like a made for TV crime show where 65% of the episodes are just repeating the same things, it explicitly calls him guilty when he hasnt had a trial. I mean there are more, but it was so bad I could write a pamphlet, and aint nobody got time for dat. Hopefully this saves some time for someone, or gives them a little better of what to expect without spoilers.",False
3,1,"Pointless, dull, and inconsequential",angelabolen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing happens in this boring waste of time. Nothing. There is no intrigue, no grand reveal, no journalistic integrity, and absolutely no point! I seriously wonder what kind of brain dead moron made this steaming pile of BORING! They can't figure out pacing, there not a drop of narrative structure. I just have never hated a documentary more. I started watching knowing nothing about the content and somehow I know less now than before. Just a big giant shame on the loser that made this movie. All the cool things in the world to investigate and you chose to talk about some lunatics who live in a bunker sometimes. Ugh!",False

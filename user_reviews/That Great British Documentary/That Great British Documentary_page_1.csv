1,3,"Interesting viewpoint, at the least",cakese24,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI wasn't planning on reviewing until seeing the only review given was slightly biased in its tone.It's steady cam most of the time, but Joan literally says she's a documentary-maker right at the start of it.She speaks of her close relationship with her father, whom was white and where she got her love for film-making and documentary film. She speaks of how helpful he was to her, and about his career. She's also quite abrasive in tone, so I understand why most people wouldn't necessarily find the narrator sympathetic.She also is given permission to catch her father's death on film, not something you necessarily want to watch unless informed beforehand.Not to say it's explicit, but she does state fairly early on it's to express her desire to explore death and her fresh mourning of her father.Although it does take you out of the real-time viewing when she's speaking of mourning and simultaneously editing shots for her documentary.I watched nearly 7 minutes before skipping ahead, since she starts following protests and was more about finding out about where her West Indies ancestry coming into play with how different countries perceive her skin tone and culture, and I have seen more cohesive documentary series which capture the same, and my addition was merely to offset the fairly unkind review left, which seemed to go slightly askew with it's suppositions.If you like art films and biopics, this may be a good study piece, otherwise it is very raw footage.",True
2,1,Why is British in Title??? Also Not a Documentary AT ALL....Narcissists exploring a debilitating Identity Crisis,dpmillerllc,n/a,15/08/2025,"I refuse to call this a film or documentary it's really just a blog or video diary documenting random feelings thoughts and emotions on a daily basis. Also includes some revisionist / fabricated history. The title has nothing to do with the actual content of this video... it's very misleading. Every word of the title is either disingenuous or dishonest. There's nothing Great about this video. There is nothing inherently British about her black/white identity crisis. And it's definitely not a documentary it's more like the thoughts and emotions related to her half black / half white identity. Exploring what that means has nothing to do with the documentary field. It could have maybe been interesting if she explored and was honest about the film. Why half black and half white individuals have such a difficult time with their identity in both the United States and I guess in britain. Possibly, why these individuals go on to be the most militant, Pro black activists? Is it to compensate for half of their identity being white? And why is it in the West mixed individuals always identify black and not mixed? And why is the white half of their identity not recognized? It goes for public figures as well you never hear about Barack Obama's White mother. Anyways it could have been interesting but it was another boring piece of narcissistic video making that filmmakers of a previous generation would be absolutely ashamed and embarrassed to present. The thought of them turning the camera on themselves was inconceivable. Those are the true British documentarians. Not this confusing therapy session that should have been worked out one-on-one with a psychologist not over the BBC storyville medium.",False

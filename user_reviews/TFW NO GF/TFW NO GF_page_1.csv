1,5,A fairly shallow look at,natecarlson-331-691523,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is novel that this documentary follows a few men in the incel subculture over a period of a few years, but the film is mostly lacking narrative or statement.Instead, we are presented with a collage of clips platforming the subjects' ideas. They do offer some insightful thoughts about consumer culture and the way young men are expected to behave in our society, but the men also spread some blatantly misogynistic or racist ideology, the latter presented caged in a flimsy veneer of ""satire"" (a term which those in the subculture misinterpret to mean transgressing for the sake of transgressing, rather than using irony to make a larger point).Personally, I felt that the misogyny and racism were brushed off too easily in favour of humanising the subjects. That may be the best approach for reconciling these sorts of men with society, but it means that we end up with a fairly shallow look into the subculture that only briefly references the hate and extremism it has generated. You get the impression that the incel community is mostly a place for commiseration and that those within it eventually graduate to more typical lives. This is probably true of many, maybe even most, but it still misses an important fact.At one point, we see a brief clip from the Toronto Van Attack (an act of misogynist terrorism that took place in Canada's largest city in 2018), but its roots in incel fora are not explained at all. The perpetrator was a member of the incel community, and he and other domestic terrorists like him have been idolized in some incel circles since. One could argue that this film is about the less extreme members of the community, and that the hateful acts of extreme factions are for another movie. Frankly though, to me it feels irresponsible to spend so much time in the subculture without directly addressing the fact that it has spawned domestic terrorism.My advice: give this one a miss. If you want to know more about the incel subculture, listen to the CBC podcast about the Toronto Van Attack, I found it much more enlightening.",False
2,6,A good documentary but could've have done more,Black_Yoshi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I actually never knew that a documentary like this existed. I later ended up having this playing in the background while working on the project. It turns out that the whole film is well produced and pretty much professionally made. I feel like the way it was edited has great form of quality and entertainment to the table. Additionally, I do find the overall topic for the documentary to be important due to how more complicated it has become overtime. On top of that, it can potentially spread to multiple people in society. It can also perhaps bring this topic to the older generations who are not super familiar with the community group online and make them understand the issue.However, the biggest problem that I have with the documentary is the fact that they didn't interview enough people. I mean, having a number of people being interviewed in the film feels a bit underwhelming. I wish that we could hear from other people like professional psychologists or something like that. We would almost hear different sides of stories and allow the audience to decide what they believe in. For example, would they be empathizing more towards the ones who speak out about the issue or would they focus more on the stats and possible solutions? Otherwise, this documentary, to me, comes off a bit biased whether or not it's intentional.",False
3,5,OK,take2docs,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey are said to exist at the fringes of society, unseen by the majority of car-owners, careerists, and married couples. They tend to be looked down upon and are called by any number of disparaging terms. The news media often portrays them as antisocial misfits and misogynists, if not outright potential domestic terrorists. Sexually inactive and mostly unemployed, not surprisingly do they suffer from depression; some are even suicidal. And contrary to unpopular belief, they are found not so much inside places of worship as in singles bars, drowning their sorrows, or at home alone, wallowing in front of a computer monitor, perhaps on the digital hunt for a mail-order bride.For a brief period, I was interested in learning all I could about the whole 'InCel' phenomenon. For those who don't know, 'InCel' is short for 'involuntary celibate.' Enter TFW NO GF (a portmanteau, not to be confused with 'WWG1WGA,' that now dwindling if not totally defunct social movement).Here we have a documentary that takes a neutral look at this, some would say, pathetic yet nevertheless semi-intriguing subculture, comprised of 'beta' males thought to be envious of successful ladykillers who populate the alpha-laden 'manosphere.'Funny, that in our generally enlightened, supposedly civilized, 21st-century society there exists adult males who still think in hierarchal terms, a hierarchy based in mythical social Darwinism. Personally, I also consider it an arbitrary benchmark of a patriarchal society that believes no adult male is a 'man' (that is to say, of equal human value) unless they've acquired home ownership and experienced parenthood. Biological facts notwithstanding, where is that written in our holy books?Call me a bleeding heart, but I'm frequently sympathetic towards human interest stories featuring people who find themselves near or at the very bottom of the so-called social ladder, often due to circumstances beyond their control. Some of these social outcasts may be found sleeping on park benches; others inside their vehicles; still others in their parents' basements. Over in Italy, for example, cynics disparagingly label the latter a 'Big Bambino' (Big Baby), in reference to a single man over thirty who still lives with his mother...as opposed to his being married to a mother-substitute.In my book, no one else's opinion of your worth as a human being ought to matter. Self-esteem comes from within. Which brings me to one thing about InCels I simply do not understand: why it is so many of them are self-loathing? To me, you're only a 'loser' if you yourself think you are. Why should having no car, no job, and no physical girlfriend make you a worthless individual? All it makes you is carless, jobless, and a masturbator.Which leads me to an observation concerning the few InCels featured in this film -- it seems to me they're lacking a sense of the divine in their lives, a spiritual outlook. No wonder they feel empty inside. Life is meaningless only if you think it to be. Incidentally, it is this very nihilistic mindset and attitude which the terrestrial powers-that-be and their superhuman overlords want people -- young ones especially -- to adopt. Sadly, as the InCel subculture has shown, many a (post-)Millennial thinks life is pointless and that they're inhuman unpersons simply for being socially awkward and/or socioeconomic failures.That there are no Chads or Stacys in the film is no surprise, but there is a Sean, a Charls, and a Kyle. InCels have personal names, after all, as I'm pretty sure virgins who inhabit monasteries do as well.Admittedly, however, Sean, Charls, and Kyle don't have much to say of interest. They tell of their belonging to an online message board where 'NEETs' and other pessimistic lost souls gather to exchange posts and swap sob stories. For the most part, the interviewees in TFW NO GF are uninteresting subjects, with nothing all that insightful to say about their worldview and situation, although I did enjoy listening to 'Kantbot,' a book-learned fellow who at one time was apparently quite popular among the InCel online community. Still, it would've been nice to have heard from one or two social commentators or sociologists, but like the InCel subculture itself, the film keeps to a very insular tone.Definitely a doc not for everybody; a film likely to appeal only to plus-thirty, floundering cellar-dwellers and their love dolls, like the reclusive dude in ""Rent-A-Pal"" (2020), a man simply in want of social intercourse, a lay, and a friend. Is that so much to ask?",True
4,4,"Had potential, misses the mark",adamwinfield,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is essentially a collection of scattered thoughts from its mainly stereotypically 'emo' characters and lacks a coherent narrative for the viewer to latch onto. There was an opportunity here to show mainstream viewers how interesting and even impactful this subculture really is, and only during Kantbot's segments do we get a frustratingly brief glimpse of this.Because of the characters featured and the choice of style over substance (flashing Wojak up on the screen every time a loser says something sad is not deep), normie viewers will sadly go away with the same 'incel' caricature this documentary seemed as if it was attempting to humanize.",False
5,1,Why was this made?,LubosV-88171,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't understand the point of this documentary. All of the characters were just normal twenty something year old's for the most part. The only difference was that the filmmaker and characters are comply unaware of how normal they really are so they just moped around and created one of the most boring pointlessly constructed films I've ever seen.,False
6,10,Revealing and intriguing,ld-00182,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am always interested in learning about the various groups and subcultures that have developed on the internet since the early 2000's. This film goes beyond the nerdy and depressing ""incel"" culture and really explores why youth are drawn to these communities. I appreciate the neutrality of this work. Give it a watch. For what it is 10/10",False
7,1,Twitter users review 4chan,vica-7-731236,n/a,16/08/2025,"Featuring bunch of twitter addicts that spent one hour on /b/ one time and took the best memes they could find and posted on their twitter for likes. Sad excuse for a """"""documentary"""""".",False
8,10,a time capsule touching the timeless,t-g-and-m-mowing,n/a,16/08/2025,"The portioning of one's online and offline personas, and the consequences of this, are well displayed in this documentary. It is a mirror for me in some ways, and probably a mirror for anyone who spends a good amount of time in online, pseudonymous communities.On the one hand, these communities can lead one to be maladapted in the offline world where words and actions have much greater social consequences. Or these communities could really help you work through some issues and ideas that no one else wants to touch irl. The thing is, with a phone or pc, you ostensibly get to pick your poison. You can choose to follow nihilistic or despairing threads and accounts, or go in the opposite direction. But we do not always do what we want to do. Looking into the abyss has never been easier, nor more encouraged.As anywhere else, there is a pressure to fit in, even when anonymous. So people, especially young, disenfranchised people, tend to take on the belief systems and attitudes of the strongest voices of in their online crowd. Boys are raising boys. There is an understanding and commiseration with one an others situation that is deep, but perhaps a lack of knowing how to improve that situation; an abundance of depressing data, and a lack of life experience. The typical old man mentor probably has plenty life experience, and forgot the data. Thesis, antithesis. Synthesis.Ariel Pink did a good job with the score. Noticed some variations on a few classics. John Maus's music is always a treat.",False
9,2,My Review,adevet-63841,n/a,16/08/2025,"This may have been a sort-of grungy look into incel subculture and their rancid online homes. Unfortunately it'll have to be JUST a look, as all audio seems to be recorded on a 1987 walkman, and put into the documentary without levelling. Most of the people sound like they are in an _actual_ pit of despair, and speaking from the bottom while the mike is hung in another county. Combined with footage that wildly oscillates between 'fair' and 'filmed on a second hand iphone 5' this is borderline unwatchable and unusable as a podcast. How this got past selection on a fairly prestigious film festival is completely beyond me. It wouldn't even pass as a first-year filmclub test project.",False
10,1,Train cancelled,markbeetson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Myself and the wife have used TFW twice in May, first time was wrexham to Birmingham international to get our flight to Crete. Travelled from Wrexham on the 30th April for our 7 am flight on the 1st was staying overnight. Before we left wrexham I saw a notice ref train strikes on the 8th May our return date, I asked the girl in the ticket office at Wrexham would we be okay on the return train on the 8th ,I was told yes as TFW aren't on strike. On our return to Birmingham international there was no trains from Birmingham international or New street to Wrexham due to strikes. We got told if we got to Wolverhampton TFW are running from there. We'd been up and on the road since 9am ,so stayed overnight in Birmingham at our own cost. Tried to claim it back but they are all blaming each other.The weekend of 24th May we travelled to London for2 nights due to return the 26th at 19:03 from Euston,I checked my phone to check for train updates and found no trains running from Birmingham to Wrexham again TFW .We returned to Euston at 15:00 to see how we could get home. We had to get a train at 16:22 to Birmingham and then get the Manchester train to Wolverhampton then Bus replacement to Shrewsbury and train to Wrexham from Shrewsbury.",False
11,8,Generation defining for a specific type of people,seaneboy-35546,n/a,16/08/2025,"You see what's in this documentary everyday when you've grown up with the internet. And not only does this doc cover the common mindsets and themes of this subculture well, it also sticks to the atmosphere of said subculture while explaining it. Its a painfully beautiful thing to see these people at these points in their lives but at least they're going through it together. But hey, we're all gonna make it. Right?",False
12,9,Sweeping the monsters from under the bed,mrbrownindeed-37383,n/a,16/08/2025,"In every other aspect of life people are treated as individuals and not held accountable for the actions of other loosely related people.For the first time ever i think this topic has been covered with some humanity instead of purposefully trying to demonise the subjects.The world seems increasingly more bland and alienating for a massive portion of the population, its liberating to actually have somebody give a voice to that and allow some of these people to speak.The internet is definitely the modern equivalent of subculture, however vague and ill defined it might be. This film attempts to capture this point in history in a open minded and often beautiful way.I hope in the future people view this Documentary in the same way that we view Penelope Spheeris' ""Decline of Western Civilization"".
It definitely deserves it.",False
13,10,An important step forward,jordanowen-108-394436,n/a,16/08/2025,"Five years ago, when woke PC culture was the law of the land, the idea that a movie like this would get released- much less acclaimed by SXSW- would have been unheard of. Now, people are starting to understand that there is a very real problem of white men who feel abandoned by society and unable to compete in the modern world. The men seen in this documentary are not unlike the hikikomori, Japanese men who are unemployed and lead isolated, loveless, friendless lives.PC culture would have us all believe that being a white male sets you up for life and that any claims a white man might have to being disaffected or depressed are to be chortled at and spat upon. This is not the case. There are a great many men out there who are falling through the cracks and failing to realize their potential. It is not an endorsement of Nazism or the KKK to say that we need to start taking this epidemic seriously and from the vantage of sympathy and support for these men, not casting them as demonic cyber villains out to destroy women and minorities.Kudos to the filmmakers for letting these men have their say. May they find hope, success and love. May the world at large finally learn to have sympathy for them and stop dismissing them based on their sex and race. You know, sexism and racism.",False
14,10,Let's goooooooooo,alexleemoyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing score, brilliant editing, compelling subject matter. A call back to the 70s cinema before documentary school of yore reminiscent of Ross McElwee's ""Sherman's March"" or Spheeris' ""Decline of Western Civilization."" An unflinching portrait of a little understood subculture.We're all gonna make it.",False
15,9,Interesting doc definitely worth a watch,jbeth-19780,n/a,16/08/2025,Interesting look at incels that isn't filtered through media sensationalism and fear mongering. Looks at the conditions that created the subculture and what the people inside actually have to say,False

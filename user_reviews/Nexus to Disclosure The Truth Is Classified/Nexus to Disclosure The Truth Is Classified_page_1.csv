1,6,They Don't Understand... Yet... but,hessmontj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its fine to question information which leads to the validity of vessels and entities, not considered to be the result of the works of mankind.The issue however, is the ability of such inquisitors to completely ignore the documented history of such vessels and entities, being well defined throughout Biblical texts.Further, that those same texts predict that such vessels and entities shall emerge upon this earth, in mankind's final days. Additionally, that those entities which emerge, are defined as being in opposition to one another. (Aka the two witnesses VS the false profit defined through Revelation 9 to 11.The assumption that these vessels and entities are somehow the works of alien kind outside our universe is interesting, but mostly incorrect.Testimony from Naval pilots indicate that these vessels defy the principals of our dimensional universe. Further, they identify vessels that have the ability to jump across dimensions as pilots testify to them disappearing in an instant, opposed to flying out of our atmosphere.Extra-dimensional travel is yet another subject defined within Biblical texts.Therefore viewers should keep these things in mind while watching this film.",False

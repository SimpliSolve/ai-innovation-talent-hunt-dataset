1,8,A beautiful film,melsed_009,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not sure where I first came across his pictures but, I do know it before 2020. I assumed he was a new artist. All of his work seemed modern. But, then I saw the picture of Yul Brynner and I realized how old these photographs must be. This story seems so modern too. Like, something that would be written today. His art all throughout makes the movie all the more stunning. It's amazing how far back things went after his day! Not just the photography, either. I'm so glad they got to talk to people who were actually there as well. A great piece of queer history. I would gladly show this those who think these thing didn't exist ""back then"".",False
2,10,An amazing piece of history,seanbeardsley,n/a,16/08/2025,Wow!! What a beautiful film about an amazing artist. If you are offended by the male nude then turn away. There is nothing remotely pornographic about this documentary but there is plenty of black and white male nudity. But if you are a lover of phenomenal photography and art then this may be just for you. I had never heard of George before watching this but I was captivated by his creativity and amazing eye. As a lover of history and art I admit I am ashamed that I had never heard of George before watching this. The photographs taken 80-90 years ago are truly beautiful. Nothing but admiration for such a fearless soul and talented artist. Watch and enjoy!,False

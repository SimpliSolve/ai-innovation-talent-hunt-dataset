1,6,"honest review , from someone who actually watched it",Snakeskinzjr,n/a,16/08/2025,"To watch this documentary , you had to pay $10.00 and watch online. I doubt that all these 1-3 star reviews bothered to pay for it , when they obviously dispise the materiel in the film. Nick Searcy got some good interviews and footage from the jan 6th rally that you have never seen before. The amount of people that attended the rally was massive. The footage of the actual event doesnt lie, you may not like it but it is original. I really liked the interview with dr. Simone Gold who i am familiar with , as she has been a frontline doctor during covid. The other interviews were well done also and you will learn more than you know about jan 6th by watching. The bad part for me was some of the filler Nick did was a bit cheesy and not needed, iI also thought that the interview whith Ashli Babitts husband was a bit long. Overall a good documentary, would reccommend.",False
2,7,Not the greatest documentary but way too much presented for it to be fake,davwatto77,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOnce you watch it you ask the question how did this go unreported?Nick interviews a not insignificant number of people who attended, there are other interviews but I focused on the people who claimed to have been there. They are real people not actors and even the simplest of searches reveals this.There are some claims with respect to timing of events/speeches and corresponding incidents at the capitol building which raise an eyebrow or two.If the footage was faked, then why fake so much of it?",True
3,7,Clearly none of these negetive reviews actually watched it,netflixry,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's pretty obvious from the very few negative reviews of this video that those people never actually watched it. Their reviews aren't reviews at all, but are just the typical troll comments you'd see under any right of center Youtube video. They obviously just don't like that a real perspective from the people who were actually there is being presented, because it spits in the face of the leftist lies, so instead of watching the video and giving an honest critique, they simply leave childish comments about it, and convince themselves it's not glaringly obvious to everyone else that they never watched the documentary at all.This documentary isn't exactly a high budget Hollywood production. It's just low budget, but full of extremely honest and candid interviews with the people who were actually there on January 6th. It clearly outlines how the mainstream media and members of the left have been lying about what actually happened that day, as well as the days since. Much of the information in the video you already know, but I assure you, much of it you have never been allowed to see until now. Give it a watch, put your biases aside, and decide for yourself if your government and the mainstream media has been telling you the truth. If you can do that, I think it's safe to say you'll realize you've been lied to this whole time.",False
4,10,Eye-opening,Draconius_S,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary that shows what happened to some of those that were there on Jan. 6th. It is not state sponsored, so it contains footage people may not have seen before on that day.",False
5,10,Finally! Some truth,sunsplusmoons,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've read the negative comments, its absolutely unimaginable that people can be so ignorant that they would believe every single thing a cnn news anchor tells them (or msnbc, or fox) but would then flat out REFUSE to listen to people who were there. Who actually lived it. Nick did an excellent job.",False
6,n/a,Finally the truth.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a revelation. I always suspected from day one that January 6th was a setup, and this footage proves it. Forget the narrative, just watch... it's all there before your eyes. And on and it goes.",False
7,10,Great documentary! A must watch b/c this could happen to any one of us.,BirdOfBatonRouge,n/a,16/08/2025,Great documentary! A must watch b/c this could happen to any one of us. What they have done to just everyday ordinary people who love this country is frightening.,False
8,9,Intellectual honesty should make anyone at least interested,forourclassuse,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the documentary may not be in the level of the best documentaries of our time, if only for giving the credible ""other side"" of the one-sided story being pushed by the mainstream institutions - news media, government, social media, etc - this film deserves applause.The first time I heard the word ""insurrection"" being used to accompany the video (from MSM, of course), I almost fell out of my seat. I told myself, ""You've got to be kidding me!"" I may not agree with everything that Trump and Trump supporters do or say, but I am one who believes that people in power need to be more responsible with the power they hold.To be specific, I expect MSM to be more responsible with the words they use to BOTH depict the TRUTH and BRING ABOUT UNITY. Instead, what the MSM did here was not only to spread a blatant lie (insurrections are planned and well-equipped - HELLO!!!!), they were clearly disuniting the American people by becoming mouthpieces of one political party which, day by day - we are not seeing it seems - actually hate the values traditionally upheld by America.This film counterbalances what MSM deliberately missed out and, thus, brings us closer to the TRUTH of WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED on January 6. And it seems like it was not what Biden and Harris said it was. Pearl Harbor and 9/11? Come on, man - have some respect.",False
9,5,I don't like it so it must be fake,jameswinny,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh my goodness the footage they show is so realistic you could almost believe it. However, I don't like what they're saying or what they show in this documentary so I will give it a bad rating and tell everybody it's really bad. There's far too much video evidence to be taken seriously. Surely if this was real then the authorities/government/president/police force would do something about it. So it must be fake.",False
10,10,Even Mr Magoo could see the fake news,sitstech,n/a,16/08/2025,Great documentary exposing truths what the fake news and the big tech and political party don't want you seeing.Keep battling on patriots the truth always shines through ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸,False
11,10,Hollywood is not 100% Broken,GraveyardWalker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good on Nick for having the GUTS to make this movie, and SHAME on the people who *refuse* to watch this with a critical eye and make their own INFORMED decisions based on what is right in front of them...that millions of people actually witnessed/experienced. Tens of thousands of these people had their phones out recording these events AS THEY HAPPENED...of course, the media and ""others"" have made MANY of them too afraid to come forward and show their personal footage-but it DOES exist out there if you're willing to look, instead of watching the films shown to you by ""The Man in the High Tower.""",False
12,10,The other side of the story omitted or obfuscated by the major media.,lethalwlaw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ironic reading two of the negative reviews, attempting to mock this documentary by stating ""Goebels would be proud..."" and that the documentary only shows ""one voice"" or one perspective. Members of the left love their labels and their mocking which uses supposition to shield faulty logic from examination. The media has been presenting ""one voice"" consistently for over a year. This film is the story of the people that were there, not a siloed narrative. The video of Ashli Babbitt is sobering as she is shot point blank by a capitol police officer (who has been cleared by Garland's and Biden's DOJ as a ""self defense"" shooting). Eye witness accounts which cuts across the progressive narrative which the DNC is pushing unabated as we witness immense policy and personal failures by Biden, Harris, Pelosi and their ilk.",False
13,10,Hit the nail on the head,macguyver-12726,n/a,16/08/2025,"All i can say is well done! To all the sheep out there ,watch and you might learn something ......................................................like THE TRUTH !",False
14,10,Great film! Watch this if you want the truth!,cwhistorylover,n/a,16/08/2025,The real truth about the events of 1/6/21 as told by people who were there. Highly recommended! Ignore the low rated reviews. Everyone who wants to know the truth should watch this!,False
15,10,The truth,christopherblanks,n/a,16/08/2025,See video and testimony from people who were there that you won't see or hear in the January 6th committee hearings. What you will get here is the undeniable truth to what happened that day...and it's scary to believe this could happen and they could get away with it.,False
16,9,This film represents hundreds of thousands of people who were gathered with no violent intentions. Why must they twist a peaceful protest into something that it is not?,cnichol3,n/a,16/08/2025,99 more possibly I should say 98% supposedly of people who gathered on January 6th we're not violent protesters but instead were peacefully protesting in a proper manner. We are being told over and over again that there were violent protests meanwhile most of the protesters were invited in by the police. Something doesn't add up here and it seems to me that it is coming down to the types of situations that we see in many socialist and Communist States particularly dictatorships circa China's tiananmen square. This film brings to light a lot of information that has been corroborated by multiple authenticators and is exceptional in it's detail.,False
17,10,Watch the whole video.,bob-99901,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's important to see this. Make up your own mind. It raises some very serious questions. While not of ""Hollywood"" quality, what it lacks there, it more than makes up for with things that make you frown and ""hmmmm.......""",False
18,10,Great documentary,ribbons-05153,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerWatched the documentary and it shows the illegal activity of the capitol police and opens up how they allowed people in and then charged them with crimes after opening doors and letting them walk through while they took pictures and then went the FBI after them to charge with trespassing. It was very indepth and the poor people that were hunted down and arrested for just being outside the building was crazy! I wanted to know what happened and this showed so much of what was going on. Can't wait for the second one to come out and hope that it is soon. Good job Nick Searcy for taking the time to do this and hope it helps those that have been incarcerated for years without being treated as humans let alone American Citizens.,True
19,10,See It And Believe It,nlathy-839-300677,n/a,16/08/2025,Somehow this movie slipped under the radar for me. Nick Searcy is an excellent director and actor. This film is another winner. Wasn't expecting Twisted Sister in a movie about J6. Somehow it all works. Dark humor is mixed in with the telling of a disturbing story. Yet it needs to be seen to inform those out of the loop. And it's a reminder why the fight for freedom must continue.,False
20,8,"It must be fake, because the government isn't responding to it? really, that's your reasoning...",msmacomber,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's not a big budget Hollywood production. It is more truthful than any Michael Moore production. That said, there is only 2 areas in the film that I saw as staged. 1) When interviewing a senior woman in her home and the cameras were already inside her home looking from her perspective when Nick comes in the door. And 2) The collage at the end of the movie of some of the people at the end of their interviews singing a/o dancing to 'Ain't gonna take it anymore'. Which means it was planned from the beginning. This doesn't make this a fake. To me just questionable in some areas. Scenes from the Capitol grounds are real. The actions of individuals there are real. Yes, it is puzzling why the government isn't reacting to these images in an investigory(?) manor. Or they are, have, and are suppressing it for some reason. To me, the blatant over reaction by the FBI to raiding American citizens at their homes for going to a protest is inexcusable. If you know where they live and a simple record check can tell you if they are a violent criminal type, why the overreaction. Yes, be cautionary, but also realistic, are these criminals? I would like to see a sequel movie, say after 1 year, about the follow-up investigation of incidents and instigators documented in this movie. Not to spoil the movie, watch it yourself and make up your own mind. Like it or not, you cannot honestly critique it until you've seen it.",True
21,10,Wake Up real America,c-renner2010,n/a,16/08/2025,"The America some of us have served and loved has been under attack for decades. There are so many influences trying to change our way of life and have successfully destroyed most of what we served to defend. As an American, husband, father and veteran I can tell you this country needed a wakeup call long ago. There are very few that are willing to stand up against the cancel culture, woke movement, blah..blah being pushed by the America hating movements, governments, billionaires, etc. Our US Government that is intended to be of the people and for the people is full of America hating snakes. Open your eyes and your ears and stop being a sheep in the slaughter of American Freedom and liberty.",False
22,10,"Watch this gem of truth, then make up your own mind",chuckni,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an appropriate and timely viewing given the demeanor of the current ""kangaroo court"" going on to try to convict many people regarding January 6th. The entire hearing process is a joke, which you will readily be enlightened to by watching this documentary.",False

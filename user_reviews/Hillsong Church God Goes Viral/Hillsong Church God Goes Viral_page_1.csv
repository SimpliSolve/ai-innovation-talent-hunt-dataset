1,2,There is nothing here,electiangelus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Two stars because it was shot well. After the first episode I just turned it off. There is nothing here, no expose no nothing. Playing sad music isn't a scandal. They are preaching a sad story that Jesus died for you sins so I find it fitting, you find that in any church. This documentary had to be made by someone who has a personal vendetta against this church. There are some seriously bad people in the evangelical circles but I found nothing here. Id like the chunk of my life back I spent auditing the first episode of this documentary. There are no victims, no nothing. Just a story about sad music you will get in any church you go to. Amazing grace is more depressing then this.",False
2,10,Fantastic balanced capture of a rising religious movement,sarahdrmmnd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely brilliant documentary. Beautifully shot.This film captures the story and uprising of Hillsong succinctly in this BBC Storyville. You can see the effort that went into making this film, years of work to follow the stories of the individuals in it.Without sensationalising the content the director showcases several peoples stories and their journey into hill song.Whilst you respect the good it has done for people in bringing them community and support which the director purposefully includes, the film also shows the other side of Hillsong opening your eyes to the background of the founders/prominent members and their lives, the money making side of Hillsong as a business and some of the cult like approaches to growing it's membership.I think this film does a good job of respectfully showing how Hillsong works, highlighting key questions that need asked of organisations like this. The talent here is in the director not sensationalising the content, just capturing it as it is.Great doc. Deserves an award.",False

1,3,To one sided,garethduff,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great true story,poorly told. Go listen to the podcast. This story has some huge characters and we don't learn very much about them. Really disappointing.",False
2,8,True Crime Doc,billcr12,n/a,16/08/2025,I heard a podcast with the priest and the writer of a book on the robbery and it led me to this film. Where is the $5 of the $7 million??? It is likely that it wound up with the IRA in Belfast. My partially Irish and all Catholic background gives me a perspective and understanding of the need for the IRA. The fight for freedom is never without blood. Father Moloney is the biggest mystery here and needs a film of his own. The cast of characters is amazing and I highly recommend Holy Heist.,False
3,9,A great story well told,david_garland29,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had known about this story from listening to a podcast on RTE and it actually interviewed Sam Miller, where he doesn't feature in this documentary. However it's still very good and most of the other main players are involved. You get a good feel for how things where in New York back in the 80's/90's in regards to the IRA and how IRA members were smuggled into America and integrated into society with the help of local Cops and Judges. It also shines light on how the IRA fundraised on the East Coast of America. A must see if recent Irish history interests you.",False
4,8,good l√•rd...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"They even call it howly, the heist...a piece of american-irish crime story thjat happened before the age of internet, therefore a secret to me, as norway then newsed mostly norwegian, and foreign politics, not crimes(except the o.j. Story)may they have'd fun with them money, it was a party to watch this documentary, and the grumpy old man recommends a round on the house to that.",False
5,10,Gripping,chasdflynn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie keeps you pinned to your seat for the entire length. It is a true crime story with characters that one would assume were created out of a very vivid imagination. The Priest, gives you the distinct feeling he could not possibly be a true to life person, but indeed he exists. The story line is gripping with lots of twists and turns. The outcome is never a certainty. Do not deny yourself a great evening enjoying it!",False

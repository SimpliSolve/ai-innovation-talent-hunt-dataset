1,10,A film to inspire exploration,williamgladstone-65583,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an inspiring story of Jill Heinerth's journey to becoming the world's most accomplished and respected cave-diver. It's a highly dangerous yet essential profession that is providing science with a new and revealing understanding of the world's underground aquatic ecosystems. Director Nays Baghai skilfully unfolds Jill's personal journey from her realization, as a young girl, that her path in life was to explore, her near-death experiences and the impact of these on her relationships and approach to fear, and her passion to inspire exploration in young people. Nays shows us Jill's story through interviews, animations, flash-backs, archival footage, re-enactments, and beautiful cinematography. The re-enactments are especially powerful and frightening. The scenes of divers swimming through enormous underwater caverns, deep beneath the Earth's surface, are magically lit and beautiful to watch. Jill's telling of her amazing life is honest, humble and down-to-earth, contrasting vividly with her technical skills and the dangerous environment she loves. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in stories about human endeavour, personal limits, and exploration.",False
2,10,Breathtaking!,callasrn,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full disclosure! I have listened to Jill Heinerth's book ""Into the Planet"" so I was very familiar with Jill's story, her book being one of my top 5 favorite books of all time! So I was very excited when I heard about Diving Into the Darkness! I was going to watch it and enjoy it because I have an incredible respect and admiration for Jill! However, my expectations were not very high in terms of production but I hoped the director will be able to do justice to Jill's incredible story and accomplishments!Well, I was blown away by the cinematography and the whole production of this documentary! The visuals are stunning, the way the director Nays Baghai was able to tell the story is really impressive! Knowing the story told, as I watched the documentary, my heart was pounding and I was astonished by how he was able to convey the drama of the situation that was happening in a very difficult place to film! The soundtrack of the film is equally impressive! It truly gives the viewer, along with the visuals, the feeling of being in those caves with Jill! One of my friends who is not a diver and watched the documentary, said he almost had a panic attack watching, it felt so real to him! Also we are ICU nurses so can take a lot to make us panic!Someone who has never heard of Jill Heinerth and stumbles upon this documentary, will be able at the end of it, to understand just how incredible of a person Jill is! On purpose I am not calling Jill a woman because in our society, somehow when you call someone a woman, you diminish the accomplishment! She is great for being a woman! No, she is a freaking incredible human being who has and is doing things, that don't seem humanly possible, showing incredible guts and strength, while displaying kindness and gentleness that you don't expect to come from someone such ""BAD ASS!! So, thank you to everyone involved in this production and specially to the director Nays Beghai for being able to tell Jill's story in such stunning way! It was so worth the wait!The production team created an incredible piece of history and any first place award is very much deserved! I hope a Golden Globe and an Oscar is coming!",False

4,10,Captivating and beautifully shot doco,priscillaouvrier,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed Diving into the Darkness. A friend encouraged me to see it and I wasn't sure whether I would like a film about cave diving given I tend to feel a little uncomfortable in enclosed spaces and I am not a scuba diver myself. However, I thought this was a fabulous documentary - the story was captivating and the cinematography was stunning. The subject is niche but the film was so well done that it appeals to anyone regardless of whether they are interested in cave diving or not. The film's heroine, Jill Heinerth, is someone who likes to push the boundaries in her quest for adventure and knowledge. She is an inspirational person and the film does a wonderful job of explaining what she does, why she does it and how her data collection adds to the understanding of the world around us. The film maker did an excellent job in putting this film together - the way the story is told through the words and imagery plus the use of animation intertwined in the story make it super interesting and the suspense has you on the edge of your seat. If you are a diver you must see this film. If you love documentaries you must see this film. If you just like a great, inspirational story about a trailblazing woman you must see this film. I highly recommend it to anyone young and old.",False
5,10,A remarkable film about a remarkable woman.,mo-97876,n/a,16/08/2025,"Superbly conceived, shot and directed - a fitting exploration and celebration of the life and drivers of an extraordinary human being. The underwater footage is just gorgeous. And the way the film managed to thread so many disparate elements (footage from different eras, re-enactments, animation, photos, diagrams, interviews, narrative, commentary, incidents, music) into such a seamless whole, all while keeping storytelling and heart at the absolute centre of the film, was beautifully done. I was riveted throughout. And I learned a heap - it really is another world in those cave systems. An alien planet within the one we think we know. A remarkable film about a remarkable woman. Highly recommend.",False
6,10,Compelling storytelling,craigbruceyoung,n/a,16/08/2025,"What sets this documentary apart from others in the adventure doco genre is the compelling storytelling and production quality.I'm not especially a documentary fan and know nothing of cave-diving, but this was absolutely gripping entertainment (at times heart in your mouth stuff), beautifully shot and edited.An amazing portrayal of what drives an individual to risk their life in the pursuit of exploration and pushing the boundaries of human endurance.One could easily believe this was made with a $20 million budget, but it was almost certainly made on a shoestring.The fact that this was made by a director in his twenties is almost unbelievable.",False
7,3,Meh...,davecox604,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this film in theatres, screening as part the Vancouver International Mountain Film Festival. It was extremely underwhelming. The essential problem with the film is they decided to make a film about underwater cave diving without having any significant film footage of underwater cave diving. Honestly! The near-entirety of the film is spent telling stories about Jill Heinerth's previous diving expeditions from years ago, for which there is no spectacular or even notable film footage. Thus a large portion of the film is told using extended cartoon animation sequences, so that the viewers will have something to look at besides Jill herself simply telling her stories. Even then, much of the film is just this, Jill speaking - which also suffers from the fact that it's all entirely scripted. Ms. Heinerth does a fine job with reading her lines, but she does not have any particular talent for storytelling. She is possibly the greatest underwater expedition cave diver on the planet however! If only this film could show me the astounding places she's been to! Instead it was 90 minutes of 'dramatic re-enactment' footage, some brief archive footage from decades past, and animated storytelling. In this age of mind-blowing 4K go-pro and drone footage, this film seriously lacks ANY significant cinematography or film footage at all. Ms. Heinerth's story might make for a good book, but as a film, I'm really not sure why they decided to make it into one.",False
8,10,"Suspenseful, moving, awe-inspiring",lusierra,n/a,16/08/2025,"Diving into the Darkness takes you to another world deep below the earth's surface and one into which most humans will never venture. This gripping documentary about cave diving is so much more than an exploration of one of the most dangerous of human activities; it is also the captivating story of one woman's determined purpose to push the boundaries of scientific knowledge in a field traditionally dominated by men.At the heart of this compelling feature is Jill Heinerth, a pioneering, multi-award-winning underwater explorer. We get to know Jill through her own engaging first-person narration; insights shared by family, friends and colleagues; and through animated re-enactments of pivotal personal experiences. What we learn about Jill's engrossing life trajectory over the course of this film is heartwarming, confronting, moving and truly inspirational.Artful, daring cinematography transports you viscerally into the almost mystical underwater realms Jill penetrates, intricate cave systems of both exquisite beauty and extreme peril. As we marvel at the jaw-dropping scenery - which literally takes the breath away - we are made acutely aware of the supremely hazardous nature of these subterranean expeditions filmed on location in different parts of the world. Getting lost in these unexplored caverns and crevices, faulty technology/equipment, and the limits of psychological and physical endurance can be lethal, so as we accompany Jill and her fellow divers into these claustrophobic depths, the danger feels all too real and the suspense at times overpowering. How the director and his crew managed to capture this extraordinary footage is a feat in itself.I knew virtually nothing about cave diving before watching Diving Into the Darkness, so this film was a surprising and rewarding revelation. And by the end of it, you admire Jill Heinerth as an accomplished explorer and as an all-round impressive human being so much that you wonder why she isn't more widely known. Thank goodness this thoughtfully told, masterfully crafted documentary will ensure she gets the recognition she deserves.A film for anyone and everyone!",False
9,10,Incredible,tsoofia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a incredible story told so beautifully and thoughtfully. Jill is such an inspiring and eloquent person who has lived an amazing life that is told perfectly in this documentary. The effort and detail put into making this documentary shows in every frame. I am not a driver but this documentary was great at explaining what goes into being able to cave dive, as well as exploring the wonders that are underwater caves. The animation and music is also incredible and adds to the overall documentary in a unique and creative way. This was one of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time and will have you holding your breath.",False
10,10,Awesome!,ckeyes-44871,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was so happy to finally be able to view ""Diving into the Darkness"" as I have read Jill Heinerth's book, ""Into the Planet"", and heard Jill speak here in Calgary. She is an awesome woman who has found her way into a predominately male career. And she has upped the ante. Her work, her accomplishments, her way of diving and photographing underwater worlds are all amazing. She knows it is a risky business and she does it for her own interests as well as for all people as she opens up this unknown world for all of us. This documentary is beautifully filmed, has an incredible commentary, and is completely stunning to watch. I give it a definite 10/10.",False
11,10,A courageous and inspiring explorer,pyork-77716,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Diving into the Darkness"" is a documentary that celebrates the spirit of exploration in the oceans and water filled caves beneath our feet. Directed by Nays Baghai, it tells the inspiring story of Jill Heinerth - cave diver, pioneer, adventurer, and true explorer of places not for the faint of heart.Explorers like Jill are a rare breed, undertaking extraordinary feats fuelled by unparalleled courage, curiosity, and dedication. The film not only showcases her incredible achievements but also invites us to admire her strength and resilience. From her childhood fascination with National Geographic magazines to a pivotal experience of her twenties, Nays skilled storytelling also allows us to connect with Jill on a personal level, making her journey relatable and human.Leaving the theatre, I felt inspired by Jill's story and moved by her commitment to being the mentor she wished she had as a child. Her legacy in research, education, exploration and water conservation is a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have on future generations.",False
12,n/a,A Lifetime of Adventure,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most people talk of having the adventure of a lifetime but Jill Heinerth has truly had a lifetime packed with adventure well beyond the experience of most of us. Her story is brought to life with a deft touch by filmmaker Nays Baghai, who overcomes the multiple challenges of filming in such a hostile environment to open a real window on Jill's achievements, without cheapening it through sensationalism or sentimentality. Supported by original photographs and film footage from her many expeditions and accompanied by an excellent sound track, this film ranks with the best in the genre. Don't miss a rare treat!",False
13,9,"Amazing, Impressive, Inspiring",cotternate,n/a,16/08/2025,"The courage and passion displayed in this documentary is quite literally awe-inspiring...
I will admit, the re-enactments do not do justice as far as how/what she has experienced and achieved as a diver..
Regardless, realizing the extent of the risks taken, ow the smallest mistakes create such a high probability of not making it out (or even in for that matter) alive and what was accomplished (not to mention the obstacles and unexpected situations that come into play...👀
Just hearing her perspective and the genuine love and passion she has, the awards her and her crews have received for their dedication and accomplishments, is beyond inspirational...
Definitely recommend checking it out.. 👌👍",False

1,10,Mesmerising,sddrrgxm,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Danger Zone"" is a thought-provoking film that confronts the complex intersection of travel and the darker realities of conflict zones. The movie brilliantly captures the emotional turmoil experienced by both tourists and locals, shedding light on the often-ignored impact of war on communities.The cinematography is striking, showcasing haunting landscapes that juxtapose beauty with devastation. The performances are poignant, particularly the lead, who navigates the moral dilemmas of witnessing suffering while grappling with personal privilege.What sets ""Danger Zone"" apart is its unflinching honesty. It does not shy away from the uncomfortable truths about exploitation and the commodification of tragedy. Instead, it encourages reflection on our responsibilities as global citizens. The film skillfully balances the harsh realities with moments of hope and resilience, reminding us that even in the darkest circumstances, humanity prevails.Ultimately, ""Danger Zone"" is a powerful commentary on the ethics of travel in a world marked by conflict. It challenges us to think critically about our choices as tourists and advocates for a more conscious approach to exploring the world. This film is essential viewing for anyone interested in the complexities of modern travel.",False
2,1,"Ridiculous ""documentary"" wasting taxpayer money",pvh-runde,n/a,16/08/2025,"Danger Zone is a fictional movie by the otherwise jobless amateur couple Vita from Poland, with her husband Kamil, funded mostly by German taxpayers, through their politically connected parents, Mama Zelakeviciute and Papa Maciej.The movie plot is simple: Vita and Kamil dream of being film makers and traveling to exotic countries, so they invent the story of a ""war tourism industry"", which in reality doesn't exist.Lacking any proof, they quote an unknown source from 2012 (!) that says ""war tourism is part of adventure tourism with an annual turnover of US$ 265 Billions (!) - and growing"".Sorry, that is like calling unicycling on a tightrope over the Grand Canyon a part of the ""global bicycle industry"", with an annual turnover of US$ 65 Billion. Growing laughter, hahaha.The snapshooters Vita and Kamil stumble from one filming mistake to the next script debacle to the next typo error, while they are safely guided through Afghanistan, Colombia, Karabakh, Somalia and Syria by real veteran travelers who have, over many years, earned the trust and respect of their local contacts. (But none of the protagonists gets credited in the film, strangely only used and abused by their first names, although some of them have well known names and CVs.)Despite all the efforts, and their claim of a ""huge war zone industry"", the two rookie reporters predictably fail to produce any footage of a real war zone, so they resort to cutting in some shotgun noise and tracer ammunition from other movies.To make things worse, the childless Polish couple seems to enjoy seeing children suffer, so they stage several weird situations full of child hatred: ""The babies are all guilty! The babies will all die!"". Furthermore, they even hand a real gun to a group of kindergarten kids in a Syrian refugee camp, and provoke a kindergarten kid to make a cut-throat gesture.The two Poles also display their country's stereotypical attitude against Muslim populations, so they stage several film situations that look like an aggessive Muslim mob to the unknowing film viewer. Defamatory words like ""terrorists"" or ""drug cartell"" are thrown around indiscriminately. As if the people in foreign countries were all criminal, savages and killers. So sad to see.The many successful peacemaking efforts of a Jewish couple, or the United Nations Organisations, or other voluntaryists, are routinely denied and cut out of the film story.The White privilege on display by Vita and Kamil, who seem to openly enjoy their atrocity p*rn, is sometimes hard to bear.In a sneaky way, Vita and Kamil try to project their complete lack of a life purpose, their own dark voyeurism, and their neurotic narcicism, onto their healthy film characters, but fail miserably.To unwitting television audiences, this fictional movie from Poland is sold as a ""documentary"" from the United Kingdom. As if there was a quality stigma of many things coming from Poland.The good news is that nowadays hardly anyone watches TV, and certainly not a film title like ""Danger Zone"", which has been used at least a dozen times before, and is practically impossible to pinpoint on Google. We recommend: don't bother.",False
3,10,View of a Protagonist.,andy-94369,n/a,16/08/2025,"I spent 7 years of my life with being filmed by this wonderful production company, and always be grateful for the opportunity.I was always treated with respect and kindness throughout the process. Thank you to the Drygas team.The subject is controversial and thought provoking, The true image that I saw of myself was difficult to watch at times. I went through many ups and downs during filming but was emotionally supported by Vita and the crew.Since the movie I have become a journalist and a more responsible and respectful human being.The movie is now I'm proud to say an award winner, picking up best Doc in the Sydney.",False
4,1,Waste of my time,loimko1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came here specifically to write a review about this 'documentary'. It's one of the worst-... Things I've ever seen. It's not a documentary at all, it's a disgusting self-promoting commercial that's 1,5 hours long. The user svh-runde wrote a much more sophisticated review and I couldn't agree more. War footage? No. Intricate interviews with the so-called 'tourists'? No. Believable sense of danger? No. Any interesting, enriching information or credibility to the subject? No. One big dck-measuring contest between a couple of people? Yes.I can't believe this was streaming on a respectable streaming service.",False
5,4,Reflecting on the morality of war tourism,sebmiller-22052,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary follows three characters who all claim that normal life is too boring. According to them, visiting conflict zones carries a profound psychological depth and a sense of connection to the world. Meanwhile, the doc is full of awkward moments that emphasise how the characters are more in search of action, as if a war-torn country were nothing more than a call of duty game. The characters pose in front of tanks, and redress into Afghan military outfits just for show, with Afghan militants on an adjacent training field watching the awkward situation play out. The documentary does not offer any insight in how the characters' perspectives on war change throughout their visit. But I am hesitant to blame this on the documentary itself, as any questioning into the characters' psychological process would likely have been unfruitful.Nevertheless, this doc is a good watch for anyone who sees themselves visiting such countries. Why? Because it leads one to reflect on their own motives to do so. And specifically, what they would look like on their own holiday videos in case they recognise themselves in the documentary's characters.",False

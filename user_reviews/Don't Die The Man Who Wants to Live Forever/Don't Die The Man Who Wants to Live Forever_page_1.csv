1,7,It's an interesting watch.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Self made millionaire Bryan Johnson devotes his life to seeming eternal youth. This documentary explores his past, his present and his relationships.In my mind's eye, I kept hearing Lois from Family Guy, shouting out 'Bryyyyan,' and at times, I almost felt like I was watching an episode of Family Guy, where Peter sells his soul to The AI gods, in exchange for living forever.I have keenly followed Bryan for many years, and I find him truly fascinating, millionaires exist in a different world from the vast majority of us, he's impossible to understand, but he's fascinating to watch.I worry people will slate this documentary, purely because they loathe Bryan, or vehemently disagree with what he's doing, I hope not, because this is a fascinating watch.Bryan.......some of what he does intrigues me, some of it I agree with (exercise, supplementing, dodging processed food etc,) some of it terrifies me, the general therapy, but who knows, perhaps in twenty years time we'll all be doing things that he's been doing here.Bryan has the wealth to do whatever he likes, I've always thought of him as a slave to AI, he doesn't seem to live, he seems to exist, through algorithms and routines, I couldn't imagine anything worse, but it's his life, and it is fascinating.It's very interesting.7/10.",False
2,5,Interesting in a side show kind of way.,rayfollis,n/a,15/08/2025,"My key measurement of a documentary's quality is whether or not it is trying to sell something. I believe the film makers did a good job of not promoting Bryan's quest. Instead, it was more informative about a very unique, if not odd lifestyle. This got it to a five, but ultimately it was just too creepy for me to give it any more.Bryan has quite a few hang ups, and this seemed to be the focus of the second half of the film. I'm glad he has found a way to cope with his depression, loneliness, and lack of interpersonal skills - especially since he only has a few hundred million in the bank.Ultimately, I found him creepy, narcissistic, and (ironically) very unhealthy looking! He kinda reminds me of the movie character ""Powder"".Notice how often he appears shirtless.Total sideshow attraction.",False
3,6,Interesting Documentary about a Delusional Man,mcintyre64,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerFirst lets start with the positives. It is a good idea to ditch unhealthy habits and try to live a long healthy active life. I completely agree with that aspect of his thinking as most would. Also if he was unhappy with work and life and overweight and unhealthy you have to respect him wanting to make positive changes.Unfortunately there are much more negatives to this story. If you need to pop over 100 pills a day tweak your blood and genes and not eat anything after midday and sleep by 8.30pm alone every night is life really worth living?He sounds like his is living like an inpatient in hospital with chronic illness having such a depressing regimented routine.I predict he is more likely to give himself a chronic illness or get cancer than he is to live past 120 years old but be interesting to see what happens for sure.He is taking wild risks with his health with all the supplements and experimental drugs he takes all the blood and gene treatment all the unnecessary MRI scans etc.As mentioned during the documentary if he is so interested in prolonging human life since he is a multi-millionaire why not fund some clinical research to find out safe and correct dosages for different anti-ageing supplements?Instead he seems to be promoting his way of life and flogging his own products to cult followers.To me this makes no sense at all he says he enjoys life but if you cannot take occasional risks or stay up late from time to time how can he genuinely be a happy person or think most people would adopt a similar lifestyle.One strange thing also is despite him having a young looking body how come facially he looks no younger than average for his age and why does it seem he is wearing green or blue nail polish in the documentary.Worth a watch but clearly he needs to ditch some of his practices if he wants to be respected more.,True
4,6,Documentary with its subject behind a paywall,timmyhollywood,n/a,15/08/2025,"How foolish of me, in retrospect, to have expected I might learn something interesting from this documentary. For its 90 minute run time, the actual salient facts of Bryan Johnson's longevity project come few and fast. He exercises an hour a day with three intensity sets a week. He's vegan. He takes a hundred or more ""pills."" Beyond this, the story focuses on his relationship with his son, a little about his past, and makes passing attempts to frame the controversy surrounding him (there isn't much) and to enter the conversation on public health.I'd hoped to learn a bit more about what he's actually doing, what vitamins or pills he might be taking, but with only a couple of exceptions, this and many other facets of Johnson's project remained unknown. I realized that this is likely because those aspects are proprietary. This is Johnson's personal quest, but also his enterprise. So the ""debate"" over whether he is altruistic or some grifter seems answered by the nature of the documentary about him itself; to really know about the man who wants to live forever, just plug in your credit card number.",False
5,6,Just pay attention to how often he is shirtless,syrmnygmdv,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been interested in Brian Johnson and find the science behind longevity fascinating, but unfortunately the documentary failed to hold my attention. The documentary starts with how the press found Brian, the subsequent whirlwind and how the project started. Then they start talking about his son and what colleges he is going to and start deviating down the road of who else is showing up to interview Brian.At least as far as I got, the documentary seemed more focused on Brian, the initial press whirlwind, shirtless shots, random tidbits about his life, a naked photoshoot of Brian, negative press headlines, and then random people showing up to interview him. It barely touched on the science or efficacy of any of what he was doing or the implications and unfortunately the show just fell flat. The documentary was more focused on peoples reactions, and Brian shirtless, than anything of substance about living longer. I think there is probably a good way to make a documentary about Brian and Blueprint but this just wasnt it. Maybe it gets better after 25 minutes but I just couldnt do it.",False
6,6,The other end of the extreme in health and wellness,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Don't Die"" (2025 release; 89 min) opens, we are introduced to Bryan Johnson, the now very wealthy former owner of Braintree Venmo. Johnson is on a strict regime and life style to maximize his expected life term into the extreme. He is doing this with the assistance of a longevity consultant. All of it is in essence done on a trial-by-error basis. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from prolific director Chris Smith (""100 Foot Wave""). Here he follows the longevity experiment that Bryan Johnson is undertaking. Johnson is correct of course that many of us have unhealthy life styles and habits. Johnson is on the other end of the extreme in health and wellness, costing him $2 million/year (apparently pocket change for Johnson). I was ready to abandon this documentary after 30 minutes, but then the documentary wisely widens its approach beyond the health and wellness focus, as we learn more of Johnson's background (growing up in the Mormon church) and how hi is working on his relationship with Talmage, his HS senior son who is getting ready to go to college. All that aside, as one scientist reminds us: what Johnson is doing is NOT science-based (there are no clinical trials of any of this), so take it for what it's worth (with a healthy level of skepticism). Last but not least: contrary to the IMDb listing (and elsewhere), the title of this documentary is not ""Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever"". Per the documentary's opening credits, it's simply called ""Don't Die"".""Don't Die started streaming on Netflix just the other day, and Netflix suggested it to me based on my viewing habits. If you are curious about one man's quest to ""not die"" and instead ""live forever"", I'd readily suggest you check it out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
7,7,The Documentary Big Pharma Doesn't Want You to See.,Humbert_Humbert82,n/a,15/08/2025,"While the medical industry might like to see Bryan Johnson dead, it's not happening anytime soon. He's turning himself into a human science experiment. This 45 year old is equal parts fascinating and slightly insane. While most of us struggle to remember our daily vitamins, Bryan is treating his body like a Formula 1 car, measuring everything from his sleep cycles to his blood work with the precision of a man who probably counts each individual almond. But what makes this documentary truly compelling isn't just watching him down mysterious green smoothies or hook himself up to various machines - it's the touching relationship with his son who watches his dad transform from a regular guy into something of a biohacking superhero.The film captures how Johnson's obsessive quest for immortality actually brings him closer to what matters most in his mortal life - his family and especially his relationship with his son. There's something wonderfully ironic about a man so focused on not dying that he actually starts living better, becoming more present and engaged as a father. Through all the blood tests, weird diets, and enough supplements to fill a small pharmacy, we see a surprisingly human story emerge. Johnson might be trying to hack his way to eternal life, but in the process, he's figuring out how to be a better dad. Whether you think he's a visionary or just a guy with too much time and money on his hands, ""Don't Die"" makes you wonder what lengths you might go to stick around longer for the people you love.",False
8,1,Really?,k-43764-45779,n/a,15/08/2025,"I mean, what? I thought B. Johnson was around 55 more or less, and I've just discovered that he is 47.I know a lot of people of his age who look much more youthful and are in good shape, who eat normally and exercise frequently, without going through the daily silly tortures and ordeals he puts himself through... to finally gradually turning into a bony aging white lady with a translucent dry skin and thin ratty hair. At only 47!!!Go out and soak up some sun, it will do you good. Take a walk in the nature, eat real food and meet with real people, and DON'T BE SO AFRAID TO LIVE INSTEAD OF BEING AFRAID OF DYING!This has got to be the most depressing documentary on Netflix.",False
9,6,Interesting Enough,genesogreen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this documentary interesting enough and valuable in that it fleshed out the life and times of a public figure that I had only known through derisive online content about his plasma transfusions with his son.The production quality was good and I felt as though there was an earnest attempt to approach the subject matter in an even-handed fashion, as a good documentary should.The problem for me is that it actually fails in that attempt and ends up feeling like an advertisement for the delusions of a deeply wounded and narcissistic person. This documentary fell short in critically examining who Bryan is and why he is doing what he does.",False
10,5,Interesting story that ultimately promotes harmful behavior,cloudsrival,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an interesting documentary, as much as it's interesting to watch someone unhealthily obsess over any part of their lives.There are two key differences between this and a generic reality TV show you'd find on cable television: the first is that the subject of this documentary is selling products based on the brand described in the documentary, which is to say that he sells pseudo-science miracle cures for aging to impressionable people and uses this documentary to promote that; the second is that he is incredibly rich.Bryan Johnson is another influencer that people errantly idolize. He started all of his venture capital companies with other partners, and he and his partners purchased--they did not found, nor create, but they bought out--Venmo, which made them nearly all of their money. Us Americans tend to distill one great feat of capitalism down to a single person, as if it's possible for all of us to become that person. Steve Jobs did not create the computer, Elon Musk did not create Tesla, Thomas Edison did not discover electricity, and George Washington didn't write the Declaration of Independence, but people like to think they did because making it big is what we're taught to idolize.Bryan has written children's books about living forever using the pseudo-science presented in this documentary. The concept of scientific study means you need to be able to demonstrate verifiable, reproduceable results for your theorem before it can become factual. Taking hormones, going through plasma transfusions, and the myriad other ways that Bryan claims to be extending his life are without basis in scientific fact and may actually be harmful to others. Bryan also forgets that GENETICS are the largest factor in life expectancy, and anything he does will only increase the likelihood that he lives as long as maximum longevity as determined by GENETICS. To sell treatments that claim otherwise is akin to peddling snake oil.This documentary was extremely interesting insofar as it brings light to someone who suffers from mental health issues. A large number of people fear death, but Bryan takes his pursuit to an extreme that is debatably unhealthy for anyone. He exhibits obsessive-compulsive behaviors and follows such a strict regimen as to make his daily life look intolerable and unsustainable for anyone with a sound mind.His depression and Fear Of Missing Out are both saddening. He devotes so much time and money to futile and sometimes fruitless endeavors to make himself live forever, when he could be using that time and money to enjoy his life more.No living organism has ever truly been actively alive forever (tardigrade cryptobiosis doesn't count as being actively alive). The REAL way to live forever is to develop a LEGACY that perpetuates after your death. The IDEA of Bryan Johnson could achieve immortality if he used his money to help cure cancer, end homelessness, and so on. This is the immortality that many people before him have realized.If there's anything I got from this movie, it's this: I worry that Bryan will waste the remainder of his life seeking something that cannot be obtained. He will have regrets as he dies. The most unfortunate part is that he is an INFLUENCER. The idea of living forever is APPEALING TO MANY, and thus many people will buy into his philosophies and miracle drugs, only to be led astray. Even if Bryan genuinely believes he is helping people, I fear that promoting treatments that are not scientifically backed on such a wide scale will only cause more harm than good.",False
11,8,Running from his shadow,edwin-wks,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an 8 for me because rarely has a documentary been more revealing through what it does not elucidate, namely the deep insecurities of Bryan Johnson and all the things he hides from the world, including himself - his shadow self. ""I'm a disaster of an intelligent being..."" and ""I don't fear death..."" were his words in this documentary, whose title reads, ""The man who wants to live forever"". This is a person full of contradictions and unaware of his blind spots. He might succeed in being the first man to live beyond 120 years of age, but die eventually he will.The origin of Johnson's death anxiety began in his burnout in his mid- to late-thirties, which brought him face-to-face with his shadow self and led him to question his existence and relationship with the LDS church. Perhaps he realised there has to be more to life than being stressed out 24/7 as a tech entrepreneur, and he found no pleasure in his roles as a husband, a father, a son and a Mormon. At the peak of his existential crisis, he experienced severe depression and suicidal ideation. It was a complete obliteration of the self that he had known.But who was Bryan Johnson if he wasn't a Mormon, a husband, a father, a son and a tech entrepreneur? His identity was built on those very foundations, but they were also the building blocks to his despair. He felt he had no other choice but to leave the church and his community, and he probably feared the punishment of hell that is promised to the unfaithful like him. That could be the beginning of his obsession with extending his life as best he could, so that he can delay purgatory.All this is merely my hypothesis, of course. For a documentary so fixated with longevity, it was telling that the focus was purely on physical health, with absolutely no exploration of mental well-being, other than a brief acknowledgement of the importance of social connection and community by Johnson himself. It seemed like a deliberate effort on his part not to discuss his burnout, depression, exit from Mormonism
and its repercussions because he desired to avoid painful emotions and memories.The Don't Die enterprise is fuelled by Johnson's need to carve out a new identity and fulfill his fantasy of cheating death at all cost, while avoiding the difficult topics of self-fidelity, self-compassion and self-acceptance (all three of which Johnson is no closer to achieving). Living a healthy lifestyle through minimising stress, eating nutritious food, exercising regularly and having adequate sleep is no news to anyone in the 21st century. Unlike Johnson and his acolytes, many in the world simply don't have such luxury because they are busy working in terrible conditions in poor countries, making goods for those like him and his followers, who never seem content no matter how much they already have. As guaranteed as his mortality is, Johnson can never outrun his shadow.",False
12,6,Shows the positives & negatives of Bryan but could be better,cpa14,n/a,15/08/2025,"In general, I think getting these ideas attention is good and it can definitely help a lot of people live longer and healthier. There were definitely some great moments talking about addiction, alcohol, fast food, etc.But the focus on him being a multi-millionaire and doing weird therapies is silly. 95% of any longevity/anti-aging outcomes will be from his diet, exercise and sleep. These are mostly very simple to follow and very low cost, I would like Bryan better if he focused on spreading the message about these rather than trying to be more dramatic in order to get more views. I agree with the longevity scientists in this documentary, he should help fund studies. Instead he seems to be trying to create a cult.Also, his calories are too low IMO. His team should look at more recent research. Extreme calorie restriction isn't as highly regarded as it was once thought. It sounds quite ridiculous that he got fat injected in his face in order to look normal/healthy, just eat a little more instead! I'm surprised his team allowed him to take vitamin E and iron supplements too, there's research showing risks to those.",False
13,1,Surprisingly too bad and laughable,incradabul,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is less of a documentary and more of an unintentional comedy. A tech entrepreneur who claims to be reversing aging, but the irony is impossible to ignore-he looks older than he says he is! Watching him declare himself ""biologically younger"" while visibly aged makes the whole thing feel like a bad joke. Maybe it's his deluded reality?I mean consuming 100 pills daily and undergoing controversial treatments shouldn't be what makes you younger. Bad idea to follow something like this.Rather than being insightful, it comes across as an exercise in vanity, offering little to no value to the average viewer. If you're looking for an inspiring take on longevity, this isn't it. But if you enjoy watching far-fetched ideas play out in an over-the-top way, this might be worth a laugh.",False
14,7,"I love creatine monohydrate, hmb n resistance training along with lottuva pushups. Why is he taking Rapamycin? It lowers immunity n causes infections.",Fella_shibby,n/a,15/08/2025,"Saw this on Netflix.I hope they come up with Follistatin supplement in the future so no need for gene therapy.As a professional gym instructor n nutritionist, I enjoyed this documentary but this guy Johnson is wasting his current precious years by running after futile efforts to catch more years. Ain't that an irony?This guy Johnson shud be applauded for taking the initiative but shouldn't be idolized or imitated.I had always endorsed exercise, good food n supplements.I am against gene therapy, against stem cell therapy n totally against the quest for longevity.The only supplement which can increase Follistatin is Creatine monohydrate.Apart from Creatine monohydrate, one can increase Follistatin by doing high intensity resistance training (hirt) not (hiit) n lottuva push ups.This is my personal experience.As we get older our focus shud be on maintaining muscle mass n bone mass.Resistance training helps both.The things which decreases muscle mass n bone mass are alcohol n lack of activity.",False
15,6,It's not what you expect,almeraheizer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSeeing the trailer you think it is about aging and science, but actually this documentation is more about a rich human with psychological baggage, who is trying to transform himself to solve these problems.All this time he is pushing himself and his body into the spotlight, while it is obvious that it does not work. He looks actually older than he is. I guess that many of the things he is doing actually shorten his life.It is kind of sad to see that he also makes his son live the same unhealthy life. I hope he realizes that before it is too late.That being said, if you are interested in psychology it might be worth a watch, but if you are looking for anti-aging tricks, this does more harm than help.",True
16,7,It's an interesting documentary,tmccheyne,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is interesting to have some insight into what this man is doing. However I would never ever want to lead a soulless life. It is great to retain as much fitness and the feeling of youth and joy in living. But we all die, thank goodness. It's how we die which frightens us all, or a long painful end to our lives can be worse.What frightens me personally is not my death but losing all who mean everything to me, to be the last of my family my age group in friends. To be lonely without one who loves me and who I love. What would be the point of extending life. This man is rich. He could enrich his life so much more, and others too.Yes keep looking after your health and fitness, but to have health problems or serious accidents can occur to us all. Love each day and those close to you as life can be a bitch sometimes.",False
17,6,VIEWS ON FILM review of Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA millionaire named Bryan Johnson, decides by all means necessary to do whatever it takes to extend his life beyond the normal expectancy. The documentary about Johnson's extremity is aptly titled, Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever (naturally).Anyway I as a critic have always favored docus, whether they be about famous people or pseudo famous people or well, dead famous people (no pun intended). With ""Don't Die"", we have Johnson who's somewhere in the middle. I mean I didn't know who he was until yesterday but now I'm getting an education. Bryan Johnson's got nothing but money so he can afford to take 54 pills a day and get red-light therapy and get plasma exchanges and um, inject himself via some gene therapy. Basically he spends all his time trying to prolong his esse so it's like he doesn't uh, have a life (har har). Bri, I hope it was worth it bro. ""100 years is not going to be enough"". Oh boy.Vitamin B12's and discretionary income aside, Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever is a clean, well-made, almost sterile vehicle by producer/director/cinematographer Chris Smith. There's nothing flashy, no tricks, just a look that seems borrowed and/or adopted from Alex Garland's sci-fi thriller, Ex Machina (hint, hint).There's interviews (mostly from Bryan and his son), a few archives, but mainly techy stuff about how Johnson's going to defy the mysterious aging process and various whatnots. Bryan Johnson, well he comes off as a little pretentious and ""Don't Die"" seems a little long-winded for a running time of an hour and a half (could've been more effective as a segment on 60 Minutes which has probably already happened). Still, Don't Die: The Man Who Wants to Live Forever is a rather beguiling watch. It's like the antithesis to what the late Morgan Spurlock did when he hit up good old Mickey D's two decades ago.",True
18,2,This movie couldn't make up its mind,jean0519,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis started as the profile of a deluded millionaire with too much money, too much time, too little coming sense. He's using his considerable resources to live forever. Then, 180° change: the filmmaker joins the cult and the profile turns into a profile of a trailblazer whose followers will spend their meager resources to follow him and ""live forever"". The filmmaker started drinking the Kool-aid and the movie turned into something else. This should be edited (if it's not too late) to show this man who thinks he's beating aging (why does he dye his hair??) and either turn into a paean to his genius or expose his grift.",True
19,7,A Visionary's Quest for Immortality or Obsession Gone Too Far?,briansaturnino-33864,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNetflix's ""Don't Die"" explores Bryan Johnson's relentless quest to defy aging and extend human healthspan. Directed by Chris Smith, the documentary showcases Johnson's extreme biohacking lifestyle-complete with 54 daily supplements, plasma transfusions, and a rigorous daily regimen. While it inspires curiosity about human potential, the film also raises critical questions about its scientific validity, ethical implications, and broader societal relevance.---Strengths1. Humanizing the Quest
The documentary goes beyond Johnson's biohacking practices, highlighting his emotional struggles and universal fears of aging and mortality. Personal moments, such as his bond with his son, make his pursuit relatable and engaging.2. Provocative Questions
It sparks meaningful conversations about the ethics of extreme longevity, from the societal implications of plasma transfusions to the accessibility of cutting-edge health technologies.3. Visual Aesthetic
Johnson's futuristic home and high-tech experiments are captured with sleek cinematography, immersing viewers in his meticulously crafted world.4. Cultural Relevance
The documentary addresses common modern addictions like social media, food, and pornography, providing a relatable backdrop for Johnson's self-discipline and extreme lifestyle choices.---Weaknesses1. Overemphasis on Personal Life
The extended focus on Johnson's relationships and emotional turmoil detracts from the film's core exploration of biohacking and longevity. Viewers seeking scientific insights may find this distracting.2. Lack of Scientific Rigor
While the film presents Johnson's practices, it fails to provide sufficient expert counterpoints or evidence to validate his claims. This absence leaves some of his methods feeling speculative rather than revolutionary.3. Missed Broader Implications
The documentary largely avoids systemic discussions, such as healthcare inequities or the societal impact of anti-aging advancements, which could have added depth and context to Johnson's mission.4. Commercial Undertones
Johnson's promotion of products and lifestyle choices raises questions about whether his efforts are rooted in genuine scientific progress or personal branding.---Objectivity and Final ThoughtsWhile ""Don't Die"" is visually stunning and thought-provoking, it often sacrifices depth for accessibility. Some may argue that its humanizing elements make the film more relatable, while others might see these as distractions from the scientific focus. Similarly, the lack of rigorous critique could reflect the documentary's intention to spark curiosity rather than provide conclusive answers.Ultimately, the film invites viewers to grapple with the limits of human ambition and self-optimization. Whether Bryan Johnson is a visionary pushing boundaries or a cautionary tale of obsession, ""Don't Die"" leaves a lasting question: how far would you go to live forever?Rating: 7.5/10
Recommended for those curious about biohacking and the philosophical dilemmas of human longevity, but watch with a critical eye.",True
20,1,In his 40's but looks 60!,cmlehmann,n/a,15/08/2025,"He spends his whole life trying to live longer. Deprived of anything that brings him joy, hungry ALL THE TIME!

He take over 100 pills a day. Never lets the sun shine on his face.Eating healthy, exercising and taking care of yourself is one thing but he, in my opinion is mentally ill.The people helping him are just enabling his weird addiction.

21,8,Surprisingly Good,seansboylan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I started this documentary fully expecting it to be a straightforward exposé of a wellness influencer/biohacker or perhaps another commentary piece on the prevalence of snake oil in today's health and wellness industry.Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find a well-executed, evenhanded, authentic documentary about a uniquely disciplined, emotionally nuanced human-being relentless in his pursuit of immortality yet open about his struggles with loneliness and depression.The doc goes far beyond the oft cringe content and polished veneer he shares on social media, providing the viewer with an intimate window into Bryan's origin story, his monastic yet luxurious existence, and perhaps most compelling, his endearing relationship with his son and his parents.

22,6,This Show is a big reminder to enjoy the life you have,koralrosecancion,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was sad and kind of pathetic. This man who look in his 50s - 60s spends endless hours in his day fighting old age and not really enjoying his life. The worst part is, it isn't working. Honestly, I come from a family of alcoholics that die in their 80s - 101. Does he honestly think his hat is going to save the remaining hair on the back of his head? (& yes, he is going bald back there.)I wanted to reach in my screen and shake him. He has the resourses to live a healthy and fun life but instead he spends hours a day chasing what only good genes can give. It also makes me realize that maybe being rich makes you more obsessed with being young because you can afford to chase youth. As for me, I hope to die in my 70s - 90s, preferably in my sleep. Maybe even younger is the wage gap gets bigger. I am ot rich, nor will I ever be. I will be lucky to have enough retirement to live off of for maybe 10 years, less if I am still paying my student loans off.That's if Mankind doesn't destroy itself by than.The future is unknown, all you can do is try to live a healthy life. Love big, laugh often and be a good human being so that, when death does come knocking, you will know you did what you could.

23,4,Missed opportunity,thomasalisi-683-668788,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a real shame that instead of exploring all the potentially interesting topics it could have touched throughout its length (e.g. The science motivating some choices, the details of the routines, how these compare to common knowledge, how all these hard decisions fit in everyday life, the potential to adapt some of the techniques to the larger public, the background of the people helping in this quest, etc. ) the documentary just remains shallow and drones around justifying the man's choice in a useless attempt of humanising him. Johnson comes out much better than the director, leaving a bad taste that it was the intended scope.",False
24,7,Enjoyable,ldpagnozzi,n/a,15/08/2025,"I quite enjoyed this documentary. To me it was interesting to see story of his life and understand his psyche. The relationship between him and his son is adorable. Don't over analyse what Bryan chooses to do, just see it for what it is with no judgement. This documentary isn't pushy, or trying to sell viewers anything. It's just about a man making choices that others may not have the capability to do.Personally I wouldn't do anything he does, but I found what he did fascinating. Good on him for finding his religion and sticking around to be there for his son.On ageing, I don't think Centenarians do any of what he does!Loved the ending!",False
25,1,Less a documentary than an advert for Johnson.,ndzdvfw,n/a,15/08/2025,"This shouldn't really qualify as a documentary, since it is clearly a one-sided advertisement for Brian Johnson, and his affiliated company, Blueprint.The program does bring up the fact that today's society has fundamental systemic issues that cause illness, and a heath system (at least in the US) that is inefficient at preventing illness, and focused on profits from treatment.Instead of focusing on changing these issues, which would improve the material lives of thousands, johnson instead spends all his time and money helping himself, and selling supplements from his website. The documentary does not include any substantial counter-arguments to this, except for the random interstitial scene with a random YouTuber or other unintroduced talking head that expresses skepticism.Save your time. The only real applicable lesson of this doc was to watch what you eat, exercise, and get adequate sleep. This is not groundbreaking science. Otherwise, pony up 2 million a year for blood transfusions and other edge-case treatments.",False

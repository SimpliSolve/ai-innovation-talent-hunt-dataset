1,4,Written by solicitors,hifiman-62270,n/a,16/08/2025,Disappointed with this. Seems victims instructed by solicitors to add bits on to make sure any compensation is generous. One guy was raped...by a soldier. Really. It was the death penalty in Iraq for gay sex. Pictures at the time show without any issues that hostages were allowed to sit by pool relaxing. Of course they were forced into Speedos. Let me be honest I'm sure I would never want to be kidnapped in this fashion or go thru what they did...but please stop letting it all be about lining solicitors pockets.yes I sound harsh but so much didn't add up. But paintings random evil middle east people is not the answer. Sad.,False

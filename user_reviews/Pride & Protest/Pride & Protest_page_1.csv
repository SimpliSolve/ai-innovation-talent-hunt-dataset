1,10,A fantastic snapshot of queer people of colour in the UK,esther411,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely loved this documentary featuring various QPOC activists, creative people and events!!!Surprised to see this scored so low perhaps by people who didn't watch it and were just offended by the cast holding up a mirror to the racist and homophobic members of society?Blaise Singh and his team at Rainbow Films do well to capture the celebrations within the LGBTQ+ too.OMG after watching this I really wanna go to UK Black Pride and Humgama events! Come on lockdown - be gone!Highly recommended ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ",False

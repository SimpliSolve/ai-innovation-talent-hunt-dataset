1,7,Biased and Misleading,Gobobo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I still see little in crypto, except a way for people to somehow profit from promoting themselves and their hustles. This doc has a lot of fluff from promoters asserting bold, ephemeral ideas and plans as though they are true and the 'next step' in shopping, social media, distribution networks, and money. As much as I love progress, I find it extremely difficult to accept their visions as being anything but wishful proposals they want others to bank.It provides 'balance' by quoting distinguished but archaic and establishment figureheads. These include Warren Buffett, who famously doesn't have a clue about tech, and Nouriel Roubini, who - besides being an expert on macro economic trends, accurately describing the Great Recession earlier this century when most didn't know it was developing - does have a clue about tech but is famously pessimistic.Much of it has already been covered many times. The only take away I had, was when a guy said that it's better to be in for just 1% of your total wealth and lose out, than not be in at all. He jokes, that if that 1% turned out to give you total financial independence, to name your first born after him. Ha ha, funny, but also he's aiming his marketing at younger people without kids. In another part of the show, they stated younger people take up crypto much more than older, so it seems he knows his demographic market.More cynical promotion, to develop a new industry and user base.",False
2,8,Interesting documentary,anaiscisneros,n/a,16/08/2025,"Informative documentary if you want a quick summary of the history of the crypto so far. Doesn't really explain how blockchain works in a too technical way, so it's easy to understand.",False
3,10,What a ride,tl-46981,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some context to start with: I had the chance to see this doc at an exclusive preview session so who knows if it was the final cut. In my opinion it should be since this was a great ""tour de force"" covering a hot topic full of history and interesting characters.The chapters build upon each other nicely, the narrator keeps everything well in check, especially if some of the figures in the movie start ranting. Funny as well!So yah, if you want to learn about that hype around blockchains, cryptocurrencies / Bitcoin and some really grand ideas for the future, those 80something minutes are well invested time. Also superior to going down the online rabbitthole which is particularly deep and confusing on those topics. And clearly less fun.",False
4,10,Fantastic exposition of blockchain and its potential,darrenvukasinovic,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taking a neutral position on both crypto and blockchain tech, this doco deep dives the history of the underlying tech and then explores the present and future potential. One comment I got from everyone we interviewed last night was the love of honestly and transparency in the doco - it's true that crypto and blockchain have evolved from mysterious roots and basements and gone through a hype and collapse phase in 2017-19. It's also true that major corporate and political players have at the same time cast shade on the grass roots coins and startups whilst also invested millions and branched internal ""skunkworks"" ops in their organizations in exploring this tech for their own ""private"" blockchain purposes. What is clear in this doco is that the underlying idea of blockchain and what it seeks to achieve - transaction speed, low cost and high efficiency; and transparency and irrevocable truth from a distributed ledger - these core concepts are in themselves the promise of blockchain theology and the kinds of modern use cases that an incredibly tech connected world, growing off the back of leaps in computing/mobile and internet accessibility, can leverage for all kinds of purposes.",False
5,4,"Lot of talk, but no substance",sami-27950,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's a lot of babble but very little substance. It doesn't make things simple enough for the laypeople and for anyone knowing anything it's entirely nonsensical at times. Random things said but not explained or questioned.For example, one company describes their product as ""an operating system on top of Etherium."" That's it. He didn't ask what that means, just put it out there. Was the point to make it seem entirely ridiculous?He went to see a vault that has servers and data. No explanation what and why. ""The key is split into five locations."" Ok, what key? What is it used for? How do they use it when they need to? Nothing is explained.There's at least some points where they show how much was promised and how nothing was delivered by the crypto fanatics, but in the end it doesn't really say anything. Much better ways to waste time.",False
6,10,Great documentary about cryptocurrencies that keeps you in suspense,dominicgluchowski,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a must see, eye-opening and entertaining movie about past, present and the future of crypto currencies and blockchain. It discusses all major political and development angles that cryptocurrencies are facing today.",False
7,4,Who is this about?,edouardlesage,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm just tired of that style of documentary where the host/interviewer/journalist is just being filmed meandering through city crosswalks and shaking hands of 47 people who each say 5 seconds worth of interesting material related to the actual topic.Nice to know that you traveled to Switzerland, Japan, UK, Germany, Argentina, etc. But what did it add to the content? Not much besides the fact that i know that some nuclear bunker doors in Switzerland are painted yellow. Thanks.",False
8,10,I enjoyed this info-dense documentary,press-82631,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very intense and detailed documentary about the entire
industry. the good parts of it and also the bad projects and people. i
need to watch it again because it was so information dense. the
production was really high quality with many graphics and helicopter
shots. i enjoyed some of the funny scenes that lightened the mood
between more technical bits. I enjoyed watching all the crypto VIPs
too.",False
9,10,Very insightful,millioncents,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very well balanced and easy to follow documentary that not only hears from the proponents of the space, but also its critics and controversial figures. The documentary opens the kimono to reveal many things newbies and even veterans in the space may have not known. A recommended watch for those curious about Bitcoin and its hardcore fan base.",False
10,3,Doesn't address the elephant in the room.,danilofer-36971,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bitcoin is currency, not money. Money has to be a commodity first, and a medium of exchange second e.g. Silver. Silver is used in batteries, cars, mirrors, water filters etc etc. But it can also be used as a medium of exchange. Money has to be a stable store of value over hundreds of years. E.g. The dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power within a few decades I.e. The dollar is currency, not money. Similarly, Bitcoin is simply a medium of exchange, in the form of a digital token I.e. Currency. It is not money. The film comes across like a pump-and-dump scheme. ""We know it's going to a million dollars a coin"". Do we know that? I sure as hell don't. There are 15,000+ cryptos out there. Crypto is the latest get rich quick scheme, but the ship has already sailed. There's no questioning the blockchain technology will have applications in the future, but it isn't isolated to Bitcoin. It has other applications. It also doesn't give Bitcoin 'value' in the same way the dollar is sometimes said to be 'backed by the US government'. Nonesense to those who understand what money actually is.",False
11,10,Refreshingly fair,MrMcMurphy,n/a,16/08/2025,Truth seeking over agenda.Interesting and thought provoking. *Very* interesting and thought provoking.,False
12,10,Fun and informative,chris-07175,n/a,16/08/2025,Great film to get an insight into how Bitcoin operates and the future of the technology.,False
13,10,Thinking of Buying Bitcoin? Watch this First!,AlCaudullo,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is a brutally honest assessment of Bitcoin. Both technically and creatively Torsten and his crew have put together a compelling story. I found myself being drawn in further and further to mysteries and sometimes outlandish statements about Bitcoin. If you have ever thought about buying Bitcoin or if you already have I strongly suggest that you watch this movie.,False
14,10,Never stop learning! Understand what is the Cryptoeconomy and Bitcoin,rserranon,n/a,16/08/2025,"This comprehensive documentary will take you to a more than 10 years journey of the new and real Cryptoeconomy, it's mysterious founders (Bitcoin) and it's crazy copycats, new proposals and wars for power control! A journey of learning for any new comer, with powerful lessons and an objective perspective, to evaluate the possibilities and benefits that might lay ahead for us. A good family watch for millennials to teach their parents! ðŸ˜‰",False
15,9,Crypto Education,pocket393-681-112695,n/a,16/08/2025,A solid documentary describing the purpose and short history of Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies. Inspiring.,False
16,9,ok was useful to a total ignoramus of this topic,anxiousgayhorseonketamine,n/a,16/08/2025,.... I knew nothing about this .... heard of it like all other people living today but had no knowledge of the workings ... cannot say i understand a lot more now but it is clearly a work in progress ...what i do know is that when i see banknotes now; however cute they are they really do seem to be escapees from the XXth century and have no business in the 21st ... so what is presented here very well too is probably where we are going ... and as the filmmaker says at the end ... we probably as users will not know how this works will not understand what a blockchain is indeed as most of us do not even understand how a toaster or a lightbulb work YET we can use themThe nerds will stay in the background but when this is finally worked out; it is NOT now; it will probably FULLY replace all cash and cardsHopefully it really will be free and not a new tracking device for governments and agenciesWe pray and we await ..... ps useful info on the internet too something i do know a bit about ...Recommended viewing for any denizens of the early 21st.,False
17,10,Braid ranging articulate coverage,steven-sidley,n/a,16/08/2025,Bravo to the creators - this subject is complex and contested and the they were able to spread the film across the whole crypto surface while keeping the viewer engaged. Also fabulous interviews with many different expert opinions and many different points of view.,False
18,9,Documentary beyond just Bitcoin,wfrank-5,n/a,16/08/2025,This witty movie goes beyond the ordinary look at Bitcoin into the evolution of new technologies and what it might mean for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It very interesting insight in an entertaining way.,False
19,10,Great follow up to 'the end of money',darrenkis,n/a,16/08/2025,I watched the first film in 2014 as a Bitcoin noob. This follow up does a great job explaining what happened over the last 6 years as well as getting newbies up to speed on Bitcoin/Blockchain without drowning them in the technicalities.Also Craig Wright is a fraud.,False
20,10,Excellent journalism on an important topic.,smiledaydream,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent journalism on an important topic. It's obvious there is a lot of hype on the subject. This movie provides a lot of information without being too overwhelming. It is not a lesson on the mathematics of Blockchain or how to program. It covers many different viewpoints and asks the appropriate questions. It is more of an introduction to 101 and 102 then it is a comprehensive course. I would like to see this person put together a series of 10 of these to go into depth on specific topics as he is a trustworthy journalist. Another 20 experts and more in-depth questions would be excellent. I also like the interviews with naysayers as they ask important questions and many of them are very intelligent. For example, the segment with warren Buffett was way too short. But it was appropriate for this movie. I'd like to hear a little more of what he says plus hear from whoever he considers an expert on the topic. And then I would like to hear a genius expert respond to what his team says. We only know what we know right now. What's going to evolve in the next 5, 10 or 15 years will be based on peoples knowledge and opinion at this time.",False

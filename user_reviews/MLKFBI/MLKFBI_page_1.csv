1,7,OK Summarization of King's Promotion and FBI's Undermining of Civil Rights,Cineanalyst,n/a,16/08/2025,"""MLK/FBI"" is a decent overview of the FBI's surveillance and efforts to ruin Martin Luther King and, by extension, also does a fair job of summarizing some of the civil rights leader's achievements. Although some of the archival footage employed for the documentary's expository mode looks newfound and, reportedly, is based on some recently declassified documents, there isn't much if anything new discussed here.I'm not an expert on King, but I've read about him over the years, seen other documentaries, visited the hotel-turned-museum where he was assassinated, and it's a challenge to point to one new thing in this doc that I learned. Generally, it's what anyone with even a passing recreational interest in 1950s-1960s American history would already know. Maybe there aren't any other documentaries that focus primarily on this angle, though, so I'll rate it positively for that. One may check out ""King: A Filmed Record... Montgomery to Memphis"" (1970), for instance, if they want a grander overview of King's activities, and there've been many others, along with documentaries about Hoover and the FBI. We even have biopics such as ""J. Edgar"" (2011) and ""Selma"" (2014). In the end, the desire is palpable to release the FBI tapes already that are scheduled to be unsealed in 2027 (which talk about arbitrary), as at least then there'd be new material for the historians and documentarians to work with.Otherwise, as it is, too much time is wasted here musing over King's sex life. Yes, he had extramarital relations; move on. I read about that and mentioned it in a biographical speech I delivered back in secondary school; it's not a revelation. The most scandalous ""new"" item, I suppose, is the FBI's rape accusation, but there's nothing really to say about such a claim from the racist organization that was out to ruin the man if there's no evidence available to substantiate it. The filmmakers could've used the same tact here that they offered J. Edgar Hoover, for whom they only hint photographically of his rumored homosexuality and never mention the more dubious claims of transvestism.The commentary on the FBI's actions against the civil rights movement is better, including contextualizing it as part of mainstream American white supremacism of the era. Perhaps, not enough credence is given to the fact that the FBI, however, was part of a federal government where administrations were offering support for civil rights out of one side of their mouth and eventually legislatively at the same time as they were approving Hoover's surveillance and intimidation campaign. Conspiracy theories regarding the FBI's involvement (or at least willful negligence) in King's murder are largely glossed over, too.As an introduction or overview, ""MLK/FBI"" does well enough, as I said, though. Plus, I like the archival footage approach with the voiceover exposition as opposed to talking-head interviews. Fortunately, I recognized some of the film clips shown, for which the identification here was inconsistent. ""The FBI Story"" (1959), for example, gets a caption, but not, as far as I noticed at least, ""The Birth of a Nation"" (1915) or ""The March"" (1963). Even if I saw the narrators' faces, however, I wouldn't really know who most of them are, although hearing James Comey remark on what he considers the most shameful aspect of the agency's history (the letter basically attempting to blackmail King into suicide) is interesting, to say the least. But, that's a whole other doc on bureau shenanigans.",False
2,7,A visual lecture on civil rights movement and the fbi,severajaaho,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film is tightly structured and narrated over archive footage of king, with some other contemporary footage mixed in. In terms of visual material, the film does not bring any new unforseen archive films to the table and a lot of the images used in the film are used several times. With the original sound bites however, the film does a great job in opening the context to the audiences. What the film lacks in new visual material, it gains in its content as it is based on new research of the FBI archives. Great learning material for history or social studies classes.",False
3,8,A Compelling Documentary about MLK and the Shady Dealings of the FBI,jadepietro,n/a,16/08/2025,"IN BRIEF: A well made documentary about this great leader but flawed man and the FBI 's vicious attempt to discredit him.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Sam Pollard's gripping documentary, MLK/FBI, chronicles the Civil Rights movement and the FBI's shameful discrediting of one of its leaders, the Rev. Martin Luther King, which was orchestrated by its bureau chief, J. Edgar Hoover. Having the FBI conduct surveillance of MLK with the sole purpose to humiliate and destroy his image with the public, the film uses declassified documents, archival footage, and Hollywood propaganda film to state its case. (The entire FBI tapes are slated to be available to the public in 2027, so only some documentation, photographs, and interviews are the film's basis.)The documentary is fascinating in its thorough researching of those turbulent times during the 50's and 60's from the start of the Civil Rights protests until MLK assassination, with comments from historians about his legacy. The filmmakers try to encapsulate the unrest in our nation during those polarizing times and it confirms the governmental tactics used to wiretap its citizenry and lump MLK with the evils of communism while labeling MLK with other more military-minded Black protest groups as subversives. Call them ""domestic terrorists"" before that term was commonplace, but the film resonants with today's racist climate.The documentary is not totally successful in its narrative structure and one wishes their scope was narrowed down and more concise in its storytelling and also focused more on Hoover's backstory and obsessive mission to destroy another man. Granted there is too much to comprehend as the film covers nearly two decades and most history buff would savor this retelling. But this is an important film for all to experience and its lingering message is truly thought-provoking. Most telling is the turnaround by a supportive President Lyndon Johnson and the FBI Bureau after MLK is awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Indeed, politics does have strange bedfellow.The director's sense of irony is also at play as he begins his documentary with this quote from a film clip of former President Ronald Reagan:""In most stories, villains are usually defeated and the ending is a happy one. I can make no such promise with this picture you are about to watch. The story isn't over...""MLK/ FBI is a noble effort by Mr. Pollard and his crew. Their film is very well constructed and edited with skill by Laura Tomaselli, making this history lesson a cautionary tale for all Americans to heed. And yes, the story isn't over! (GRADE: B)",False
4,n/a,Joins a list of other great Civil Rights documentaries,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMLK/FBI is an excellent, excellent documentary/film essay with high production values, but it's important to note off the bat that the intended audience are viewers who already have a basic knowledge of the major beats of the Civil Rights Movement in the US. This is a documentary very specifically about Martin Luther King's persecution by the FBI, not about the Movement in general, so foreign viewers (and sadly, some US ones) might want to glance over a couple Wikipedia articles before seeing the film.Those who thought that Dr. King's only enemies were some hillbilly sheriffs in Alabama and Mississippi will be shocked to learn that declassified documents revealed that J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI thought of him as a dangerous menace and sent him letters telling him to kill himself. And, depending on what else is revealed in 2027, that may be only the tip of the iceberg.During the documentary, we hear the historians (and by proxy, the director himself) reckoning with the thorny ethical question that by discussing these issues, whether we are complicit in the FBI's unlawful and invasion of his privacy. Ultimately, the film seems to conclude that hopefully in 2020 we collectively have the maturity to understand that none of it takes away from what he achieved.The film is more traditionally a documentary than I Am Not Your Negro, but shares some of Peck's stylistic touches. Pollard has various historians narrate the story without showing their faces, relying wholly on stock footage and photographs. This is generally what I prefer in historical documentaries, putting you wholly in a time and place and not cutting away to contemporary talking heads.",True
5,6,"Accounts on what I've heard on MLK after HS, but...",desertdac,n/a,16/08/2025,"MLK/FBI could have put forth 3 main issues with more power. That leaves it open to still hear extremists on the partisan left or partisan right continue justifying only part of imperfect MLK's world. While they ignore so many the great and thoughtful insights he stood for.1) The FBI under misguided ruler-ship (Hoover & Sullivan) taking advantage of findings on surveillance (authoritarianism+) or manufacturing items if hard facts aren't found. This is the worst, and it shows how a monied public agency doesn't always serve truth and who pays for it.2) Communist party involvement disproven by MLK's own stated beliefs, including his outing of more than one person involved in communism. The Alt-R and some voices in the post 1990 pay-triot movement, John Birchers, etc, hold onto this notion though apparently false.3) MLK's adulterous activities weren't clarified until the end of the film, though much of that may have been beyond its scope. No matter, this should have been better explained during the FBI's tapping of his hotel rooms. That would serve we who try to do well, to be vigilant that our private and public lives are on the same high ground.Regardless, it's a film documentary worth seeing, though it lacked details that could have been covered.",False
6,7,good documentary,SnoopyStyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary about the FBI investigation into MLK. It's a fairly straight forward recounting of the issues. I do know the general points of the story. J. Edgar Hoover's obsession is well known. His relationships and work with the political leaders are not that hard to work out but it is good to lay them all down. Of course, there is a pro-MLK point of view but it's not unreasonably slanted. It's actually very telling that the documentary paints JEH's investigation as something very mainstream at the time. That may be the most surprising point coming out of this. Even if the investigation wasn't hidden, it would be likely supported by the majority of the people. The polling on JEH and MLK is the one big factual hit. It puts numbers into a sense of the times. Mostly, this is not that eye-opening of a documentary but it does put everything into context.",False

8,9,Excellent Documentary on a True Hero,catfanatic888,n/a,16/08/2025,Very thorough and incredibly detailed account of what we do not know... Infuriating and educational. It saddened me and taught me a lot. I hope everyone will get the chance to see this. How sad that this icon and hero was taken away from this world at such a young age. The world would have been so different had he been able to have lived his full life.,False
9,10,A first-rate documentary,richard-1787,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really enjoyed this documentary. Rather than try to summarize it, I'd like to address the way that it is different from what has become the sort of standard way of doing historical documentaries since the very deserved success of Ken Burns' early films. And then to reflect, a little, why this is a documentary everyone should see and think about.Until the very end of this movie, we see no talking heads, no people telling us their views about what happened. We hear the voices of the eight people who were interviewed extensively, several of whom, like Andrew Young, knew King well and were even involved with him in the Civil Rights movement. But our visual focus is almost always on newsreel footage - or, on occasion, excerpts from documentary-like movies about the FBI. That creates a very different effect, at least on me, than I experience when I watch Ken Burns documentaries like the one on America's involvement in World War II, *The War*, or the one on baseball. Frankly, I prefer this approach, at least for the telling of this story. My only suggestion, and it is a minor one, is that there are times when the voice speaking changes and is not identified. Since we can't see who is speaking, I would appreciate it if, in a subsequent edition of this documentary - and I'm sure there will be subsequent editions - that be added.The other thing that I would like to be added is an occasional caption to identify some of the individuals we see in the newsreels. There is, for example, a man we see at least twice speaking from a podium outdoors addressing a group on a platform. (He's evidently a white supremacist.) He isn't identified, and I wish he were. The people who made this movie - and they did a fine job - are probably so immersed in this subject that they know all of the individuals we see, but that is not going to be the case for many of us. A few simple captions added to some of the newsreel footage would help.Other than that, I applaud the makers of this documentary and strongly recommend it. It does not pretend to present King as a saint. It does not center on him, his work or his life. Rather. It sets out to show how and why the FBI and its director, J. Edgar Hoover, spent so much time watching him and, finally, trying to destroy him. And that is one very interesting, if sad, story.The shining image that Hoover had for many years in this country has long since been destroyed for various reasons. This might drive one of the nails further in its coffin, but that image is already pretty dead without this movie.But it shows, very well, how our own country, that enshrines freedom of speech in our constitution, has sometimes worked so hard to suppress that freedom for some of our fellow citizens. That is frightening, and we cannot ever be allowed to forget it, or it will keep happening.",True
10,4,Nothing new here. Couldn't end fast enough.,asc85,n/a,16/08/2025,"I guess because it's about MLK, we're all supposed to genuflect down to this documentary. The fact of the matter is that this film was a bore. I'm not even remotely an expert on MLK, and there was nothing new in this documentary. I guess if you really don't know much about MLK's life, and/or if you didn't know anything about the FBI discovering his infidelities and trying to exploit them, then maybe you'll think this documentary was great.In addition, there was a very curious choice made by the director, whereby there are voiceovers by numerous people throughout the film that I had never heard of before (e.g., Beverly Gage, Donna Murch, Marc Perrusquia), and they never tell you why they are important to this story until right before the credits roll. Why?",False
11,n/a,Astonishing FBI attack on the civil rights movement and MLK.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy."" MLKIt's shocking to hear in the eye-opening documentary MLK/FBI William Sullivan, the FBI's director of domestic intelligence, encourage Martin Luther King, Jr. to commit suicide. The theme of the doc is that the agency, under J Edgar Hoover's direction, from 1955.was dedicated to bringing down King and the Civil Rights Movement.Although the animosity was known even in the 60's, the doc does a credible job showing this aggressiveness was a part of the mid-century paranoia dominated by the fear of communism and perhaps mirrored it. In this case, the agency, like Joe McCarthy, had little evidence of the subjects' undemocratic tactics but probably was motivated more by the fear of losing influence to liberal protestors or lonely anarchists.Mixing archival footage of King parading and snippets from his famous speeches, director Sam Pollard gives a fluid narrative to otherwise discursive material. To his credit, talking heads are at a minimum as he emphasizes the growing concern that King was being targeted to go down.That plot was notoriously supported by ample evidence of King's philandering, mainly in hours of tapes with his women, not his wife, from wiretapping to photos. The actual auditory evidence will be released in 2027, and the ballyhoo will probably be disappointing because he did his good while he was doing his bad, and the good he did for civil rights and Black people far outweighs infidelities to his estimable wife and puritanical white folk.MLK/FBI could have profited from discussion of his influence and flaws and how the latter might have been better served by expert analysis about their importance. That he was an appetitive man, at least in regards to women, was known before this documentary; that he was a powerful player in the freedom of his own people and other repressed minorities, will redound through history.MLK/FBI will remind you in important evidence that like JFK, MLK was destined to change a nation and lose a young life in return. I never tire of remembering true heroes.",False

13,10,So powerful!,lpagan-1,n/a,16/08/2025,It could not be more timely to learn how much the fight for racial justice was always considered a threat to the default American power structure. What a brilliant and powerful film!,False
14,10,Go Watch Now!,isaacson-70001,n/a,16/08/2025,Excellent and compelling film. It was chilling to see just how far the FBI's campaign of hatred went. I loved the use of audio-only interviews until revealed at the very end. The interviewees served as our trusted narrator as opposed to characters. Really beautifully done and highly recommend the watch.,False

17,8,Democracy?,guisreis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very good documentary that goes depth inside USA undemocratic and racist state, far away from widespread shallow speech and self-image of a country of freedom and democracy. As usual in dictatorahips, FBI not only inbestigated but also harassed Martin Luther King in order to dampen anti-racist struggle in the country.

18,8,The policy of suspicion,MiguelAReina,n/a,16/08/2025,"The FBI begins spying on MLK on suspicion of communist activities and ends up spying on his sex life. It is the disease of the moral watchers. The documentary accurately narrates these espionage activities that move against the defense of human rights. Through well selected archival material, it is a necessary film to show the moral baseness of those who considered themselves protectors of moral integrity. It is the danger of a policy based on constant suspicion.",False

But I feel like I didn't learn anything new. The documentary fails to provide a closer look into his life. The timeline and the order of the events and what the events even are, is depicted poorly. It's rather a farther look at MLK than a closer look. At some points I even felt like the documentary is actually trying to undermine him, a continuation of what FBI was trying then! You don't know who is commentating or being interviewed in the narration which gives a sense of dishonesty from the producers.",False
20,10,Cool documentary - an insightful take on the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is quite a comprehensive and elaborate documentary - with a nice academic touch to it :)
So this film focuses on civil rights leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Martin Luther King, and his relation to the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover; ending with King's assassination in 1968.So hopefully the FBI has learned something from that; namely that harassment of civil rights leaders - in particular black and colored folks - is unacceptable, and that freedom of speech, assembly and association must be upheld and honored by law enforcement officers in the United States of America.What stands out in this film, I think, is that Martin Luther King successfully combated racial inequality and discrimination through nonviolent resistance. It should be noted though, that racial equality and social harmony remain elusive in America to this very day - with an increasing incidence of police violence against minority groups. Although quite a complex topic, I think it is imperative that the US Senate and Congress - in particular President Joe Biden - finally take the necessary steps to implement a Basic Income Guarantee (BIG) in the US; to effectively counteract racial inequality as well as socioeconomic inequalities - so that all folks in America have the opportunity to get a good education and be able to provide for their children.It should also be noted, that US teachers say school shootings and mental health struggles have made this year their hardest yet - with many teachers struggling to preserve their mental health. Teachers in Germany can out-earn an entry-level doctor or web developer. But in the United States, too many teachers have to work second jobs to make ends meet.Many teachers told CNN they fear they've already reached a point of mental burnout. And it's not just teachers - pediatricians in the pandemic are seeing record numbers of children with mental health problems.Hence the US government - as well as the US judiciary - must make a greater effort to empower US teachers and counter health problems among young persons; such as increasing salaries for school teachers, so that they can make ends meet, prevent mental burnout, and are not taken advantage of.So hopefully the US Senate and Congress - in particular President Joe Biden - can improve salaries for US teachers and properly fund public schools; by implementing the necessary laws to make it mandatory for US states to provide a functional school system and appropriate salaries for teachers

21,8,Red Scare Meets Black Lives,JayWolfgramm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary tackles a very interesting part of history. It is a story I don't often see taught in school. It features a lot of big figures is U. S. History. It is the 1960's, we have J. Edgar Hoover, Lydon Johnson and of course, Martin Luther King Jr. Take those characters and put them in the U. S. 1960's setting, with the Civil Rights, Cold and Red Scare. Put all these ingredients together and you have your self a fascinating recipie.Looking at the situation from the lense of today, it is easy to see that Hoover is acting selfishly and irrationally, but this documentary does a good job of rationalizing his actions, without justifying them.It is also quaint to remember a time when the FBI needed wiretaps in order to listen in to American's phone calls.Not much to say, the film does its job well. It informs its audience of an interesting story in an interesting matter.",False
22,10,Glad I watched!,babybirda,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI read David J. Garrow's piece about MLK in Standpoint and it was so disturbing that I became interested in a subject that never interested me in the least. The piece was so unbalanced it reminded me of the classic stereotype about Black men. Rape and orgies? Garrow dehumanized MLK. MLK/FBI humanized him. It showed the worry, the anguish on his face when his wife received the tape and his thought that his world was going to collapse. He was HUMAN, not a crazed maniac.I found MLK/FBI to be realistic. King was in his 20s when his star began to rise. It is believable that women made themselves available and he didn't say no. Over the course of 10 years, 40 sounds like a reasonable number of women for a man who cheats on his wife to have slept with while he was on the road. MOST adulterers do not rape or participate in orgies. FBI added too much their transcripts during a time when Emmitt Till was murdered for whistling at a White woman.I appreciate two points the documentary made about King.1. He was extremely busy, flying all over the place, marching for miles, meeting with people, writing speeches, spending days in jail and he had a wife and four kids. On one of the tapes, he is planning to hook up with a girlfriend in a MONTH because he had no time on his schedule. A human being, even a Black man, only has so much energy and there are only 24 hours in a day. To believe otherwise is to buy into that stereotype that I have not yet found to be true.2. The FBI was trying to take MLK down. They were next door listening to his private conversations. IF a rape actually occurred, they had the power and the obligation to arrest MLK and the men in the room, to prevent the rape. They wanted to destroy him and that would have done it. Yet, they did nothing more than send to his wife, not the rape tape, not even an orgy tape, but a tape of ONE man and ONE woman getting busy. The imagination of the FBI creeps into their transcripts because they describe what MLK saw and also his demeanor. It's a 1960's audio tape. How would they know? They could not see him His wife said that it could be anyone on the tape.I suspect that in 2027, all that we will hear on those tapes is static and a little moaning. Even his wife knew that he was cheating.",True
23,3,Not convinced,docherla-59758,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary on the whole appears hypocritical. Here, we have a baptist pastor married leading a nonviolent protest movement based on integrity and drawn from philosophies based on truth/integrity/honesty etc.On the other hand, we have the FBI, an organisation sworn to protect the administration.I actually not understand whether the commentators were insisting that the FBI's evidence on King's sexual adventures was true or not. Audio tapes are quite enough, even in those days, to make out who is who and there is not much variations in the sounds made during sex and names are usually mentioned. They just seemed to hint that the evidence was planted.In addition, I did not see anything to support that King did not do it nor did I understand why he went through an emotional crisis when he had not done it.My biggest peeve about this documentary since I watch a lot and everyone of them have video recordings of the commentators talking so that body language can be made out, is that none of the commentators are on camera and in addition, none of them neither prove nor disprove that the FBI was fabricating evidence.",True

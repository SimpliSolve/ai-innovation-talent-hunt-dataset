1,10,Can't stop thinking about Can't feel nothing,mattyspens,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film made me frustrated, disillusioned, curious, self-critical, and I loved every minute of it. The director is an odd duck to start, but watching him become a fish out of water in so many subcultures, investigating so many emotional manipulators is actually a joy to behold. Maybe not for your mom, but anyone who knows the peril of the doom scroll will be intrigued by this surprisingly funny and very poignant doc. I was particularly interested in the international sections in Russia and Asia, but the dominatrix is probably the best character. Perhaps I have become a new fan of hers as well...",False
2,10,Philosophical dark comedy on the internet and our emotions,Dugongplayer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler*spoilers*
This film travels to the belly of the internet to showcase how it's used to manipulate our emotions. It captures people, including the self effacing director, at their most vulnerable. Russian youth are being used for propaganda. An L. A. techdom humiliates men in their own homes (to their utter delight) through use of technology. A North Macedonian doctor creates fake news to pay off student debt. A Chinese live streamer wants to be a musician but it's not as profitable as sitting in front of her phone talking to her fans about nothing in particular. And triumphantly, an internet troll in Florida finds love in someone he has bullied.Can't Feel Nothing is a metaphor for the internet itself, through its absurdity and sprawling nature and it's addictiveness. Sometimes, you don't want to look at some cringe worthy scenes but can't look away. It's a rabbit hole and I want to go down into it again.",True
3,10,Mistress Harley stuns as the star of Can't Feel Nothing,techdommewifey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can't Feel Nothing is an amazing documentary starring Mistress Harley the Techdomme. Mistress Harley steals the entire show. Everyone else is sad they can't feel nothing, but Mistress Harley profits while living a life she enjoys. Everyone else lives in a sad fear filled world and Mistress Harley is fearless and proud. Damn is she hot. I can see why the director wanted to interview her. I bet he spends a lot of time on Mistress Harley's  website  like all the other guys.The movie is too short and should have been longer. Also why such limited credits? Only the crew gets credits and none of the subjects. It's kinda lame to see all these really cool people and have no idea who they are. Also text on screen would be helpful. Tell me where I am and who is talking otherwise I forget. Even the news knows to do that. I hope on DVD they have better credits and special features.",False

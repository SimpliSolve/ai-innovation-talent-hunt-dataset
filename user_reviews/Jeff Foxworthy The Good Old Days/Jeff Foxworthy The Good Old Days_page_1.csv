1,7,Good solid show,brett-76260,n/a,15/08/2025,I will say I love JF. He is a comedian that that always brings it. No this isn't the best show he's done but it's well worth watching. One thing that I love the most about him is his show is clean and not riddled with language. I'm a US Marine so I'm not a novice when it comes to foul language. But there is something refreshing to sit down and watch a comedy special and not have to hear non stop f bombs. Jeff proves you don't have to cuss to be funny. That's probably one of the reasons he had a loyal fan base. They know he's not gonna f bomb you to death. Again this isn't his best performance but man it's good to see him back on the stage.,False
2,5,Pretty tame for the boomers,MajBlade2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jeff Foxworthy was never Andrew dice clay but he did have a bit of bite to his comedy alot time ago. I think he spent so much time in Branson he just knows what comedy will make people haha and be comfortable
And nothing wrong with that
hope he makes more
but I think Ill move on.",False
3,5,Good Clean Comedy Fun,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jeff Foxworthy has been around a long time. He is a family friendly southern comedian, His stand up special is enjoyable. He talks about his Mother, his relationship with his family, and non controversial social issues. I like him but he is not my favorite, by far. Nothing about this special offends but nothing sets the world on fire either. The word that came to mind over and over again was ""cute"". It was cute and highly watchable. I chuckled and smiled a lot. His common sense approach to life is refreshing.",False
4,6,it has funny parts,faithless4734,n/a,15/08/2025,Jeff is a great comedian. He seems to have lost a step. While there are funny parts in this it seems somehow to be missing a vital element. I cannot say it better thatn that. I know that fails to convey my point. He just missed the mark.,False
5,6,"""None of us have it figured out.""",classicsoncall,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHe's been funnier, but coming out of our two year long Covid haze, the show was a welcome event. As the title suggests, Jeff made a trip down memory lane to compare then and now when it comes to things like cell phones replacing the antiques that most viewers today can't even relate to. The line about not knowing who his new grandson's father is was in poor taste I thought; I hope he was kidding about that since he didn't bother clarifying the statement. The road story about him and Larry the Cable Guy probably took some courage, as I tried to picture myself in the same situation and couldn't see myself walking out the hotel room door. You think he really gave that Old Milwaukee to Larry?",True
6,3,Disappointed!,collectorofsorts,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm an old guy and Twitter was on fire about this show tonight. So, I thought I would give it a watch. I got15 minutes into an hour long show and I heard 3-4 mildly funny things that made me crack a momentary smile. But they were quickly forgotten with new bouts of soft spoken ramble. And I normally like these old guy/back in the day shows. But this one is just too boring. I turned it off at the 15 minute mark.",False
7,8,Finally a comedy show NOT about Covid or politics,phojar,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you thank you thank you!!I've tried watching several stand up comedy shows and immediately get turned off when the comic goes political, so it was very refreshing to watch a show without being attacked. I needed that.Good, refreshing comedy.Keep it up!",False
8,4,Not his best material,Snootz,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'll admit I've never been a huge Foxworthy fan, but he has his moments. And there are some mildly humorous parts in this 60 minute routine. But the majority of it is tired and demeaning ""my wife"" and ""my mother"" jokes that had me yawning through most of the show. Dude, it's just not funny to listen to 20 minutes of how your wife packs a suitcase. And cracking jokes about not knowing who the father of your daughter's child is... just not funny.There wasn't much of anything brilliant or hilarious in this. Not one belly laugh, or even more than a chuckle. A lot of this show is a bit off-color (no, it's not ""good, clean comedy"" when he's talking about the size of his junk).I did somewhat enjoy the end when he's talking about his unexpected evening in the hotel. Other than that, there's not a joke or routine in the rest of the show that was memorable. I noticed he no longer finishes on the ""You just might be a redneck"" routines, and that's fine I guess. But maybe he needs to think up something new and original, because wife / mother / mother in law / daughter jokes just don't cut it any more.",False
9,8,Perhaps those of a certain age may appreciate this more,billsoccer,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm almost 70 and have been listening to Jeff since he broke into the public scene. A lot of his current jokes are about his life experiences, being older etc. Perhaps that is why I appreciate his material and my wife and I laughed out loud many times. I don't think a much younger audience would relate. But if you think as I do, don't miss this. It is his best material in many years.",False
10,3,A few chuckles but more like grampa rambling,OneAnjel,n/a,15/08/2025,"You know that one old guy who always tells the same corny jokes at every gathering and draws them out longer and longer every year? That's what Jeff reminds me of here. He starts off by saying his wife is a visual interpreter, or something made up, and then proceeds to mimic the characteristics of someone with undiagnosed adhd - for 2 very long minutes - (or someone on meth). In fairness, most people over 50 don't realize that's an illness and has a treatment - my mother was like that and, trust me, there's nothing funny about it. If you make it past that horrible experience, you might enjoy some of the Remember Whens (if you're over 60) but it's just not funny. Some of them are mildly amusing but then he beats them like a dead horse. You definitly need to be in your 60s (raises hand) to even understand some of the humor now that we're in the age of me too and cancel culture. I didn't finish it but I did get 30 min in, thus the 3 stars giving the benefit of doubt for the parts I declined.",False
11,1,Has stand up comedy died??,landon-70581,n/a,15/08/2025,"I spent the whole time wondering how this could have been released as a finished product.The only thing I came up with is that he has a big name, so every time he practiced this material he got laughs leading him to believe it was funny.Is the 2 drink minimum making comics think their material is way better than it is?Netflix keeps raising prices, canceling quality shows and pumping out garbage comedy and terrible reality TV.I rage cancelled my subscription after seeing this attempt at a ""special"".",False
12,1,Does he need money?,shawnwojcik,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTired covid jokes, good old days are apparently 30 years ago cause what he references as current times are from 15 years ago. What a waste of time and money. Spoiler alert. This sucks.",True
13,1,This is kind of unbelievable.,scotty-52238,n/a,15/08/2025,"The way Jeff is able to notice that thigs have changed and are kind off different than before is uparalelld in comedy.Did you know that older people sometimes have trouble with cell phones and that back in the day that sometimes the cable connected to your phone could get tangled up ? That women can take a long time to get ready ? Oh it's so true, because they do, and they did ! That's why it's funny.Well get ready for some serious wackiness, edgy and very, very, very, very original jokes.Oh and did anyone know that mother in laws can be annoying sometimes ? I don't know why more comics don't do mother in law jokes, they are so relatable because i too know people who have annoying mother in laws. Jeff completely nails it. Observational humour at it's very best.",False
14,1,Irrelevant:,appletimebaby,n/a,15/08/2025,"Has-been comedian tries to remain relevant while rousing political turmoil of right-wing conspiracy theories. Jeff Foxworthy was barely funny at the peak of his career. Now, watching he is a sad, pathetic shadow of his former self.His one-hit-wonder of a joke should be left in the past along with this simple minded fool who has often been outsmarted by 5th graders.",False
15,1,Worst stand up act of all time and I'm not exaggerating,nlytnd_1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This standup makes Brendan Schaubs The Gringo Papi look like a masterpiece.The whole act is painfully boring and the entire act is loaded with the most cliche observations that were beaten to death 20+ years ago.. Woman shop a lot get it... women pack a lot... get it. Remember back in the day when phones had cords on them. This is horrifically unfunny. I don't know how it's possible for someone to put out something this bad.It's not a matter of taste, no one found this act funny those people who ranked this act over a 1 have an insane degree of bias in favor of a comedian they like as opposed to a funny comedy act they liked. Even many open micers have some essence of funny even if they're nervous and fumbling the delivery... this is the worst written material of all time. Foxworthy must be mentally ill to be this out of touch with comedy.",False
16,1,What were Netflix thinking?,russbdenny,n/a,15/08/2025,Who says conservatives can't do comedy? Anyone who watches this disaster of a stand up. Tired jokes that were cliches fifteen years ago that have definitely not improved with age and the same can be said of Jeff Foxworthy himself. This was just embarassing.,False
17,2,Avoid if you don't currently reside at a Senior Living Facility,rodredburn,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTerrible special without a doubt. Tons of outdated material about IPhones and text messages and corny stories about his wife, mother in law etc.However, my friend Longhorn and I convinced our buddy Philib to watch it. Longhorn and I had hyped the special via group chat for hours before Philib caved in and said he was going to watch it with his soon to be wife. Keep in mind that Philib is in his 30's and his lady friend is only like 28 (good job Philib!)We waited an hour or so and I asked him for his rating of the special? Philib has yet to respond and I think this was the straw that broke the camels back. Thanks a lot Foxworthy for ruining a 15 year friendship!",True

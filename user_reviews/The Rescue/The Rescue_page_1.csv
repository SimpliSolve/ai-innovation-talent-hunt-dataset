1,8,This is great. The best doc on the cave rescue.,JurijFedorov,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI have watched quite a few documentaries, news segments, and Youtube videos about this cave rescue. It's a huuuuge operation so every time you watch a new video you see something totally new about the operation. There were hundreds of people directly on the scene, thousands involved, various different plans being checked out. It's just enormous. Elon Musk even promised he would build a mini submarine to rescue the kids and called one of the rescuers pedo guy for doubting him on Twitter. Of course completely insane idea because it's very narrow cave passages, but there were many such alternative plans.So all these documentaries, and movies, are not always about the same thing. Here the focus is on the rescue divers. Especially divers from UK and then one doctor/diver from Australia who gives the kids anesthesia and makes this all possible. They also bring up the Thai divers and their inexperience. And then the big political hurdles they all had to punch through to even be allowed to try out this rescue attempt. Days after they left the cave was flooded. So just a few more days and everyone still down there would be dead.In the other docs they mention and show how Thai units unsuccessfully climbed down small caves on top of the mountain to find a route down to the area where the kids were. It was a dangerous task by itself. It's mentioned here for 30 seconds. But it was actually a big operation by itself. Then there are the farmers who allowed their crops to be ruined by the water pumped out of the cave. Those farmers are amazing! They are not even mentioned here. It's largely focused on the White divers. Which frankly feels just perfect for this because this is the main storyline. I did enjoy the other docs because they presented the culture in greater details. But the actual rescue was 95% done by these divers and their plan and they did it voluntarily. This is the best documentary about the rescue itself for sure as we get interviews with all the divers and even opinions from a girlfriend and wive at times. We see the full plan from start till finish. They even tell us about how a diver got lost and swam in the wrong direction with a kid. This stuff is not mentioned in the overview docs. We learn a lot about smaller mistakes and even who made the plan. In the other docs it really feels like the British divers just kinda helped out. Which here is shown to be totally false. They actually did all this stuff themselves.It's also by far the most emotional doc. It's personal stories. We get to nearly meet the kids here as we slowly explore how they were found. Now, there is A LOT of politics around this. An enormous amount of Thai politicians budding in and doing nearly all PR on this, to improve their image. This is shown in the first 30 minutes, but then largely drops to the background. While in reality the politicians actually did a lot more talking. They also show religious gurus come to visit the cave. It's just a ton of people who really don't do anything to help out on the ground who just visit the place or are in power without really knowing much about what is going on. In the other docs you see the fuller picture so the Thailand farmers and mountain cave explorers make the Thai effort more impressive. Here the politicians, gurus, and divers are the ones shown and they didn't really present the greatest image of Thailand as they did make quite a few mistakes because of inexperience. But the doc overall is brutally honest. All mistakes are just clearly presented and the divers don't mind revealing where they messed up. In the other docs it's shown as a herois group project for all countries.This is NOT the last story on this rescue. There are hundreds of hours about this. And you really need a small TV show to show it all. This is just a very small part of the full story. We don't even learn about the diver who died from a cave infection a year later or about what the boys did afterwards. They don't even tell us if the girlfriend to a British diver, the second most featured person here, ever ended up dating him because he became a hero or if they just broke up?They do show some amazing 3D cave scenes that show us how this was done. This is not seen anywhere before so this is HUGE. Amazing idea and really makes this one stand out. Then you have quite a lot of shots that are from somewhere else. Either recreations or shots from other cave dives that are shown here to recreate the events. I'm not sure where they filmed that or who the actors were as they never tell us what shots are real or what shots are fake recreations.It's very fun and fascinating. Best doc on the cave rescue... so far. Something better will come along, I just know it.",True
2,9,Reminiscent of Touching the Void,matthewssilverhammer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIf this were fiction, it would be written off as a manipulative, corny, & narratively ridiculous argument for the power of the human spirit. As a documentary, it's an inspiring, assured, laser-focused, & terrifyingly heart-dropping disaster-adventure-drama, proof that sometimes the truth of a story can be a significant part of its appeal. Told through original footage, incredible talking head interviews, & Touching-the-Void-level reenactments, it's among the most thrilling films of 2021.",True
3,9,Not all hero's wear capes,paudieconnolly,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerOne of the most inspirational stories of humanity. A tale that shows all humans have a connection to risk everything your life your Freedom your Future for another person you have never even seen in country you have never been. It a tribute to the human spirit and human experience. Filmed beautifully with perfect story telling. In an age when reality tv could not be faker. Here is some reality Tv which should make you proud to be a Human.,True
4,10,Meet some real-life superheroes,A_Different_Drummer,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerCould be the best documentary ever made. Because of the proliferation of cameras and social media, everything seems to happen in real time. Conflict. Resolution. Heroes. Superpowers. Forces of Nature. Even (not kidding) a love story. Supernatural intervention. Science & ingenuity. Courage. Sacrifice. A happy ending. Bring Kleenex. Lots of Kleenex. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

5,10,I Desperately Needed a Spoiler Before Watching,leftbanker-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't follow this story at all when it happened, so everything in the documentary was news to me, something that made it harrowing, often terrifying to watch. I really wished I'd had a spoiler, but I had to learn what happened as the film unfolded the story to me for the first time. For the faint of heart, I'd suggest reading about it first as you may not hold up well to the crushing pressure and fear.What for most human beings represents the most dreadful thing imaginable just happens to be what a few remarkable souls do for fun. Their moment to rise up presented itself and the world is a better place for it. This film did a fantastic job of giving these men a few minutes to explain exactly who they are. It was a great experience to learn about them.A group of self-professed misfits and oddballs just happened to have the skill sets that the world's elite soldiers lack, while this ragtag bunch of men who don't appear out of the ordinary in any way, displayed a level of courage that I couldn't even contemplate. I'm not claustrophobic, or at least not much, by there were times viewing this that I had to pause it and take a few deep breaths.The boys were incredibly brave, to such a degree that I couldn't even take it in. When after something like twelve days of being trapped inside the cave, the divers surfaced, and the boys acted like their parents were ten minutes late picking them up at the mall.The actual rescue was the most preposterous thing anyone could have ever dreamed up, and those who came up with the plan were dubious of its success, but felt that this was the only course of action if the boys were to be saved.As I said, I didn't follow this story as it unfolded. When I saw that this documentary was available, I had no interest in watching it. It seemed like an after-school movie concept. I had no idea that the events of the story were so incredible, and what brought this film to life was how adroitly they analyzed the rescuers. It also did a great job of showing us that the world isn't always such a terrible place.",True
6,10,Bring Kleenex!,mjlyl1982,n/a,15/08/2025,"An amazing story of perseverance and triumph, it hit me on a level I didn't expect - after all the ugliness we've seen in the world with Covid, it restored my faith in humanity. Just go see it.",False
7,9,Deeply Moving Experience,howard.schumann,n/a,15/08/2025,"Successfully following up on an Oscar-winning documentary is not an easy task, but directors E. Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (""Free Solo"") more than accomplish that with The Rescue, the tension-filled story of the rescue of 12 young soccer players, ages 10-16, and their coach trapped in the Tham Luang Nag Non cave in Northern Thailand in 2018. Though it was a retreat the boys have often used in the past, after heavy premature monsoon rains, they found themselves surrounded by water two miles from the cave entrance, facing long odds for survival. To capture the drama, the filmmakers relied on 87 hours of footage filmed by a Thai admiral's wife, interviews with the rescue team, computer graphics, and the use of reenactments when it became too dangerous to film inside the cave.Trained cave divers were recruited as well as Thai Navy Seals, U. S. Special Forces, Australian medical experts, a Thai nurse named ""Amp"" Bangngoen who helped as a translator, and thousands of volunteers to undertake the rescue in the cave's claustrophobic, winding underground passageways. The challenge became even more real when divers discovered four pump workers trapped not far from the cave entrance and had to undertake a dangerous rescue that became a trial run for the later attempt to free the boys. With the cave rapidly filling with water, the conditions became so daunting that one volunteer - a former Thai Navy Seal, died from a lack of oxygen.When members of the Seals concluded that they did not have the diving skill required for the rescue attempt, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, two highly experienced British divers were called to Thailand. The inspiration of people of many backgrounds and training coming together from all over the world - including the U. S. and China - to engage in a joint undertaking captured the world's attention. Paraphrasing the late poet George Eliot, ""What greater thing is there for human souls than to feel that they are joined for life, to strengthen each other, to be at one with each other in silent, unspeakable memories?""The documentary not only depicts the bravery and determination of the divers, but offers a look into their personalities and goals, each with a compelling story. In one interview, one of the divers says that his dangerous hobby is ""two parts ego, one part curiosity and one part a need to prove yourself."" The divers talk about how they had been ""outsiders"" all of their lives, always regarded as misfits and ""nerds."" Fittingly, it was Stanton and Volanthen who first discovered the lost boys and their coach on a ledge two miles into the cave, where they had taken refuge after heavy rain submerged the route they had followed.Finding the boys was only the beginning of the ordeal, however. How to get them out seemed an impossible task given the monsoon threat and the rapidly filling cave. Though thousands of gallons of water were drained from the cave, it was only after a daring proposal to bring the boys out (rejected as ""insane"" by Australian Doctor Richard Harris) was finally approved that a way forward could be seen. The result is a deeply moving experience that should be seen on the big screen to experience its full impact. Even a cliché-ridden closing song, dreamed up by well-meaning Oscar-baiters, cannot ruin the experience that is The Rescue.",False
8,9,Incredible and inspiring,Movi3DO,n/a,15/08/2025,"Don't give up.A documentary about the event in 2017 about a rescue mission where 13 soccer kids and their coach got stuck inside a cave in Thailand.I think I heard a little bit about this event back then, but I had almost no memory of it coming in to this documentary. And wow, this was the most emotionally powerful and inspiring time that I had at the theater this year.The documentary aspect was extremely well done. There were minimal side-tracking, and the story got straight to the rescue and spent the entire time focusing on the divers and intense situation. Quite amazing was also reinvention of the scenes in the cave by the divers that participated in the rescue. Added to that were the real footage from the divers inside the cave. Some of them were heartbreaking to watch.I was on the edge of my seat for the whole rescue mission. I was glad that I didn't remember anything about the event, because I had no idea if the rescue was a success or not. Many times I had expected the worst outcome, which made me even more worried.The divers who were interviewed were incredible at retelling the story. They told enough information to get audience understand the direness of the situation as well as their emotions throughout the mission. There were some scenes that talked about the divers and their personal lives, but it was told just enough that I got where they came from and not feeling dragged.Lastly, the theme of not giving up and unification of the people were beautiful. So many times the divers thought it was impossible, but others encouraged them to take risks and not giving up hope on the kids. The amount of people that came from around the globe to participate in helping the kids were inspiring. It gave you more hope on humanity.Overall, an incredible documentary portraying an incredible event. 9.5/10.",False
9,9,A new benchmark by which documentaries of real-life significant events should be measured. Hugely emotionally affecting and technically superb,mickman91-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Perfect documentary in every sense. All of the details and narrative flowed effortlessly and was all well explained. It was clearly well researched from all sides and care was really taken to make sure all parties were respectfully and faithfully presented. From a technical standpoint it was also incredible. The blend of real footage with reconstruction work, especially in the cave and underwater which are incredibly difficult places to make a film technically, was seemless and fantastic. There was none of the terrible CGI or poor acting or cliche voiceover man that you get in many of the disaster documentary rubbish on TV. But most importantly, the devastating potential of the situation and the incredible courage and bravery and effort that was put forward by so many heroes really shone through - it is a nail biting and also a very emotional watch. The only thing is I am not sure why they didn't give any mention to the second Thai NAVY seal who died in 2019 as a result of a blood infection caught as a result of his brave work on the rescue. My guess is that this happened when production for this documentary was already finished. It is a strange oversight otherwise.",False
10,n/a,Genuinely suspenseful and moving account of the Thai Cave Rescue,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The world was captivated in 2018 when a youth soccer team got trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. This Documentary by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin (who won an Oscar for FREE SOLO) follows the rescue mission that was a collaboration of the Thai Naval Seal Team, divers from the U. S. Military, Australia and China (who, for some reason are given particularly short shrift) and other freelance divers from around the world. But, it was a squad of British civilians led by Rick Stanton and John Volanthen who took center stage because of their unique qualifications in such situations.Vasarhelyi and Chin were somewhat hamstrung in making the Doc for several reasons including the fact that Netflix has locked up the movie rights to the soccer team and their families and couldn't be interviewed (old news footage is used to get some of their side of the story; recreations are also used where no footage is available). The filmmakers made the decision to focus on the rescue personnel - it really should be called ""The Rescuers"".Even with these constraints - and the fact that everybody knows how it turns out - THE RESCUE manages to be genuinely suspenseful and moving.",False
11,7,An incredible retelling of the miracle heard around the globe,Mike_Devine,n/a,15/08/2025,"What makes a documentary compelling? Besides the fact that it's true storytelling, the intrigue of the subject matter has a lot to do with whether one is worth a watch. In National Geographic's 'The Rescue,' we're taken back to 2018 to see the full picture of how 13 members of a Thai youth soccer team were dramatically rescued from a flooded cave.There are a lot of things to like about 'The Rescue.' For one, we get to see how things unfolded in real time over the course of the weeks it took to study the situation, devise a plan that had the best chances of success and weather the elements (literally) in what can only be described as a true miracle. The team of expert cave divers who led the effort give firsthand accounts of every major decision, twist and turn that they were involved in as they raced against the clock, and the adrenaline comes through in their retelling of events.The thrill factor here rivals that of anything Hollywood churns out, even though it's not as suspenseful given everyone generally knows how the story ends. 'The Rescue' is a documentary that appeals to all ages and people of all different backgrounds. It should not be missed.",False

13,7,Couldn't Stop Holding My Breathe!,sethdoray,n/a,15/08/2025,"Like most, I've never gone cave diving or anything even close to that sort of thing, but golly this sure felt like the closest I'd get to that feeling of depth, claustrophobia and silence diving in such an environment would bring. Vasarhelyi and Chin do such a great job of bringing the emotions behind these heroic events to the forefront. The weight of life and death put on the shoulders of so many. And the call to action that can bring the most seemingly average person out of their day to day and into a dangerous cave. Excellent film, can't wait to watch it again!",False
14,8,"""...Believe!!!...""",li0904426,n/a,15/08/2025,"I believe most of the scenes were re-enacted by the same crew that helped in the rescue but that doesn't diminish the greatness of this documentary, on the contrary, they enhanced it. If it weren't for the insistence, tenacity, courage of the British dives, this rescue would not have been successful. The computer-generated images provided us with an idea of how big, long and dangerous this cave is. By also showing the intimate life of these British divers and their reasons and passion for diving, the directors brought more realism, authenticity, humanity to the documentary.One of the best documentaries of 2021.",False
15,9,"Forget prejudices, trust your intuition.",frank-liesenborgs,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Rescue"" is about the rescuers and the peculiar mentality of the dedicated cave diver. It also provides an expert, 3D-graphics-enhanced procedural recreation of the whole painstaking, perilous extraction process. The mechanics of the operation boggle the mind, and in presenting them so elegantly. Just amazing that despite all the differences in nationalities, training (Thai Navy Seals) culture and languages, a group of non-professional cave divers succeeded in the rescue of the 12 boys (age 11 to 16) and their football coach. Astonishing story and better than most Christmas movies nowadays. This is an unbelievable story that must been seen! It is better than most of the movies hitting the theatre now.",False
16,10,Amazing documentary,ilovefoodcoma,n/a,15/08/2025,What a well done documentary!!! It told the story so well with the original footage. Love it that they interviewed all the key persons in this mission so I got to know their point of view. The detailed explanation of the incident really got my full attention. What an amazing ending for such tragedy. All the people helping are truly heroes!,False
17,10,Amazing Edge of Your Seat Movie,DavoZed,n/a,15/08/2025,A simply miraculous rescue. The secrets of how it was done are revealed in the movie.A must see for anyone who believes anything is possible.,False
18,9,Gripping In Every Way,JoshuaMercott,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTwo directors and mindblowing detail set major tones in this documentary, which re-created a 2018 event that took the world by storm. Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi captured the best and scariest moments of a very real rescue operation that saved the lives of twelve boys and their football coach.They were stranded deep inside a flooded cave in Thailand, and if not for the rescue team's tenuous and continuous efforts, all of them would have perished.Daniel Pemberton's musical score kept me on the edge of my seat. Aloe Blacc's ""Believe"" was a beautiful soundtrack to feature in this docu.A 'tri-wizard' cinematography team - David Katznelson, Ian Seabrook, and Picha Srisansanee - did wonders bringing several important moments to life in this National Geographic documentary streaming on Disney+ Hotstar.Great work from the rest of the crew as well. All the actual people involved in the rescue - rescuers and rescued alike, from Royal Thai Navy members and regional officials to cave explorer Vern Unsworth and his partner Siriporn Bangnoen, as well as a handful of expert British and other civilian cave divers, and foreign military personnel - featured in this detailed and well-crafted project.This documentary genuinely bottled the angst and anxiety, fear and horror, of those crucial 'life and death' moments. The re-creation of several key elements were brilliantly dramatized. This Nat Geo documentary is definitely worth watching for several reasons, top on the list being its diligent attention to detail.",True
19,10,One of Mankind's Most Incredible Tales,ljsmith-25626,n/a,15/08/2025,"This HAS to be made into an adapted screenplay blockbuster for the big screen. I followed this breaking story closely back in 2018 and was absolutely captivated by it at the time. The Rescue sheds so much more light on the incredible store of the Thai cave rescue. It is almost a fairytale - the Myanmar monk who foretold the finale, the torrential monsoon rains that held off until the moment the last child had been rescued, the relationship between the cave diving hero and his love interest who just so happened to hail from the nearby Thai town. Fate. Everyone should watch The Rescue. I can't wait for the Hollywood adaptation.",False
20,n/a,The Rescue,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Rescue embodies the very element that is needed in the World right now, when every country works together to accomplish a single goal, beautiful things will happen. The sheer determination and heroism of the group of divers is the driving emotional force of the film, and so unlike many other documentaries, the film is not carried by fascination nor discovery, but more so on the development of human emotions. The topic was also such a big deal at the time that it is easy for audience to be captivated by it.",False
21,7,The Rescue,Prismark10,n/a,15/08/2025,"In 2018, 12 kids who had gone out to play football and their coach were trapped inside a cave system in Northern Thailand. They had little chance of survival as the monsoon season approached.Their plight captured worldwide attention. Once the rescue was over, media outlets signed up various parties. The school kids, the rescuers etc.Ron Howard even made a movie Thirteen Lives charting the ordeal of the football team.Co-directors Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi made the Oscar winning documentary Free Solo about a solo ascent of Yosemite rock face El Capitan.Here they concentrate on the volunteer cave divers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen from Britain. What was a strange hobby became a vital skill set. Even the Thai Navy Seals had problems navigating the cave system which was now flooded.The documentary uses news footage and reconstructions to tell their story. It has talking heads from the Thai authorities, the American armed forces who assisted them. As well as other cave divers from across the world including Dr Richard Harris who was vital to the rescue.However it was a fascinating take. The Thai authorities initially had little time for these guys but on their initial dive they came across four workers who were trapped. No one knew they were missing at first.What is missing is contributions from the kids and their families. That is because their rights were sold to other media companies.",False
22,10,This should win the Oscar again!!!!,jillbeckinheim7,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is single-handedly the most thrilling, tear-jerking film we've ever seen. KUDOS to the filmmakers and to all the HEROES of those 12 children.We saw this film in a completely empty theater (Century XD) in Rancho Mirage and it's a sad commentary on our country. THIS IS THE PERFECT FILM every American needs to see and completely empty seats. Instead all the young teens are watching Halloween, James Bond, Seeds of Chucky, etc.All the older adults have given up on great films like this.Truly awe-inspiring, earth-shattering, jaw-dropping documentary and I'm 100% sure it will win the Oscar. Nothing can compare to this. In fact, I will say it's the best Documentary ever made in the past 50 years.The closest documentary I've watched that comes close is 'The Epic Journey' that you can watch on youtube. But that's faith-based so beware.",False
23,7,A well put together and tension-filled documentary.,Top_Dawg_Critic,n/a,15/08/2025,"You can tell a lot went into the making of this docu, and that's not including all the real footage and international news clips. It was directed well, but it was a little too long for me at almost 2 hours, and the pacing wasn't that great. Some scenes felt rushed, others incomplete. This should've been shorter, or more content added with faster pacing. It had great cinematography, both in and out of the water.",False
24,10,How can anyone rate this below a 7?,brianearley25,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wanted to just come to the review section to see how many people are miserable with their life lol. They are easy to spot, they normally rate true stories with courageous people around 1 or 2 stars. If you do a deep dive of their life they are the most negative humans on earth lol. This was a very good documentary about real life people doing some extraordinary things. Shows the compassionate side of humanity and how in the most chaotic times we can actually come together and do some impressive things. Give it a watch.",False
25,8,"A really good documentary, especially in its second half",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Rescue is probably one of the very best documentaries of 2021, and tells the very suspenseful story about the rescue efforts in saving a soccer team of teenage boys from an underwater cave in Thailand back in 2018.Faults here are minimal. I think it drags a tiny bit in a few small spots in the first half, and the lack of footage sometimes leads to instances where you can tell footage is getting reused because they just didn't have any images of an integral event.But for the most part the set up is very good, and the second half of the documentary is where it really shines, as the rescue plans and the carrying out of those plans are expertly recounted for maximum dramatic effect, and many of the interviewees are genuinely interesting and engaging people in their own right.Was a big fan of this directing duo's last documentary too, Free Solo. That one might have had the more spectacular footage, but this one tells a more powerful and emotional story. Both are among the best documentaries of the past few years.",False

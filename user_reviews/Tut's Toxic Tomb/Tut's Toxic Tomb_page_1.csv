1,2,Would Have Been a 10 Without the Egomaniac in the Tank Top,PFFAW,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very interesting story very well told, but the egomaniac in the tank top was completely distracting. Her presence on camera added absolutely nothing. I'm assuming she was included to give the show ""sex appeal,"" but she was just annoying. Somebody needs to tell her to cover up, especially her massive hips that look even bigger with the camera angles used. She even ensured that they included a butt shot of her. At least she put a shirt on when she went to Europe. Her hair was also annoying. I don't think it's the asset that she thinks it is. It would be really nice if the production team could edit the bimbo out and rerelease the show. Then I would give this show a 10. Great, engaging experts, excellent documentation from the time, Josh is a great host, as always. I learned a lot.",False

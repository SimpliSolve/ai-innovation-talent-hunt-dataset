1,n/a,Jesus can do anything,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The best movie I have ever seen. Jesus is the son of God. He showed us what real mercy is. He never condemned the human race opposite to that he died for us yet when we where still singers. He is alive today. And all that call on him will be saved. Jesus is lord. The movie talks about that.jesus is coming back soon. Jesus took on himself the wrath of God. On the cross he was separated and abounded by God, so you and me will never be left by him. Please homble yourself and call on his name. Hell is real. Jesus can help you and he is next to you even now. He is stronger than any power that you are facing. Hell temples at the name of Jesus. Call on him. He is alive!",False
2,10,Miracles! Signs and Wonders!,kandis107,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm concerned to hear some Christians say they didn't enjoy the movie simply because they don't believe deliverance is real? We have plenty of user case stories in the Bible that tells us that it is. Are you questioning this because the Bible didn't explicitly say that The demon possessed people that Jesus healed had been saved before or had been in church or were Christians?!?! It doesn't matter if you're saved you can still open gateways unknowingly to the demonic and become bound by a spirit that got in your temple through an open door. We come into agreement many times through the things we watch, purchase, say out of our mouths unknowingly. Now do you have power to send those spirits away? 100% yes!!! But What happens if you don't know that you opened a door or that you came into agreement with an ungodly spirit? You then will need deliverance my friend! Yes it happens to saved people too!! It's happened to me before No shame!!! Get free!!!!For the naysayers, Y'all please don't be used by the enemy by sharing incorrect information simply because you just lack knowledge... This movie reveals the revival that is definitely happening in the last days that the Lord revealed in the Word, the great awakening. During the showing of this movie at my theatre people were crying, weeping, getting prayed for, getting delivered and giving their hearts to the Lord. I for one was touched and had never experienced nothing like this before outside of a church!!! I felt so much better after I left the movie I felt like something was lifted off of me and that I now had the strength to handle my situation a little better. The signs and wonders and harvest from this movie was amazing! God is still moving!!! Please go see it now!!!",False
3,1,You can tell these people are corrupt by the reviews,Vjohnal-139-371203,n/a,16/08/2025,"A flood of perfect 10-star reviews with little detail is a red flag. It suggests either a coordinated effort to artificially boost the movie's rating or a lack of genuine audience feedback. In an era where online reviews can heavily influence viewership, it's not uncommon for filmmakers, studios, or marketing teams to engage in tactics that make their films appear more well-received than they actually are. While some movies do garner universal praise, true audience reception tends to be more diverse, with a mix of both positive and negative opinions.If a movie truly deserves a high rating, you'd expect to see a variety of reviews-some offering thoughtful praise, others providing constructive criticism. A well-loved film often inspires deep discussion, with viewers sharing their favorite moments, highlighting strong performances, or pointing out flaws. When a film only has overly positive, vague, or generic comments, it raises questions about the authenticity of the feedback. Are these reviews coming from real moviegoers, or are they strategically placed to create hype?Additionally, looking at the dates of the reviews can provide further insight. If a large number of 10-star ratings appear in a short time frame, especially before the movie has been widely released, it strongly suggests manipulation. Genuine audience responses typically trickle in over time, with different perspectives emerging as more people watch the film. If there's an overwhelming wave of near-identical praise immediately upon release, it's reasonable to question the legitimacy of those reviews.Without a balance of opinions, it's difficult to trust a film's rating. A truly great movie will withstand scrutiny and still earn high praise from a wide range of viewers, not just those pushing a specific narrative. When the feedback feels suspiciously one-sided, it's often a sign that something isn't quite right. While this doesn't automatically mean the movie is bad, it does suggest caution before blindly trusting the hype. Instead of relying solely on ratings, it's best to look for reviews with detailed analysis and a mix of viewpoints to get a more accurate sense of whether the film is worth watching.",False
4,10,The Holy Spirit will Guide you to truth,zbpdtkgd,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm saddened that there is even one negative review concerning this movie. I realize that there are Christians that have accepted the Lord as their Savior but their growth stops there. The greatest thing is to read the word of God. Be willing to allow Holy Spirit to Guide you to the Truth. Everything in the movie is Biblical. Folks will admit that Satan is real but they do not want to acknowledge that deliverance, healings and Miracles are for today. Read the word of God. And yes Holy Spirit is alive He is with us . This could be the first thing you may need to Learn. Read the Bible ask God to guide you and listen. Thank you Mike Signorelli and others for being bold in the Lord the movie deserves a 20.",False
5,10,Fantastic,ricolad-24603,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was such a great testimony to the glory of God sweeping across the world. Real revival is so needed...today more than ever. This is a movie that needs to be shared with your family, friends and as many lost souls as you can find. Satan will do his best to wreak havoc where he can, out of desperation, because he knows how the story ends. This movie will be an eye opener and life changer. Suicides and addictions will be canceled. True revival will begin to take place in theaters, homes and churches. It's time for the true body of Christ to put on the spiritual armor and prepare for battle. Time to get off the sidelines and start taking territory back from Satan.",False
6,10,This movie is LIFE. CHANGING!!!,maillady-04438,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone needs to see this movie!! If you believe that God is raising up a remnant and I do then it's a MUST WATCH!!! Deliverance broke out in my theater and lives were forever changed! I'll definitely be going back on November 13th. When we kick God out of the church he shows up in the movie theaters. Society has gotten so demonic and churches have become so lukewarm warm. This movie shows you that God is still in business for those that give him their YES!! I can't even put into words what I witnessed at the first showing. I'll be taking friends, family, neighbors, absolutely anyone that needs a touch from God! This movie is so well done. Thank you Pastor Mike Signoreli for your YES!!",False
7,10,Game Changing Movie,speedysonic-95532,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is a documentary that covers several revival events and their origins from several key ministers of the gospel across two continents. And is a gateway to bring people to seeing and knowing the gospel that otherwise would be too intimidated to attend a local church.Revival broke out in several locations across America in the aftermath of the movie ending for several days. Healing, deliverance, salvation for many. As the stories told in this movie connected to the people who have previously felt disconnected from the church.The Domino Revival comes at a time where there is great division across the world. And the barriers that had to be overcome to get a Christian based movie onto theaters across America is a hurdle few have been able to overcome.May God continue to use the film that has captured and blinded the imagination of the world. To who Jesus really is!",False
8,10,Revival is Now!,michellepacheco-59347,n/a,16/08/2025,"V1 Chruch and all the Pastors walk by faith and not by sight. I went to watch this movie and it was amazing how God moves mountains. The Glory of God was all over the movie. I enjoyed all chruch members praying and asking for prayer. Pastor Moses laid hands on me and my friend we felt so at easy after we left the theater. I also saw Dan he Baptized me and my friend Ray we was so happy to see him. Deliverance is real. It's about our deliver Jesus Christ he took away all my fear and worries. I love me so Jesus he is my best friend now and forever, he is the way and the truth of the life. With God all things are possible. I will submit to God until I take my last breath.",False
9,10,No Spirit but the Holy Spirit,shantethomas-28759,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a call for all people to wake up and enlist in the spiritual army. Viewers were empowered by the message, convicted by the Holy Spirit, healed, and delivered. As believers, we are called to follow the great commission declared by Jesus Christ. This film is an evangelistic tool that not only speaks to the heart of believers, but it also pulls those that might have back slidden and unbelievers back to their rightful place in the Kingdom of God. By the end of the film, there were many salvations and rededications. It was beautiful to see strangers praying for one another and being the church outside of the four walls. Freedom was brought to the streets, and revival became the heart posture. Revival is now. Go see.",False
10,10,Can't wait to see it a second time November 13th!!!,cjensen-85465,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie changed my life forever!! I am so thankful, I will be taking my father and husband November 13th!! Finally a movie that's worth watching, praise God!! I am now following each and every person in this film, and they are teaching me so much in such a short time. Forever thankful for each and every person in this movie. This is exactly what the world needed! I sat down to watch this 2 hr long movie and by the time it was done I thought only 45 minutes had passed!!! And to me that's incredible! Not very many movies I can say that about! I encourage everyone to go see this and or make sure u watch it when it comes out!",False
11,10,"Faith stirring, Points toward Jesus",ravenkask,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was really in expectation for this movie because God has been moving in my life in an amazing way. Sometimes words can't explain, it's literally just like Jesus said Come and see. This movie helped me do that, it's amazing the way people are getting touched by Jesus like in the Bible! I've personally been touched in this way. And if you're truly in the healthy part of deliverance you know it's not about quick fixes, but getting your hands untied to actually fight back! There were things and thoughts I battled with for so long that I took on as my identity. Once I realized that demonic activity was real I was able to see it for what it is. Deliverance is not an excuse to keep sinning, but it's freedom for a believer to really walk in all God has for them, unhindered.",False
12,10,The greatest movie since ever,melissaromero-18108,n/a,16/08/2025,"You will want to experience and see what Jesus is doing in America. He has been building an army.

We all have a part of the final days and you will want to be here to experience the Domino effect. This is just the beginning😍.

13,10,Touch the hem!!,jodiisblessed,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movement/movie represented the bible account of the woman who touched the hem of His garment and was forever changed!! You can NOT make this stuff up. Bring a mustard seed of faith and show up to see this!! God is not limited to a pretty church, in fact much of His ministry was on the field!! What do you have to loose?? An illness, an addiction, a demon?!? Unforgiveness, poverty?What could you possibly gain?? Freedom, restored family, marriage? Relationships,and new perspective, the truth, family, discipleship. No stone was left unturned, the power of God is very much moving amongst His people, and the devil is still a liar!!!

14,10,Awesome!,francesletogreene,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Domino Revival is a movie like no other you have seen!! God is still doing signs, wonders & miracles!! To watch everyday people being impacted by the power & presence of Jesus brings you to tears! Not only was my heart touched but as I looked around, many in the theatre were also touched. People were crying & by the end of the movie, many got up and gave their life to Christ! The Domino Revival is life changing! I would encourage anyone who wants to experience the heart of revival, run don't wait to buy tickets for the November 13th showing!

15,10,Inspiring a generation to believe for Revival and LIVE for Christ!,joelbomberger,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is moving and powerful! It gives first hand accounts and narratives that show how God is working in this generation. It shares countless miracles, personal testimonies and movements of the Holy Spirit that are happening across the globe.It's filmed excellently with a wide variety of denominations and expressions within the body of Christ. The interviews and highlights of each story and ministry represented within are powerful and noteworthy.I'm not sure why other reviews want to slander it just because they disagree with the theology of deliverance? This movie simply showcases real stories of people who's lives are set free. And showcases the Gospel of Jesus Christ at work. There's nothing unbiblical about it.Great movie, Go see it if you get the chance.",False
16,10,The REAL JESUS!,schlangenemily,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was a powerful move of God. It is not hype. It is not emotionalism but truly how God uses the least likely but because they say yes. It is their obedience to do whatever God says to do for the freedom of his people. Gifts of the spirit, prophecy and healing is for today. God is the same yesterday, today and forever. You can't accept the reality of darkness without also accepting that God is mightier. He is the King of King the Lord of Lords. Domino Revival is one of many stories intertwined in one. An epic movement you don't want to miss being a part of! My life has been transformed because of Pastor Mike's yes to Jesus. My husband and I would not be the people we are today without him and his wife Julie. They are the same people behind closed doors as they are on stage. Their humility and servant hearts always gives God glory. It's not about them but about Jesus.",False
17,10,The Dominos are falling!,katherinncastro,n/a,16/08/2025,"After this movie, I had a friend confess her anxiety and suicidal thoughts to me, she has been opening her heart to God along with others I brought along. I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit throughout the theater and not to mention the love for Jesus in the room was just truly impactful. This is definitely a good movie for Adolescents in today's age who are struggling, christians who've been asleep (dead in spirit), or anyone who's ever felt separated from God. It will draw you near, it will show you His power of healing anyone who opens their heart to Him. Bring your family, bring your kids, bring your friends, bring the non believers. Plant those seeds. Jesus reigns!",False
18,10,Powerful,rtgs-16225,n/a,16/08/2025,"Words cannot describe! I left the theater wanting more! I'd buy tickets to this movie every single time without a doubt and bring people so they can see for themselves!The Holy Spirit was present during the whole time take your whole family it is amazing and powerful!Thank you so much for making this movie, it gave a much deeper understanding to my partner and he has been much more open and receptive of The Truth!This movie has blessed me so much, that same night I rededicated my life to Jesus 😭

19,10,We need the Holy Spirit!,winningsaleshabits,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was raised about as ""social club"" Christian as they come. So, let's just say, deliverance services were something I experienced much later in life. And, I can totally understand people being hesitant to explore. There are charlatans and people only looking to manipulate emotions under the guise of Christianity. All that being said, this movie is an example that God still moves! The pastors in this movie are God-fearing men and women. Go see this movie, not for anyone else but for yourself. Don't worry about the person sitting next to you .... Allow the Holy Spirit to work within you. We need revival more than ever in this world!",False

21,10,A must see,melisaramos-74749,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was a must see I definitely recommend it to everyone who can go see it I absolutely loved every minute of it. Personally many supernatural things happen right after the movie the revival came home with me and I was able to Help A family member of mine who was in need and was desperately losing grip of their sanity, salvation, and sobriety. This was such an encouraging film I truly can't stress enough how important it is for believers to see it but also non believers.Honestly after seeing this movie one of the audience members invited us to V1 Church I binge watch all Mike's videos and wow I just am in awe the healing Power of the Holy Spirit. A must see! Miracles live footage.",False
22,10,WATCH THIS MOVIE!,jtgpjgdgf,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie was absolutely life changing and I recommend every non believer or even a believer to watch this movie. This movie touched me and my husband's life. My husband has been struggling with suicidal thoughts his whole life and he was freed from that October 24th. We both struggled with addiction as well my husband was smoking and mine was alcohol and we've struggled with that for a while and we decided that night to through out all his smoking stuff and all my alcohol and even the bartending tools I had out in the garbage. No longer will we serve addiction, no longer will have a place in our marriage nor in our household. We are freed and it was all because I watched this movie! This movie literally had me in conviction from the beginning to the end. Literally crying from beginning to end . And I feel that a lot of people need to watch this movie and see revival that is just stirring up- from this movie a fire light up inside of me like I felt it (it was as if a switch turned on inside of me) and I'm just hungry for the things of God. Before I felt lost and I felt like yeah I was going to church, but I was still doing the same things so I still felt the same way. But now I have this fire for God and I just can't stop and won't stop! GOD IS SO GOOODDD!! I'm ready to be a soerer of Gods kingdom!",False

24,10,Presenting the Gospel,mike-62568,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie is all about presenting the Gospel and setting people free from oppression. I was inspired. I highly recommend you to see it and be prepared to minister to others after the movie ends. What fun! Revival is now!I was blessed to be able to minister to a lady who was sobbing because she prayed and rejected a spirit of suicide that had been oppressing her. I then received a word from God to prophesy over her and also to prophesy over her middle school aged son and daughters.All the seats in the theater were sold out but not every seat was occupied. I believe people purchased tickets and gave them away and for one reason or another the recipient didn't attend. It is best to go with them to the showing.,False

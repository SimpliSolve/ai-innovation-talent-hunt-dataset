1,9,"Shout out to ""Uncle Ralph""! We Love YouðŸ’ž",akimr1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally, the world now knows what the ""culture"" always known. Herc birthed it, and Uncle Ralph raised it! Without him, there is no Yo MTV Raps, no Breakfast Club, no Hot 90 anything, no Drink Champs, etc... He had the vision & foresight to capture the music & the time, but more importantly the beauty & essence of the culture on video...Raw & Uncut! Super Shout out to Nas for returning the ""LOVE"" & using your skills & platform to pay it forward - this doc ensures we know & never forget who Ralph McDaniels is to ""Us""! You made sure this Man Got his Flowers Now! You did damn near the impossible with the short time allotted to tell a story that merits at the very least, a mini series - You captured it & brought the bass....so we not only see & hear it - but you feel it in your bones.... Salute!",False
2,9,The visual document of hip hop's legacy,dBom,n/a,16/08/2025,Video Music Box was to broadcast television what Kool DJ Red Alert was to radio around that same time.A living document of the early years of hip-hop that was not visible anywhere in the mainstream of America.May video never die.May every episode of this program be digitized and archived on the internet forever.,False
3,8,A Nas Song Come to Life,howisya,n/a,16/08/2025,"Emerging filmmaker Nas gives an inside view to Ralph McDaniels and his fabled Video Music Box, a television staple of New York City since the 1980s. Hip-hop fans who grew up outside of the range of WNYC TV or are on the younger side can more than put a face to the name: host/producer McDaniels and his show are given a loving tribute with a thorough history and seemingly total access to the treasure trove that is the thousands of hours of the show archive.The endeavor is a natural vehicle for gifted storyteller Nas, who affectionately honors and revives classic hip-hop figures and touchstones in his otherwise deeply introspective music. That love Nas has shown over his musical career is fully returned here with open and thoughtful interviews with those involved and a who's who in hip-hop and beyond offering their mostly glowing commentary on and touching recollections of the pioneering show and creator. Those no longer with us appear in well-preserved archive footage. Sincere appreciation for McDaniels and company's authenticity in bringing music that started out in the park to a wider audience echoes throughout and allows Nas to explore the history and evolution of hip-hop culture and music overall. You're Watching Video Music Box and never forget that, but it's one of the finest documentaries about hip-hop I've seen. Nas nails the cultural impact and significance here while keeping it fun and fairly light, and it is an absolute joy to watch. Shoutout to Mass Appeal.",False
4,10,I Like To Give A Shout Out,lunarrainbowpro,n/a,16/08/2025,To everyone that made mixtapes back in the day by having the cassette at the perfect position and waiting weeks until that song finally plays on the radio and then moving faster than the Flash to get across the room and simultaneously pressing down the play and record button. You are beautiful and I love you.,False
5,8,Legendary,CJXzoic1970,n/a,16/08/2025,"Long before Yo MTV Raps and Rap city Ralph McDaniels Video Music Box loomed large. Not being from the east coast, all of us in 'Middle America' would just get snippets of the cultural revolution happening in NYC. We did our best to keep up, starting our own public radio show and later video show. Very informational and long overdue documentary on what helped blow up Hip-Hop and the black east coast cultural experience. They're right, the powers that be kept attempting to block this movement from the rest of the world but the groundbreaking art would not be stifled. I wish they would dive deeper into the commercialism powers that be that control the media but then, that would anger those powers. Video, as evidenced on Tik Tok and IG now is such a powerful force of communications every current media maker needs to study what enabled this medium to prosper as is does. Music and video will never die. Bravo Ralph and Thank YOU. Thanks to NAS to seeing the importance of sharing this story!",False

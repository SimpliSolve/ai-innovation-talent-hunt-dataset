1,9,Today it's still one of the best horror films,Stibbert,n/a,15/08/2025,"Antarctica, winter 1982. The team on an American research base get surprised by a couple of mad Norwegians who is chasing a dog with a helicopter, trying to kill it. All the Norwegians are killed and the Americans are left with nothing, but a dog, a couple of bodies and questions. That's the beginning of the greatest horror/thriller film I've ever seen.From the very beginning all to the end you feel the tense, paranoid mood. Helpless and alone out in no-mans land. Ennio Morricone was nominated for a Razzie Award for his score. Why I don't know 'cause as far as I can see his score is simple, creepy and very good. It really gets you in the right mood.The acting is great! The best performance is probably given by the dog who's just amazing. As for Russell and the others on two legs I can say nothing less.You may think 1982 and special effects are not the most impressive? Well, think again! You haven't seen it all until you've seen this. Bodyparts falling off and creatures changing forms... Rob Bottin has done a great job witch today stands as a milestone is special effects makeup.The movie didn't get a big response when it first hit the big screen due to other alien films at the time and so it's not very well known. In fact you can almost consider it an unknown movie. Nobody I've asked have heard of it. However the movie has managed to survive for over twenty years as a cult film on video and DVD. Twenty years is a long time and except for the haircut the movie is still pretty much up to date. This movie is to be considered a classic.The movie is without doubt one of my, if not my favorite. I've seen it several times, but it's just as good as the first time I saw it. As a Norwegian the only thing I don't like about this movie is that MacReady keeps calling the Norwegians swedes!",False
2,8,Makes more sense now,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie failed at the box office and nearly ruined the career of John Carpenter. Think of that as you watch it. But did it really fail? It made nearly $20 million on a $15 million budget, but audiences must have expected more. Studios certainly did.Was it because E.T. came out at the same time, as well as so many other science fiction and fantasy films? Did the recession make people not want to watch something so nihilistic? Did the sheer level of gore turn people off? Were people upset that he remade a film some considered a classic*?After one market research screening, Carpenter asked the audience what they thought. One answered, ""Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing...?"" When Carpenter said that the answer was up to their imagination, the response was, ""Oh, God. I hate that.""How could audiences respond to a movie that did not spoon feed them any of the story beats? That doesn't have a single character to root for or get behind? That is influenced by Lovecraft - as our the other Apocalypse Trilogy installments Prince of Darkness and In the Mouth of Madness - in that ordinary people face off with supernatural horror that they are doomed to be destroyed by, which isn't really what mainstream America wants from a popcorn film?Yeah, it could be all of those things. Or perhaps, the world was not ready for it. But watching the end of this film, as everyone sits around wondering who has a disease that they can barely understand and know will eventually impact them, yeah. I think the world of 2020 is ready for it.I wonder what it's like to watch this movie when it screens every year at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. I bet it feels pretty real there, too.In an interview with the AV Club, Carpenter said, ""If The Thing had been a hit, my career would have been different. I wouldn't have had to make the choices that I made. But I needed a job. I'm not saying I hate the movies I did. I loved making Christine and Starman and Big Trouble in Little China, all those films. But my career would have been different.""As it was, Carpenter was reluctant to make the film** and nearly quit before it ever started filming. A lifelong fan of Howard Hawks***, he felt that his version of the story - both are based on Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell Jr. - was unbeatable. But as he re-read the original story - spurred on by co-producer Stuart Cohen - he saw how he could make a movie with a vision for his time, just as Hawks had thirty years ago.Beyond Carpenter, so many talents make this film work. Of course, there are the actors on screen, like Kurt Russell, Keith David, T.K. Carter, Wilfred Brimley, David Clennon and Richard Dysart. But there's also the astounding production design and storyboards from Man-Thing artist Mike Ploog and Mentor Huebner, which were so detailed that several of the shots from this look like carbon copies of their sketches. There's Dean Cundy working to make every shot look amazing - this is his first major studio movie with Carpenter. Want it to get even better? Sure, Carpenter could have done the score, but he got Ennio Morricone****. And finally, the Rob Bottin-lef effects team were pushed to the brink of exhaustion - Bottin was only 21 years old and ended up going to the hospital for exhaustion, double pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer after working for an entire year on the film, sleeping on set - but the work they created will never be duplicated and puts any CGI efforts to remake this film to shame. Carpenter thought that having someone in a suit - like Alien - cheapened the film. He wanted something more. Well, he got it. In the last battle with the Thing, fifty different artists are operating the monster.We're lucky that this movie exists. I saw it at the drive-in this year and it felt like it could have been made today. It was too imaginative, too nihilistic and too good for most people, even nearly forty years later.*One of the reviews that upset Carpenter the most came from the co-director of the original, Christian Nyby, said, ""If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse. All in all, it's a terrific commercial for J&B Scotch.""**Originally, Universal was going with Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel as the team for this movie, but were unhappy with their take. John Landis was also considered, but the film was really greenlit when Alien was such a big deal in 1979.***How big of a fan is Carpenter? You can see scenes of The Thing from Another World during Halloween.****Morricone's score for this film was nominated for a Razzie, while his score for The Hateful Eight - which has some unused music from this film in it - won him his only Best Original Score Oscar.",True
3,8,Who Goes There?...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,"You're stationed at an isolated outpost in Antarctica when a helicopter arrives intent on shooting a dog it had been pursuing across the tundra. Things get out of hand and the occupants of the chopper have their ability to pursue curtailed, more permanently than they'd like. Not too long after this carnage it becomes apparent that the pursuing shooters had a pretty good reason for wanting to remove the dog from the land of the living as the dog turns out to have the same aspirations as its pursuers, albeit in various guises, transformations, metamorphoses and reconfigurations.While this was made in 1981 it remains to this day one of the greatest and most engaging pieces of horror movie making that has ever been created.",False
4,n/a,The Thing holds up better and better every year,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,The Thing does a great job at holding my attention throughout. It has just enough to gross me out while making me wonder if the person next to me is an alien.The idea that this movie was made in the early 80s and it took years to be reevaluated before being well received just tells you how ahead of his time Carpenter is. Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors from the pre2000s and this is a good example of why.It's one of those special movies I can't get enough of. Every viewing feels like the first. I can't be the only one who feels the same amount of dread and uncertainty every time I watch it.,False
5,10,One of the Most Re-Watchable Movies Ever Made,fullbug,n/a,15/08/2025,"Classic and timeless that is now almost 40 years old. Great cast and character interaction, and covers the whole gambit of genre's (sci-fi, action, horror, thriller, mystery). There are even a few comedy moments, and with it taking place in Antarctica, it could even be classified as an adventure. It is one of the most re-watchable movies ever made.",False
6,10,"""The Thing"" is John Carpenter's masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!",ivo-cobra8,n/a,15/08/2025,"A classic film. John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?Seriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design.In my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I'll put any of ""The Thing's"" old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven't seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see ""The Thing"" again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who's your friend? Who's the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you've never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?""Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.""John Carpenter's The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.The basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.It is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80's ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! 'The Thing' is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell's characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt's best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",False
7,10,A classic that still holds up to this very day,MovieAddict2016,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler""I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you'd just attack me right now, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation. It'll fight if it has to, but it's vulnerable out in the open. If it takes us over, then it has no more enemies, nobody left to kill it. And then it's won.""John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made  fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. This is how all movies of the genre should be made.Taking place in the Antarctic in 1982, the movie focuses specifically on a group of American scientists. We are given no introduction to their mission, but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy Norwegians appears at their base camp, chasing an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, which is when things really start to get crazy.It is soon made quite clear that the ""dog"" is actually a shape-shifting alien organism, which manifests itself upon the physical form of its victims  in other words, it begins to eat the Americans, and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot discern the difference between their friends and enemiesThe pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begin to fight for their own survival, using wits instead of brawn. If the Thing is indeed amongst them, then how are they to go about revealing it? How many Things are there? How can the Thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed at all?)The creature's origins in the film are explained easily: Thirty thousand years ago a spacecraft plummeted to Earth, and was frozen in the Antarctic ice. The Thing tried to escape, and was discovered in the ice by the Norwegians, who unknowingly released it from its natural prison.""The Thing,"" the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic ""Alien"" (1979). Many comparisons have been made  the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area, stalked by a seldom seen foe that manages to kill them off one-by-one. However, ""The Thing""  for all practical purposes  came first.Based on the famous short story ""Who Goes There?"" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (writing under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was ""The Thing From Another World,"" an unarguable classic. But to be fair, it bore little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake does it more justice.The idea of the Thing being able to adapt the physicality of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great, and is the most vital link to the short story. In 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought many advances in SFX.Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore-fest into a startlingly frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The Thing, although never actually taking one specific form, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply superb. They still pack a punch twenty-two years later.Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie Award at the time) is a bit too electronic and tinny, but nevertheless haunting when used correctly.From the fact that its cast consists entirely of males, to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time, ""The Thing""  by any standards  is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, ""The Thing"" performed poorly in theaters, and ""E.T.""  released the same year and featuring a much kinder alien  became the higher-grossing picture of the two (by far).In the long run, however, ""The Thing"" is superior in almost every conceivable way. Spielberg's tale is outdated and flopped during its 20th Anniversary Re-Release. ""The Thing,"" on the other hand, has gradually climbed a ladder of cult classics  it is one of the most famous non-famous movies ever made.Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career  from his amazing ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (1976) to the magnificent ""Halloween"" (1978) to the disappointing and silly ""Escape from L.A."" (1996), ""The Thing"" remains his very best motion picture. Although its reputation over the years has never been honorary enough to land it a spot on most ""great movies"" lists, ""The Thing"" is still one of my favorite horror films, and  upon close inspection  masterfully crafted. It is a daring and ingenious thrill-ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling  a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is genuinely unpredictable.",True
8,10,Finally getting recognition.,mcseph,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am ashamed to say it, but I have to admit, the first time I saw this film was only about a year ago.  After seeing it, I immediately rushed out and bought the DVD collectors' edition and have watched it many times since.The film is terrific on many levels.  It works as your straight monster or action type film, as a horror/sci-fi and also as a very intriguing look into the human psyche.  The incredible sense of paranoia, mistrust and fear, lent not only by Carpenter's direction (which is stunning) but also by the incredible acting of the cast in general.  Kurt Russell (obviously) is spectacularly understated in the lead role of MacReady, and, as a direct result he ""feels"" like a real person, rather than a hollywood ""all american hero"".  The other cast members all carry off their roles with style, and the net result is an intensely believable atmosphere, and a truly fantastic film.",False
9,7,Good Movie,jmorrison-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very good thriller; gory but effective. The atmosphere of creepy revulsion and panic is conveyed very well.To me, the best line in the movie is delivered by Donald Moffat (as Garry), at the conclusion of the ""blood test"": ""I know you gentlemen have been through a lot, but when you find the time, I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F***ING COUCH"" A line delivered beautifully by the beleaguered and terrified character.Kurt Russell is good, however the ""rebel without a clue"" bit may be a little overdone (ditch the yosemite sam hat already...) Well-acted and terrifying, an effective movie.",False
10,10,Intelligent Splatter,Gafke,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV, scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession. This is a GREAT movie, and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGI.Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened.

Who is the Thing?The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic. I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel, but that's just the animal lover in me being picky: kill all the humans you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as, one by one, the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I liked the original version, I prefer this one; the real threat lies within, and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When it is forced out of hiding, it's wrath is huge and the results are horrific.This is one of Carpenters best films, right up there with The Fog and Halloween. All of the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character. This film has something for any lover of the horror genre. Don't miss it.",False
11,6,"Some things work, some things don't",hall895,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Thing is a monster movie with a twist. The monster could be the guy standing next to you. Or maybe the monster could even be you. The story unfolds at an American research outpost in Antarctica. Some crazy Norwegians show up, shooting at a dog. Before the Americans can ascertain what is going on the Norwegians are dead. Soon everyone will realize this dog is no dog at all. It's, for lack of a better term, a thing. This thing can take the appearance of other creatures it absorbs. It can become a perfect imitation of any living creature. So now how much do you trust that guy standing next to you? Paranoia overwhelms the group very quickly. This thing is, quite literally it appears, eating the group alive.Kurt Russell plays MacReady, the helicopter pilot who becomes the leader of the group as they try to stop the thing before it destroys them all. If they don't stop this thing in its tracks and it manages to make its way to civilized areas it will be the end of humankind. So some pressure on our little group then. MacReady is a take-charge kind of guy. But who's to say he's not a thing now? Certainly other members of the group have their doubts. Trust is a commodity in very short supply. Where the film fails a bit is in failing to really establish any characters beyond MacReady. A couple of them stand out because they're portrayed by actors we recognize, Wilford Brimley for example. But it's a largely faceless bunch, not a whole lot of personality in the group. And for a bunch of supposed scientists they're not the smartest group either.The movie has some decent twists and turns, leaving you guessing along with the characters as they try to determine who's still human. It's an intriguing story but it certainly would have grabbed you more if you really identified with all of the characters. As it is there are too many guys whom you really wouldn't care about should the thing make a meal of them. Characters, and the story as a whole really, too often take a backseat to the gore which director John Carpenter piles on liberally. If you're looking for a gross-out movie you'll find few better. The creature effects are very well done but maybe a little too repulsive for some people's tastes. A little more story, a little less blood and guts, probably would have served the film well. It is a very compelling story. You just wish the filmmakers trusted that story enough to allow it to carry the film. The paranoia, the mistrust, there's so much great tension there potentially. But tension loses out in the quest for gory, scary moments. In a movie such as this you want to have some good frights. But you want the scares to enhance the story, not overwhelm it. The balance in this movie is just a little bit off. It's an interesting movie but there is definitely the sense more could have been done with such a fascinating concept.",False
12,10,Flips the scenario round from the original to great effect.,hitchcockthelegend,n/a,15/08/2025,"John Carpenter shows how much he loves the 1951 original by giving it the utmost respect that he possibly could, the only difference here is that Carpenter chooses to stick to the paranoiac core of John W Campbell Jr's short story.The secret to this version's success is the unbearable tension that builds up as the group of men become suspicious of each other, the strain of literally waiting to be taken over takes a fearful hold. Carpenter then manages to deliver the shocks as well as the mystery that's needed to keep the film heading in the right direction.Be it an horrific scene or a ""what is in the shadow"" sequence, the film is the perfect fusion of horror and sci-fi. The dialogue is laced with potency and viability for a group of men trying to keep it together under such duress, while Ennio Morricone's score is a wonderful eerie pulse beat that further racks up the sense of doom and paranoia seaming throughout the film.The cast are superb, a solid assembly line of actors led by Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell, whilst the effects used around the characters get the right amount of impact needed. But most of all it's the ending that is the crowning glory, an ending that doesn't pander to the norm and is incredibly fitting for what has gone on before it. Lets wait and see what happens indeed. 10/10",False
13,6,Why do modern audiences so badly overrate this film?,ugothereur-548-496417,n/a,15/08/2025,"Maybe they're sick of CGI and fine the film's first rate practical effects refreshing? Could be, but the truth is all the criticism The Thing received in1982 is still valid. Messy, muddled scripting. Unfocused direction, lethargic editing and scoring, and unsympathetic characters make it impossible to create any real suspense. The effects are the star, and that never nade a Transformers movie worth watching. The best scene in The thing is the blood test sequence, and that's because the cutting of the fingers was simple and identifiable. It was human unlike the characters and certainly unlike the film.Dean Cundey's photography and Rob Bottins practical effects are brilliant, to bad they were surrounded by mediocrity in the other departments.Stick with the 1951 original. It's superior film. One in which you'll care about the characters and real suspense ( not repulsion) is on display.",False
14,5,Barf-bag splatter flick: Cult film but no classic.,Degree7,n/a,15/08/2025,"John Carpenter's update of 'Who Goes There' and 'The Thing From Another World' came out 31 years ago to seemingly little fan-fare and even less critical reception. Steven Spielberg's 'E.T.' released the same year was a more popular take on the alien invasion story. Apparently people weren't too keen on seeing hideous creatures from outer space wreaking havoc in the same way.Which is a shame, because 'The Thing' has a lot going for it. The opening sequence with a pair of Norwegians in a helicopter chasing down a sled dog, with the steady synthesized beat of the soundtrack, proves something eerie, and leads into a brilliant set up.Unfortunately, once things go wrong and sh*t hits the fan, the paper thin characterizations of the cast come to the forefront. All of these 'scientists' and researchers on this base are rather bland, and the viewer never gets a sense of having known these guys. For example, in 'Alien', you feel like there is real camaraderie among the crew of the Nostromo, with subtle rivalries and edgy small talk providing so much detail and backstory to their characters (much of it ad libbed). But in 'The Thing', you never get a chance to hear these guys talk, or develop as interesting human beings at all. The most you see is them playing ping pong or getting high. The only insightful one is Kurt Russell's ""Macready"". Everyone else is simply fodder for the alien.Carpenter seems to rely on mantaining the viewer's interest with the next highly inventive, but over the top special effects gore scene. Some say that ""the less you see, the more frightening it is"". Well someone forgot to tell Carpenter this on set, because each creature appearance is gooier and more in-your-face than the last. Even worse is the concept of the shape-shifting alien itself. It seemingly has the ability to transform into whatever shape with whatever powers it wants. A lot of it seems to depend on the amount of material (people) it absorbs, but in some cases the survival of the characters seems entirely arbitrary and not down to the rules that should have been established in the beginning. The main concept is that each piece of the alien is a living whole. But the film doesn't account for the idea that even the tiniest, invisible molecules that float through the air are part alien. And if the alien transmits itself through bodily fluids, why can't it just breathe onto someone and absorb them that way.Because of this and the weakly written roles, the atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia that should be developing is instead undercooked, and leads to many of the characters going crazy and acting unrealistically way too soon.It's literally only 10 minutes into the assimilation process, when one key scientist character realizes that mankind would be doomed within a year of the alien reaching the mainland. So what does he do? Round everyone up like a sensible person and try to weed out the alien? No, he suddenly destroys the radio and the helicopter, therefore dooming his companions to be trapped on a remote base with an enemy they can't see. Oh, and he tries to kill them all.Of course, the alien isn't too smart either. Rather than laying low and maintaining its disguise, it would rather transform at the most inopportune moments to get itself destroyed.Honestly, the film has little depth to its story or plot, and is really just a B-grade slasher flick, like Carpenter's last film 'Halloween'. With characters that seemingly want to die, how else could you describe it?",False
15,n/a,Good things come to those who wait,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"* * * * ½ (4½ out of 5)The ThingDirected by: John Carpenter, 1982Looking back on John Carpenter's The Thing  today a highly treasured cult favourite  one has to wonder why it was dismissed by both the audience and critics when it first came out in 1982.Steven Spielberg's extra terrestrial adventure about a sweet alien that phoned home (that stole the hearts of both children and adults world wide) had opened just two weeks before and was on its historic box office rampage. Bad scheduling may have had a greater impact than anything else on the fate of Carpenter's first big studio effort for Universal Pictures. Nobody was prepared  moreover wanted anything so dark, gory and scary as this genuine remake of the famous 1951 original. This was the time of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.It then makes for great movie history trivia, that The Thing has gained such a remarkable afterlife on video, DVD and television. Both financially and critically. Carpenter's version is less a remake of the Howard Hawks' version than a more faithful adaptation of John W. Campbell's short story ""Who Goes There?' (on which both were based), and critics today point out how well Carpenter plays his characters against each other. Kurt Russell will never top this one, and he gets a brilliant sparring from the entire cast.It opens in Antarctica with a sled husky running from a pair of crazed and armed Norwegian men in a helicopter. The scene is long, slow and uneasy. It feels like the Apocalypse. It oozes doomsday.This scene comprises one of the greatest opening sequences in film history.Ennio Morricone's moody synth score (heavy on naked thumping bass lines in classic Carpenter style), the windswept massive white of the desolate polar ice and the majestic husky running across the tundra chased by the chopper, compromises a completely mesmerizing piece of scenery.A satisfying example of a movie that today  18 years after  looks downright muscular in its simplicity.The budget was big ($14 mill), yet it allowed Carpenter to visualize his ideas better than ever before. There's a brooding darkness to this film, making the whites and blues of the icy Antarctic claustrophobia seem poetic and almost angelic. Dean Cundey's extraordinary photography created a palpable chill to every shot. The careful preparation (the crew went into a record 11-month pre-production) paid off immensely.Horror specialist Rob Bottin was handpicked for the many gory and grotesque special effects. Be warned  there's a lot of splatter and gore here. The Thing is actually notorious for its creature morphing scenes. Some find them disgusting, some mere cult.An argument could be made against The Thing being an Alien rip-off; it has its origins in an old sci-fi story and it creates tension by popping a crowd of people (note: all-male) on an isolated outpost (an Antarctic research facility) terrorized by an alien life form.Where Carpenter was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece, his own alien movie is original and intriguing in its own right. There's a rhythm and an environment that equals Scott's in every way.The husky was in fact half-wolf and half-dog, and it was noted that it never barked or growled on or off the set (Horror Takes Shape, the making of - DVD version).Watch in awe at the scene where it walks through the hallway and stares at a human shadow, slightly tilting its head forward in stalking position like a wild wolf. This is a fine piece of animal training, sure, but that's not the point. This is as spooky as anything ever made in a horror movie.Carpenter had all the right tools here, and he utilized them to perfection, making The Thing his best movie alongside Halloween.",False
16,10,Still my all time favorite sci-fi/horror!!!,PeachHamBeach,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe silly saying, ""You can't touch this"" surely applies here. With all the clone horror and sci-fi films coming out, along with all the inferior remakes, it's hard to find anything worthy of 2 hours of your time. That's why I always rely on the classics that scared the weewee out of me when I was a pre-teen.THE THING is, without an ounce of doubt in my mind, the goriest, ickiest, screechiest sci-fi horror classic that John Carpenter, or any other director (sorry, even you Mr. Spielberg) ever made. What really gives it power, though, is not the gore (it OOOOOZES of slime and blood and God knows what other fluids), but rather the sense of dread, isolation, and distrust it fosters in the characters and the viewer.You can't get more remote than Antarctica, and in this howling, freezing white setting is where the story takes place. Several Americans, researchers and military men, are stationed there. One day, they witness a Siberian Husky dog running for dear life from gun-wielding Norwegians. Before they know it, the American outpost is battling a mysterious creature that can imitate any creature it wants. It may morph into disgusting slimy bloody shapes before it's finished, but once it's finished, if you didn't see it in progress, you can't tell it among humans or other normal Earth animals.Kurt Russell, Keith David, Wilford Brimley, Richard Masur, Donald Moffatt, TK Carter, Thomas Waites and Charles Hallahan are just a few of the fine cast. This film is the reason why horror CAN be a great genre. It actually STILL scares me. The alien blood ""jumping"" out of the petri dish when the hot wire touches it still makes ME jump!!!Still the scariest of them all.",True
17,10,I worship this film. 10/10,The_Wood,n/a,15/08/2025,"John Carpenter's The Thing is hands down the best horror film ever made. Not only that, but it is also on of my personal favorite films of all time. What makes the movie so great?  It's hard to put my finger on it. Everything just seems to work in The Thing, it's one of the rare occasions where everything just seems to fall in place.  The film is even superior to Alien in creating a type of moody atmospheric hell.  The fact that it's not only about the gore (which is wonderful btw), but it is able to create a paranoia that is unmatched in films.  A truly wonderful film that is worshiped by all horror buffs, and anyone who has good taste in films.",False
18,10,"Right up there with ""Halloween""--one of Carpenter's best!",preppy-3,n/a,15/08/2025,"Remake of the classic 1951 ""The Thing From Another World"". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by a thing from outer space--it devours and completely duplicates anything it chooses to. It starts off as a dog but gets loose--and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon, nobody trusts anyone else--they're isolated--the radio is destroyed--their helicopter likewise. What are they going to do?The 1951 film had the thing just be a big, super human monster. That movie was scary. This one is too--but the story is different (and based more closely on the source material--the novelette ""Who Goes There?"") and it's scary in a different way. The movie starts right off with Ennio Morricone's extremely eerie score setting just the right tone and--when the Thing gets attacked--the amount of gore is astounding. There's blood and body parts flying all over--arms are bitten off, heads detach and--in the strongest one--one man is devoured face first by the Thing. The gore effects are STRONG and real nightmare material. I don't scare easy but I had to sleep with the lights on when I saw this originally back in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible--how this picture got by with an R rating is beyond me!It also has a very creepy feel--gore aside, it is very suspenseful. You're not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and the score really build up the tension. One complaint--no one is given any distinctive personality traits. They actors just remain straight-faced and say their lines. That's annoying...but the movie still works.This was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982--it competed with ""E.T."" and MANY critics complained about the amount of gore and there being no female characters in the movie. It's now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see...for strong stomaches. NOT a date film!An amusing note: When this was released Universal sent a note along with all prints of the film. They suggested to theatre owners that they play the film in an auditorium near the rest rooms. They were afraid that people would be so sickened by the violence that they'd have to be close to a facility to throw up!",False
19,10,A creepy gem of imaginative sci-fi horror,Leofwine_draca,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough this film clearly got made due to the success of ALIEN, I actually find it the better of the two. I certainly consider it Carpenter's joint best, along with that one with the Michael Myers guy. This is a film based on John W. Campbell's story ""Who Goes There?"", which also inspired the 1951 flick THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD which saw James Arness as a killer carrot-man in the same setting. Carpenter is closer to the original story, as his menace is a gory shape shifting alien which consumes and imitates its prey – forget the T1000, he has nothing on this thing. The look of the creature is extremely disgusting and disturbing and hard to forget – imagine some Lovecraftian terror in the flesh, covered in blood and tentacles and other less describable body parts, and you're halfway there.The rest of the special effects are incredible; witness heads slide off bodies and turn into spiders, and the infamous and gut-wrenching kennel transformation which I had the misfortune to watch when I was but a boy. You can bet I had plenty of sleepless nights after watching that one. Plenty of blood, gore, and violence throughout make this one of the hardest of horrors. Yet despite all the effects, this is still a plot-driven movie with absolutely loads of suspense and tension – not to mention a near overwhelming paranoia throughout.There are many imaginative moments – the opening sequence, in which Norbert Weisser tries to kill a poor little doggie – to the excellent blood test scene, in which the guys are tied down whilst Russell tests their blood samples for the alien virus. Russell is subdued but great and as an ensemble, the rest of the guys are true to life and so believable, which makes it all the more horrific. Every outburst, crack-up or breakdown seems to be happening for real and we do learn to care about these very natural researchers trapped in the worst scenario imaginable. Add to this a spooky Morricone score and you have a super movie about which I can say no more – except that you watch it for yourself.",True
20,7,"If You Liked 'Alien,' You'll Like This",ccthemovieman-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This intense sci-fi film is almost horror in nature, a la ""Alien"" as it features a tremendous amount of suspense. If you liked ""Alien,"" you'll like this, the main difference of the two films being the different setting and a different cast.The cast may be different but the characters are the same: scientists-heroes who are all profane low-life-types who you would never see in professions and positions like this. Only in the world of film do you see sleazy people like this in high-tech intelligent positions such as astronauts or scientists. Who better to exemplify this in the 1980s than self-proclaimed macho man Kurt Russell?Back to the positives: besides the great suspense, the story is an involving one that hooks you in fairly early and never lets go. I have a widescreen VHS copy which looks nice, too, since the visuals definitely warranted a widescreen viewing experience.",False
21,10,The tagline is no mere jest,I_Ailurophile,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The ultimate in alien terror,"" it says. It's not wrong. This is it. This is the greatest horror film ever made. John Carpenter's A-#1.Cinema is full of great creature designs, yet The Thing bests them all. Every incarnation we see of the creature, and all the practical effects and set pieces that bring it to life, are the best that the industry has to offer. The most realistic CGI will never compete.The paranoia and distrust in the outpost is palpable. Carpenter crafts a tangible atmosphere of desperation and suspicion, from the unassuming beginning to the classic, ambiguous end--one of my very favorite endings from any movie, ever.Composer extraordinaire Ennio Morricone lends his great skills with a minimalist, synth-driven score that adds immensely to the building unease. It very well complements the performances of the excellent ensemble cast that bring every feeling of terror and wariness to life. Kurt Russell once again shines as Carpenter's lead, MacReady, and Keith David is superb as the antagonistic Childs. It's easy to overlook other cast members with smaller roles and less time on screen--even the unmistakable Wilford Brimley--but have no doubt, they're all just as good, just as essential to the picture.Once again: not only is John Carpenter a master storyteller, a fantastic director generally, but his greatest skill is in slowly building the tension and suspense in his pictures until the explosive finale. He does it so well that it's impossible for the viewer not to experience the same misgivings, the same sense of horror, as the characters on-screen--not because you're watching it, but because you FEEL it just as deeply.It's violent, it's gory, and broadly it may not be for everyone. But this needs to be seen by anyone with the slightest interest in horror, or creature features, or with a keen interest in cinema history as a whole. Similar stories may be told, but there are no and will never be any imitators.",False
22,7,classic,markusanti,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie is an update of the classic 'The Thing From Outer Space', but only like it's predecessor, this film is in full color, and the characters of this film have much more to worry about than an alien veggieThe film centers around a group of Arctic Researchers you encounter an alien lifeform capable of taking the form of anything it comes into contact with, and out of for that matter. Kurt Russell stars as R.J. MacReady, an alcoholic Vietnam Vet, thrust into the role of leader of a group of relatively cold and callous men all of whom are readily plunging into manic paranoia and somewhat madness once they realize that they are up against a creature that can take any form, be any one of them.John Carpenter, more than in any other of his films, manages to create a truly believable and incredible atmosphere. When watching this film you truly get the sense of the dark,sinister, desolate surroundings, you feel and realize that these characters have no where to go...never for one second do you not believe they are stuck on a polar ice cap. Also, this film has perhaps one of the greatest endings to any film of it's genre, or any genre for that matter. I'm not going to give it away here, but to say that it will leave you wondering would be an understatement.Kurt Russell is superb as MacReady....truly conveying the emotions of a man thrust into a situation of unimaginable horror, forced to lead a group of men who cannot trust that the man next to them is not the creature that has driven them to the brink of paranoia and emotional meltdown.I don't care if this movie is 20 years old by now, the special effects in this movie are gut wrenching, mind blowing, and absolutely awesome. They blow away any CGI pixel based crap out there today. The 'Thing' itself is a truly horrifying and disturbing creation...unlike any alien you have ever seen in a movie before. Those who have a low tolerance for gore and blood had best prepare themselves for watching this movie.This movie does what any good horror/sci fi movie should do, it really thrusts you into it's character's world. It leaves you wondering, what would you do, who could you trust if anyone you knew could be the creature waiting to feed on you, and take you over as well. The images, and ideals of this movie stayed with me long after i first saw it, and today as i write this review send a chill up my spine.It is a true shame this movie is only now getting the proper recognition it deserves. A box office flop when released, now more then ever when movies are paper thin with plot, and one dimensional in effects, this film can be appreciated as a true masterpiece of sci/fi and horror.If possible, get the Collector's Edition DVD, and enjoy it in anamorphic widescreen..the way it is truly meant to be seen. Marvel at the incredible scenery, the taught direction, the excellent atmosphere, the sweat inducing, gag reflex activating, and everything else that makes this movie great.",False
23,10,Why The Thing?,allst,n/a,15/08/2025,"Many people has got a film they think of as their favourite movie. My movie will always be John Carpenter's The Thing! The main reason why this movie is a cult-film is perhaps the splatter-effects created mainly by genius Rob Bottin and that this is the movie that made Kurt Russell what he is today (along with Escape from N.Y.) In my opinion, this is not a great film because of the effects, it has to do with the story, the atmosphere, and of course, the acting. I have watched thousands and thousands of movies (3-6 every day the last 10 years), but none has had the impact on me as this one, not even the great ""Das Boot"".Here's my suggestion to you who likes sci-fi and horror movies: Place yourself in the good chair of your home. Be sure you're not interupted by anyone. If you aint got a projector, sit close to your TV and watch this miracle of a film. Let it absorbe you, and you'll see it my way!Best View Time: Late February between 5 and 9 in the evening.",False
24,6,More of a gross out film than a well-crafted horror.,bscrivener-50810,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Thing is a 1982 sci-fi horror film directed by John Carpenter and stars Kurt Russell as Mack MacReady, a researcher based in Antarctica and our protagonist in the film. Upon its release, The Thing was met with a lot of mixed reviews and overall a negative reception, however over the years has gone on to gain a cult following and a legendary status in the history of sci-fi, horror and cinema as a whole. While The Thing does have its moments, as in the grand special effects of the horrific, repulsive monster itself which still don't look particularly dated by todays standards and the great sense of vulnerability in our characters. It is in these characters that lies the problem. Not one of them is particularly likable or relatable, even Kurt Russell himself. You never get a great sense of caring or hoping for a certain character to make it out alive, rooting for a character just doesn't happen in The Thing. We are also left hanging in the balance by the end of the film with no real climactic epic fight or showdown. The Thing can be tense and generally scary at times, but in reality is a pure gross-out film rather than a well crafted horror. The music however is another strong point which does add to the suspense and the very clever idea of blood samples in the latter part of the film really has us guessing and wondering who is human and who is the monster. While I don't agree the statement that The Thing is one of the greatest horror movies of all time, it does have its tense, pseudo horror moments and shrieking horror soundtrack to build on this. Overall it does feel more of a gross-out, gore-fest with unfortunately unlikeable characters, some rushed scenes and disappointing third act which leaves it feeling incomplete, but with brilliant special effects. 6/10",False

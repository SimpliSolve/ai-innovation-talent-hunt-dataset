1,8,Hope Against All Hope,Kannonfodder,n/a,16/08/2025,"A few short 10 to 15 min segments by Vice have shown us what internet networked demonstrations look like over the past decade. Whether in Egypt, Ukraine, Venezuela, Ferguson (US) or elsewhere there is a paradoxical self-assured hopelessness against far greater forces, almost certain to win any conflict of arms. Ai expands on the theme with a 93 minute film that takes us through several stages of the protests, from peaceful beginnings to what seems like almost urban warfare versus a far stronger, and by then, meaner force of state security.Like Vice background exposition and use of talking heads is minimized. Ai focuses on images and sound, introducing words mostly of protesters, to take us inside their thoughts and give context to what we see. As a viewer I felt the intensity of the protests, as well being witness to the minutiae of the many small in between moments that make up history. What I felt lacking was a deeper understanding of the costs incurred by the participants. What has happened to their family relationships? Their life prospects? Why did this strong urge to protest happen in this generation, and despite the hopeless situation? We see the rage, we know the freedom they want, but I as a viewer cannot escape the merciless logic of power forced onto the citizens of Hong Kong by the Chinese Communist Party. Perhaps this hope against all hope is the point.Despite these misgivings this is a remarkable documentary on a historical event utterly surprising and predictable all at once.",False

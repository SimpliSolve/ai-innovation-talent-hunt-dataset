1,10,EXCELLENT PIECE OF WORK!,pahalp,n/a,16/08/2025,I'm surprised why this film was not sent to Oscar? This is a really a great documentary. All technical aspects for a great documentary are present and it's actually the food for brain to the intellectually hungry people. Watch it folks.My friend sent a clip from the film to me and I was instantly in search of the full movie. Impressive! Usually I don't find good documentaries especially from Indian makers but this impressed me. I'm sure the director has a unique vision to see a subject like this in this depth.Kudos to director for his courage to explore such a sensitive topic that skill fully üëçüëçüëç,False

4,10,Very Nice Eye Opening Concept for Society,rkashyap099,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYour movie is really good. It takes a huge heart to make this film in India. The work you have done with so much courage, no matter how much it is praised, it is very less. The generations to come will always be grateful to you. If he learns from your film, you have put a very cruel image in front of the society in a beautiful way. Hindu who has become completely indifferent towards religion, who has nothing left to do with his saints and his culture. Makes fun of his religion everywhere and sees it being done. Then when he is retaliated by those of other religions, then he remembers his religion. There is a tight slap on the face of such Hindus which has been kept by your film. I pray to God to give Hindus good sense and make them aware of their religion. Seeing such films awakened goodwill towards religion. Many anti-religious activities are going on in the country, which people are ignoring even after seeing and those who are doing these wrong acts, Hindus silently support their actions, which is a matter of great concern. Every time I have seen this film of yours, my heart has thanked me so many times. I am very thankful to your whole team. Hindus should become aware of their religion and religious teachers. This is the prayer to God. One more request to you that like you made this film with so much courage, make more such films, so that people get goodwill towards religion and come forward in performing their duties.",True
5,10,Gripping. Insightful. Top notch.,singhshipra-87764,n/a,16/08/2025,"An hour well spent. A must watch.You must watch this feature if,Like me, you too thought 'What is there to talk about for the 14th of FebruaryYou were once a teenagerYou were or are in the category who is still looking for a partner-You have a child or know someone who has one.
because, it opens your eyes to an all new perspective.If one were very frugal in one's appreciation, one must laud the makers for picking up this brave subject and creating such an excellent piece of work.The film is created at par with how one would expect a world class documentaries to be. The narration is gripping and flows through very well. Each statement is referenced and well corroborated. The tone never gets preachy, rest the audieces can discern. I never knew love can be classified based on the interests between the two parties :) . Oh, and the background music complements the documentary throughout.I am recommending to my F&F.",False
6,9,Have not seen such level of documentary in Indian Cinema,aaravmehta-63730,n/a,16/08/2025,"The way this film postmortems Valentine's Day, stitches the facts together and stay true to the core truth is something only a cathartically clear-eyed work of documentary art can do. And crisp edit and majestic music.. Take a bow guys.. I won't reveal much about film here but trust me this film deserves a sincere viewing, there's a lot in it that needs to be processed. Love, perceived to be a repository of genuineness, is an intimate component of Human Being but now it has become inextricably linked to the mass market and adopted the economic mechanism of Western society.",False

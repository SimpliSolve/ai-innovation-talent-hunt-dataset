1,8,Solid Overview of this Master of Horror,Reviews_of_the_Dead,n/a,17/08/2025,"This was a documentary that I saw hit Shudder earlier this year. I'm a huge Dario Argento fan so getting a documentary about his personal life as well as his career was something I knew I'd watch. I started this one at work when my day was slow and then finished at home. This moves fast, gives his personal life before becoming a filmmaker and then goes through personal things as each of his movies came out.Now I knew parts of Argento's personal life. I tend to do research on people and things that I'm a fan of. I didn't know that he was married to Marisa Casale earlier in life. They divorced as he became more popular to the point where elements of Four Flies on Grey Velvet might be mirroring things there. I knew that he had two daughters that were actors, Asia Argento and Fiore Argento. I didn't realize there was a third. This factors into things that made Trauma odd for him and Asia.It was also interesting to hear from Asia about what happened between the love of his life and her mother, Daria Nicolodi. It is a shame that she passed away before this was made as I would have loved to hear from her. Suspiria and Inferno stem from stories that Daria's mother told her. Dario wasn't big on giving her more credit for some reason and it strained their relationship. These are things fans of this horror maestro already knew, but we get a different perspective here.Something that I like as well is that we see Dario getting interviewed. These were done for this documentary as he is older now. We also get interviews from his sister, Floriana, his ex-wife and fellow filmmakers he's worked with like Michele Soavi, Lamberto Bava, Franco Ferrini, Luigi Cozzi, Claudio Simonetti and Vittorio Cecchi Gori. There are also great filmmakers who he directly influenced like Guillermo del Toro, Gaspar Noé and Nicolas Winding Refn. I also didn't want to leave out that they talked to Cristina Marsillach who is the star of Opera.I'd say that this is a well-made documentary. There is a great editing early where Dario is being driven to a remote hotel and they put in scenes from Deep Red and Suspiria. That made me smile. The only thing that I didn't necessarily like is that this has felt at different times like they're making a movie and not a documentary. This doesn't ruin it by any stretch. Asking Dario and all these people different things as well as framing what was going on in his life while making these movies was an interesting watch for any fans of this filmmaker. I'd recommend this for sure.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",False
2,8,Well made!,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIn this film, Dario Argento explains the difference between fear and panic (the panico that gives this its title). He claims that fear is like a fever of 100.5 F, one that has you terrified. Panic is just a degree higher, something that takes you beyond to a place that you can't control.If you've read Argento's book Fear, he often speaks of writing his scripts isolated in a hotel room. In this documentary, the director finds himself returns to the place where he completed his latest script and speaks as part of an intimate interview, all while being followed by a film crew documenting his life for a movie about his illustrious career.He's joined by friends, collaborators and fans -- many of whom are today's most important filmmakers -- to discuss the story of his life and films.Director Simone Scafidi made Fulci For Fake in 2019, a film that attempted to explain the movies of Lucio Fulci. In that effort, he didn't have true access to Fulci. Here, he has Argento speaking to his greatest successes and why he makes movies, as well as some of the most essential people in his life, including his daughters Fiore and Asia, his first wife Marisa Casale, Claudio Simonetti of Goblin, Lamberto Bava, Michele Soavi, Luigi Cozzi and current directors Nicolas Winding Refn, Guillermo del Toro and Gaspar Noé.Del Toro speaks most effectively on the power of what Argento can do and how he's ""getting high off his own supply."" He makes a case that Deep Red presents a world where anything at any time can happen and that you must accept that -- ""here's is a killer doll, alright"" he laughs -- and that it's also full of ancient evil waiting on the outside of the frame, a film where no one is safe.There's a lot more that I'd like to have heard about, such as the time in American making Dawn of the Dead and Inferno, as well as what inspired his later films. This skips quite a bit -- sorry fans of Dracula 3D and Mother of Tears -- but it's impossible to get a multiple decade career into a short running time. What does emerge is that even when people have had rough relationships with Dario -- such as actress Cristina Marsillach, the star of Opera -- they feel as if they have learned from the time they spent with him. It makes for an interesting companion to his aforementioned autobiography, as you only hear his side of the story, where Asia presents a more nuanced vision of him, including a surprising moment of tenderness and vulnerability.It's very hard for me to be objective on this film's subject, as his movies form the nucleus of so much of my love for cinema. I am pleased with the results, as it gives me as much as I need to know and I could honestly listen to Soavi, Bava and Cozzi speak for hours.As a film nerd, I am beyond happy that this mentioned The Card Player. As you may know, my parents' first date was to see The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and for years they used it as a barometer of films they hated. I think my gialli addiction started in those formative film discussions as a form of rebellion. Also: Yes, I did cry when they showed the Louma crane from Tenebrae.",True
3,7,"A Suitable, if general, Overview",joker-4,n/a,17/08/2025,"Known as the ""Master of Thrill"", Italian filmmaker Dario Argento boasts a long and complex career. The Shudder original Dario Argento: Panico documentary takes a look at highlights from Argento's filmography by interviewing the Master of Horror himself along with other talking head contemporaries. For those that might only be familiar with The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970) or Suspiria (1977), Panico is a suitable overview with Argento himself acting as a grandfatherly host. For true Argento fans, Panico has all the substance of a featurette buried on disc 2 of the Opera collector's edition Blu-Ray.Dario Argento: Panico provides a totally-fine overview of the auteur's work that pairs nicely with salt-cured prosciutto and a glass of Sangiovese chianti. But what would have worked spectacularly would have been if that Italian hotel was haunted... instead of Argento's tired eyes.",False
4,7,No Panico ...,kosmasp,n/a,17/08/2025,"... in the discotheque ... or wherever else you want to take it. Just do not take your gloves off for this - so no pun intended. How are you feeling about Dario? You may be a fan of the first hour - you may still be a fan ... you may only like the early things he did ... I doubt there will be many who like his recent output ... which would beg the question: was he always ""bad"" or is he losing his touch? Something to ... well food for thought.Argento worked with a lot of people ... he worked for a lot of people ... so there is no shortage of people who want to talk about him and his work. As a friend said, this is a beginners guide ... it is more about Argento light ... but there are enough more documentaries that probably dig deeper ... we will know shortly how the other movies fair ... I will watch them and tell you about them.",False
5,6,A decent documentary.,Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,17/08/2025,"Dario Argento Panico is a documentary that has an initially interesting framing device that it doesn't do a ton with (the man himself working on his latest film in a hotel, with a film crew purportedly following him around). It intercuts these scenes with fairly standard documentary scenes that go through his directorial career chronologically.The only part that really felt inspired, beyond the first few scenes, was a time when what Argento was saying in the present day lined up very well with a TV interview he'd given in the 1970s or 1980s. The editing kept cutting back and forth, letting young and old Argento finish their sentences, and it was quite affecting.It's otherwise a decent documentary about an interesting filmmaker, but at a certain point, it feels like it's going through the motions a bit as a documentary about a filmmaker. Beyond a couple of parts that stood out, it's probably just for Argento fans only. I find Argento's films generally interesting, so I found this documentary mostly interesting.",False
6,8,A comprehensive and methodical review of the long filmography of the master of Italian horror.,ma-cortes,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary about the great master of European fantasy and horror cinema offers an immersive exploration of the life and work of the legendary director of ¨Suspiria¨, introducing us to the mind of the Italian genius, and offering us the testimonies of other filmmakers who love his work with key names in current cinema. Dario Argento wrote his most famous films inside hotels, completely isolating himself from external reality and immersing himself in his own nightmares. In the documentary Dario is working on his latest script in a hotel room, revisiting the isolation where he dreamed up his most iconic films, removed from distractions to explore his dark imagination. After many years, advised by his agent, he decides to go back to a hotel to finish his new screenplay and to be interviewed, filmed and followed by a crew that is shooting a film about him. Meanwhile, they are intertwined with opinions from notorious directors, screenwriters, producers, actors and family members, such as: Michele Soavi, Lamberto Bava, Franco Ferrini, Luigi Cozzi, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, Guillermo del Toro, Gaspar Noé, Nicolas Winding Refn, Cristina Marsillach, Asia Argento, Fiore Argento, Floriana Argento and musician Claudio Simonetti who was the main composer and member of the musical band Goblin . Within this structure, a wellness center very far from the distressing places that characterize the cinema of Argento does not feel at ease and has difficulty both in finding the peace necessary to finish the screenplay, and in confiding the his secrets to the crew who are interviewing him. But the demon of cinema, who has never abandoned him, will once again push him to give himself totally.In his beginnings Dario was a prestigious screenwriter in various genres as Spaghetti Western, wartime and thriller, such as: ¨One upon the time in the West¨, ¨Oggi a me... domani a te!¨, ¨Cemetery without crosses¨, ¨Battlee of Commandos¨, ¨Commando¨, ¨Every Man Is My Enemy¨. Dario then created the 'Animal Trilogy', whose film titles were influenced by a magician from Turin. His first important movie was ¨The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" that became an international hit, despite having continuous discussions with the main star, Tony Musante, who even claimed some authorship of the story. Argento followed up with two more thrillers, ¨The Cat o' Nine Tails¨ (1971), starring Karl Malden and James Franciscus, and ¨Four Flies on Grey Velvet¨(1971) starring Michael Brandon and Mimsy Farmer whose character and aspect bears remarkable resemblance to wife Nocolodi which made her quite angry. These films were backed by his father Salvatore Argento who was the major promoter and producer, who financed all his projects and sometimes limited the highly imaginative and expensive productions that came out of Dario's mind. He then went back to directing so-called ""giallo"" thrillers, starting with ¨Deep Red¨ (1975), a violent mystery-thriller starring David Hemmings that inspired a number of international directors in the thriller-horror genre. His next work was ¨Suspiria¨ (1977), his masterpiece, a surreal horror film about a witch's coven that was inspired by the Gothic fairy tales of the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson, which he also wrote in collaboration with his girlfriend, screenwriter/actress Daria Nicolodi, who acted in ""Profondo Rosso"" (""Deep Red"") and most of Argento's films from then to the late 1980s. However, due to some vicissitudes, discussions and the little recognition of Nicolodi's authorship, it gave rise to the sad marital separation between her and Dario, which caused him deep sorrow. Argento advanced the unfinished trilogy with ¨Inferno¨ (1980), before returning to the ""giallo"" genre with ¨Tenebrae¨(1982), a sort of gory whodunit, and then with the haunting ¨Phenomena¨ (1985) with a very young actress: Jennifer Connellly.Argento got a big hit in North America, as he temporarily settled in the US, where he collaborated with director George A. Romero on the two-part horror-thriller ¨Two Evil Eyes¨ (1990) (he had previously collaborated with Romero on the horror action thriller ¨Dawn of the Dead¨ (1978)). While still living in America, Argento appeared in small roles in several films and directed another violent mystery thriller, ¨Trauma¨ (1993), which starred his youngest daughter Asia Argento from his long-term relationship with Nicolodi. Argento returned to Italy in 1995, where he made a comeback in the horror genre with ¨The Stendhal Syndrome¨ (1996) and then with another version of ""Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera"",¨ The Phantom of the Opera¨ (1998), both of which starred Asia, in this last film she had her first on-screen love scene in front of her father, and where Asia said she lost her virginity. Most recently, Argento directed a number of ""giallo"" mystery thrillers such as: ¨Sleepless¨ (2001), ¨The Card Player¨ (2003) and ¨Do You Like Hitchcock?¨ (2005), as well as two gory, supernatural-themed episodes of the USA TV cable anthology series ¨Masters of Horror¨ (2005). Having always wanted to make a third chapter to his ""Three Mothers"" horror films, Argento finally completed the trilogy in 2007 with the release of ¨Mother of Tears¨ (2007), which starred Asia Argento as a young woman trying to identify and stop the last surviving evil witch from taking over the world. In addition to his Gothic and violent style of storytelling, ""La terza madre"" has many references to two of his previous films, ""Suspiria"" (1997) and ""Inferno"" (1980), which is a must for fans of the trilogy.The documentary titled¨ Dario Argento: Panico¨(2023) was well directed by Simone Scafidi who, together with his production team, documents his life, including formative interviews and illustrating us extensively about Dario's career. Simone is a director and screenwriter specialized in the world of documentary. Among his works are: ¨Zanetti story¨ (2015) and ¨Fulci for Fake¨ (2019).",False
7,8,For the true admirer...,indy-39,n/a,17/08/2025,"In my wildest dreams, I never hoped that anyone would ever do a Dario Argento doc that would seriously delve into what makes Argento one of my favorite filmmakers. Indeed, I often vacillate myself between seeing him as a guilty pleasure and a true visionary in the horror genre. Dario Argento: Panico lays out a sound case for placing him at the top of the pantheon of greats.I enjoyed the film with a rare relish and was very impressed that the exploration was not top heavy with Suspiria- but rather doled out equal time to so many other films. It made me want to go out and revisit some of the work I haven't seen in a while. (I'd just seen Inferno recently in the Blu Underground print and was blown away by the film for the first time- after three previous viewings. ) My high praise, however, comes with a warning- I think if you have limited exposure to all of his work you will be at a severe disadvantage here. This is a deep dive and the film doesn't take time to get you up to speed on the work- but that's how it should be when dealing with the ""Maestro"". (If Fellini called him that, how could I possibly disagree?)",False
8,5,Dario Argento Panico: Passable but glosses over some of the talking points,Platypuschow,n/a,17/08/2025,"PlotA film crew documents horror director Dario Argento as he works on his latest script in a hotel room, revisiting the isolation where he dreamed up his most iconic films, removed from distractions to explore his dark imagination.CastMade by Simone Scafidi who also did a comparable documentary about Fulci (Which I've yet to see) and featuring interviews with Dario, Asia, del Toro, Bava and Ferrini.VerdictArgento is a cinematic genius, this to me is not disputable. I've enjoyed a large percentage of his works and hold him in high regard within the industry.A documentary about him I saw great potential in, sadly the execution is very sterile. It's not exactly an expose or even a biopic, it's a very bland by the book look at his life and his works with contributions from his peers.This to me is a passable and eye opening watch for mega-fans, but for anyone else it's an unforgivable bore.RantsSomething has always bothered me about Argento, and that's his use of his daughter Asia. He cast her frequently through his works even from a young age, yet the consistency is nudity and sex involving her and that just never sat right with me and raised questions I'm entirely certain I don't want the answers to. To him it's likely harmless, to her it's likely harmless, to me it has made my skin crawl since the first time I saw it.BreakdownInformative

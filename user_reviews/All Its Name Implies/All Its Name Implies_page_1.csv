1,10,The importance of local story telling,whereamiatnow,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know how many documentaries there are on the Camp Fire. I do know a vast majority of them are made by production crews that first time in Paradise was just after the fire. It is important that we celebrate local storytellers. ""All Its Name Implies"" was made for and by Paradisians. This is not some commercial enterprise to gain accolade and personal profit, it is healing a community through art. For a community to heal and rebuild itself the process needs to be owned by the community. We see it at all levels, the outside expert coming in to implement their idea of what is right. What if those outside experts came in and asked, how can I help?When asked, ""How do you tell a good story?"" You first make sure it is your story to tell. This film is a good story.",False

6,10,"A Beautiful, touching tribute to Paradise.",peenkstarz,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was very beautifully done and was obviously made FOR the survivors of the Camp Fire. It was personal, emotional and beautifully executed. Clearly a lot of care went into this film. It showed different perspectives of the survivors, from those who lost their homes and the very few that did not. It was a beautiful tribute to the strength of a community and how quickly life can change forever.",False

8,10,Perfectly Paradise!,bug311,n/a,15/08/2025,"I could be biased because I'm a Camp Fire survivor, but this documentary is amazing. I've watched every other documentary and show that has come out since the fire in November 2018. They're good, but this one is the real deal. The filmmakers captured the true heart of Paradise.
The town of Paradise is an immensely special place and this documentary illustrates clearly what makes Paradise all its name implies.
I highly recommend this film!",False

10,10,Documentary about Paradise CA fire has a lot to tell us about surviving traumatic loss,anne-m-hudson,n/a,15/08/2025,"On November 8, 2018, the Camp Fire roared into Paradise, California, and burned 95 percent of its structures to rubble. Homes, schools, businesses, the hospital--were gone. This catastrophe ripped the fabric of the community to shreds.All Its Name Implies is a documentary made by Paradise resident Ev Duran, and it feels like a home movie in a great sense of that term. It's his home, his famiy, his community he's making a movie about. It includes a cell phone video made by a man who stayed at his house whie it burned down; footage of the evacuation from inside one of the cars, including screams from fleeing residents who feared they would die; interviews with residents recounting their first sighting of the fire in Concow and how they responded; interviews with the owner and an employee of popular Paradise coffee shop Juice and Java.The interview with the psychologist (one of the filmmaker's cousins) about post-traumatic stress disorder gives the documentary its throughline. He says that some people want to avoid being reminded of a traumatic loss and avoid ""triggers,"" sometimes to the point of not being able to leave the house. Others deal with it by remembering it and seeking support, and those people fare better. Social support helps them recover. By validating people's experience with the Camp Fire, this documentary provides some of that support.Paradise may never be able to go back to what it was, but the strong sense of community on display in this film gives us hope that they can build a new Paradise on the ashes of the old.",False

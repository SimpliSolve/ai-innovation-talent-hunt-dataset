1,1,A very important topic but done very insensitively,jamesclaxporter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Though this topic is really important and its really interesting to see inside these facilities and meet these people stacey oversteps her mark here. I didn't want to see her opinion on how patients should be treated, shes not the expert. Multiple times she tells a patient ""why can't you visit cambridge"" when the staff are explaining why. You can see this is only going to cause problems when the patient says ""well stacey says i'm fine to go"". On multiple occasions she asks suicidal patients insensitive questions. In all honesty she should have let the staff do more of the talking with patients as it gives the impression that a tv show host can do a better job than literal psychologists, and to be honest we found that quite a poor message.",False

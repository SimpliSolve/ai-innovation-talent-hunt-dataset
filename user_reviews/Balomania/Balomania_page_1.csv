1,2,Fetishization of dangerous crimes that burn innocent people alive,rioguy,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie grossly forgets to show images of burning homes. Homes of innocent people set on fire by hundreds or thousands of ,kilograms of fireworks falling on them. I welcome everyone to look for those images.Beyond that, the narrator's constant dramatic whispering and almost baby- talk like narrating is annoying. The movie didnt find much to say, so the film maker makes it about herself. As if the dramatic whispering that it will be the last ballon she sees would be of any relevance. Its dragged and boring beyond the insane fetisization of something dangerous. Much of Brazil was devasted by wildfires this year. They obviosuly dont know, dont care, cant control where the baloons will fall and what the baloons will set on fire.The female filmmaker, doesnt care much that its a machist world, totally excluding woman. She is so full of herself that it doesny bother her.Baloons are not an artform. They are dagerous, burning hazards. The reason for that is the competition and consant need to be the one who builds the biggest baloon with the highest number of kilograms of fireworks. That the baloons shouldd fly over 3 states, NOT knowing where it will fall, destroying lives and property. Totally self serving of delusional men who care more about the baloons than taking care of their children.Not something that should be celebrated. Also no mention who the ""sponsors"" are. You can guess if its the misitrsy of culture or the drug kartels.Dangerous, self serving content presnted in a boring, dragged way.",False

1,8,The meaning of life,bspoorendonk,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI loved the documentary. It shows people. Real people. At their best moment, at their worst moment. Confident people, insecure people. Successful people and people that are trying to find their way in the world. It's just interesting to see and sometimes touching.Sometimes I feel I would have liked to see more of a conversation. Sometimes I would have wanted to support the people that were walking by.The story of Robert, that just left prison, was most interesting in my opinion. I hope Robert stays on the right path. I've read in an interview that he moved in with his children and ex-wife. I wish him all the best!",True
2,8,Great in so many ways...,philip-00197,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pawel Lozinski got the pacing absolutely spot on. Film Balkonowy could so easily become ""another slow documentary"" but the rhythm, the passing of time, drops your heartbeat and let's you in.The interviews, conducted from Pavels balcony, are excellent in length - long enough to trigger your imagination but never so long as to become boring.It's a ""humanitarian film"" and, arguably, a prerequisite for enjoying Film Balkonowy is that you share the director's interest in ""ordinary people"". There are no great reveals, just a pleasant scratching of the surface into the lives of random passers by.Somehow Lozinsky manages to capture one of the essences of documentary filmmaking - being there.",False
3,8,What a brilliant concept,aashishhere,n/a,16/08/2025,"I admire the creator for thinking of this, for persevering through the creation period, and for asking questions which revealed so much about people in many cases in a very brief conversation. I wish I could do that in real life-- walk around, and really get to know people.The characters often open up about themselves in profound ways. Some in ways like they were indeed waiting for someone to ask them about their life. I guess that is how it is in real life.Also I thought love and loss was such a universal theme. So many conversations centered around relationships, regret about not doing enough, or regret about not having someone to care for in their life.",False
4,n/a,My first review.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"In this movie I am transported from my apartment in Sweden to a balcony in Poland, and I am lucky enough to meet a lot of great people.Who is the hero in the movie? Probably all of the people who have the courage to talk to the man on the balcony.Fun, inspiring and thoughtful.I thought the movie was great. Is it a documentary or a movie? :) All the characters are great and they all add a little something to make the movie what it is. Nice to see the seasons change so we get a sense of time passing.Nice to see a movie about real people. It would be great to see how they are today, a few years later.",False
5,5,Jest inny,dodaella,n/a,16/08/2025,"Film jest bardzo inny. Generally easy to watch. Quite long for non exiting movie.I guess that was the idea of something different. And for that reason- 5 stars. However the Filmmaker should have commented more (in my opinion) and perhaps goes into better chitchat with pedestrians but perhaps he is /was too shy for this. Also, I rather think that a lot of the characters were unusually weird. Not that people aren't awkward but it was unrealistic.Good representation of old generation. Just as I remember.Now:
A very big question to the filmmaker - have you found the answer? Have you found a purpose of your life??",False

1,4,Imperfect as the film medium they're touting,Silicone54,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a fan of photography in general I wanted to like this documentary. There was a 2020 documentary called An Impossible Project that did a much better job of celebrating all things analogue. It was more personal with a mix of history, chemistry and comedy.This movie just felt like a cobbling of film enthusiast photographers. I didn't feel any connection to any of them outside of one or two. There is no history lesson or big revelations or even useful information. Ok well now I know there are community dark rooms in my area that I can rent time to do my own film developed.The photographers mainly shared why they love film vs digital but that is not enough. Monet can explain in over 2 hours why he loved using a particular paint brush but the brush isn't what made Monet great.I came away shrugging my shoulders and will forget much of this movie. But I still remember the previously mentioned documentary now 3 years later.",False

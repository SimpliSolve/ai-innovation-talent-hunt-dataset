1,8,Heart Wrenching,leigh-williams888,n/a,15/08/2025,"I appreciate these victims willing to go on camera and share their story. It would be incredibly difficult to recount their experience.To those who have left a review saying there isnt enough camera footage and what footage we do have is blurry - what is wrong with you? This is not a Hollywood film with perfect scenes for your enjoyment.I personally found the footage and the audio to be terrifying.The helicopter pilots who went out of their way and did everything they did to help, are absolute hero's.Whist hard to watch, I highly recommend watching it so you understand what happened that day. And come away appreciating your own life and the force of nature.",False
2,7,Food for thought,rugbylane,n/a,15/08/2025,"How much risk is acceptable risk? How well informed are you before you take your family on an adventure excursion? Risk cannot be avoided otherwise you will have no experiences worth living for but where is the tipping point? In retrospect it seems that these excursions should not have been allowed but hindsight is 20/20. As a person who studies risk for a living, my only advice is to take risks that are known but avoid the unknown. I recommend watching this documentary for this reason; to give you food for thought. Considering it was only 3 years ago I commend the participants for their conteributions and the makers for their discretion.",False
3,7,A moving documentary about a tragedy with facts that seem a little glossed over.,justahunch-70549,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary about the tragic eruption in 2019 of the Whakaari volcano that killed 22 people and injured more shows the reason for the attraction that these people, and many more before them, had for visiting. Despite the potential danger, it's as beautiful a place as one can imagine. It had previously erupted in 2013 and 2016, so I'm not so sure I would have gone there in 2019 as a three year pattern, even if just a coincidence, had emerged. In any event, the poor people who happened to visit on that particular day suffered horrendously and some of the survivors are here to tell, and in some cases, show what occurred. Some of it is actual footage taken by some who survived and some of it is recreated events narrated by those there that day. The human survivor focal points are a couple who were there on their honeymoon and a young man who lost his entire immediate family and somehow, miraculously survived while with them. He alone will break your heart offering inspiration as well. Included are are also some very, very moving recollections of the bravery of many. This is a difficult re-telling of the events to hear, but oddly, there is no mention of all of the legal ramifications that occurred afterwards as there was some warning that the volcano could possibly erupt. The end credits make it clear that no one was ever held responsible despite that fact. The newlywed husband, a very congenial man to listen to, states at one point he would never had gone had he had been aware of all the facts that were known that day and you can just feel the pent up rage he is feeling beneath that veneer. Tours of this island are no longer allowed.",False
4,7,Honest and balanced but....,hayward-alan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Honest and balanced but can't help feeling the victims deserved tough questions to be asked about the lack of early warning systems, lack of requirement for appropriate safety equipment to be carried or stored on the island. The survivors bravery for telling their stories was incredible and the creators deserve credit for sharing them so honestly. Have to hope that other similar volcano tourism operations around have taken note and adjusted safety protocols accordingly. It may be many years before people go back but I suspect it will happen eventually and no doubt be very different when it happens.",False
5,10,Heart Breaking,destiny_west,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary tells the sad and tragic story of the eruption of the Whakaari volcano that killed 22 people and injured countless others.This documentary is mesmerizing and devastating. Well crafted in its narrative, with stories from victims and rescuers.The helicopter pilots that went to the island to rescue people when the government called it a no fly zone and would not send in others. These men are true heroes. Absolutely remarkable human beings.This documentary is a must watch. It is horrific to even think about what these people went through, the pain and suffering from steam burns is beyond description.The real footage taken and audio are haunting and terrifying.This is a must watch.",False
6,7,Harrowing account of the 2019 deadly volcano eruption,paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""The Volcano: Rescue From Whakaari"" (2022 release; 98 min) opens, we are introduced to a small community on the North Island of New Zealand. Thirty miles off the coast lies Whakaari, or ""White Island"", one of the most active volcanoes in the world, and a popular tourist attraction. It is ""December 9, 2019"" as tourists arrive on the island... At this point we are less than 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from director Rory Kennedy, who just earlier this year made the excellent ""Downfall: The Case Against Boeing"". Here she reflects on that fateful day in December, 2019, when a group of tourists visiting Whakaari find themselves trapped when the volcano erupts. Let me admit up front that I had not heard of this tragedy before seeing this. A couple of things struck: first and foremost, the beauty of that island (someone remarks ""it's like landing on the moon""), resulting in absolutely stunning photography (and immediately wanting to add this island to my ""bucket list"" of places to visit). But also this: there is a reason why the island is called ""the most active volcano in the world"", as this type of eruption apparently happens with regularity (as in: also in 2016, also in 2013, etc.). It is telling that after the 2019 eruption, the island was closed permanently to visitors, Along the way, we get lots of talking heads, including tourists who survived, first responders, etc.""The Volcano: Rescue From Whakaari"" had a brief US theatrical release, and started streaming on Netflix this weekend, where I caught it. In and of itself there is nothing ""revolutionary"" about this disaster documentary, but watching the footage of this far flung location, literally at the end of the world, makes this worthwhile. Of course don't take my word for it, so I readily encourage you to check it out and draw your own conclusion.",False
7,10,I can't imagine,dwrdspence,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't post much on here but I want to say something .... I can't imagine going through what everyone there went through. I will try to keep my words short. 1. This was something that everyone there was looking forward to as an adventure that many others went before. If I was there I would have thought not me. It's not going to happen while I'm here for these few moments. 2. The way everyone came together shows you the true human side of people to help others and not give up. 3. My prayers and thoughts to everyone involved. One more thing.... Speaking on how the doc was done. Whoever said this is long, it's not. It was straight forward and done extremely well. I believe it showed courage and determination. I'm so sad this happened but the doc gives you a first hand look of what everyone went through and puts you right there to relieve a horrible experience that makes you think on your own life and how we as people, we take things for granted on a daily basis. I also still can't imagine the strength it took for everyone involved to show us how and what they experienced.",False
8,6,Cultural difference is on show here,joshtomhardy,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAussies/Kiwi survivors: it's nature, it happens. Horrible, but you can't blame anyoneAmerican survivors: who can we line up legally to blame.What happen is tragic, but you knowingly go on an island with an active Volcano, you take that risk. Just shows an absolute difference in culture between the Americans and Australasian people, for example saying..
""had i been told the risks prior I wouldn't have gone"" that is silly, if you call yourself scientific people and go on an island with an active Volcano how do you not know the risks?The stories of the individuals were very powerful (brother and grandmother of the guides and the female guide). The aussie kid Jesse, wow serious strength.The running time is maybe 30 to 40 minutes to long. As some parts of the documentary felt touristy, and the comment at the end of the documentary that no one has yet accepted responsibility... that was uncalled for and an ugly thing to say, the producers should be ashamed of themselves for putting that in.",True
9,10,Brilliant documentary,queen-of-zeba,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerUnlike an earlier reviewer, I did not find this documentary too long at all. In fact, in my view, it could have been longer. I was mesmerised for every single second, and I don't even usually like documentaries. Perhaps it had special meaning for me because I live in New Zealand and have visited Whakatane many times. Although I've seen it from the shore when visiting the region, and from boats when fishing, I've never been to White Island/Whakaari.This documentary is extremely well done, with a lot of real footage, and with a heart-breaking and emotional impact. I started tearing up the minute the description of the eruption started, and haven't yet stopped. How brave those rescuers were. And thank you to the survivors (and relatives) for telling us their stories.",True
10,7,Whakaari and Uvalde: lessons learned,segesta65-440-677054,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe lesson is:
When the going gets tough, and even if they can help, the government will stand back and let you die.Brave civilians, not police or coast guard, are the heroes here. Coordinating themselves, private citizens and friends came to the rescue of dozens of burned and injured tourists on a desolate and dangerous island after an unexpected but fortunately brief eruption, 90 minutes from the mainland. The use of actual video footage is especially powerful and tragic.After seeing this event, which happened right before Covid, I now understand the New Zealand government's oppressive lockdowns a lot better. Embarrassing and disgusting.",True
11,9,Kudos to the helicopter pilots!!,punjabilion,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe helicopter pilots and the fixed wing aircraft pilots are real heroes. Kudos to you lads!! You deserve an award for bravery!! Shame on the NZ government and the emergency services response. You must say that was a poor response just like the American response time.Best Wishes to all the survivors, especially the lad who lost his sister and parents. Hope the American couple fully recover from their injuries and can learn to enjoy life again.People complaining about duration of the documentary should go watch their 3 minutes short videos as they clearly have no attention span. And to the people complaining about the footage should go watch Dantes peak or something.",True
12,7,Someone to blame?,dierregi,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a relatively well-made documentary about the ""unexpected"" eruption of the Whakaari volcano. This volcano is situated on an island one and a half hour's journey from the coast or 45 minutes by helicopter, hence quite remote.As bad luck wanted, the island was open to the public and visited regularly by tourists. On the day of the eruption, two groups landed by boat and a handful of tourists landed by helicopter. The group that started earlier managed to leave the island just minutes before the eruption.At that stage, there were still some 30 people on the island, 25 of them close to the volcano, and all hell broke loose. Some tourists literally melted on the spot never to be found and they were the lucky ones. Some 22 managed to reach the coast, badly burnt and thirsty. The only rescue they found was the first boat that turned back to pick up the injured and the helicopter pilot, who jumped into the sea and was unscathed.You would expect that an official rescue was organized, but the city officials forbade it because ""the situation was too dangerous"" and only three (or four?) commercial pilots decided to fly their helicopters to the island to rescue the survivors.All that gallant rescue was almost for nothing because almost all the rescued people were burned too badly and died, but a handful survived with terrible scars and a very long recovery time. Heartbreaking stories, especially the newlywed and the teenager who lost his parents and his sister.My relatively low rate is due to the fact that we don't hear much about the victims (what about the helicopter's group?) and that eventually, the moral of the story is always ""who's to blame and why the survivors didn't get hefty compensations"".",False
13,5,Best and worst of society,roobeedoo,n/a,15/08/2025,"Those who helped the victims went way above and beyond what most people would do and deserve to be recognised. However, being amazing and selfless, they don't seem to believe they did anything heroic. The world needs more people like that. The Aussie/NZ survivors are thankful for rescuers and grateful to have survived. We hiked around a volcano, it erupted, we're not dead, life goes on.On the other hand are the Americans. Nobody told us an active volcano could be dangerous. The boat ride back to the mainland was so long, and there was water (because it's a boat?), it was uncomfortable. They cut my wedding ring. There wasn't a single thing they didn't complain about. The husband claims there was no way to know it could be dangerous, there was no way he could have made an informed decision. (Because he couldn't Google ""is an active volcano dangerous""?) If he knew then that a volcano can erupt, he wouldn't have done it. Are you for real? Sure there's a reasonable assumption that organised tours are safe but do your due diligence. And maybe ask a second grader what the words ""active volcano"" mean. No one forced you to go traipsing around an extremely dangerous place. Take responsibility for yourself, no one else is accountable for your choices. You're solely a victim of your own ignorance.The documentary was done well enough. The shaky camera work and flashes of generic ground/sky/steam/boats/aircraft are annoying, but without showing actual video of the events it's kind of the only was to show the chaos. It's raw hearing survivors and the victims' loved ones speak of the tragedy. Like all Netflix productions it's twice as long as it should be.",False
14,7,Cant even imagine,Robbert_budel,n/a,15/08/2025,"Its a terrible event that took place in 2019. . And to be honest, i dont think i have ever heard of this tragedy. Just like many others, its often just another headline in the news, of which you read it and feel sorry but without realizing the pain that is behind the letters of the article.It left me sad the whole day. The pain and horror are beyond anything you can imagine. The documentary delivers a powerfull story of survivors and the community as a whole. I you like documentaties, i would definitly recommend it but be aware that it can leave you emotional after watching it.Blessings to all the survivors and families of people that passed away.",False
15,9,"Painfully riveting but a most worthy ""watch""",graceoverpressuretheoneANDonly,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the better documentaries of the unfolding & aftermath of a natural disaster that I have ever seen...Part of me wanted to turn it off for fear of what I might see - but the larger part wanted to know the truth(s) of this great catastrophe on Whakaari (White Island) The cinematography was excellent along with the variety of narratives from a multitude of perspectives. I'm frankly amazed 22 lives were lost and not all 47 because what was suppose to be an awesome adventure in nature turned in a ""heartbeat"" to a great tragedy. MANY ""lessons"" learned in watching it in regard to natural disaster and the elements of first aid for such a rare occurrence. I salute every person who was part of this production for creating an astounding ""blow by blow"" understanding of how it all unfolded - the wrongs and rights of it and the amazing men and women who came to the rescue in spite of the dangers presented. EXCELLENT documentary!",False
16,7,"Interesting, but Incomplete. What about the others?",tclark55,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA fascinating documentary on an event about which I knew little.Documentary filmmakers decide which conversations are included in their film and which are edited out. Much of the criticisms on this site seem to focus on the U. S. couple who were two of the primary interview subjects. The reviewers describe how the Australians and New Zealanders look at the tragedy stoically, while the American couple see litigation in their future.First, I did not see that. They did not mention a lawsuit. They did show regret and mention details that some reviewers regard as illustrating shallowness. For example, at least one reviewer cites the wife's objection to her wedding ring needing to be cut off at the hospital as an example of pettiness. No, this is shown because the filmmakers focused on the bond between these two newlyweds. They were on their honeymoon. They kept mentioning how they would not let each other go, and so forth. This was a decision the filmmakers made. Perhaps the other interview subjects also showed regret about going and anger at the tour companies or the government,The filmmakers' decisions on what to cover are why I gave this a lower rating than the topic and the cinematography deserve. Here are my criticisms:1. The film is too long.2. While the subjects had fascinating stories to tell, what about the other 20 or so survivors? Were these the only ones who would agree to an interview?3. What about the other victims? There is a shot of the names of the dead, and some of them were obviously couples or families. A bit of information about each would have made the tragedy more impactful, perhaps, a photo and a line or two for each victim.For example, the testimony of the young Australian man is powerful, but I would have liked to hear more about his parents and his sister. The horrible fact that bothered me the most was that they never found her body. They never found Hayden's, too.4. A bit more about the aftermath would have been informative. Yes, the island was closed to tourists. Yes, no one had faced punishment (there since have been trials related to responsibility), What was the reaction to the face that the rescue helicopters were not allowed to help, yet private pilots were able to rescue and aid a dozen of the survivors?5. Related to the last point, one shot of a helicopter pilot hints at the anger he is feeling towards the government rescue services that refused to help. His thoughts on that would have been interesting.This is definitely a fascinating topic, and the documentary is interesting. I would have liked to have heard less from some of the interview subjects and learned more about other victims.",True
17,10,Intense and well done documentary,slmcclure,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought this documentary was really well done for such a horrific tragedy for those involved. It was so nice to see the bravery of those who helped without hesitation. It was a bit long, but I didn't mind.It is awful and tragic what happened. No one probably should've been on the island with the alleviated risk, but it is an active volcano. I would've expected these people to do some research on their own or ask questions before taking a trip to an active volcano to determine if they thought it was ""safe"". I don't think they can blame anyone for what happened. They chose to be there. There is obviously always going to be a risk when it comes to nature. Though we have amazing technology, we can't always predict when a natural disaster will happen.",False
18,n/a,"Insensitive, Uncritical, and Artificially Positive",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This tragic event has some incredible accounts of survival and heroism that are inspirational, and this documentary covers that well. However, by focusing only on these ""positive"" stories, it horribly glosses over the culpability of tourism operators (who had warnings that they ignored) and the ineffectual response of the government (that failed to send aid, and possibly left people to die on the island, only civilians evacuated some people). In trying to present an ultimately uplifting movie, the documentary is unforgivably uncritical of the greater story and the lessons to be learned. Almost all of the documentary focuses on the stories only of survivors and the amazing responding heroes (civilians, not first responders) and fails to examine (even for 1 second whether tourists should have been there - the tour operator was found negligent) or to tell the stories of the victims or even give them any semplance of an identity (with the exception of the 2 local guides who died there). Instead there is brief graphic with the names of the 22 people who died there that flashes briefly at the end. There is a time to be uplifting, but not at the expense of completely ignoring culpability and anonymizing the dead. This is, without exaggeration, one of the most offensive films I've ever seen and one of the most bizarre choices for a documentarian. Disgusting.",False
19,6,Fault,sailorjjr,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWell, this is sort of like skydiving. If your parachute doesn't open, I don't have any sympathy for you? Right? It's an active volcano. It erupted 6 years ago, then 3 years ago. This was the end of another 3 years. It's going to erupt. Soon. Sorry, but as tragic as this is, don't go near an active volcano. They are deadly.Why not tour a jungle full of hungry lions? Because they might kill you. Why not swim with alligators? Because they might kill you.For the cruise line, the local government, the tour company (making money) to even allow this is beyond comprehension.So many at fault, including the tourists.",True
20,10,A sensitively & adroitly crafted film,greg_hopkinson,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA sensitively & adroitly crafted film about a collection of heroes from diverse cultures who get caught in a natural disaster and step up to help each other. The film communicates how each has dealt with the trauma - the Aussie battler, the mystical Maori, the Pakeha (white NZer) getting on with it, the Americans sustaining each other with mutual love, and the solid Belgian.'The Volcano' moved me to question my NZ culture's attraction to, and dance with, powerful and unpredictable aspects of Mother Nature. We have easy access to an abundance of wild beauty. Much of it comes with risk. [Personally, I've been caught in a few hairy situations.] Are we too cavalier and reckless? Is the beauty and awe too great to resist? Is the low risk profile woven into our collective consciousness? I've concluded I don't know.Ultimately, the event and aftermath appears to have allowed all the courageous people interviewed to move closer to love.Sharing is impactful. This film could help all the survivors; loved ones of those lost; and first responders, to move towards finding an effective way to find sustainable peace.Well done film makers, and well done those who stepped up to be interviewed.",True
21,7,Good but too long,lucienm-60321,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary about the explosion of a volcano in New Zealand is well put together.... however it's too long.It should have been one hour, not more.47 tourists go on a tour on an island which has an active volcano. Now, that's sound exciting except why the NZ government would allow people to go to an island which had had an explosion respectively 6 and 3 years before ?The documentary doesn't go into that. It should have had.The documentary shows us how beautiful this area of the world is. Pacific Ocean so beautiful and majestic with its bright blue colours.... the village, its native Maori people, aerial views of the spectacular island.... All very good photography.However, the length killed what would have been a great documentary.",False
22,8,People are great,Polly_Styrene,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe helicopter and fixed wing pilots who flew in a no-fly zone at their own risk and the guides who lost their lives trying to help are real Heroes. It was excrutiating to see real life footage of the eruption as the people suffered terrible burns, but worse was imagining what they went through after. The aussie guy who lost his parents made me very sad. The americans were over the top, placing blame. Could have cut some of that mulch out. Overall the story is about everyday heroism we are all capable of, and the failure of institutions driven by concerns of liability vs efficiency and compassion. Esp when the heli pilots ignored the instruction to go to the airport with their victims instead of straight to hospital. Those pilots are real heroes.",True
23,6,Could've been shorter.,bizare_ho,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt goes without saying, what happened was terrible. The lives lost; the trauma; the injuries sustained... absolutely horrible. As a tourist you do expect and demand tour operators to be well trained; responsible and can ultimately be held culpable if negligence has occurred and can be proven.That being said... I found some of the comments and overall blame culture attitude of particular survivors to be difficult to palate and hard to feel empathy with. You. Went. To. A. Live. Volcano!! It's like climbing Everest and being shocked that it's a bit chilly up there! Even living an ordinary life isn't without its risk, but when you actively go looking for adventure and the wonderment of Mother Nature in her natural, yet unpredictable state - you are increasing the risk of something happening to you. No matter how unlikely, it's never impossible.",True
24,4,Too long and wrong focus,RIK-22,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerUnlike many of the other reviews here, I thought this was quite a poor documentary for multiple reasons.The focus of this should have been much more around the negligence of all the parties involved, such as the Tour Operators, the local government and the NZ government.Instead, we got the drawn out and overly long focus on some of the people who survived the incident. I have great sympathy with their experiences, but there wasn't enough material to cover the running time, so this was the wrong approach.Also, we got very little clarity on what was happening. Normally you would expect more video and re-constructions to make it more understandable and relatable. They had cameras on the island, where was the footage?As mentioned, they should have had more emphasis on the fact that there were clear signs the volcano was about to erupt, and they still conducted the tours. The complete lack of any shelter points on the island, medical kits, inflatable boats, etc. The absence of any emergency plans from the Tour Operators and the authorities. The lack of any this was astonishing.The documentary should be asking some awkward questions to the local government and NZ authorities, how can health and safety be so lacking in 2019.",True
25,7,Terrible,juan_moran,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt was an excursion that does not make sense, I suppose that all the people who went signed documentation accepting the risks.I don't know if you can go to a volcano that is still active and even more so if it erupted 3 and 6 years ago, the death they had is unimaginable, the worst and it was all the fault of the negligence of going to places with all the risk.It is impossible to be ready in the face of this tragedy, fate meant that some could not survive, these events show us that there are many people who do not value their lives or those of others and live in conflict over minimal things, rescuers could not save themselves because they wanted to save to others.",True

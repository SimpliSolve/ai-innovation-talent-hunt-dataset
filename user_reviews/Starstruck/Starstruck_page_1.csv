1,1,A Blatant Copy of Stars in Their Eyes - without any of the charm !,silversundance,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stars in their Eyes was a great show. It worked because it showcased the talent of an individual and the talent of the wardrobe team. It also had a good presenter and worked well as a show.This was just auful. The presenters were too full of themselves and the focus was more on them and what they had to say. They fawned over ever star on the show so it made their dialogue pointless, and the presenter was just lacking any character.The stars were ordinary people - but because the presentations were done as groups of three - none were able to shine as individuals. The musical numbers were rushed and lacked the pizazz of the original show. Again all the focus was on the judges - which it shouldn't be ! This type of show does not fit in the X-Factor style of presentation !Just another failure by ITV !!",False
2,9,I love it!,suziestephens,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think it's great! Light hearted, easy watching and fun. It's a show for positvity, there's no negativity or putting people down.I also love the fact that the judging panel can actually do what they are judging other people on. So many shows like this have a judge with no relation to what they are judging, like a chef judging dancing!I also like guessing who they are going to be performing as.Yes, they don't always look exactly like the person they are going to be performing as, but it's not just about the look, it's about the singing voice, performance style, presence and quirks and traits of the artist that they are able to do.",False
3,2,"Stars in their eyes, it wishes.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"What is going on with so called light entertainment shows on ITV, once again they manage to deliver yet another stinker.The format, inspired by Stars in their eyes, or just a plain rip off of it. A format, that is just so incredibly tired, is there genuinely any appetite for a Sunday teatime singing competition anymore?The huge flaw, is that the contestants play second fiddle, once again, to the judges, the show is all about them, and pandering to their egos.I adore Sheridan Smith, and recently I have loved watching her in The Teacher and No Return, she is so much better than trash like this, she's worth a point, and that's the only plus point I can find on this show. Perhaps that they're not dressed up as licorice alsorts and bananas is another. ...Genuinely I sat through two of them, I can't cope with another minute of it.Agonising, 2/10.",False
4,9,It's pretty dreadful....,gofigure-17664,n/a,16/08/2025,"And that's why I love it.Most of the acts are hilariously bad, with a smattering of really decent performances. The latest episode featured 3 guys having a stab at being Barry Gibb for the night, and I haven't laughed so hard in such a long time. So tonight Matthew, for that reason alone, I'm giving it a 9/10.I'm guessing the viewing figures have been good enough to bring it back for a second season. Most of the judges are bit too forgiving, but at least Adam Lambert can be more cutting with his appraisal of a performance.Just don't go in to this expecting too much, enjoy and treat it for what it is, light entertainment.",False
5,1,Starstruck,studioAT,n/a,16/08/2025,"ITV have a root around in their cupboard and piece together elements from failing/failed shows of the past such as 'X Factor', 'The Voice' and 'Stars in their Eyes' to end up with this hideous Frankenstein's monster of 'entertainment', that I very much doubt will be remembered fondly.Couldn't they have saved the money and saved 'Neighbours' instead?",False
6,1,Please stop,lynnsimpson-33438,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't know what the judges are talking about when they praise these acts because even a non professional like myself can tell that they are really bad.,False
7,1,Great concept but the positivity is cringe,alextalent,n/a,16/08/2025,You could literally come out onto the stage and fart into the mic and the judges would swoon.At least Adam tries to tell the truth ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚This show needs to be less trophy for everyone and more harsh competition in order to survive.,False
8,3,So bad it's funny,aharris69,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThose of you who remember Stars In Their Eyes will remember how cringe worthy that was. We'll Starstruck takes it to another level. Take 3 people who look nothing like the star they're supposed to be and transform them into looking nothing like the star they're supposed to be. Robbie Williams and Justin Bieber should sue. Not only that the vast majority sound nothing like them either. The judges try their best to drag the show out of the cesspit it belongs but fail. Stick to singing at the local pubs karaoke night.If you want a good laugh then keep watching.Maybe they'll bring 3 horses on and turn them into crocodiles.,True

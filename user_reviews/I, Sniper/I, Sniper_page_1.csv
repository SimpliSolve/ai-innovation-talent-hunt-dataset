1,9,In depth about unlikely killer duo,johansk8god,n/a,17/08/2025,Very well produced and narrated True crime. About the DC Snipers John Mohammad and Lee Malvo.A great interview with serial killer Malvo is the back bone of the movie. A lot of interviews with Wounded victims and relatives to killed People.Good editing and quality photo material.,False
2,9,"This is a documentary, not US military Propaganda.",MBreviews1988,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is about a home-grown terrorist that was trained by the US military. This is about an African American man who felt society did not respect him because of his race or sexual identity. This is about a kid who was neglected and found someone that showed him love.Americans never want to analyze themselves or admit their faults. All the reviewers complaining are those Americans that would rather ignore America's faults than understand them and try to repair them.The military knew this guy might have tried to murder his fellow soldiers and they released him to the public, and somehow he was able to get his hands on guns and kill more people. Until America addresses it's flaws HONESTLY, terrorism like this will continue to happen.",False
3,8,"Worth watching, and not easily forgotten.",mandagrammy,n/a,17/08/2025,"Although this documentary series tends to lag occasionally, it never gets boring. It is probably one of the most thoroughly produced docs of a complicated and ultra tragic event in our history that I've seen. What makes it most worthwhile is finally getting the full story from the viewpoint of the victims and those most affected by the murderers. Although we hear quite a bit from the youngest member of the murderous duo, he is not allowed to present himself on camera, which is the right thing to do. The people that are focused on are those who have the right to be seen, as well as heard. Not only are the victims given a voice, but so are the men and women who worked so hard to try and stop the senseless crimes. Overall, this is definitely a series worth watching and not easily forgotten.",False
4,10,Chilling,mayga-26857,n/a,17/08/2025,Absolutely chilling. Malvo basically narrates the entire story from a prison phone. The editing flows right with it as he describes his thoughts and what he did during each murder.,False
5,10,Extremely tragical story,hakan-47349,n/a,17/08/2025,"One on the most heart tearing and best series I ever seen. Great production, hard thought to believe it has happened in reality.",False
6,7,"Horrifying, but overlong.",paul2001sw-1,n/a,17/08/2025,"Everyday, people get diagnosed with terminal diseases, and in America, gun crime is rife. Yet there's something unqiely terrifying about the thought of a sniper picking off victims at random, just because he can. John Mohammed was a deeply distrubed individual who, with his young accomplice Lee Malvo, wreaked havoc in Washington, D. C. This documentary tells the story. And it's a good (i.e., horrifyingly bad) one as far as it goes. But it's quite a long series. A lot of modern life is caught on camera these days, while many of the witnesses, the luckiest of the victims, and even one of the perpetrators, are still around to speak; and yet there's not much to learn we're not told in the first couple of episodes. A lot of people died, then the police got lucky, and captured the killers as they slept in their car. Mohammed was executed; Malvo got life without parole. What pervades the tale is a sense of grim senslessness; maybe it didn't need six whole episodes to tell it.",False
7,10,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,antoniocassone2013,n/a,17/08/2025,"This well-rounded, balanced documentary is outstanding. I sat back and thought about how well done it was. At first, I thought...since a great deal of the story is told from Malvo's perspective through audio calls from prison...it wouldn't be as balanced as it actually was. Here we hear not only from Malvo, but from law enforcement, media official, victim's family members and from the few victims who survived that period of time. It was such a tragedy and this documentary series puts it all in perspective. One of the best true crime docs I have seen in a long time. It will draw you in and you will stay for awhile. It sticks with you.",False
8,9,Your Children Are Not Safe,katbkaliski,n/a,17/08/2025,"The episode ""Your Children are not Safe,"" was utterly chilling and riveting. Lee Malvo's candor and attention to every little detail was amazing to hear recounted. His drawings gave me chills. The devotion and reliance Malvo had towards Muhammad made him perfectly pliable. He became the perfect killer. It's frightening.",False
9,10,Perspectives from all angles- well done,mowglihokie,n/a,17/08/2025,"Living in the No Va area it's difficult for many to understand the anxiety in that area at the time- especially with these events following 9/11 and the anthrax killings....the documentary does a GREAT job of talking with most of the officers and victims or their families, all, while a large part of the story is being narrated by Malvo... it's chilling to hear his calculated story and then get the perspective and feel the emotions of those directly impacted by that POS- especially after the shooting at the middle school...Blending into the story of where many of these people are now adds yet another well thought out and edited story... excellent documentary..",False
10,5,Certain Americans are not Responsible for Their Actions,salliemathis,n/a,17/08/2025,"Certain ""Americans"" can't be held accountable because you see, ""The System"" turned them into bad people.White supremist society, racism, the military blah blah blah and so on and so forth, you know, the current trend in media to explain away why a certain type of American just can't cut it in the civilized world.",False
11,10,A Unique True Crime Doc,portal1790,n/a,17/08/2025,"I know that history helps. A lot. Even so this is a unique true crime documentary. Seems like you can feel something sometimes. At times. Simply a powerful 8 episodes one better than the one before. Cold as ice in an inside view from a killer as you've never seen before. A gripping narrative episode after episode in a true crime documentary that you've wish it never happened but a peace of US history is written in this unfortunate disturbing behavior. ""Vice"" aka ""Viceland"" it's at the top of it's game now. Amazing.",False
12,8,a chilling story...,ops-52535,n/a,17/08/2025,"About power over man, and the outcome of that.As a tv-series its saggy and extremely slow in pace, one could easily have cut it to a 4 part documentary.But we shall all pray for the victims and salute the people sitting in loss and agony, and cheer the thought that''' we'll meet again one sunny day''",False
13,9,From the horse's mouth,happyspaceinvader,n/a,17/08/2025,"You can either learn from history, or choose to ignore it and carry on repeating the same mistakes. To learn from history, you have to hear all sides of the story... not just the sides that tell you what you want to hear so you can sleep more easily at night.We'll never get to hear the side from the older killer, John Muhammad, as he was executed in 2009. But to hear the side from the surviving killer Lee Malvo provides a fascinating insight into just how easy it is to plan and commit a murder spree in the USA. And if it was frighteningly easy in 2002, it's apparently just as easy now in 2023 if not easier.It's only Feb 20th and already there have been 68 mass shootings in the USA, with 104 people killed and 269 injured. Statistically, Americans are far less safe right now than while these two men were on the loose back in 2022.The Internet is strangely light on the background of these two men... one a decorated soldier, the other a Jamaican immigrant. What should be shocking is how relatively ordinary they were, according to the people they came into contact with, but instead it's tragically familiar.One particularly telling moment is when the owner of the shooting range (where the killers honed their skills) gets in a muddle as to whether owning guns is a ""God given"" right or a constitutional right. You suspect he wants to believe the former, but has to concede the latter. And when he makes a point of telling us that what a gun is used for is ""up to the individual"", the camera lingers just long enough to see the self-doubt settle into his eyes.",False
14,4,Needed a Narrator,ewood-21907,n/a,17/08/2025,The documentary uses prison interviews with the perpetrator as the backbone of the narrative. They were so married to this format that the result is a meandering and gappy story. I had to pause the show and research the missing pieces. An actual narrator or inserting textual clarification would have helped. The perpetrator has a strange cadence and knowing what a vicious person he is made it impossible to watch.,False
15,1,Glorifying murder and psychotic slimeballs,randall-13,n/a,17/08/2025,"Why???? The series was very poorly done, poorly written, poorly directed and poorly edited. All it does is encourage other psychotics to go out and ""make a name for themselves"" by doing the same thing. Again, why??? The makers of this farce are as sick as the perpetrators of the crime.",False
16,1,Biased in favour of murderers,mancocm,n/a,17/08/2025,"2 hours of almost justifying why these 2 halfwits went around murdering people is almost sickening. Society, upbringing, blah blah. 2 cowards killing unarmed people from a distance. One victim was sitting reading a book! Can't believe the younger killer will get parole one day....",False
17,5,It could be so much better,MM1057,n/a,17/08/2025,I am 1/2 way through episode 2 and it just drags out. It could have been done so much better. One of the crazier stories in the Country right after 9/11. It missed the mark in so many ways. üëéüèº,False
18,1,Why???,sagon-77202,n/a,17/08/2025,"Why was this even made or got such a high rating. TV series should have never been made to begin with, discredits veterans and how 1 dad ruined a kid life for no reason.Dont need to watch it, if you were around when it happened.",False
19,3,Too long and needed a narrator,EPMD57,n/a,17/08/2025,"They never should have let the murderers narrate the story. I would have appreciated a narrator and a telling of the story that didn't give the culprits a chance to revel in their work. Gross.Honestly, this was the worst way they could have told this story.",False

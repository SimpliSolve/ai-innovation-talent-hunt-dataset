1,6,Was this COVID trickery?,rwise-73562,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film rolled along quite pleasantly. It flipped between the clever and thought provoking and merely contemplative. The very sparse use of any dialogue is rather odd.BUT the most interesting and arguably deceptive aspect is the closing statement on the screen which says that all the 52 film sequences were filmed in California. I had to read and re-read that very carefully to make sure I understood correctly.I noticed lots of people were leaving and didn't read the statement and so left thinking they had just seem 52 bits of film shot at the announced location. That is definitely what I thought I was watching.But the film naker has confirmed it. Despite each of the 52 sequences being announced as, for example, 'Grand Junction, Colorado', or 'New York, New York', they were in fact, located in California.I have read the film makers explanation for this but I was unconvinced. It seemed like a desperate ploy to convince the viewer it was very clever when really, it was the huge compromise that had to made in order to make the film. It ends up being trickery.",True
2,3,Comedy James Benning Film?,akoaytao1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"Practically here because of James Benning's Sight and Sound List. In that list, he infamously just voted his films.This film was the first film of his I found available.In here, the presents a ""view"" of the 51 states + PR and DC, presented in mostly diegetic sounds of the area. In the end, it claps back and shows that it was actually just from California representing the whole of the states.This a mockery of the Idealization of American Landscape in movies. He leads you in this spaces and then proceeds to crash it.It does not work for me. I had since watched a bunch of his films AND this is by far his artsier work with a comedic bent, if your strong enough to wait for the .I think people should watch Landscape Suicide first. It really made me rethink his work AND understood this long shots of nature works.",False

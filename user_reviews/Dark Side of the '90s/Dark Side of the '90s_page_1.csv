1,6,"Not a bad show but nothing really ""dark sided"" about it",ncoflin,n/a,16/08/2025,"So I like this show, it's fun 90s nostalgia. It's not very different from other 90s decade docuseries done in the past by CNN or Vh1. The title implies it would be about something ""dark sided"" but it's not really. Some of the dark sided stuff seems like a stretch. I presume they're just doing it for branding purposes since Vice has other docuseries like ""Dark Side of the Ring"". Ooooioo.",False
2,6,Interesting but something is missing,interestingstuff,n/a,16/08/2025,"I felt nostalgic watching this series and it had some nice stories but I also felt like something was missing here. They only had 10 episodes so they had 10 stories to present to represent the entire decade of the 1990s, yet they went with stories like Beanie Babies, sock puppet or some night club in Los Angeles out of all the interesting topics they could have picked.Also episodes felt drawn out and repetitive. The people they interviewed in each episode were knowledgeable about their topic but they all repeated the same things over and over. The storytelling in these episodes could have been a lot tighter.",False
3,7,"First Season good, Second not so much",xtidusxyunax,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved the first season, lots of amazing insights about cultural events and trends and all that.Dropped it from a 9 to 7, is due to Season 2 seems to a very heavy focus on social justice, I think someone came in and was a BLM activist.Just feel like there is so much more to the 90s as it was in the first season, and the pivot is so sharp. The only episode of season 2 I like is the UFC origins one.",False
4,n/a,"Close, but no cigar.",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"They could've approached this in an unbiased manner and it could have been very well done and still somewhat accurate, but they just couldn't do it. The history is good about how things have happened, but the narration and perspective is inaccurate and biased. Too bad because there was a lot of promise of nostalgia for a teen of the 90's.",False
5,6,Poor narration,nicosmoothcriminal,n/a,16/08/2025,"Pleasant German was sure to introduce herself as a Hollywood icon? Who is she? Ridiculous.She said she stumbled over river phoenix one night at the viper room passed out on the floor!Wouldn't you stop to see if he's breathing? Perhaps get some guys to help him up?Horrible! Do you have no heart?This series would have been better with better
narrators. No self proclaimed icon!I'm from that time period, and lived near the Viper room. It was no different than any other bars at that time.Especially the Rainbow, right down the street. We were all young and thought we were invincible.Many were not.May they RIP.",False
6,9,Great Show,Missyrocks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Arbitrarily found out about this show on YouTube because someone posted an episode about the Viper Room. I had to research it to find it. Loved every episode on demand so far. They should do more to advertise this series. It's great, but I didn't know it existed.",False
7,8,Really like the series,bpb99,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this series was pretty good, I'd definitely watch more if there is a third season.However I felt I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I was born a little sooner... Being born in the 90s, I know *of* a lot of these stories from the media, I am familiar with them all but I was basically a babe at the time. I don't really feel the same sense of nostalgia.I agree with others, certain stories could definitely have been left out and replaced with... better ones. I felt the same way about the original dark side series itself though. There was also a lacking in the 'dark side' aspect, it was more just a normal docuseries.I would love it a lot more if they did an early 2000s version of this show, I think that would be pretty great for those of my generation. Of course it's biased and I am sure everyone would prefer a version of their own youth.. The only thing I have seen is a natgeo docuseries on disney about the 2000s and that one is super dull and slow yet short, I think that the dark side would do a much better job of it.",False
8,10,Top Drawer,blueshoe711,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a fine series. Plenty of detail and lots of interviews with people who were there and know what they're talking about. Too few documentary series take the time to develop their information this way.,False
9,8,Well done,lotusflower_cam,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've only watched season one so far and I've enjoyed the episodes. I'm a child of the 80s and 90s so watching this is like being back in the 90s being nostalgic for some of the best times of my youth. It's also a refreshing and deeply reflective experience, looking at the era with different lens now being much older and thanks to some information this documentary presents that I didn't know about at the time.Like some reviewers pointed out, there are details that are left out in the episodes, and the series could probably have done better. But for a docuseries covering such a wide range of topics that spanned a decade, I think it did well.I particularly enjoyed the episode on the Viper Room with information surrounding the scenes at the club that I'd never heard until now. I was a huge fan of River Phoenix from when I was a preteen in the late 80s after being struck by his raw and beautiful performance in Stand By Me, and his death, which happened when I was in high school was a traumatic event for the then-seventeen-year old girl. Three decades later my heart still aches when I think about him and his life cut too short. So many interviews and articles written about his life and death that I read or watched over the years and they always left questions. This documentary helped to fill that void. It was heartbreaking to remember it once again but thanks to the interviewees who were the regulars of the club and their stories of what kind of place it really was, I have more clarity and understanding. So thanks in particular for this episode.",False
10,4,Interesting but flawed,dailydoseofnopes,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is by no means a bad one. The biggest flaw is that it tends to skew facts in order to fit a current year topic.Unlike Dark Side of The Ring where it is presented impartially: some facts may be omitted/edited in order to tell the complete story overall; this show tells its own version of history from a certain point of ""view"". History dictates A leads to B leads to C. In this show A leads to C.An example would be the Jerry Springer show somehow lead to Columbine. Columbine happened in 1999 and the narrator advocated to why schools allowed students to have access to guns? They conveniently failed to mention the Gun Free Schools Act of 1994.Again, not a bad show, the topics are interesting and a fun stroll through memory lane but filtered facts bring it down.",False
11,8,an interesting stroll...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Through the life of american ''pop-television'' of the 90's. To be a grumpy old man that has never dove into the falsification of super perfect confectionary actors and titles, its an interesting uncloackment of how the entertainment industry development sped of like a rocket due to technological improvements and investments, and to realize what kinda frenzy a little tinker may cause due to flock mentallity, and being dizzyingly digitized by the networks and the network.So bend your tounge cause it might get bitten by the pure dependency of the fair and square squawking box that has made our generation become the most pasified one since the athenian democrats started making laws upon eachother, and the only excercise was either a thumb up,...or down.Do have a look ,vice have done a nice job here.",False
12,10,Those nostalgia feels,queenkulick,n/a,16/08/2025,A well written series that gives you series nostalgia feels for a past lifetime. It's fascinating to hear new stories about things you grew up with. I hope they do series on different decades.,False
13,5,Season 2 is not great.,staciarose20,n/a,16/08/2025,It's so politically driven and most episodes of season 2 are boring. Wtf were they thinking? There's so many interesting stories and public figures from the 90's! I don't wanna hear about UFC for two hours.,False
14,5,American life in 90's,rleigh-42220,n/a,16/08/2025,"I mean, it's not wrong and pretty much sums up a lot of the 90's influences but more focused on American events for the most part.That said, it will FOREVER irk me that they always try to say ""Beverly Hills 90210 was the first groundbreaking show about real teens"" when Degrassi was already doing that before they ever showed up.Watching Jason Priestly, being Canadian, agreeing with this bs in the documentary is just rich.",False
15,4,"Ok, but biased and missing much of the 90s",june_panic,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm only partially through watching the entire series, but I can tell (from living through the 90s) that much of what is presented is from a very current left-wing lens and seems to intentionally focus on certain modern social issues rather than viewing the culture from what life was like in the 90s.Much of 90s is completely absent because it either doesn't fit the narrative or they couldn't find actors willing to do interviews. How could you possibly have an episode about teen TV shows in the 90s and not mention Beavis and Butthead or South Park at all?Putting all that aside, the content they do show is not overtly incorrect (just a biased perspective) and provides an insight into what it was like living through the 90s. However, it is better if you actually have someone that lived through the 90s sitting next to you to provide the correct context.",False
16,1,Totally biased to one view,mjwigert50,n/a,16/08/2025,"Throughout the entire series they go with a lot of individuals and people saying racism, sexism, and homophobia. When they talk about every dam subject it has to because of those three reasons for everything and it gets pretty old and laughable because you yell wolf and their is no wolf it makes you look dumb. It is never just a bad situation they got to put a narrative on anything and especially bashing law enforcement. They hate law enforcement in this series. It was a waste of time and effort. I could only deal with so much yelling wolf and no wolf so many times. They show biased individuals more than anyone in every episode.",False
17,5,You don't need 20 episodes to cover the '90s.,bt698nhj,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fact that you made this documentary 20 episodes illustrates how into the weeds you went. I love documentaries and I love history and this just bored the life out of me.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",False
18,5,It's the 90s IN THE USA,sami-27950,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show is, as can be expected, only about the USA. Not about the 90s, more about USA. It shows things from there and there are interesting parts, but they could've titled it correctly or had an actual larger view of the world. Most of us can't relate to anything they show since, gladly, we didn't live among mass shootings and forced ""us vs them"" that is the norm even today there.",False
19,5,It's an ok show,b4blue,n/a,16/08/2025,"Someone took the time to review the events, trends, tropes, narratives... that marked the 90's, which is admirable. Good effort was put into it. So what is the problem? The main problem is that this hasd been done in the time when everything is deeply political and there is no centre. Leading narratives in the media are extremely left leaning, hypocritical towards the system they thrive in and every criticism is labeled as extreme right wing. You can see how many conspiracy theories, even debunked ones are still pushed through this show, because it helps with the narrative. Some episodes are laced with more of it, depending on the content. Especially if the content is directly connected with what is happening today. I don't think there is a malicious intent behind it. Authors genuinely believe to be doing the right thing. They believe they are on the right side of history and minor or major omissions are not important. This is how most bad things happen in this world. It's not through some joint conspiracy but numerous acts of simple idiocy. Human civilisation doesn't work because there are best people at critical positions. It just somehow works in spite of too many people being really bad at their job.",False

1,3,"Art Film, not a Documentary",imdbfan-8489591422,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a ""documentary"" by an Italian director who goes to Bosnia Hercegovina without a clue about the local history and culture and he asks a couple of good questions but doesn't even investigate them.I am also an outside who has studies South Eastern Europe a bit, and this film does not give you any new insides. There are a lot of artists from Bosnia, and just art or music or dance classes in Bosnia, but none of it is explained. What is the significance of the ballet dance? Why are we shown a puppet theatre? There are fragments of interviews, but I guess the outsider wants to keep the Balkans ""mysterious"" and does not try to understand.As other reviewers have set, it's not clear why women are shown naked at the end, why the wird cut up techniques...I'll give it some stars for halfway decent camera work, the rest is a misguided art project that does not work for such a serious topic. I'd rather see something by Bosnians and not interviews in Italian with subtitles.",False
2,1,This movie should be deleted,fmjam1,n/a,16/08/2025,"No substance, no clear story. The movie is not presenting Bosnia and Herzegovina accurately by any means. Directing, photography, camera are almost not bearable. As it was said at one point in the movie ""it should have been deleted"". But still, some people are getting money from their countries for making fake art attempts as this one.",False
3,n/a,Producer should look for another job,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNot worth watching. I watched a lot of documentaries and o boy what a horribly terrible this one was! Dude starts his 'journey' with 'finding out what the role of religions has been on the Balkan war' bashes all the religions in the region, interim concludes that it was a fight of communists and finishes of bashing religions all over again. He is not shy of making a derogatory reference to the Turks by showing a turkey a long the way. Why express your own hate if you want to discover the countries culture mate? Religion is a reality in the Balkan and it won't go away because of your coloured perspective. If you want to help those people try emphasising their brotherhood, the similarities and the fact that they lived peacefully together for multiple centuries. Otherwise look for another job please.",True
4,1,Hard to do worse than this,sumadinac_gavrilo,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is really remarkable to get such supports from EU and a regional film commission for a pointless work. This is not a documentary (as Netflix presents it), nor a movie. It wants to be somehow poetic, but it achieves just to be prosaic (like at the very end). It doesn't tell what Bosnia is, or just in VERY small part. It doesn't help to understand Bosnia, but mostly shows how director sees it trough typical ""western"" clich√©s. The bosnian gold is the people (and I speak by direct experience!), a people that despite everything think still about south Slavs as jedan narod=one people. Bosnia-Herzegovina is a fantastic land and deserves much better then this.",False
5,1,Choosing the facts,IDunavailable,n/a,16/08/2025,Putting 'combat pope' and 'hate filled imam' in the same sentence is malicious.Also if he didn't use words 'Sarajevo' or 'Bosnia' I would never guess he is talking about it. So many nonsenses and biases view of Sarajevo and Bosnia.,False
6,1,Bosnia Is more than that,Tommybboy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is not going anywhere. Extremely superficial. Told through a useless voiceover. Bosnia and Herzegovina is more than that. The istituto Luce archivial footage, despite their historical importance, are misused and edited with no sense.The book told the journey of a train between Belgrado and Sarajevo. In the movie there is not journey at all.In addition, the director and his entire team talked for more than an hour before the start of the documentary, about things that the public could not understand, complimenting each other for the wonderful work done.Embarrassing.The finish is also in bad taste. In my opinion there was no reason to see nudity. Not in the way it was done.",False
7,2,Mediocre and childish,strahinjapavlovic,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is not how you make a ""documentary"". Poor editing with no concept whatsoever. The film is portrayed as an story about Bosnia throughout a ""train journey"" which leads us to see the modern Bosnia and how it is connected to its roots and history. Neither history, nore train were seen in this film. I would like to know how fast cuts with archive footage with barley dressed women and a protagonist which is a girl, dancer, musician, teacher etc are relative to the subject of this documentary. Such a waste of locations, unplanned shots and framing which were essential for this type of storytelling. Bosnia has so much more to offer then how the author sees the film. Truly narrow and without extensive research of the subject leeds you to approach this way to a tri-nation, country wide subject, and gets you to this, a film very like a student work, and a poor one indeed.",True
8,1,Movie is a grabage,gavricdarko,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is huge garbage, and don't say anithing. It's show Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) like muslim country, but it's not true. Also he partly tell a story of one side. In BiH you have always 3 sides of story. If I can give a zero (or -1) for this film, I will give.He shows nudity at end of movie, without reason or some context. There no trip with train at all. Autor of that movie don't know anything about history of BiH. In one scene he show demolition curchs in Russia in 1920... ? Why??? There Is no context. I wanna 1 hour off my life to watch something quality. P. S. Also I think that this film need to be deletede.",False
9,10,"The worst, post-war tragedy in Europe put in context",edwardsodmann,n/a,16/08/2025,How can anything as horrific as the annihilation of human dignity and the unrepented slaughter of fellow humans be put on our media tables? How can we be invited to try to relate to the survivors of the genocide and mass rapes? What is left in their hearts and minds and what is the next generation in for if they don't have the privilege of becoming a pupil at the school of rock there? It's an artistic master piece that starts a conversation among all Europeans.The selection of wonderful people shown helps us to connect if we're interested. The smiles and positive passion on some faces is the seed of hope.,False
10,1,Unimportant and amateurish,stevewyndhamsmith,n/a,16/08/2025,"This 'documentary' has been put together by someone who by their own admission hasn't live in the country. He uses irrelevant and overdramatic footage to emphasise uneducated statements he's made over the top of local people talking. I can't work out if the producer is simply amazingly ignorant and blissfully unaware of how stupid they sound or has edited this to make it into some kind of dark comedy? Either way unless you want to watch a documentary that is woefully biased and misses out large swathes of historical information that holds huge cultural importance for this area and the surrounding Eurosian continent, I wouldn't bother watching this. Netflix should have a moral obligation to delete this immediately.",False
11,1,Unbearable watch,MyleneC-8,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie is just one big pile of steaming garbage and a tremendous waste of the time.What promised to be a documentary about Bosnia ended up being some cheap soft-porn at the end. What was the point of the random nude girls? And he asks people to keep rewatching as if there is some deeper, hidden meaning? Dude, are you for real? Honestly, no structure, no coherence, jumps all over the place with the themes and the camera work is beyond horrible. It portrayed nothing of Bosnia, just what the ""director"" thought it was -- typical, Western, colourblind vision. He knows nothing of the region, and it blatantly showed. For instance, he bashes religion when it is the core of the country, especially the brotherhood and unity between the faiths. He should've listened to his own advice and deleted the film.",False
12,1,totally Pointless,trajanjan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even annoying to be honest! No story no concept, just idea to look very ""deep and artistic"" but nothing from that.Very bad narration, without closure or points and connection with the next scene, nothing.In general ""Bosnia Express"" lacks a compelling storyline, with disjointed scenes that make it difficult to follow. The characters lack depth, leaving the audience disconnected from their journeys. The pacing feels uneven, making the overall viewing experience unsatisfying. Unfortunately, the film falls short of delivering a memorable cinematic experience.I will not recommend this movie!!!!",False
13,9,A personal account of the war in Bosnia.,Uneken,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are of course many political views that motivate an opinion about this documentary, if you want to call it that.It's more a poem than a document. It reflects the director's opinion about what happened during the war in Yugoslavia. But there are moments of balance. How religion stokes the fires of hatred and violence: always and everywhere, even though these faiths pretend to promote peace and justice. Everybody suffered in this war, but the ""muslims"" (Q: do you have a Koran? - A: yes, somewhere in a drawer, I think) most, by far.We have to call the things by their names. That is what this film does, in a beautiful way.",False
14,n/a,watch it please,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is not a very precise account of the war in Bosnia but it captures some of its worst horrors. It meanders left and right, and is quite unfocused, but you can feel that deep tragedy that struck Bosnia in the war 1992-1995. It was an all-out civil war, everz nation against all the others, a situation when no side can claim inocence. And this movie captures that fact nicely. The movie could have been made a bit less confusing, but I suspect the author's intentions were purposefully set in other direction, maybe because the war itself was as confusing. Please put it on your watch list, it deserves your time.",False

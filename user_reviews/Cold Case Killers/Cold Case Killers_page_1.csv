1,10,Perfection; for me at least.,sicklittlebunny,n/a,16/08/2025,"This program has it all, procedure, forensics, fascinating cases, and its all real! It's like New Tricks, Silent Witness, Waking the Dead, The Bill, Law and Order UK, and Midsomer Murders all put together, with the lead detective and many other who were involved in the case walking us through everything (including friends and family and witnesses). The bonus of it being a British show is that we still have all the media footage, so Crime Watch reconstructions, news reports, police and family appeals to the public, etc, are all the original recordings.But what made me give a rare 10/10 is that THEY SOLVE THE CASES! Contrary to the badly written summary, it's not about reopening cold cases. The program is about the cases that were never allowed to go cold, it just took a long time to get justice.",False

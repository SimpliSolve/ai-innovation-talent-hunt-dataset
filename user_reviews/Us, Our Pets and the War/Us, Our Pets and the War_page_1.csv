1,8,"Emotional, sad...and continued tragedy for all being alive",wczerkewicz,n/a,15/08/2025,"It would be easier to reflect on this movie in retrospect, once all the horrors of war are behind us, but unfortunately, the war is far from over. A huge number of animals will continue to suffer, and it's a devastating feeling as you finish watching the film.This incredibly touching yet heartbreaking movie by Anton Ptushkin, a YouTube blogger who had never been a documentarian before, makes it hard to hold back tears. Each story is filled with the pain and suffering of both animals and people. Ptushkin skillfully brings this emotionally charged topic to the audience, showing yet another way to reveal the terrible consequences of the war in Ukraine.The one thing you want to do after the movie ends is hug your dog and pray for an end to this war.",False
2,6,A hidden way to get what's going.,grrinorm,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis movie is ultra close documentary to know what was in the Ukraine, to not reveal people identities.There almost no russian propaganda, that entered and stayed in like in a lot of such called ""Ukrainian media"", that pretend to be ""news"", ""information sources"", ""ukrainian"" but trully a bit more camouflaged and a bit lesser fraudfull like the enemies.I get a lot of emotions, there plenty of people that share their wealth with all living beings they can get to, through concrete, or unattainable physically (only using special rescuing vehicles), even under the seige of occupants. The strength and willing to live of animals were inspiring, and horrors they experienced were completely unrighteous.The offending country is deserving it's D-Day and else.",True

1,9,Superbly detailed recount of one of the most important moments in music history,sgillard-71308,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThough story is compacted in to just under 1hr 30 (or just over) Binders buddy film demonstrates all that Has been myth about the compact special. Giving detailed no holds barred recounts of the twist and turns of an event created to reestablish a star through the eyes who experienced along with showing Col. Parkers tunnel vision ed concept of Elvis being a paycheck to further his own success. Some may view the set up as baised in favor of Elvis but this adds to examining the truth of the unfolding events showing Parker as he truly was a deceitful conman with one goal...saving his own skin ofc.,True
2,7,"Enjoyable, but...",mestberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a decent documentary as it gives you some insight into the making of this famous special. From a music and TV historian's point of view, you get a laugh out of the concepts and costumes, and what was considered risqué at the time. Elvis looks great (in fact, probably the best he ever looked), and you get a taste of all his music.The negative: it would've been much better to not have known that Steve Binder was an executive producer on this show. He made sure to have many of the participants praise him up one side and down the other. It was a little gratuitous by the end. Yes, we understood that you did everything right, and Elvis trusted you more than anyone else in the room. And yes, Colonel Parker was ""the devil/monster"" (probably all true, but a little humility goes a long way).Positive: if you're an Elvis fan, you will find a lot of enjoyment in it and get some backstage secrets. Unless you have no idea who Elvis is, you will still get a better idea of who the man really was.",False
3,9,Activity behind the making of Elvis' iconic 1968 special.,michaelRokeefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTrying not to fall into temptation of heavily expounding on an event that carries its own folklore. Fully authorized, behind-the-scenes story of the making of the legendary and momentous piece of TV/musical history. Director Steve Binder was in a most unique position of propelling the broadcast in the progressive direction it took.Elvis Presley bravely was convinced by Binder, to regain confidence and recapture part of his past to progress in making a TV special that would give The King of Rock 'N' Roll a rebirth and beginning of a new chapter in his well documented career.Binder took Elvis on a walk out on Sunset Boulevard and no one noticed. Mr. Binder told his new friend that his career was ""in the toilet"". The nervous Presley doubted he could on stage without embarrassing himself. Binder had to fight Colonel Tom Parker and the idea of doing a Christmas themed special. Steve wanted Elvis to don a black leather suit and rock! That was just part of what happened at the NBC Studios, when Elvis took his career back into his own hands. The special was a smash hit. And Presley once again became relevant and took back the public's adoration and his seat on the throne as the ""King Of Rock 'N' Roll.",True
4,10,Steve Binder - Your the Man,stan-232,n/a,16/08/2025,"In 1968, Steve Binder told Elvis that his career was in the toilet. Thank God for his honesty with Elvis, and subsequent trust Elvis put in Steve's hands.Steve was the right man for the right time. A bit of luck. A bit of belief by Bob Finkel in Steve's ability .If Elvis had not decided to live at the NBC Studio, during film, the sit down unplugged boxing ring sessions may never have happened. But once again Steve saw the opportunity to adapt the dressing room sessions into something so special, unrehearsed and spontaneous that it will remain an iconic part of Elvis history
The master stroke (among many) was the closing of the Show with ""If I Can Dream"".It is such a pity that Elvis never used this song again. Can you imagine this song as an occasional alternative to ""Can't Help Falling In Love"" throughout his latter live career.Anyone who is interested in Elvis will enjoy this documentary.",False
5,10,I cried through this whole Documentary.,paulolafsveen,n/a,16/08/2025,"The King.What could Have, and should have Been.Yes. I'm a huge Elvis fan, I've seen the recent movie Elvis, too many times to count. I've seen all his 60's movies, all his previous documentaries, and have read twenty five or so Elvis books.My point, Steve Binder was a God send for Elvis and his fans. The 68 special is an absolute must see for all music fans.What really hit me about this documentary was the love from Elvis fans, who were lucky enough to be in the audience.One woman, who was in her seventies now, talked about how it wasn't cool anymore in the late 60's to like Elvis. She sat ten feet from him and said she was overwhelmed and overcome with emotion.The love and breakthroughs in this special, If I Can Dream."" And the late 60's choreography is incredible.For Elvis's mom to say the colonel was the devil, is absolutely spot on. But to see it shared in a binder Doc is spellbinding.And the fact that the Colonel kept Binder away from Elvis is a crime. Right after the 68 special Elvis recorded some of his greatest hits, Burning Love, In the Ghetto and Suspicious Minds.Just imagine what Steve Binder and Elvis could have accomplished together. It staggers the mind, and hearts and souls, of all Elvis fans.Taken Care of Business Baby.",False
6,10,THE KING LIVES!! .... In This Stellar Documentary.,Movieboy62,n/a,16/08/2025,"So many wonderful ""Behind the Scenes"" testimonies make this well-polished documentary a true success and pleasure to watch. Lots of fun, little secrets from '68 are finally provided the spotlight in '23! BRAVO TO DIRECTOR STEVE BINDER, CAST, and CREW! The heartwarming care to the subject matter is truly a wonder to behold. During the Binder interview moments, I was stunned at how good the man looked, and decided to employ some simple math. This creative, cogent, gem of a man is age 90!! BRAVO, Mr. Binder. Your creative vision is quite spectacular! The tone of this work is beyond focused and accurate. I expect fans and Elvis' Spirit will be enthralled with this most impressive work.",False
7,8,"Average documentary, deserved more",wundaar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think my expectations were too high going in. I was born after Elvis died so this is only the second time I've seen him on the big screen (TTWII was the first which was incredible). If you're a big Elvis fan you won't learn anything new. The frustrating thing for me is that I took friends and Elvis' music wasn't featured as much as it should have been so a missed opportunity there. The documentary seemed a little disjointed in parts and oversimplified the movies era as being a write off and diminishing his creativity as an artist during this period which is wrong. He made some amazing music in the 60s. The visual quality was surprisingly fuzzy so no 4k. We get it with the Colonel already, we know he's evil. But he also did a lot for Elvis which included generating the comeback period starting with the How Great Thou Art sessions. Some of Elvis' best music comes after HGTA and before the special. The documentary also suggests that Elvis didn't do much after the special which was extremely frustrating as he accomplished so much after 1968 and most fans I know prefer the late 60s/ early 70s Elvis era as his voice entered the tenor range.",False

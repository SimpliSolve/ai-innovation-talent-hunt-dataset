And saddened.",pennymoser,n/a,15/08/2025,"Someone, some way, some how must sort out the health care inequities in this country.The featured people are gracious and enlightening. The filming of the countryside made me feel as if I were actually there.The questions asked and the answers given are succinct and most poignant. This clearly shows how all people are actually not created equal....some people did their very best and were left with little to nothing. The filmmaker beautifully and tragically nailed this long story with a short film.This should be required viewing for every member of Congress. Then, they should each have to take a quiz and write an essay.",False

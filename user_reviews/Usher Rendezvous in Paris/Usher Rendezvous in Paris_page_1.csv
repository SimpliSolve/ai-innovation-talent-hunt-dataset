1,9,Living Vicariously,twocents2,n/a,16/08/2025,"I walked into a crowd of thirty middle aged black women, so I am not the target audience. But hey, it was enjoyable and the price was right. This was filmed during Fashion Week. Usher had plenty of changes and really got around town, as his prerecorded segments showed. It was fun to see audience reactions as he approached or even when they sat far away. At one point, he was singing on a tiny pedestal less than a hundred square feet and I feared for his safety. I got a kick out of his dancers on roller skates doing loops around the stage. Obviously this was just for hardcore fans who have attended his concerts or have missed them for various reasons. His primary romantic interest was not as attractive as the others, so that was a turnoff. But I enjoyed going back in the time machine with his songs. It was only in theaters for four days, but should have a lengthy life on demand. He is certainly still in demand. We go to the movies primarily to be entertained, and this really does the job.",False

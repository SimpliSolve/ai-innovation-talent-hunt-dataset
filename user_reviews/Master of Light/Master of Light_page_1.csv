1,8,Not what I thought what it would be. And that's okay!,thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"Did you hear about the rose that grew
from the crack in the concrete?Proving nature's law is wrong it
learned to walk with out having feet.Funny it seems, but by keeping its dreams,
it learned to breathe fresh air.Long live the rose that grew from concrete
when no one else ever cared!Tupac ShakurThis is also George Anthony Morton. A man with his feet in two worlds, doing his best to help his family improve mentally - which he knows will take them even further when they are his age.He explained things in a simple calm way that needs to be presented to the world in forums where more people can not only hear it, but act upon it. Give this incredible man a TED Talk - it will be a gift to us all.Mr. Morton - Keep up your brilliant work on all levels and God's speed.",False
2,10,Directing Destiny,Znoodles,n/a,16/08/2025,"George Anthony Morton's story is not just the plot of painting his family members upon his release from prison.This film encompasses not only the 1980's crack epidemic, single parenting, siblings, addiction, jails and prisons, poverty, education, the unbalanced nature of Federal sentencing, the bail structure but most importantly how to take the next step towards a goal, how to direct a passion towards a positive result.He tells a therapist that ""Darkness is my friend"" and he also recognizes how many very famous artists are motivated by a similar force.I rated this documentary a 10 because ALL students of art should be familiarized with Mr Morton's journey to discover what could motivate the passions within themselves.Although Mr Morton focuses on elevating the African persons place in amazing and widely recognized art, I believe his raising up will elevate all persons who are dark skin toned.His nephew Treshon will have an enlightenment very few children are exposed to because his uncle has helped to clear his path. As we all could do more of for each other.",False
3,10,Inspiration isn't enough to describe,pbnvvyjgqs,n/a,16/08/2025,George Anthony Martin was born to be an artist and painter of light. His journey is unique he is a pioneer and his specific mission and what he is trying to accomplish. I will support such endeavors in this 21st-century. Because it is so rare to stumble across a human being like this that represents a hero to humanity.I often wonder why some people have more stronger Will than most humans? How are people able to overcome such adversity? Is he just special or do we all have the same strength inside of us? Is it God in us? Is it purpose? This movie had me questioning so many things about life in general. This man has an amazing Story to share with the world. This needs to be shared with the world.,False
4,3,"Interesting, but lacking",remcdowell-69691,n/a,16/08/2025,"An interesting look at a very talented artist. I did find myself wanting a lot more attention to the art itself, and less on the ""new thought"" counseling psychobabel that is so in vogue nowadays. There is obvious brilliance here, in part growing out of the turmoil of his childhood, but which wasn't fully explored in the documentary. We do get a fairly intimate look into the troubled relationship between the artist and his mother. The interpersonal family discord is interspersed with scenes of counseling sessions with the artist's psychologist which seem oddly personal. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about the documentary was that there was so little attention on the art itself even though it is the art that seems to give the artist his purpose and drive. In the end we never get to see the finished products of the portraits of his family, leaving us feeling somewhat unfulfilled in watching a film about portraits.In general, I would have preferred less new age psychoanalysis, more focus on the art and artist.",False

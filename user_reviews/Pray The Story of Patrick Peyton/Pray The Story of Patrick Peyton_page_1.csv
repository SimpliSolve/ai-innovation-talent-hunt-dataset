1,10,Watch and be INSPIRED,tannerkalina,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this film with a group of college students, and we left the screening blown away that we have never heard of Father Peyton. We were all inspired to truly dive into the rosary and trust that our Blessed Mother is looking out for us!",False
2,10,Brilliant -EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH!,siobhanfallonh,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a brilliant documentary. Every couple should watch this film as a prerequisite for getting married. It is a masterpiece with a very important message, which will make life so much easier if you simply listen to the message of Father Patrick Peyton. The documentary is produced with superb quality. The interviews, clips of Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Lucille Ball and the music bring Father Peyton's simple message to a worldwide audience.Everyone should watch this film! I immediately contacted my friends & family to say -make it a priority to watch as your life will improve after viewing!!",False

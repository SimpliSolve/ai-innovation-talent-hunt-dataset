1,1,Way to suck a sex trafficker off,bricewhelan,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is literally just 43 minutes of them glossing over a few of his controversies while painting him as a revolutionary icon. There's 3 minutes right at the end which is a quick rush of all the recent stuff we heard in media and its all alleged and claims in terms of his actions, no mention of all the evidence or any real details of his worse crimes. They don't even mention all the dildos and lube. Anyone who wanted to learn anything more than surface knowledge should not watch this as it is trying to cover up or underplay a lot of his more heinous crimes. It's a waste of your money and just straight up evil how it tries to defend and praise a criminal while pretending to be unbiased. This is either a ploy for Diddy to get out or made by paedophiles aka his friends.",False
2,1,This was the worst documentary I have ever watched,leonmcgivern,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBasically there is 45 minutes of a cheap voiceover with some free clips - for 10 mins of the movie it is an advert of his water Company. They cram in all the allegations in the last 4 minutes the rest of it is the achievements. There are multiple irrelevant clips. Quite literally gifs in the film if the mention ""sharing love"" there world be a free clip of somebody making a heart shape with there hands. The only clips of Diddy are him smiling or promoting his brand. It looks like one of those top ten videos on YouTube from 2019 and looks like you could have made this in CapCut easily and looks like it was strung together in iMovie. DO NOT BUY THIS.",True
3,1,Absolute rubbish. Surface coverage of his life.,jasminesarahashley,n/a,16/08/2025,The whole thing is a surface level covering of his life and career. Feels like a c grade - high school essay is the script (potentially written by chatgpt) and seems to celebrate his success and highlight what gpod he has done in the community without any solid numbers or references. It also shows how everything was a business venture for him and doesnt give any analysis or observation on what these achievements were forming by way of connections of contacts. It doesnt even cover this in the commentary. It doesnt form a structure that would make any of it relevant to recent events. Dont waste your time. I had it on in the background while cleanong - I got to 6 min left and realised it is just waffle with a bunch of videos of the guy.,False
4,1,A glorified documentary of a sex trafficker,ashjharriman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasted money on this and for what, I watched 40 minutes of all these great things he did over his life, (most of it skipped through when I realised it was all about tooting his horn rather than the truth of what has been going on) to then spend 2.5 minutes being told what has been currently happening. TWO AND A HALF MINUTES!! Summit to plummet what a load of!!! This video is just to give him glory for everything and totally ignores the terrible things he's done, I can tell you if this was a video of Jeffrey Epstein it would have been totally different. Not sure where why or how someone thinks this is okay to make despite everything he's done. Absolutely appalled.",False
5,1,Terrible!,d-molden88,n/a,16/08/2025,"I dont even know what to say abou this documentary, it was terrible.40 minutes of what an amazing man diddy is and how much he has done for his community, for 3 minutes and 52 seconds of his horrendous crimes....this documentary is an insult to every one of his victims.I can't tell you the amount of times I rolled my eyes at the sheer absurdity of it all.Anything he did for his community was only done as a means to ease his darkened soul and balance out his wrongdoing.I would urge anyone thinking of watching this to just not do it, you will come out enraged by what you have just witnessed.",False
6,1,Can't rate it low enough,stuartwalker-33436,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolute tosh, I am now beginning to think this was put out here to get public interest in Diddy and support him.I thought it was a two episode job as by 42 mins they still hadn't talked about any negativity.The director should be ashamed, the narrator should be ashamed, the writer should be ashamed.The whole documentary is a bad timeline of his career with more time spent talking about Tupac and Notorious BIG.Please do not watch it realistically should be removed from Amazon Prime and any other streaming service and listed as Pdiddy propaganda.Not much else to say other than just ignore and move on.",False
7,1,Do not waste your life,sophloucrawford,n/a,16/08/2025,"Leaving the moral question aside, this documentary jumped all over the place, there was no chronological order, it covered bad boy entertainment and then about 10 mins late reintroduced bad boy entertainment. It spoke about Biggies death and then 2 minutes later covered the start of his journey, the whole thing made no sense, It felt like a really poor AI tool created this with the terrible voiceover that seemed to repeat ""however"" and ""notably"" like the only language it had available and the footage was literally the same clips on repeat! I feel like I have been robbed of time and recommended to everyone - DO NOT WATCH.",False
8,1,Imbd account created: Dont rob yourself of 44minutes,j-benjamin,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary was so scathingly ðŸ’© I can't believe we even committed to hearing this partially literate narrator shame himself in Diddys alley. I was hoping for a short sensationalistic takedown. Angelica Butcher? What an embarrassment. The timeline is a scatter gun of Diddys ðŸ’¦ Laughable attempt to polish his rim. This is hands down the biggest ðŸ’© I have watched in a decade. Why would you even commit to being part of this debacle? The documentary's title is offensively deceptive. It couldn't even paint the influential parts of Diddys life with any meaningful credibility. Disgraceful. Distasteful. Don't watch.,False
9,1,Did Diddy write this documentary!?,najadomino,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not gonna hide this under a spoiler because nobody should see this """"documentary.""""50% = Tupac and Biggies backstory (for some reason)
45% = all the great things Diddy has done
5% = all the bad things Diddy has doneYou see the problem?! This is BARELY a Diddy documentary. It spends WAY too much time YAPPING about unrelated people, as if they are too scared to talk about Diddy himself. Why even make a Diddy documentary if you're just gonna talk about other rappers?And don't even get me started on the lack of coverage for the various crimes he's done... It's really like Diddy made this. At the VERY END of the show, it discusses Diddy's domestic abuse allegations and crimes. Despite committing a TON of various illegals acts, they only dedicated around 5 minutes to covering it. They didn't even mention the baby oil!!!",False
10,1,43 minutes of Fan Girling Diddy,dannielle_k,n/a,16/08/2025,"I created an account specifically to review this because i'm so annoyed I watched it and I don't know why Amazon are even showing it.Essentially it's click bait; it's 43minutes of coverage on how much the makers clearly worship Diddy. Tonnes of coverage of how much he's achieved and painfully long clips of him waffling at public events. Too much detail on irrelevant events, and then doesn't mention other considerable events.There's a teeny bit at the end that covers the huge amount of abhorrent crimes he's been accused of, that give off a 'they're only allegations, and there's loads of them, but oh well'It's disturbing biased, and should probably be called, I heart Diddy.",False
11,1,Absolute slop,rahunt-89517,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA script that consists of paragraphs ripped straight from various press releases from Diddy's own businesses or articles written about them, most likely written by AI. This is played over B-Roll that barely lines up with what is being spoken about, intercut with archival interviews with the man himself or people singing his praises.The illegal activities of Diddy come up with 3 minutes left of the sub-1hour runtime. This too is just a list of the allegations over barely connected B-roll but this time with no interviews intercut.Poorly made rubbish looking to capitalise on the interest in the case before the HBO doc comes out.Save your time and don't watch.",True
12,1,Glorifying a predator. WTF?,alh44,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why on earth this is entitled Summit to Plummet. I do not understand. The entire show is about the supposed summit until the last three minutes. It actually paints Diddy to be some kind of hero and philanthropist. Very disappointing and actually shameful that somebody produced this. I wonder if he paid for it himself?Watching all of the clips of Diddy being Mr. Nice Guy was not when I tuned in for. Like most people, I wanted to hear about the current allegations and what's happening with the case today. Not the history of Tupac and biggie in the 1990s. I would give this zero stars if I could!!",False

1,9,Love it!,mdn1023,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this show!I enjoy watching Nate and Jeremiah walk through the process from their first meeting with the homeowners through to the completed project.Nate & Jeremiah seem truly interested in getting to know the families to determine their style and what's important to them so they can guide them. They are respectful of the items that may have sentimental value and help the owners select what should remain in what will become the new space vs. Letting go.The family scenes with their children are so sweet. I had never seen Jeremiah before watching the show, but he seems so genuine and I adore him and his sense of humor.",False
2,10,Elegant,scottichawluk,n/a,16/08/2025,"The premise of keeping items and integrating them into the design is exactly what we should all be doing with the things we love. Nate has a keen eye for classic, elegant, gorgeous interiors. Another reviewer commented that Nate states things are ""handsome"" too frequently. But those items usually are quite handsome/classic...so he's not talking out of his backside. Jeremiah adds more whimsy and a younger flair. Plus he has great hair! Their children are darling but I'd like to see less of them. Too many shows are bringing on the children and honestly it's really none of our business and feels forced and staged.",False
3,4,Where are these guys from?,DingelBerry,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all, what really bothers me is that the top guy Nate says ""OH MY GOD THIS IS HANDSOME "" referring to a piece of wood!!! Everything is 'handsome' to this guy! It irritates me to no end, NO ONE talks like that!The bottom guy I think that's Jeremiah is always crying and being melodramatic about his clients personal ugly furnishings, gimme a break.",False
4,3,Same old same old,GNickL,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sad to see that in 2023, HGTV is giving these two dullards another series. Why? Didn't the last one suck enough?Why does HGTV have to make every show about a couple? Don't care if they're gay, straight, related, or whatever...I DON'T CARE! They're boring no matter what they are despite their emotional acting.Nothing new here people. Turn away. Nothing to be seen. Clueless as to why these two deeply narcissistic, rather awkward, boring people appeal to anyone. Who are they and why do we care? More people who are famous for being famous because a TV network told us they are famous. This show also perpetuates the very tired HGTV formula of throwing together random scenes of nearly pointless yak yak and forced, acted emo. We get short snippets of the two pretending to actually be doing something while we know that soon as the cameras stop rolling, they're outta there.",False
5,2,Boring couple bad designs,slyfox-40032,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNate and his husband are 2 soft spoken.dull people no energy .no excitement , lifeless show about buying WAY overpriced furniture and expensive paint to redo a homeowners home..one episode they had a damn.lamp that cost couple thousand dollars and took.them.forever to decide what angel it should e and if they should add something to the wall...you spend more tham.100 dollars on a lamp I'll personally scream until I'm blue. Open kitchen shelves hate..mirrored backslash. Tacky..if each item.isnt expensive then they feel it's not good..one show 6,000 $ for a kitchen.table with hideous chairs..terrible designs.homeowners put up a great face. Probably had it changed and sold off the high priced ugly furniutre.",True
6,1,They killed a Batchelder fireplace,dianapettit,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAll the white, grey, beige anyone could want. Bland as can be is bad enough, but tonight they showed us a Batchelder fireplace tile they will rip out and replace with tacky marble. I can't watch. Clients with bad taste is one thing, but so called decorators with bad taste is even more painful. Next they will be painting the original woodwork (in great condition) white, or beige. If they can't appreciate the architectual details and all they want to do is make it a bland box you can find anywhere, they shouldn't be allowed to touch it. The superior attitude about how stylish they are, is just the final nail in the coffin. Save your time, this is one hour you will never get back.",True

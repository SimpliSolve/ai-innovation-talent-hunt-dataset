1,9,Interesting and more Barry than expected,PDT816,n/a,16/08/2025,"Barry in his own words. It's a great look into the greatest that ever played covering his career to his family relationships. I think a lot of people who have been Barry fans since his days at Oklahoma State will particularly enjoy the relationship aspects between Barry and his father.It's an NFL production, so there's the expected highlight moments throughout the film to relive or be introduced to his greatness. There's plenty of interviews from people who were questionable choices, but the comments from Barry's teammates and others make up for it.Several in our household that aren't football fans enjoyed it as well.",False
2,9,Great film for football lovers,TheNamelessCzar,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a diehard NFL fan, I watch every game on TV, and I grew up in the golden era of running backs with Emmitt Smith and Barry Sanders. I've always considered Sanders the best running back in NFL history. I HATED the fact that he retired early and always questioned why. I had heard rumors, and this movie basically verified them. The reveal was not revolutionary but did clean some things up. The true reason to watch the film is to revive the feeling I had when I watched Sanders in the first place. His brilliance on the field is and always will be unmatched. He could make a 1-yard loss look like the best play ever. A very good movie for football fans to savor.",False
3,8,Retired in his prime?,jmy-34320,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a pretty good documentary and it's great to hear directly from the man himself about why he retired and why he did it the way he did.One of the only things that bothered me is how they kept speaking as if he had many good years left to play at that level, but he was 31 when he retired. Anybody who knows anything about professional football knows that a running back who turns 31 is nearing the end of his career. This is especially true of quick, shifty guys like Barry Sanders.Do I know that he wouldn't have been the exception to the rule, able to keep taking rushing titles after his 35th birthday? Of course not, he was a tremendous athlete. We can never know.It was still a very enjoyable documentary, and is a must-see for any fans of Barry Sanders, the Lions, and the NFL.",False
4,10,A beautiful story about football and life,caseywhawk,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI've seen comments that Barry still hasn't answered the ""why"" question. I strongly disagree. He lost many of his friends/teammates to free agency over a small amount of time. He has a close relationship with his first coach, who was replaced. The new offense was not the best scheme for him. Two players were injured the same season with spinal cord injuries and one never walked again. For most of his last year he felt it was his last and in the last game, they were beat down and I'm sure he saw little promise of any change. He said his heart wasn't in it and that season did nothing to change it, it sounds like it made it worse. Although Barry didn't end up having any daughters I heard he once commented that if he could play 10 years and be healthy where he could walk a daughter down an aisle, he'd retire. Who can argue that playing a few more years to be injured and suffering the rest of your life is worth it? Also with what we know about concussions and CTE, he probably dodged a bullet.I think what matters most is that he is a good person, a role model for kids, and didn't let fame change who he is. You can see his dad was his voice and was a great man. I think there's a lot of wisdom to gain from the documentary and it's one of the best I've ever seen. It's not just about football, it's about life. My favorite thing his dad said was he'd like all of his sons to have 2-3 kids because it makes a man whole. As a father I couldn't agree more.",True
5,10,Superb,legendarymrf,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, just wow, if you are a fan of Barry watch this, if you are a lover of life watch this. This is a tale of a real human being that lived life true to himself. Beautifully made with heart and soul, just like the film's subject Barry Sanders. I am really moved and growing up watching him play was a privilege, watching this documentary reminded me of that privilege. Thank you Barry Sanders for all you have given to the sport and the world. I don't want to provide any spoilers, I just want you to discover for yourself what this documentary will provide as a discovery of the man behind the yards he ran during his time in the NFL.",False
6,7,Ignore the incels commenting. A character documentary explaining the man & not so much the motives,Ezknickels,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think alot of angry ppl with political agendas is wanted this film to be more what THEY wanyed it to be. An APOLOGY of sorts, (for the nothing they contributed to a sports legends career) This movie is handled in that vein at all. Think of it more as an episode of ""30 for 30"" that plays more on the nostalgic side of the mans career, and focuses more on the context clues of his life and personality as an explanation for his words early departure. People writing short sided crap like ""they didn't explain"" are simply ppl being dense at the docs main focal point, that Barry was both an introvert, and incredibly pragmatic person. It shows how He didn't EVER at any point strive for a bigger contract, media attention or personal accolades. An honest to god ""shut up and play"" kinda of player. Someone you'd THINK would be an appeasing subject for ALL the cry babies whining about Jemele Hill's (a Longtime respected sports journalist who they are not) presence in the film. (Literally you can tell when your reading a trump supporters review and theyre whining over someone's presence, thats what it is) Get over it guys.Anyways, the doc shows you a prospective from a insider view into Barrys life, through his now semi grown young adult children. All in there from 20 to mid teens, (in other words, his accomplishments since retiring) and lets them olay interviewer for a segment at one particularly engaging part of the film. As one of his youngest, points out that it was in fact ""THE LOSING"" that would logically be the biggest reason for his early departure. But its biggest reveals to that lie in the films details. As far as ACTUALLY getting definitive answer from Barry on this. Not so much. The films as a whole is done well, with a proper amount of nostalgia & sensitivity Youve come to expect from other sports docs as the before mention 30 for30 series, & Barry himself is definitely a one of a kind personality who's career finally gets a better chance at reflection & humble introspection from Sanders himself. It shows you ALL the reasons why after painting the picture of a humble kid who loved his teammates, loved the sport but not the attention, as well as the looming issues with health risk from the sport . And how much THOSE things changing had impact on his will to remain. Some people who are selfish, and ignoring those things, would call Barry selfish. The reality is, FANS wanted him to stay and break those records FOR THEM as well as him. Barry only wanted greatness with the ppl he came in with. Detroit neglected this. Once those core ppl left, he no longer had a reason to stay. I think he was if anything a tragically UNSELFISH guy. An athlete oblivious to his own abilities and we at some point ALMOST get to that ""elixir""of regret from a man who seems to kindve wanted a different outcome. But with Barry, we see more retrospective to his career and success withon his family life. Its sad and beautifully done. By the end, We dont need a billion whys anymore as its easy to empathize with just wanting nothing but a good life. This is all i took away anyhow. You be the judge.",True
7,10,The Mystery of Barry Sanders,zkonedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBarry Sanders has long been one of the most enigmatic figures in NFL history. After a decade of being one of the all-time great running backs, he up and vanished (retired) while still at his peak with no explanation given as to why. In Bye Bye Barry, the filmmakers examine Barry's life and personality in greater detail to try and understand his decision-making process.The reason Bye Bye Barry is such a masterpiece documentary is because it is essentially two things in one 90-minute runtime:First, it is a nostalgic look back at an iconic football talent. All the clips of Sanders making defenders look foolish trying to tackle him are incredible to behold and often narrated by the likes of Madden and Summerall or other great NFL voices. It all adds up to a reminder of Barry's utter greatness and how clearly he was one of the best to ever ply the RB trade.Secondly, this doc is a really effective character study of Barry Sanders the individual. In a sport where ego and bravado often define the great talents, Sanders was the polar opposite. He cared little (actively rejected, in fact) the trappings of fame that came with NFL superstardom. He never celebrated on the field and hardly showed so much as a glint of emotion. As the filmmakers say here, he 100% let his play do his talking for him--and it largely was enough.For a little while after watching, I didn't have Bye Bye Barry at 10/10 stars. The reason? Because as a viewer, you'll be waiting for that crack of emotion from Barry--and it simply never comes. This might leave you feeling a little disappointed. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized it was perfect--because that's just Barry. He has such a conviction towards his ideals that he simply will not break just for the cameras. Not an approach that can (or maybe even should) be taken by everyone, but admirable in its earnestness.Add all that up and this Amazon product is top-level documentary work. You may still not understand exactly why Barry rode off into the sunset so early, but you'll clearly understand that for those who knew him it was no surprise. Just ""Barry being Barry"".",True
8,7,A Solid Documentary,mchl88,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a Cowboys fan, the whole Barry vs Emmitt thing was prevalent throughout the nineties (in between counting championships of course). I always thought of Emmitt as a reliable .300 singles and doubles hitter while Barry was the home run hitter (who also struck out a ton). And for a time there was a clear question of who would finish their career with more rushing yards.And then, one day, poof, Barry was gone.This documentary calls it the greatest mystery in sports history and I can't argue with that. Most athletes stay in the game way too long. Barry, for some reason, stepped away at the near height of his talents. And while I enjoyed this documentary, it fails to solve that mystery. Sanders never really explains why he walked away from the game that he dominated so well. Was it the devastating injuries to some of his teammates? The Lions ineptitude? Who knows. Maybe, not even Barry Sanders himself.",False
9,10,and on the 8th day....,BetterDeadThanRed,n/a,16/08/2025,"God created football....
And in His thundering voice God said: 'Let us watch ...and let us perfect it!'
So they worked with it, perfecting it, Adam giving names to the various positions and teams, coming up with playbooks until it was all ready...
...and then He made Barry Sanders, for man to sit back with Him on His day of rest, drinking a few cold ones ...and He saw it was good.(aaan Then Satan went and bought the Detroit Lions like the prick (in the finger) that he can be, and we all know what's happened since... )
BUT along that journey... before the new JOB finally had enough...
Barry Sanders was possibly the best RB who ever played the game. At least within my lifetime he was as good as Walter Peyton.I hear that Jim Brown was outstanding but he was before my time but I have seen some terrific RB's throughout the past 52 years.I was a senior in high school when Barry Sanders was a rookie in Detroit.I watched him make all of the best defensive players of the day miss him, repeatedly; names such as Lawrence Taylor and Reggie White included.I watched him disappear under a sea of his opponents uniforms just to watch him reappear and take off running for an additional 60 yards on his way into the end-zone.....and I seen that happen numerous times.To put things into perspective; Lawrence Taylor was the best defensive player to ever play in the NFL ...hands-down.Barry was his offensive equivalent meaning that coaches would set their entire game-plan around those two players.Barry was the Tom Brady of Running Backs, the L. T., the Jerry Rice.A once in a lifetime if not a 'once ever' type of player considering his play, his class, and his affect on Lions fans who deserved that breath of fresh air after all of the seasons that they were terrible with no light at the end of the tunnel in sight.I would have loved to have seen him in his prime w/ Megatron at his prime along with the 2023 Lions as they would have been unstoppable.As a NY Giants fan myself I would always worry when we would play the Lions, and the Lions more or less sucked (especially after they got rid of Fontanes and numerous players that were core players) but whenever Barry Sanders was on the field they were always a risk to taking the win.Barry got to the point he had enough I believe as Barry was all about his team winning and the Lions just weren't helping to make that happen.That I blame on the Ford family owners.Today it's almost unheard of to see a RB play into his thirties. Not so back then as he was considered being in his prime.Also, today due to so many rule changes to the piont that nowadays it's closer to flag football instead of ACTUAL football.Those rule changes also made it so it's a pass heavy game where teams run to keep defenses honest. The complete opposite as it was back then, and there was no running back by committee like today either!In Barry's time it was a big deal for a RB to hit 1000 rushing yards on the year (fewer games too) but Barry Sanders went over 2000 yards one year and if they counted the yards he ran going east to west and back again (trying to not get tackled) instead of north-south he'd would have had 5000 yards likely as On any given play Barry would run 60 yards back and forth just to gain 4 yards, and he did it ALL the time!Likely because his offensive line sucked (the 2023 NY GIants O-line is similar if that helps to understand just how bad it was).Barry Sanders could have beaten Walter Peyton's all time rushing record too, but that record meant nothing to Barry so he didn't go back into the game to do it.Nobody understood but that was just Barry Sanders. He was about the team winning and not personal rewards.'HAVING CLASS' is what it's called.Barry was also a true professional both on and off the field.When he scored he acted as if he seen the end zone before, refusing to insult the integrity of the game or his own reputation like some of these clowns today who feel the need to put on a Broadway play whenever they score.It is unprofessional and is terrible for kids to see as it teaches poor sportsmanship.Gloating was something that punks did, not professionals.When Barry would score? He'd simply hand the ball to the referee or toss it to him.He acted as if he'd seen an end-zone before and would again.It didn't matter if they were winning by 30 points or just won in overtime. Barry would show true class when he scored.'Humility' and 'Humbleness' ....two actions that the present generation of NFL players should learn.If they wanted to be cheerleaders they should have put a cheerleader skirt on (or whatever they wear) instead of a helmet.This is a must see movie for all football players and fans of the NFL.If you watched him back then it's good to see it again as there was a lot I forgot about.If you weren't there back then it is a ABSOLUTE must to watch and I promise you that you won't look at these current players the way you did before watching Barry Sanders as most today aren't anywhere near the same league as Barry Sanders.There is so much that can be learned, and how this man played should never be forgotten.I have seen some outstanding running backs in my lifetime. Some of the best to ever have played the game... but there is only one Barry Sanders.",False
10,10,Inspiring,kateAraya715,n/a,16/08/2025,If you are someone with any sense of empathy or care enough about respecting the sensibilities of others you will walk away with 2 things. One is understanding of why Mr. Sanders retired and respect for his reason. You will also get to know a bit about who he is and he is one of very few people in the world of fame that has known exactly who he was from a very early age - and honored it. He didn't try to become what is expected he didn't play football for the accolades. He remained true to himself throughout his career and personal life and so stayed a solid and good man. Anyone who watches this and gives it a low rating because they feel he didn't give the answer they wanted - they were not listening and are likely surrounded by people that feel they aren't being heard too.Learning who Barry Sanders is as a human being is inspiring and a blessing. Excellent movie hearing from different perspectives and his Dad - wow. Just good stuff. Bravo William - you raised a real standup man. God bless them all.,False
11,10,Executed Perfectly!! Everything flowed for great entertainment!,tarawieland-45562,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow! This was an amazing movie! I was glued to the TV with this presentation. I was thinking how entertaining can football clips be, but the directors executed everything perfectly from the story line to the music to the message we left with! You will not be disappointed even if you're not a football fan. The same message applied to so much in life! I cannot wait to watch this again with my boys! Barry was a class act and it's displayed well throughout the storyline. He's such a humble man...thank you for being so much to the hand of football and for setting a great example for the next generation.",False
12,8,THE MOST IMPORTANT THING....,getnoldfast,n/a,16/08/2025,"Been an NFL since the Buccaneers came into the league in 1976. Barry was always the one guy the Bucs hated playing knowing that the Bucs were terrible at that time and in the same division, but that Barry was going to bring it each and every game.I'm glad he finally came out and made peace with a lot of his fans and the NFL community as a whole. A person knows deep inside when it's time to move on, regardless of their profession.I do have two items I'd like to point out. First, I don't agree with this show using that race hustler, Jamele Hill. Of all the out of touch people out there they could have picked, she is at the bottom of my list.However, on a good note, Barry and his wife, Lauren, appeared to have raised four outstanding young men who just happen to be good looking too. Overall, football is exciting and fun to watch, but the end game is that these four young men that will be leaders in our future. Bravo Mr. And Mrs. Sanders!",False
13,10,A proper goodbye to a legendary figure,horizonsurf,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have always been a Barry Sanders fan, and one of the few who understood when he walked away from the game when he did. We have become so custom in our society to big egos among great athletes, propelling them to hang on in a sport that they no longer have the skills to compete in, getting by on name alone. Not Barry, not for one second! The phrase ""lightning in a bottle"" is often used to describe the tremendous amount of power and energy in a small package of time or mass... Barry Sanders was an entire global storm measuring 5'8""! His highlights are just as eye popping now, as they were then- he's a truly amazing bad ass, a man among men for all time. There will never be another Barry Sanders, what a great father, what a great story how he was his father's son. I forgot how fun the NFL used to be, thank you for everything Barry, most of all for being Barry Sanders every step of the way.",False
14,9,Great movie!,magpie1717,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great movie. I only gave it a 9 (instead of 10) because that garbage J. Hill is so prominent in the movie. Otherwise, fantastic. I grew up during this time and have always been a huge football fan. Even though I am a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan and Emmett was our guy when Sanders was playing, I have always respected Barry Sanders for his abilities and what he was able to accomplish. Although I, along with so many others at the time, could not understand why he walked away when he did, I now understand so much more and have such a great respect for him. He was an amazing athlete and is a very humble man.",False
15,8,Well done,kwilson-40888,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought this was well put together. I enjoyed the footage of Barry Sanders playing and the interviews of people who knew him, played with him, and people that lived in Detroit.Barry Sanders is a man and a talented professional athlete. He is not a God. He owed the team 100% when he was playing. He owed the coaches and management 100% as an employee of a company. That's all he owed anyone.People seemed bothered that he was not an attention seeking self-absorbed media hound. They seem betrayed by him, that he stabbed them in the back, by not making a huge publicity extravaganza spectacle when he retired. It's none of their business. Stop worshipping athletes and celebrities. They're just people and they don't owe you anything except effort on the field.",False
16,1,Don't waste your time.,deepee-28069,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerBarry does not explain why he actually retired so what was the point of this? Barry obviously did this for the cash. Jemele Hill is terrible and adds nothing to anything she talks about! Eminem is a talentless pottymouth who also added nothing! Yes, Barry Sanders was fantastic on the field but Barry Sanders might actually not be the sharpest knife in the drawer as they say. It's nice that he wasn't a selfish athlete at the time I guess. There was just a lot of boring commentary from a bunch of Ex-Lions. I don't write many reviews but I felt compelled to write this one. Don't waste your time with this!",True
17,10,Role Model,coryd-13770,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing movie, the juice d nobody with all the guitars kinda ruined it though. Outside of that I couldn't have more respect for Mr. Sanders, he knew he was great and didn't need numbers or records to prove it. Wasawesome seeing Rodney Peete, Jemele Hill was fun to listen to, he just chewed up yards like I'm chewing up words, apparently have q50 to go. Lions whew, I do remember the great Herman Moore, and I was just a kid, probably liked him better than Barry, Kramer was a highly underrated QB. Motor City Madhouse, I'm just typing what I see now to fill the characters. Barry was really looking forward to playing the Skins.",False
18,10,A great documentary about one of the top 3 running backs in NFL history.,mhorg2018,n/a,16/08/2025,"So who are my top 3? 1-Walter Payton. 2-Barry Sanders. 3-Earl Campbell. What do the three have in common? The franchises they played for squandered their greatness with poor drafting and bad coaching. I watched Barry from his first year in the NFL, absolutely amazed at how great he was. Eminem and others were correct; we'll never see another like Barry. He was truly the epitome of humility. He might have played that tenth season, but playing for such a bad franchise wore him down. Who can blame him? Watching the plays, many of which I recall seeing-were absolutely amazing. But I have to admit, his father was a terrible, mean-spirited person. How that man could believe he was better than Barry... I didn't see him in the NFL and playing sandlot football doesn't make one great except in the neighborhood. Like the entire NFL world, I was shocked and dismayed when Barry left. But, he left his mark on the NFL and I'll always remember him for being one of the greats and a humble man. The NFL has been graced with many great players, and Barry is at the top of that list.",False
19,10,"This is film is about moving on, and sometimes it hurts",YourCommitmentToSparkleMotion,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLook, I don't even watch football. I have no team to root for, no real attachment in any way whatsoever ,but I can tell you one thing: this film hit me right in the gut.So if you're a fan of football, imagine someone who isn't familiar with football witness a football player completely obliterate and outwit literally every other football player in his path. And that's just the football side of it. XD he was a human brick wall.Then you have Barry the guy, who basically just shrugs his shoulders and smiles.. like ""who me?""And then there's everyone else back in nineteen ninety whatever like ""wtf just happened to us?""
All those poor lions fans. I felt genuinely depressed they never won when I was watching this. You know it's coming, but you're never truly prepared. It can be juuust a bit uncomfortable and hard to sit through.Barry being Barry is most exemplified with his kids. Just being a dad all casual like and straight faced, like ""yeah I was just done with it lol"". I've never witnessed anything quite like this documentary in my entire life.It just hits different. Those vintage play by play calls combined with Barry's unreal athleticism is truly something that everyone should experience. As a hardcore baseball fan, It kind of makes me wish I had a football team growing up.That is to say that this doc evokes a sort of nostalgia, and when it's over, you do feel empty. Like that's it, the story is over.You're so invested in this great football player, raised by good parents and coming from a good family.You watch him prove over and over throughout his life what his values were, his convictions.But then you're surprised when he decides to hang it up.Hey, it shocked me to my core and made me realize to everything there is a season, and a time and purpose under heaven.For the people who got to witness it first hand, God bless you. I can only imagine what that would be like.I was ok with what he did and how he said it because it felt true to who he always was from a young age. Like another reviewer pointed out, it seemed like he didn't show a single ounce of emotion his entire life basically. So this was no different. He just decided to bounce, and... well... that's all, folks!With that I'll just close this out by saying it's amazing what kind of legacy someone can leave behind in only 10 years; but a mere blip in time.For that I'll always have fond memories, a non football guy I might add - of the life and times of the great, the mysterious, the football running back superior, in london no longer here with ya, the one, the only, Barry sanders ladies and gentlemen give it up for him... 👏",True

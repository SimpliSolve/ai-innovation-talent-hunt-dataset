1,9,Mind blowing,gazmar62,n/a,16/08/2025,"The 'making of' a Nolan film is always going to be interesting but here it's as mind blowing as the film itself, so much effort goes into making it real , and in camera , it's awesome stuff. There's a new appreciation of the film when you know how hard it was making it, so many people working to their best capabilities, pushing the boundaries of their knowledge and skill , so many things that have never been done before, it's incredible. There are scenes in the film where I thought argh, they are stretching reality too far here, that's not possible and then when you see how it was made and that it was real it fills you with awe. I was lucky enough to see Tenet at the cinema 5 times and it isn't just a movie that you watch , it is a movie that you experience, I hope we get more great cinema experiences from the genius of Christopher Nolan and the amazing people he brings together for his movies.",False

1,8,Very satisfying,cockezville,n/a,16/08/2025,"I discovered Anne Murray in 1970 after hearing her singing ""Snowbird"" and became an instant fan. I stayed a fan until she retired- also saw her in concerts.This documentary is really made for her fans because she has been very open about her life and most of us know the information provided but it is a nice documentary about how she sacrificed a lot for the sake of her career and the regrets she has in spite of her gratefulness. It is not a tell all and she is very respectful of her team and her ex- husband who is shown to be a good man. It is produced well with great footage that I have never seen.I would have liked to hear more about specific albums with her other producers, and her split with Brian Ahern in favor of Tom Catalono in production duties. She departed with Ahern after one of her best albums, Highly Prized Possession. And did Capitol regret parting with her after she had a top ten country hit,""Feed the Fire""
And there was some family stuff not mentioned like her parents death and her daughter's eating disorder struggles, or the death of Dianne Brooks one of her backup singers.But all in all it was a very satisfying documentary.",False
2,10,Beautiful,mweratcliffe,n/a,16/08/2025,I'd always loved Anne Murray's voice and when I'm alone just doing things throughout the day by myself - Snowbird always pops up - what I didn't know until I watched this biography was just how many moments in my life were underscored by one of her many ballads. I'm also a big fan of Karen Carpenter and Doris Day who I believe bring the same qualities to their music. I think what comes through in Anne's voice is all the honest love we wish we could give - and receive (the tough part) - everyday with everyone one in every exchange - big or small. Simple grace. Honestly just a delightful show. Thanks to all involved.,False

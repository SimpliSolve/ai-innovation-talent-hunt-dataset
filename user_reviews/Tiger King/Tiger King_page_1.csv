1,8,This is quality documentary-making,OCarlisle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Filmed over the course of several years by clearly passionate and committed filmmakers, this superb series takes many gripping twists and turns. I watched for seven hours straight, only breaking to Google every now and then.Although it's about the exotic animal business in the USA, it actually has multiple layers of interwoven themes.Populated by flawed humans interacting with magnificent animals, nobody is presented as a pure goodie or a baddie - every real-life character has elements of both, presented in such an insightful way that you'll find your opinions and loyalties shifting as you get carried along on this interesting journey.Perfectly paced, great soundtrack, interesting bonus to have the main protagonist's ""own"" music featured. I finished this feeling educated and entertained, sad and conflicted, curious and fascinated.It's a highly recommended experience.",False
2,8,Only in America,ileon68,n/a,16/08/2025,Bunch of low lifes keeping big cats. Unbelievable but very entertaining.,False
3,6,The weirdness of the characters and events is entertaining at first...,hoever-51744,n/a,16/08/2025,"...but soon wears off. To be honest after a while I just continued to watch it because I wanted to see how it ends, it wasn't really that entertaining anymore. What also leaves a somewhat sour taste in my mouth is that a large part of the appeal of the series is based on the fact that you don't really know how much of what is being said by the different characters is true or not, and then when you dig a little bit deeper you also start to wonder where and when the filmmakers are maybe not telling the whole story anymore. In my opinion definitely not worth to be called a documentary. Still, as mentioned in the beginning, it's difficult to stop watching once you started, in that regard it is much like a bag of chips: the first couple of hands you grab seem to be delicious, after a while you are not continuing because it tastes good but because it's just the right combination of fat, carbs and salt to please a prehistoric part of your brain, and after you finished emptying the whole bag, you pretty quickly realize that the whole experience just wasn't worth it.",False
4,10,Trainwreck,bholly77,n/a,16/08/2025,I feel better about my life decisions after watching this. It's an amazing documentary about a world I never knew existed. MUST WATCH!,False
5,9,Can't take your eyes off it,cbellagigi,n/a,16/08/2025,During the pandemic what else if there to do than binge watch documentaries. This one does not disappoint! You will ask yourself over and over again if these people are real.,False
6,7,I worked for this guy for 9 months,tjlove-59575,n/a,16/08/2025,"Back in 2008 I worked for Joe Exotic for about 9 months, 4 of which were on the road and maybe 5 at the animal park. I've seen the doc and in my experience working with him and being at the park I really don't have anything bad to say about the guy based on what I lived personally being around the whole thingthere's obviously some sensationalism involved in the doc, some things are accurate and some things aren't but that's the nature of these kind of things.",False
7,10,A Beautiful Train Wreck.,sajdmed,n/a,16/08/2025,"I couldn't stop watching. Just when you thought it was strange it raised the bar even higher. If you like this series you definitely need to check out ""The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia"".",False
8,7,Big Cats are not for our entertainment.,missmayhillary,n/a,16/08/2025,I live in an area with many Joes. Men who get off on the power exchange between man and beast. Also while profiting off of it. Thats all I have to say about this documentary. Big cat captivity for entertainment and profit is wrong.,False

10,6,So many despicable people in one industry,view_and_review,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't think I've ever seen a show with more despicable people than ""Tiger King."" By episode four I was having a cathartic moment like, ""What am I doing watching this?"" I didn't like any of the people and I especially didn't like Carole Baskin the Mary Sue. She was no better than the rest of the slime balls in the big cat industry, she only spun her obsession a different way. It's not like she was releasing cats into the wild. All she was doing was taking them from other owners and putting them into her ""sanctuary.""As the deplorable people piled up like Joe Exotic's Walmart meat I found that I had to press forward and finish the show. Why? Because I suffered from FOMO: fear of missing out. I was seeing so many internet articles, memes, and text messages about the show I could no longer be the guy who didn't know who or what Tiger King was. Now that I've watched I find myself red neckier for it and almost ashamed that I gave so much of my valuable quarantine time to such a show. I'm not impressed with ""Tiger King"" at all. The whole ordeal is one of the wackiest things you'll ever witness; it is truly a case of fact being stranger than fiction, but it's also too close to reality T.V. and I HATE reality T.V.",False
11,9,"When ""good intent"" is overshadowed by $$$ and fame",Felicia_Voris,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe big players in this documentary are all of dubious character. The filmmaker spent 5 years filming this story; he presents a clear picture of all the characters in the story. This is a rare documentary devoid of any bias against any particular person in the storyline. The good, the bad, and the evil sides of all characters is on display in each of the seven episodes.I think it's worth the binge to watch all the episodes to see what happens when people start off with the good intent to help endangered animals, and how quickly the needs of the animals become overshadowed by $$$ and fame.I see people requesting folks make donations to Carole Baskin's Big Cat Rescue. I have issue with her and her husband spending approximately a million dollars to sue Joe Exotic. Why not take that cash and put it back into the sanctuary? The layout and containment areas of BCR look to be in worse shape than the containment areas of G.W. Zoo. If the animals truly do come first, I'd think the Baskin's would be better servants of how they spend their money battling antagonists like Joe Exotic. It was quite the tell to hear Carole say she wished she would have been killed, to bring more awareness to her cause!",True
12,6,Interesting...and irritating,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Joe Exotic runs the GW Zoo in Oklahoma. The zoo's claim to fame is its massive collection of big cats, including tigers and lions. An eccentric, larger-than-life, unscrupulous character, Joe Exotic's management of the animals leads him into confrontation with animal welfare advocates and another zoo owner, Carole Baskin. The feud between them leads him down a very dangerous path.A reasonably interesting documentary. The old ""fact is stranger than fiction"" saying certainly applies to this: you couldn't script something this bizarre. A tale littered with oddball, repulsive characters and off-the-wall goings on.The characters, while providing colour to the proceedings, are also a drawback: there is absolutely nobody to support. On the one hand you have the insane rednecks, on the other the greedy, superficial, possibly-husband-murdering, power-hungry busybody. Even the minor characters are all quite loathsome and seem to have an agenda. The seediness of it all becomes a bit irritating after a while.Overall: overhyped but watchable. Just don't expect any pitiable characters or even to come away feeling educated: nobody in the series deserves 15 seconds of fame, let alone a 5-hour documentary series made of them.",False
13,2,"Long live the King, eh The King is Gone.",PlutoZoo,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a shame that the second series of the Tiger King is lumped in with the first series for the sake of reviewing it here. Whilst the first was astonishing, compelling, crazy and riveting, the second series is a shameless attempt to cash in on the success of the first, it seems, and concentrates on long winded sleuthing that is tedious at best and boring at worst. The main problem being that it suffers from a singular problem that might have been a red flag to less excited producers when deciding on a second series and that is the lack of Joe Exotic. The Tiger King 2 doesn't feature much of the king himself, seeing as he's banged up in prison and therefore is very disappointing as a sequel. Many wondered how they'd match the first series, given his predicament, and we now have the answer: they couldn't. Not recommended.",False
14,8,Pathological Liars Abound,SGSypult,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting series on many levels, but everyone featured is a pathological liar and experienced various mental illnesses. The truth means nothing to these people, so it will never be found.
Protecting the animals is the only thing we should care about here. The actual ""animals"" are the featured people: Baskin, Antle and Schreibvogel. Sick, awful human beings.",False
15,10,Wow,markanthonyparra,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has it all: cult dynamics, twisted gay Okie love, animal rights and abuse issues, forensic intrigue, something for everyone.... and Big Cats!!",False
16,7,üêÖ Redneck Tarzan üêØ,Top_Dawg_Critic,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMost of the hype is from the ridiculousness of Oklahoma's King of the Jungle and his competitors. Interesting story but it wasn't told very well. The episodes were too long with many plot and technical issues. I wanted to see more focus on Baskin's ex-husband disappearance and am shocked no further investigation happened. Hype is over, time to go feed my tigers now. üòõ",True
17,8,Total train wreck,Sbecon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I couldn't stop watching. Absolutely compelling story with outrageous characters and unbelievable events. Proves what they say, the truth is stranger than fiction.",False
18,6,I don't get the hype.,PsychoBeard666,n/a,16/08/2025,"Narratively, the documenting is all over the place. Who is telling the story?
Apart from the big cats, nothing intrigued me.",False
19,8,Well damn,dhillon-664-55851,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a great documentary, I just never knew that I have existed on this planet with these people. I mean I don't even know what to say, Big cats, fights, gay owner, other lady husband missing, lawsuits, poor joe screwed over by Jeff, I think these guys live in there own dimension and somehow crossed over.",True
20,7,Wow,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,n/a,16/08/2025,"I didn't want to watch it for a long time, but when i started watching it, my blood froze, it was really interesting.",False
21,8,Cub petting is not cool,fajarsantoso,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary really tells you the story of a fued between big cat breeders doing it all for the money and fame and big cat rescuers.Definitely worth watching and I really hope this docuserie make Americans realise that cub petting ain't cool as apparently, there are between 5k - 10k big cats living in the USA as pets.",False
22,n/a,Disgusting,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't interested at all anyway, but my husband had it on and wouldn't stop watching it so I got roped into it I missed the first couple of episodes I think watched a show this crazy AF narcissistic a$$hole who I felt didn't even like the animals was all over the screen. This documentary was well made, hence the 3 stars but the rest is a disgusting and sickening display of how screwed up people can be.",False
23,7,"Tiger King - Murder, Mayhem and Madness",shivamt25,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis review contains mild spoilers but as it is a documentary, most of the information is present all over the internet.Tiger king is a new Netflix 7-part documentary which revolves around the life of Joe Exotic - the owner of the G.W. Zoo. What feels like a straightforward story about an eccentric big cats lover soon takes a surprising turn towards a murder for hire plot. But wait, there's more!Tiger Kings is far from being a generic documentary. It's crazier than what we're led to believe in the first few episodes. The last time my mind was this boggled after watching a crime documentary was when I watch HBO's ""The Jinx: Life and Deaths of Robert Durst"". The best part is, the Tiger King's life, without the ""murder for Hire"" allegation, was full of drama. He was a gay Zoo owner, who married 2 guys at the same time and ran for governor later on. His life was no less than a movie. He even had a villain, Carole Baskins - owner of the Big Cat Rescue, who was fighting against the private ownership of big cats like lions and tigers.But the story gets crazier by the episode. Carole is not actually an angel sent from heaven to save these poor cats, also, she is not the only villain in Joe's life and then suddenly, FBI comes into the picture!You can easily realise that the whole rivalry between all these big cat eccentrics has been sensationalised. A type of mystery was created around there life to spice up the whole story. But in the end, it all feels justified as each character involved is so colourful that you cannot take your eyes off. If you were not aware of the whole thing like me, there is no chance you can predict what they did. It baffled me when I couldn't decide who's side am I on. I, as a viewer, was not able to trust the words on any of them. I was asking myself, do people like these really exist? The only ones who you'd feel sympathy towards were the animals because as one of the persons involved explained, ""all these fights were for the cats, but none of it helped their situation. Not one of these fights benefited the animals involved.""There are hundreds of such sanctuaries in US alone where tigers and lions are living in the captivity of cages. They're used for breeding to produce cute cubs with whom you can click pictures to post on social media and feel good about your lives. When they're old, they become useless. The show successfully put this reality in front of us as well.I would recommend this show as the best documentary there is to watch while you're locked up at your homes. As compared to the uncertainty around the future of this Pandemic, Tiger King will definitely feel more unreal. After you've seen it, do let me know how do you find it. Also, do you think Carole really did it!If you liked Tiger King and are looking for similar crime documentaries, you can go for HBO's The Jinx that I mentioned before. It is about a big real estate personality, Robert Durst, who was a suspect of multiple murder charges. The ending is still one of the most surprising I've ever seen. Also, you can watch Making a Murderer by Netflix. It is about how Steven Avery, who was wrongfully accused of rape because of corruption in local law enforcement found himself being considered as a suspect in another heinous crime.",True
24,3,Don't understand the hype,alexrosetz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sure it's interesting, but not for more than an hour or so episode.
Eventually it comes down to trashy people. We shouldn't give these people more attention... especially when wildlife is involved.",False
25,9,Riveting,TinaTanberk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well made. Everyone stinks in this except the animals, film maker and woman who lost her arm.",False

1,10,A Treat on King's Table,teenaelizabethphilip,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was one of the best concert movies I have ever seen. The quality, the content, the artist Agust D himself amazed me. It felt like I am in a real concert and not watching a movie of a concert. Felt like Agust D was in the room. I am happy I made the decision to watch the concert. The song selection, how it was paced, the guests in the show and the song list. I have never seen anything like it or anyone like him ever. The way he started the concert, chef's kiss. The progression, beautiful. The energy, blows the roof. His energy on that stage flows through the screen onto the audience. You cannot sit still. I wonder how much more energetic was his concert. I have never seen a concert like this. I lost my voice even though I didn't know the lyrics. I am a fan of Agust D now. I hope I can see him in real life one day. Agust D, you changed the trajectory of my life. I am the King I am the boss was stuck in my head for days after that.",False
2,10,had high hopes and it was even better,msamiedu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seeing this in theatres was so much fun i cannot imagine how lucky people who experienced it live are. Everybody in the cinema was so genuinely happy, dressed up and cheering it was like a real concert and we sang and danced. It was such an amazing experience i'm sad it was in theaters only for 3 days here in Egypt but i'm lucky i got to go twice since it was selling out really fast! This was such a great movie and experience and I highly recommend going if you can. Really missed seeing Suga. I'm immensely proud of him for doing all of this. Gotta give him credit he's one of the best artists i've ever seen. The deligence and talent 100/100.",False
3,10,Incredible 10000/10!!!,lovelygirl-21701,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched it four times in the cinema that's how fantastic it was!! The progression of the songs was incredible and exciting to watch suga/agust d is really someone you cannot deny has put his talent and hard work into a beautiful experience for his fans. Not a single dull moment when he is performing. As someone who couldn't go to his concert it was amazing and compensating to have this chance. Wish him all the best and all the happiness just as he made me happy
If you can go see it in the cinema you should definitely go! Sing and dance and vibe! I guarantee you will have fun. Some songs i didn't pay attention to before but when i saw them in the movie i got chills and it was like seeing it for the first time. They've become my favorite like Snooze and moonlight.",False
4,10,Agust D did it again,perseusjackson-75769,n/a,16/08/2025,"Him showcasing his exceptional talent as a rapper and producer is really inspirational. The mixtape delves into personal struggles, mental health issues, and societal commentary, all delivered with intense lyricism and powerful beats. It's a raw and unfiltered expression of Suga's inner thoughts and emotions, resonating deeply with listeners worldwide. I really liked the stage setting and show etc. Hands of midas didn't disappoint as usual. It's a movie that I will definitely watch again and again. It created a very warm atmosphere with the fans in the cinema. Perfect cinematography from the best producer.",False

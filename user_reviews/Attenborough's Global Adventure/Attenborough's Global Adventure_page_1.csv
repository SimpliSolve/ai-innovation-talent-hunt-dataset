2,n/a,A collection of segments from other David Attenborough documentaries,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a meta-documentary, comprised of segments from other David Attenborough documentaries. IncludingGreat Barrier Reef with David Attenborough (2015),Galapagos: Nature's Wonderland (2014),David Attenborough's Conquest of the Skies 3D (2015),David Attenborough's Natural History Museum Alive (2014), andRise of Animals: Triumph of the Vertebrates (2013). They have attempted to create new documentaries based on themes, e.g. Home Planet. But, I failed to see the relationship between the episode titles and their content. Nevertheless, the segments are all pulled from other wonderful documentaries and each episode is enjoyable to watch. I would encourage viewers to seek out the original source material. I rated this title a basic 7, as there is nothing original in the content.",False

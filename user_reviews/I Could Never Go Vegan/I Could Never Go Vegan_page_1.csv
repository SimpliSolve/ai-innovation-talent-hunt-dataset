1,8,Think twice about your lifestyle.,MehdiTaba,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a family-friendly, thought-provoking exploration of veganism, offering a fresh perspective with its unique style and tone. Unlike other vegan documentaries, it tackles common arguments surrounding the lifestyle, making it relatable to people with different mind-sets. The strong Northern British accent adds character, though the abundance of on-screen text can be challenging to follow at times.Packed with compelling statistics and a wealth of information, the film is both inspiring and engaging. Its tone masterfully balances positivity, humour, sadness, and horror, creating an emotional yet uplifting experience. The fast-paced narrative is complemented by excellent direction, especially for a feature debut, and a well-crafted screenplay. The production quality stands out with good edits, an impactful film score, and impressive audio mixing and cinematography.Overall, this debut documentary is an essential watch for anyone curious about veganism. It's cool, maximalist, and undeniably engaging-a truly inspiring piece that left a lasting impression on me. I really enjoyed it!8/10.",False
2,10,A Superb Film That Should Make You Think,jmonday-96003,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film dives into the common reasons why people have such a difficult time changing their view, beliefs, and diet when presented with new information. The paradigms we've been conditioned to believe our entire lives come to a crash with new evidence about how too much meat, dairy, and eggs are for our health, the well-being of the planet, and the animals.When our deeply entrenched beliefs are questioned, it's natural, even biological, to get defensive and have a hard time not only changing, but even wanting to change. We want to stay in our habits and believe they are right, much like politics. But is that the best for us? The evidence is now abundantly clear and overwhelming, more plant-based foods are better for our health, and too much animal products increase chronic disease risk across the board. Whether we want to turn a blind eye to it or confront it and change for the betterment of our lives, is another story.",False
3,2,"A Persuasive Pitch, But Biologically Flawed",legion-of-the-snowzombie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Thomas Pickering's 2024 documentary I Could Never Go Vegan is a sleek, well-edited, and emotionally appealing exploration of plant-based living. With vibrant storytelling and a cast of passionate advocates, the film sets out to dismantle common objections to veganism. From environmental concerns to health claims and ethical arguments, it presents veganism as not only morally superior but also nutritionally ideal. But is it?Despite its compelling presentation, I Could Never Go Vegan falters under scientific scrutiny. The proposition that a vegan diet is inherently better for the human body is not only unproven, it's at odds with evolutionary biology and nutritional science.Evolutionary MismatchHumans are omnivores by design. Our evolutionary history is steeped in meat consumption, and our physiology reflects that. The human digestive tract is relatively short, typical of meat-eating species, unlike the long, complex intestines of herbivores. We produce hydrochloric acid in the stomach at a concentration similar to carnivores, evolved to break down animal proteins and kill pathogens found in meat.Moreover, our brains-arguably our most defining feature, owe their expansion largely to high-quality, calorie, dense animal foods. Key nutrients such as vitamin B12, creatine, haem iron, and DHA (a form of omega-3 fatty acid) are either absent or poorly absorbed from plant sources, requiring supplementation on vegan diets. The film glosses over this biological reality, instead romanticising an idealised vision of plant-based health.Health Claims in QuestionWhile some studies do show health benefits to increased plant intake, correlation does not equal causation. Vegan diets can reduce certain risk factors like LDL cholesterol, but this doesn't automatically translate to overall better health. Indeed, long-term veganism is associated in some studies with higher risks of bone fractures, iron-deficiency anaemia, and mental health issues-especially in populations without proper supplementation or access to fortified foods.The film fails to address these nuances. Instead, it leans heavily on emotionally charged anecdotes, often substituting personal testimony for rigorous science. Interviews with activists and influencers are engaging but lack the depth or balance needed to make a compelling scientific case.Ethical Arguments not Nutritional TruthEthics and sustainability are valid discussion points, but they should not be confused with what is biologically optimal. Just because a diet aligns with one's ethical beliefs doesn't mean it's the best choice for human health. The documentary conflates these spheres, giving the impression that what's ethically preferable must also be nutritionally superior-a position unsupported by robust nutritional science.In Closing...I Could Never Go Vegan is visually captivating and emotionally persuasive, but it ultimately promotes ideology over biology. While plant foods certainly play a vital role in any balanced diet, the film's dismissal of meat as unnecessary-even harmful-is both historically and scientifically inaccurate. Humans evolved eating meat, and for many, it remains an essential part of optimal health today. A more honest documentary would acknowledge the complexity and individual variation in dietary needs, rather than pushing a one-size-fits-all narrative.",False
4,8,Go vegan. It's that easy,Vievver,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a vegan, I found this documentary deeply inspiring and powerful. We truly need more documentaries like this-works that bravely and honestly shed light on the realities behind meat-based lifestyles. This film is not only eye-opening, but it also tackles often-ignored issues with courage and integrity. I sincerely thank everyone involved in making this important documentary.I'm proud to be vegan. I believe this choice doesn't just help animals and the planet-it also elevates the human spirit, bringing more awareness, compassion, and purpose into life.If I could offer one constructive critique, it would be about the pacing. At times, the film moves quickly from one topic to another, making it a bit hard to absorb all the important facts and statistics. In future documentaries, it might be more effective to focus on fewer topics and explore them more deeply. That way, the audience has more time to reflect and fully understand the message.I highly recommend everyone to watch this film - and more importantly, I encourage you to go vegan.Go vegan - it's as easy as drinking a glass of water.Through this choice, you'll discover the true meaning of life, empathy, and awareness.",False
5,1,I Will Never Go Vegan,HammBurger,n/a,16/08/2025,"I Could Never Go Vegan, is a (2024) British propaganda film directed by Mr. Thomas Pickering (vegan-zealot). This film explores a plant-based lifestyle (which is very unhealthy) and its impact on individuals and society. The film aims to indoctrinate common ideas about veganism and invoke views of adopting a vegan diet.Truth be told, mankind is in fact omnivores. Humans have been eating both plants and meat for thousands of years. Enjoying both on the same plate, is the best choice for a much healthier lifestyle. To be fair, avoid any meats that come from a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO). Support local farmers that raise grass-fed / grass-finished meats.You can enjoy that steak dinner tonight, guilt-free. You'll be much healthier for it, having never gone vegan.",False

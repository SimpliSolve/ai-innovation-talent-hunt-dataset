1,8,Well worth your time,mssofaspud,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don't assume the poor averages from IMDB are an accurate reflection of the value of this film. The poor ratings they pronounce are a clear indication of why this film is important. They are obviously posted by cult members of the oh so glorious MAGA movement. If you don't acknowledge the danger you're destined to be a victim of, then that well worn story that goes ""When they came for the teachers I said nothing. When they came for my neighbours I said nothing. Then they came for me and there was no one left to say anything."" will play out for real. How can the danger be so clear to someone looking at this from afar, and be so disguised to someone in its midst?",False
2,9,A MUST-WATCH EYE-OPENER,dawkinslcsw,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA powerful and comprehensive explanation for how we got to this divisive point in our politics. Told in a straightforward, easy to follow manner but so rich in detail that it may require a second viewing. Told by experts from many different fields and including views from Republicans, Democrats, Libertarians, and Independents. Especially moving are those who give insight into their own personal evolution: Former Representative Joe Walsh discussing why he left the Republican party and Malcolm Nance on why he felt he had to go and personally fight for a free Ukraine to protect this country from the rise in authoritarian takeovers.",True
3,n/a,You have to laugh at the disconnected themes and presentation.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Imagine saying we are going to have a ""psychological"" discussion around ""trumpism"". Then all you really do is avoid any direct specific psychological aspects beyond saying these guys are brainwashed fools.Yet they clearly have never witnessed the exact same faults pervasive in both parties. Worse the bulk of the film is pretentious and modern for its own sake and audience.Anything of merit won't come out for decades really examining the times and the man and phenomenon for decades until we have enough distance from it emotionally to evaluate it beyond partisan politics.This is just another generic attempt to keep the emotionally reasoning voter to stay the course and get out and vote ftw. This won't sway any real undecided people. It certainly offers no real insight as to what it pretends to be aimed at a psychological discussion of pro trump fandom.OF course the reality is the psychology and stakes in partisan political power in our country is often times very harsh and deeply exploitative.Remember despite the economy being terrible the official line from the horses own mouth has been the economy is not only not doing badly but in fact has been fine the whole time!A million simple examples from any side and so many shameless party antics demonstrates the reality there are plenty of whatever it takes to win players and mentalities.Still if you want the same material regurgitated for the umpteenth time over the past nearly decade now that have only grown in escalation like a well aged fishing story there is an all you can eat buffet.Bring plenty of salt and ketchup cause its from a very played out casserole leftovers recipe being served in a timely manner purely to cement voters who already concur with its ideas and exclusively biased emotional reasoning.To bad no one is worried about the psychology of such emotionally focused anti reason campaigns. They aren't unique in the slightest to trump. He simply did what was the status quo in a successful way that caught them off guard and humiliated them in the worst way in 2016 and he has never been forgiven.",False
4,10,a groundshivering document...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOn political authoritarianism, hate and propaganda. Its for a viewer living far away from usa, and is not an american citizen so true on its narrative, that it made me laugh at moments , on how misguided and steered a vast part of the american population has become since early 2010's, by making their minds up on social media and other political figures that has more selfish goals than you might think, a biased look on how easily people have been scruud and lied to... for the best of mankind and the american democracy...?It is a must see documentary, its a humble try to show the american public what world will come to be a reality , if...!Being polite and civil is a civic duty, if not is the recipe for civil war, not only in usa, but the rest of the western world too, including european states. So having the big advantage of being old and analouge, that still seek information from more than one source, and still reads printed books made of paper , its my grumpy old mans duty to recommend and tell people to share this film for all its worth...",True
5,1,It's just a political campaign ad,b4blue,n/a,16/08/2025,"... which might help swing undecided voters to Trump, because it is treating voters as stupid and uninformed. It's the IT age. Everything can be checked if you choose so. Mainstream media rules over people who don't. People are not this stupid. I have seen so many talks with ordinary people in the US of all colors and backgrounds. Adults know what is happening and they want to do something about it. It's not about democrats vs republicans anymore. It's between uniparty system (dems and reps) vs will of the people. True democracy is at stake. No more puppet candidates, who can't talk without a teleprompter or don't know what day it is.",False
6,1,Does not support its own premise,kenmaz,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt 5 minutes into watching this video, it became obvious that the intent was not to reveal something unknown to the general public, something so sinister as to induce both fear and loathing, and something only they know- that President Trump is using esoteric mind-control techniques to hypnotize his followers and supporters- but rather to just say, using a different video video and using different testimonies, that Trump is a dick and don't vote for him. Aside from a few adjustments to the script and dialogue, it's quite similar to their earlier video, ""Unfit"", another hit-piece.You would have to be 5 kinds of gullible and willfully ignorant to buy what they're selling in this video. Of course, if you're someone who already despises President Trump, you've already been sold on it. You're willing to accept that most of the testimony provided is from people with an axe to grind against President Trump, and the rest are in support of those people. More to the point, if the writers and producers of this video had any integrity, with a bit of credibility, they would've been honest enough to show how *everyone* is doing so, not just President Trump. The more cynical of us have been aware of that since the first man hopped up on a tree-stump to talk to a crowd.",True

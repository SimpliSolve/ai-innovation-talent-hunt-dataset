1,8,I love Rick and how he speaks on his home county,eleen-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolute pleasure to watch a man a professional to speak of one of the picturesque places in UK. With love, with passion and with tenderness. Definitely will be visiting this place some day.",False
2,7,Great viewing experience,wurideflame,n/a,16/08/2025,"The magnificent natural scenery, friendly residents, and home-cooked food all come together to make a great viewing experience. It made me desire to travel to Cornwall.",False
3,8,He can't cook!,alyssa_starelli,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat travel show and we love the mockery he makes of simple cooking! It's hilarious. Crab guts, apple quesadilla, raw vodka pancakes, runny omelet, 95% fat chops with smooshed berry sauce, watery veg-bake. He's made nothing we'd want to eat! It's like a cooking show parody albeit serious and therefore fantastic TV!! Bonus: Cornwall is beautiful and reminds us of our visit.",True
4,2,Yes another programme all about the celebrity,Drabble500,n/a,16/08/2025,"This isn't really a programme about Rick Stein's Cornwall. It's a programme about Cornwall's Rick Stein.This isn't necessarily a pop at Rick, who I am sure is an amiable sort of fellow, but every time you want to see lovely Cornwall, up he pops to get in the way.In this he follows a long, long, line of celebrity-obsessed television productions. As if the world somehow revolved around the 0.1% of that demographic and as if they are the arbiters of anything and everything that's interesting about places.Cornwall is a fantastic county. It would be even better if the 'me, me, me' brigade just stepped aside for a bit and allowed the rest of us to see it, in all its glory. Without someone's fizzog in the way.",False

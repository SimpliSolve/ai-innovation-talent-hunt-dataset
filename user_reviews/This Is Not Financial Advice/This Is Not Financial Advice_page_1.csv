1,1,Influencer-scum at their worst,bwdude,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great collection of absolutely unlikable wannabe influencers peddling their scheme.Let them invest their money in hypes if it even is real. But don't fall for them and think twice before following their advice.Yes, buying the right thing at the right time could have made you rich overnight, but those were more coincidences than planning.If you have to watch this, please please take it with a rock-sized grain of salt and don't spend your money without really knowing what you are doing.Personally, I would not trust any of them further than I could throw them. That was it, you are on your own now.",False
2,10,The most REAL & Informative documentary of the year!,spinelli-john-m,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full disclosure, I'm very critical of films in general! This topic hits VERY close to home for me as I live it just like those who this is about. This film not only covers multiple aspects of living and breathing today's financial realm. It also manages to touch on underdog stories, giving hope to those newly involved while being an educational cautionary tale as well. This film has the HIGHEST potential to become a case study for DECADES with college students learning today's complex financial market and what the future holds for it!The people who were involved in this project want this film to help educate the younger generation(and current) to brighten the future for things like personal finance, and self reliance. That fact couldn't come across more clear than the perfectly tasteful way they've approached and RIPPED OPEN this topic, turning it on it's head like nobody before! So proud of this film and the team behind it that made it possible! I'm also very proud of the people involved that were brave enough to come forward and tear open their lives for all to see so that others may benefit!",False
3,10,Powerful Time Capsule with a Lesson for our Culture,pjmcginnis-85014,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film documents the craziness of the dogecoin/crypto and influencer-driven investment craze of 2021 through the eyes of a quartet of charismatic leads. A mix of live action documentary punctuated with animated explainers, thus film is fresh and provocative with a lesson for the FOMO- driven investor class: ask yourself who is making money and how. You will be entertained but you will learn something as you laugh and cringe along the way. And luckily the charismatic subjects of this film make it hard to look away, even when they're playing the casino of online trading that is so pervasive in this film and in the wider world. Loved this film.",False

5,10,This film will be studied decades from now...,bdoochin-85175,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a roller coaster to watch - just as it was a roller coaster to live.'This Is Not Financial Advice' might be THE definitive study of this crazy point in time - a world reeling from a pandemic, where trillions of dollars change hands between people who have no idea what's real, what's fake, what's an internet joke. You'll have no idea who are the winners and losers in this film until the very end (and then, we still don't know what's to come).The filmmakers have done the world a service by capturing this point in time and sharing lessons we should all pay attention to, now and for the ages.",False
6,10,Pro the DOGE is me,deanhawkey,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a crypto enthusiast, I honestly didn't expect much from this film because outside of crypto. Most haven't a clue what that world is like. So by no means did I expect Hollywood to capture the vibe and mindset of the crypto world. But I was wrong. As I sat listening to three tales of investment strategies that need the title of the film to ensure you are aware of how risky their approach is. I kept thinking to me self, this story is remarkable, and yet it could very easily be my story.The premise is about losing so much faith in the current economic system and losing so much faith that you are willing to risk everything because you know that it will either change the world for the better, or things will be so bad it won't matter anyway.Without giving spoilers, the three tales told here are all relatable to anyone that has suddenly seen the light of how Blockchain can change the world. And the mindset behind that type of investor.It felt good to know that someone understood the crypto community and instead of assuming we were all just foolish investors buying worthless images.If you took the Red pill, this film will be very relatable.If you took the blue pill it will open your eyes. Careful, you might even start seeing what we see.Either way the film is both informative and entertaining.",True

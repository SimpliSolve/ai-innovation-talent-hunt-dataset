1,10,AMAZING,nancycamaldo,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film not only shows a very interesting and unique perspective of modern colonialism in South Africa but also its rather unexplored consequences for native people and animals - I think it is a very important film to watch!IÂ´m really in love with the protagonists and the cinematic style of the film!It somehow manages to show me the intriguing everyday life of the Black Mambas, but at the same time to reflect on the heritage as a white person. The film does it without being pretentious, but subtle.At the end I got really emotional. One of the best documentaries I have seen in the last few years.",False

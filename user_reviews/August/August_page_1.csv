1,10,August..reborn,janette_zhang,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can't believe that love and passion for life conveyed by the documentary is from Zhang Zhehan coz I know what had happened and what are now still happening. The Sacredness in this documentary is showed by the beautiful natural scenery and interesting people yet actually from Zhang himself. I can't help but smile and cry with Zhang' doing cooking with the interesting big sister,sharing his understanding of dreams with the boys, cycling on his way in the gentle and magic snowy land, looking for miraculous glacier despite inevitable failures...which he has experienced enough and got used to ...He sings his own songs and keeps telling people, be strong! In the heaven like land, he is a hero. I have been inspired by him and again am inspired by him with this documentary. He is and will always be a legend! This is an honest documentary which also showes Zhang Zhehan's talent as a movie director. Zhang Zhehan's already a brilliant actor.",False
2,10,A calming documentary,hehuang-62109,n/a,16/08/2025,"I kept crying while watching the documentary. It turned out that I felt such emotion when I saw your work without knowing it myself. Perhaps only those who have experienced it together can understand the depth of those scars. What was I thinking when I watched ""August""? I was wondering how someone could have such vigorous vitality and enthusiasm, and would always be impressed by this charm. I particularly like the background music in the documentary, especially the Meili Snow Mountain, which is ethereal and sacred, as if I am also in it. After staying in the city for a long time, people really need to go to nature to relax themselves. After reading this, I want to go to distant places.",False
3,10,A healing journey,zhangxingxing-81725,n/a,16/08/2025,"God, this documentary really gave me a dual enjoyment of both my eyes and soul. At the beginning, a person was slowly and firmly climbing a snow mountain. The sky was so blue and the snow mountain was so white. Under such beautiful scenery, the appearance of the narrator made me fall in love! I understand why he went to climb the snow capped mountains and his experience. Oh my god, it hurts me. Following his shots and descriptions, I witnessed more beautiful scenery and saw many ordinary people enjoying cycling and life. I hope you can heal both us and yourself, Zhang Zhehan ~We all experience a lot of pain, even though many of them are not something we should bear. But since those injuries haven't killed us, they will definitely make us stronger, won't they?

4,10,I want to travel to Tibet after watching the documentary,Messi033,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching the documentary, I want to travel to Tibet. Tibet under the director's lens is so beautiful. This is a successful documentary. With the beautiful nature and the nomadic lifestyle, the animals here are more free than those in the city. The same is true for people. Fast-paced cities will make people nervous and anxious, and the unchanging life will gradually numb people. After reading August, it seems that I understand why so many people like cycling. Maybe they want to find the answer, or maybe they like cycling without a reason. There is no standard answer. Life is the same. There is no best way to live. Finding what suits you is the best.",False

In this film, I feel that whether the world is beautiful is not in the world but in you. It is you who find peace in this noisy world, and find the motivation and courage to start again.

6,10,"Stay alive, go on",yiyiripple,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is very good, recording the beautiful scenery of Tibet, recording the mood of passers-by, and also recording the director's own bit by bit.It is easy to say to live, but after experiencing some things, you will find that simply living also requires a lot of courage.Go on, it is more difficult than simply living, living if it is the first step, then the second step will be more difficult than the first step, go on, go the right way, go a good way, step by step down to earth.We do not forget the pain, but overcome the pain, those scars may be forever, but still need to bravely persist.Come on, director Zhang Zhehan, come on, singer Zhang Zhehan, come on, actor Zhang Zhehan.The future road, but also need the captain to lead us to go down together, the future of us, will be better and better.",False
7,10,A warm film,heshoufen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this documentary. It's a serene and peaceful film that follows the director's solo cycling journey along the Yunnan-Tibet Highway as he seeks self-discovery amidst a storm of online criticism. The film delves into various themes such as finding inner peace, discovering oneself, and seeking answers in life. The director immerses himself in the crowd, experiencing his true self and finding beauty in nature, sentient beings, communities, passions, dreams, brotherhood, and love. While the answers to life remain elusive for the director for now, he continues his journey forward, searching for them along the way.",False
8,10,Finding inner peace is truly invaluable,kuokuo333,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a short documentary about a travelling journey from Shangri-La to Tibet by bicycle. The breathtaking landscapes were complemented by interviews with various individuals. Through these conversations, the director discovered the essence of dreams, friendship, and love. Although he didn't find all the answers he was seeking, he did find solace in connecting with others.I was already aware of everything that the young director had gone through before watching the documentary. It's truly an absurd case of persecution. However, the film didn't dwell much on pain, except for the challenging mountain climb at the start, which symbolized his struggles after forced to leave his career. Except this part, the rest of the documentary felt light and soothing, akin to sipping on a warm cup of tea. The director, who had faced numerous setbacks, didn't wallow in self-pity or bitterness but instead sought new possibilities in life, gently healing the viewers in the process as well. In the vast world, the most profound exploration lies within one's own heart. Regardless of how far one travels or how many mountains they climb, the true challenge lies in confronting the depths of one's soul. Clearly, the director realized that finding inner peace is the ultimate treasure.This being his debut work, I am excited to see what he creates next.",True
9,10,Connect with your heart and know yourself,janehsu,n/a,16/08/2025,"August is a documentary combines a lot of elements, and like a treasure with endless wisdom, and to open the treasure is simplyly opening your heart and connect with the film.There is a saying, watching an excellent documentary is watching yourself! August is a documentary made by the heart of Director Zhang Zhehan. He has good connection with nature, people and the world, thus this film nables you to find yourself in different dimensions.I have been watching this documentary for several times, and each time, you will find a new dimension and something touch your heart. We keep oursleves busy by doing things and lose the connection with our heart. By watching this film, you will find a peaceful space to connect with your heart and may find something meaningful to your life.",False
10,10,August is not just August,mo-44180,n/a,16/08/2025,"August is a movie which can calm down one's heart after watching. If you're disappoint ed with life,or in a low ebb of fate,you can find answers in this movie. What has happened to this world? Will the world become better now. No. Zhangzhehan still adheres to his ideal and reshape his belief even if all the ill-will and stigma of the world are dumped on him. He still treats everything in the world with warmth and kindness, calmly and beautifully. I hope fate will be kind to Zhangzhehan . August of the past is not yet over, and August in the future will come. But this movie will continue to inspire everyone to live on, go on, seek selfhood, seek direction, and reach the other shore.",False
11,10,Life is a miracle,zzhjrsy,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a new director, this documentary is very sincere and shocking. Starting from his own personal experience, the director went on a healing cycling journey after experiencing a desperate situation. What would you choose when ten years of hard work were burned down overnight? What would you do when your beloved career was destroyed and your reputation was slandered? The director used this documentary to give a perfect example. The audience was easily attracted by what they saw and heard along the way, and their hearts magically calmed down by the end. Life is great, and Zhang Zhehan, who was able to stand up again after despair and encourage others, is really admirable. Live on and keep going. God bless him.",True
12,10,August is a wonderful story directed by Zhang Zhehan,xiazhixing-06116,n/a,16/08/2025,"Actually, August has always been a good month.August was originally a peaceful month, where ordinary people would watch the moon, appreciate osmanthus flowers, express their longing, and blow the cool summer breeze. It should not make a group of people feel like a month of hardship, nor should it be a time to avoid every year.Facing August head-on and returning calmness to what should have been August is bravery and a better way to love oneself.Finally, as someone who has watched a lot of films, I would like to take the liberty of commenting on Director Zhang Zhehan's films. Without wearing filters, it is objective to say that the films are very mature. Realistic, natural, and smooth. Documentary films emphasize authenticity and objective recording. Even for a film about Zhang Zhehan's search for a path to self-healing, Director Zhang Zhehan tries to weaken his own existence and objectively tells the stories of one person after another he meets, truly expressing his emotions.The copy written by Zhang Zhehan himself is great. It must be accompanied by Zhang Zhehan's calm voice to listen. Every sentence has entered my heart, and I haven't shed tears. It's really my family motto that goes deep into my bones, and I am exceptionally strong. The editing is also very good. Then I wanted to pay special tribute to the music. I deliberately memorized the name of the composer, which made me almost cry a few times. I silently recited it several times before I could hold back my tears. I don't want to cry because everything is okay.Zhang Zhehan, I understand you, we understand you! Director Zhang, you are really excellent!",False
13,10,August is a healing documentary,mingao-52834,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know this actor, Zhang Zhehan, and I also know about some of the things he has suffered in the past three years. I thought he would be completely defeated by now. After all, if someone were to erase all of my scientific research output from the past decade, I would either fight desperately or give up completely. So, when I saw the documentary he directed this time, I was very surprised. What surprised me even more was that the entire documentary didn't urgently pour out his grievances to the audience, or complain about how unfair the world is. Instead, it seemed to record his healing process. From the composition, color, to the music, I feel he is still positive and upward, like a tree striving for sunlight, with an indomitable spirit. The storytelling in the whole documentary is very smooth. The director knows what he wants, which is to find the motivation to continue moving forward, so each story serves this purpose. I especially like the music in the documentary, especially the drifting part, but towards the end, there is a hint of sadness. I am very surprised that this is Zhang Zhehan's work. He has grown a lot, but he must have also experienced many hardships. Finally, although Tibet used to seem beautiful but rundown in my impression, this documentary has given me the latest information. It's similar to where I live in Switzerland. Given the opportunity, I would like to go and see it.",False
14,10,What's August like?,zehongw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finished August with a smile. Probably because just got up, the whole person has just refreshed, has not been affected by the worldly clutter, can follow his story more wholeheartedly, feel the road he has walked, the people he has met, the world he has been to. And those painful parts, after many times of practice, finally familiar with, so have the power to find more beauty.I began to think deeply about why watching ""August"" felt healing. As the creatures who master the absolute power of this planet, human beings have actually grown up all the way in the conflict, in order to compete for resources, in order to grasp the initiative to live, attack, struggle, and harm each other, is the main theme of human society. However, in today's great development of material productivity, in fact, there is no need for such a fierce struggle: we can eat, wear warm clothes, live well, and even pursue our dreams. After thousands of years of killing and fighting, and thousands of years of growth, we have the ability to provide people with the ability to live together in peace, no longer need to show their teeth over a few resources, raising sticks to intimidate each other. Of course, the reality is not so good, especially as we have just witnessed a terrible murder, which will make it feel even more poignant. That's why August is so precious.So the people you meet on the road are very rare. They are a group of people who choose to walk this difficult road for their own inner pleasure, without any worldly purpose. Just like the director's team, in the hail, snow mountains, wind and rain, between the heat, for what, as if for nothing, huge investment, and even without any predictable economic return, just to tell the story of the road to the audience. But it is precisely these do not do anything, their telling and shooting is so valuable, it is the human beyond the struggle, calculation outside, one heart toward the beauty of the footprint of self-growth. That's why it's so moving.",False
15,10,when you arrive at a real snow mountain,i-12878,n/a,16/08/2025,"Zhang Zhehan, when you arrive at a real snow mountain, all the blizzards you've experienced before pale in comparison. You seem to have become a snow mountain yourself-serene, pristine, powerful, silent yet majestic. Clouds above your head, clouds beneath your feet, Zhang Zhehan, fearlessly continue your climb. Your work will have a lifespan of over 100 years. Just as nature cannot easily erase a snow mountain, the limitations of the internet cannot erase your achievements. The name your mother bestowed upon you is the most precious key in your life. Carry your key, carry your answers, and follow the path beneath your feet. Go create the newest and best August.",False
16,n/a,Human life is not defined,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn addition to the beautiful scenery, this film also shows us the life of ordinary people, there are two brothers who are young but have their own ideals; A friendly, quick restaurateur; There are a couple who met and fell in love because of cycling. I think the film gives us the message that there are many possibilities in life. We don't have to live exactly the same, we can choose to live in the bustling and convenient city, or we can choose to live in the countryside with beautiful scenery and open roads.I think, even in the city life does not have to let the pace is too fast, we can slow down properly, listen to the voice of their own hearts, think about what they want, and then fight for it.Everyone's interpretation of the film will be different, but it must be beautiful, positive energy, maybe there will be negative evaluation, but it must be objective. However, in these negative comments, I found that some people interpreted them with malicious intent, saying something completely unrelated to the film, and even slandering and insulting the film director himself, which I could not understand. In general, what the film brought me was beauty and help. And the nasty negative comments made me feel scared and upset.",True
17,10,A good documentary about creatures and life,danielhines-26044,n/a,16/08/2025,"""August"" is a warm and beautiful documentary. From a professional point of view, although it is the director's debut, more than 10 years of experience as an actor has made him have not the first performance in acting as a director. The dubbing and shooting of the documentary are very professional, taking a person's cycling route as a clue, looking for the philosophy of life in the experience. It also lets us be moved by the simple, hard-working and gentle quality of people who are far from the hustle and bustle of life. The protagonist rides all the way and feels all the way. In the end, although there is no clear answer to the meaning of life, the answer has been answered from the ride all the way and from the ordinary life.",False
18,9,A story that will inspire you to live well,r-14413-52436,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a documentary, what touches me most about ""August"" is not only the magnificent scenery and people who love life that he saw while riding along the way, but also the director's own self-compassion and self-healing of his own encounters. He suffered from that kind of persecution of public opinion that was as unfair as the drowning of the world (now in the comments section you can still see that so many haters are still persevering in the continued persecution), but he didn't have the slightest bit of resentment, in his eyes, he looks at the mountain scenery, the trees, the animals, the people, the road ahead, and tells the people who love him not to fall into the trap, not to let down, this is really very touching to me, and also really have redeemed to me, thank you Zhang Zhehan.",False

21,10,Living a good life is the choice of the brave,guyue-10900,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI originally thought it was a traditional documentary about riding to Tibet, but after watching it, in addition to being attracted by the beautiful scenery of Tibet, China, I also admired the director more. The director's life is really exciting enough. Faced with the harm caused by rumors, some people will sink in pain, and some people will be resentful and extreme. But the director of this documentary walked out of a third life. He chose to face the injury head-on, constantly improve his professional abilities and survival wisdom, and make himself a stronger person. I hope I can become someone like Zhang Zhehan.",True

23,10,It makes me want to visit China someday,shallychou,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI accidentally saw this documentary on YouTube. It only lasts for about 50 minutes.I know almost nothing about the director and China. The documentary makes me want to visit China. The view is beautiful and the people are very nice.My favorite part is playing basketball. Because I like watching basketball games, even though I'm not good at basketball. But never mind!

24,10,Thank you Zhang Zhehan for filming his own story,haizhelovezzh,n/a,16/08/2025,"The opening picture shocked me, and a figure climbed the snowy mountain with difficulty. Beautiful glaciers, grasslands, virgin forests, and free animals are all beautiful. This is a healing journey, and the scenery along the way and people's smiles are precious. My favorite part of the documentary is the story of the basketball brothers. The director saw himself pursuing his dreams as a child in the children who like basketball. He respected the children's dreams and encouraged them, and the children were willing to share their secret bases with him. A disaster plunged Zhang Zhehan's life into a trough. He stood up again and decided to start again. Ten years later, he rode again and found his brave self during the trip.

I think Zhang Zhehan is a talented director, because this is his first work as a director, and I didn't expect that he made it so well. What moved me most was his attitude towards life after going through difficulties. Unsurprisingly, this will inspire many people in difficult situations. His lens language is also very good.

I think I will watch this documentary a few more times. .",True

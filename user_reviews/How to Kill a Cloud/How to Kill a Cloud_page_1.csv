1,2,Agony of drought,pekka-raninen-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I hate to write a negative review of a Finnish document film. But... How can a film about clouds, rain and water be so unbelievably dry? So slow and uninteresting that it's pure torture to watch it?I mean, if you really want to make science, and especially climate change as a subject, as dull as possible, this is the way to do it. Can't imagine how any more distant the average taxi driver or other John Doe could feel about science, or funding science and education, or encouraging their children to higher education, after trying to stay awake watching this film.Beautiful photography, at times. Music, kind of poetic, I guess? Editing... oh dear, apart from writing the whole thing over and up again it would've been easier to delete at least 30 mins of the material and tighten the rest up!Is this art? Is this education? Is this really a document, even? To me it seems this film tries to tick all the boxes at one go, but because of attempting that, it fails miserably at all of them. I'm really sorry, because I really would have liked to like this film a lot.Finally, it seems that the archive still clip from 1967 could possibly be about the herbicide operation called ""Ranch Hand"" (Agent Orange etc. Chemicals), if not of ""Popeye"".",False

1,9,We all deserve to be seen,melodyso,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't really enjoy the typcially underdog turned superstar story so I thought I'll hate this. But it's very well done. It didn't portrayed people with disabilities in a negative light. They are filmed as people that are capable and independent. It's done a great job humanize them.Everyone has that feeling where they don't feel seen or celebrated. I figure that's why it is so touching to watch. It is a beautiful story of ordinary people trying to do the right thing. Nothing is over done. I just wish they have included more of the model's backstory.,False

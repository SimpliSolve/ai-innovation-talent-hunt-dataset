1,8,Informative and accessible,elerifairy,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a medieval historian I found this tv show to be very interesting. Whilst it definitely leans on the side of over explanation, I understand it to be more for the sake of accessibility than as an insult to viewers. My only real complaint as a historian is that I feel they could explore more circumstances for the death and burial, but I think that's probably due to fitting the information within the allotted time. There seems to be a few people making comments about the all female presenters, which personally I didn't even notice, even if it was intended by the studio. Personally I feel if you did have an issue with it then it reflects more upon yourself than the tv show; for its about time we had some female dominated tv shows as I'm fed up of male dominated tv shows. Personally, I highly recommend this tv show to anyone, no matter how much you know about history because it's just a fun watch and really brings history alive (particularly the lives of those who are overlooked). If I wasn't already a massive history nerd, I definitely would be after watching this show.",False
2,8,Skip the acting,rorygcunningham,n/a,16/08/2025,"An excellent programme as regards its content, but the scripting is awful. Raksha gets away ok, but Carla is made to look half-witted. Try to make it more natural, please. The writing of stuff on a glass pane is a bit silly. Please keep going, but improve.",False
3,8,Fascinating Show With Women Scientists,lynnkear,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's nice to watch a show that features women scientists. Obviously some people can't handle it, but I actively seek out programming with women. It's unfortunate that so many men are threatened by women. Frankly, some of the other comments border on misogyny. In any event, this show is fascinating. It's kind of a true crime/history/archeology mashup. Hope there are many seasons of this.",False
4,9,Beaker People REVEALED!,kingsleymiller,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am a semi retired teacher who produced a book which Prof Sir Michael Rutter described as an interesting and informative guide. In all my years of teaching history I have never understood how who the Beaker People were until this series. The BBC is over rated and it is great to watch these off beat series on History eg Walking Roman Roads, which have a fresh outlook. Lead presenter excellent.",False
5,10,i love this show,sarahking-20154,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this show please make more episodes pleasepleaseplease!!! I especially love the episodes about the really old skeletons but the ones about skeletons from the industrial revolution were cool too. I love how the information is presented in a crime documentary way (especially when there wasnt actually a ""crime"" involved in the persons death). Anyway i need there to be more episodes of this. Thank you.",False
6,1,Childish drivel.,henrybrown-terry,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is so insulting to the viewer. It is so amateurly scripted and directed. You can see the presenters queueing up to say their lines, inane and risible as they are. This is something that I would have expected to see as a six year old on kids TV back in the 60s. The fact that this is being shown this on primetime evening TV now shows how much the media has ""dumbed down""",False
7,3,"Bring back ""Time Team""",jdhb-768-61234,n/a,16/08/2025,Utterly underwhelming historical / archaeological series. There is nothing new and it seems to be little more than an opportunity to promote a series presented almost wholly by women.It's repetitive and not very interesting. The presenters exhibit little in the way of screen presence and the jumping from studio to location serves little purpose. I've watched parts of 2 or 3 of these and won't be bothering again.,False
8,1,Disappointing,imdbfan-3561089221,n/a,16/08/2025,"A disappointing slog through what could have been fascinating material. Information overload combined with stiff delivery made this nearly unwatchable. Tori Herridge's segments were especially monotonous, droning on with textbook facts rather than engaging storytelling. Save yourself the time and skip this one. I was excited about the concept but quickly found myself checking how much time was left in each episode. Tori Herridge speaks as if she's lecturing undergrads who are forced to be there. Her lack of real expertise clearly doesn't translate to engaging television. I don't know who this show is for but it wasn't for me.",False
9,1,uninspired,theodoramedly,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was information overload and grew boring very quickly. Personally felt like i was reading a textbook rather than being entertained. Herridge was especially droning. I agree with others that it was repetitive and uninspired. Nohing more should be made like this again. Please spare us. The concept had a lot of promise but unfortunately they grossly missed the mark. Im sure these people are very educated and qualified but it doesnt mean they should be allowed to have an entire netflix show. Very basic and maybe could have been ok, but no. I would skip this if you are considering giving it a watch.",False
10,1,More British Tax Payers Money wasted by BBC,morgandavis-08401,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rubbish Borring Programme. The only people that appear to be excited by this series are the female presenters. maybe it's the thought they are actually getting paid for this rubbish that excites them?
And what is with all these disgusting tattoos? The BBC has to be sold off to save the British Tax Payers from
being ripped off! No value for money!",False

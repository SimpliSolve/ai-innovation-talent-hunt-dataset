1,10,We are a living history,thebeachlife,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saddam Houssein's dictatorship, closing borders, Al-Qaeda, the American occupation, Daesh, civil war - we are welcome to all of this and a lot more that constitutes the modern history of Iraq and how and what brought this country so rich in perfume and flavor to tatters. With that said, the story itself is deeply personal, which naturally makes the viewer sympathize with the suffering that several generations of Feurat's family went through, and probably will.The animation is somewhat minimalistic and pastel colored yet superb. The storytelling is straightforward and to-the-point. The narrative is not chronological but very clear and comprehensive, not too emotional but awakening and thought-provoking. Don't expect a happy ending but we know that everything will be ok in the end. And if it's not ok, it's not the end. We are a living history. The war is there, we just need to look out of the window; but it will end somewhen, won't it?",False

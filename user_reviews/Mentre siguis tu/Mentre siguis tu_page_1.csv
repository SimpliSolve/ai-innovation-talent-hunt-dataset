1,10,"Impactful, insightful, inspirational",stragglemuffin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile you're still youBeing a film about dementia I went into this expecting the following. A film that will be harrowing, heartbreaking and hard to watch. This is a topic that is so frightening that it must be treated with the upmost respect and has high standards.Watching the degeneration of a veteran actor as they lose their craft is horrifying especially when it is not of their own will, and they don't know why.Losing your individuality between the character you are playing, and your own personality is tragic.How she explains the characters she has played is incredible. Talking about how she wants to be able to choose where she dies and she doesn't want to lose who she is.Knowing your life is coming to an end, and more so not just your life, but who you are. The idea of being left as a shell makes for Carme to desire to leave something behind and to act while she still can.Extraordinarily powerful and moving motivation. Highly inspiringThe discussion of euthanasia is devastatingly tragic and insightful. Brings up so many moral questions and can be applied to anyone.It is such a debilitating disease and it is slow. This is why it's so painful. I teared up at many points in this film, and that's not easy to get out of me.10/10. One of if not the best film I've ever seen.Such an impacting performance and content matter. Absolutely incredible.",True

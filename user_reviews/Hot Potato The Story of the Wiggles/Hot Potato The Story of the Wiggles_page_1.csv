1,9,How A Simple Kids Group Became A Worldwide Sensation,brendancrowl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like with most people, I grew up with listening to the popular children's group, The Wiggles. I mean I was obsessed with the group as a kid because I had the videos, sang the songs, and watched the show on Playhouse Disney. But this documentary shows how they are more than just a kids group with catchy music, the documentary explores even further at just how they were able to overcome new challenges and obstacles along the journey ranging from mental health, medical emergencies, and other things. It also features how the group would have new additions to the group in the form of new cast members and new songs to impact a new generation of fans with new songs and more.This documentary made me feel nostalgic as well as having me laugh, cry, and interested in knowing more about my favorite childhood heroes. As a longtime fan of The Wiggles, this was a MUST SEE for me because these guys (Greg, Jeff, Murray, and Anthony) have played such a big part in my life that I feel that I can appreciate everything they've done not just as musicians, but even more as legends that have defined the world of music for generations of children all over the world. There is no doubt that The Wiggles have left their mark on music and entertainment.",False
2,9,Wiggle-tastic!,ddbmschmidt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMy kids were born in 2007 & 2008. ""Prime Wiggles""time when Sam was THE Yellow Wiggle.We went to 4 concerts, and they were SO MUCH FUN! Hot Potato is burned into your brain forever!Was wonderful to see Sam in the Documentary, and the whole transition back to Greg was glossed over.Anthony showed a very insensitive side. To reduce Sam to a ""hired man"" was BEYOND insulting to Sam, and to all of the fans. Sam was done dirty! He lurched The Wiggles into the stratosphere, and has a stunning singing voice!Greg's return marked my kid's natural transition out of Wigglesmania, so we did not have the same enthusiasm to the newer Wiggles. The anti-woman Wiggle backlash/complaints was, and is still absurd! The Original Wiggles have not been erased.But... it is wonderful to see NEW Wiggles, new Wiggles for new Generations! Innocent, catchy fun entertainment for children, and adults.",True
3,9,Wiggletastic!,Jace_the_Peanuts_Fan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up watching The Wiggles on Playhouse Disney, Sprout, and VHS tapes, and sometimes I still watch it to this day and do the dances for nostalgia purposes. The Wiggles are my favorite children's band, partly because I've had a lot more exposure to them than any other children's band and they're one of the only ones I grew up with. However, I only like the original lineup (Anthony, Murray, Greg, and Jeff). I'm neutral to the Sam era, and I never watched the new Wiggles. When I first heard about this documentary, I was excited for it, and I enjoyed watching it very much! It shows how these guys are more than just a kid's band with catchy songs and explains even further at how they were able to overcome new challenges and obstacles along the way, from mental health, medical emergencies, and other things.I learned a lot from the doc, like how Dorothy the dinosaur and Captain Feathersword came to be, the origins of Wiggles songs like Hot Potato, Rock-a-Bye Your Bear, and Get Ready to Wiggle, and how Jeff's sleeping routine was thought of. I already knew that the original Wiggles, minus Jeff, took an early childhood education class together in college and originally wanted to be preschool teachers, but I didn't know until I watched this that they have used a lot of what they learned in that class, such as including repetition in their song lyrics (for those of you who don't know, repetition is a key to learning, although I think some but not a whole lot of Wiggles songs go overboard with the amount of repetition, which I find annoying) and speaking directly to the camera in the episodes.Another fact I learned from this is that when The Wiggles gave various TV channels the idea to create the Wiggles show before it came along, a lot of them turned it down because they thought their (The Wiggles') home videos were cringe, and Anthony replied, ""Greg, Murray, and I studied early childhood education in college, so we know what we're doing."" This led to them making the show themselves, and before they thought of that, they thought to themselves, ""Do they know more than we do?"" Those are good words to live by! You should ask yourself the same thing if others bully you, make you change something about yourself, or give you negative comments about yourself and are feeling down about it, and I'm going to do the same for myself the next time somebody does such a thing to me. You know more about yourself than anyone else, so it's unlikely that others know more than you do. The people at those TV networks probably didn't ever take an early childhood class, so it's unlikely that they know more than The Wiggles.I've heard previously that the reason Sam left the group was because he got fired, and I heard somewhere else that he left because his contract expired. I was confused and didn't know which reason was the right one, but it's clarified in the doc that it's the latter. Thank you, Wiggles, for clarifying that! I was surprised that Sam was in this (in neither a good nor bad way) because this is the first time he's had involvement with The Wiggles and been in touch with any of the other members since he left, and I think he said years earlier that he had no interest in working with them ever again, but I could be mistaken.There is video footage of various full length Wiggles songs performed at their latest reunion concert in this, and the songs' titles appear on screen at the beginning of the videos, just like the TV series, which made me feel like I was watching The Wiggles. I like the idea of the music videos in both this and the show having title cards because that way everyone watching knows the names of the songs (except for those who don't know how to read yet or don't pay attention, of course), and no other shows I've ever seen have title cards during their songs. Enough said.",False
4,10,Wiggly Terrific,mjcarlon,n/a,16/08/2025,"My triplets were born in 2002. Given the timing, The Wiggles played a big role in our lives. I say Our because the entire family was immersed in Wigglemania.I smiled from ear to ear, Jokerlike, while taking in all one hour and forty four minutes of this masterpiece. How could one not while hearing all those classics including Rock-a-bye your bear, Fruit Salad and their own Margaritaville, Big Red Car. But it's not all primary colors and three chord soft rock. The back story and behind the scenes are simply captivating.From Greg's mystery illness, the backstory behind Jeff's narcolepsy, Anthony's mental health struggles (and ink), and Murray's ability to have a great head of hair well into his 50s, there's so much more to take in than just the music.This really is up their with Def Leopard's behind the music, IMHO (though no one loses an arm).Watch it, you won't be disappointed. And if you are, put your hands in your air and rock a bye your bear.",False
5,10,Fantastic documentary!,njwifemom,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a family, we loved the Wiggles and all their shows and songs. So grateful to have shared them with our son who's now 21. Thanks to them, I was able to take a quick shower or do a little housecleaning as my son was mesmerized by them. He still remembers watching them.Glad the Wiggles were as nice in real life and they portrayed themselves to the public. Fantastic to learn the history of their classic songs. Looking forward to sharing the Wiggles with my grandkids. Can't believe this documentary doesn't have 10,000 reviews. Very well done and highly recommend watching it. The Wiggles will transcend time and will be a wonderful childhood memory for many future generations.",False
6,10,"...fascinating, entertaining and eye opening.",lasreviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a film about my favorite group that had a positive influence on my kids as they were growing up. The movie explores the backstory, creation and history of The Wiggles, starring Anthony Field (blue), Murray Cook (red), Jeff Fatt (purple) and Greg Page (yellow). My kids discovered them when the group made the arrangement with the Disney Channel. Kids in Australia and New Zealand knew about them years before and it's not a wonder that they took the rest of the world by storm. I learned so much about them while watching this documentary that it simply blew my mind. Their songs may have been simple, catchy, bouncy, and fun, but the four guys' journey wasn't nearly so benign, easy or without serious challenges.My most favorite aspect of the film was the nostalgia triggered by the awesome songs I sang along to with my kids as they watched the shows and videos over and over again, Hot Potato being only one of many. The dance moves that accompanied them always made me feel that if they had an exercise video based on the songs and all the moves, I would have bought the video for myself. To this very day, I'll break out in songs like Hot Potato, Fruit Salad, Here Comes a Bear, and the silly, Do the Monkey. Man, those were awesome times when my kids were little.Did you know that at their highest point, they made more money than AC/DC, Hugh Jackman and many others? The Wiggles did that - all while appealing to the sense of joy, fun, and energy of toddlers, and bringing their parents along for the ride. And, what a ride it was, in that Big Red Car.Even to this day, one of my most favorite video/movies The Wiggles made was with Steve Irwin at the Australia Zoo. At that point, I was just as much a fan of the group as my kids. The documentary showed the amazing steps Anthony, Murray, Jeff and Greg took to get to that moment in their careers. It covers the difficult times after the 9/11 attack in New York City and there were a few moments in their retelling that had me tearing up. The tone was somber, respectful, and introspective. The film also covers why Greg left The Wiggles. By the time that happened, my kids were fully immersed in their school career, and we no longer subscribed to the channel that brought The Wiggles singing and dancing into our lives. I had no idea about the seriousness of Greg's condition, nor the challenges the group faced to find someone to step in for him. Nor did I have a clue as to what role Anthony played in The Wiggles existence as the years went on.After I watched the documentary, I looked at some reviews. Wow - that was a revelation. The film shared some examples but that nowhere touched upon the emotional response and backlash that occurred during the many transitions The Wiggles went through. I even read one where the commenter claimed that Anthony ruined The Wiggles because of the changes and decisions he'd made over the years after two other members retired. After watching the film, I disagree with that sentiment. Anthony saved The Wiggles by keeping it going, keeping their name, music, and presence alive, not letting it fade away until the point in 2019 when they were all able to come together to do a benefit in support of the Australian people who were suffering the worst fire season in the country. Society and pop culture change frequently and what is popular one day becomes lost and forgotten the next. If not for Anthony, I don't think the public would have responded so well and enthusiastically for a band no one remembered. Instead, according to the film clips I saw, many of the attendees were in their 20s, kids that grew up singing and dancing with The Wiggles and were now young adults, with jobs and incomes that allowed them to attend and support the cause. That joy came across the screen and brought me back in time when my kids and I had the best time singing the songs together.Do you know what else I learned while watching this documentary? Anthony and Jeff were a part of a successful singing group called the Cockroaches. One of their songs was played during an interview with Greg and I'm thinking, ""I'd listen to that!"" In fact, if you pay attention, you'll get a hint of the energy and talent that would later contribute to the success of The Wiggles. I also learned the background of Dorothy the Dinosaur. I had no hint how important that character ended up being to their success. I even laughed when I heard how Captain Feathersword came about. Little by little I was seeing how The Wiggles I knew came to be. It was so cool!Another adorable thing I enjoyed while watching the film were the film clips. Parents must have submitted them to the group. They showed their toddlers reacting and interacting with The Wiggles on television and generally having a great time singing, learning and laughing. There is power in laughter and in music.Hot Potato: The story of The Wiggles was one of the most enjoyable documentaries I've ever watched. How the group came to be such a success was fascinating to watch. To think, if not for two of them being teachers, and their passion and joy for teaching, which I believe contributed to the focus of singing songs for preschoolers, I don't think The Wiggles could have come to be. Learning how Anthony, Jeff, Greg and Murray came together to create a singing group that touched generations starting with the littlest of fans, was a sheer joy to experience. I am awfully glad I discovered this film. I highly recommend this documentary for all those who were parents at the time who repeatedly watched the videos and sang the songs with their kids. I think it would be great for those littlest fans, now grown up, to learn more about the men and characters that enriched their childhood. It's fascinating, entertaining and eye opening. This film made me appreciate The Wiggles all the more.",False
7,7,Underrated Legends,maryrosepractice,n/a,16/08/2025,"My biggest flex is that i went to a Wiggles concert with the original four members.Words can't explain how impactful the Wiggles were for multiple generations of children, so seeing them as old men is tear jerking and learning about the personal obstacles they had to overcome is eye opening.Those four dudes are all so smart and talented it's crazy. Incorporating childhood psychology into performances is wild and it explains how the Wiggles became so successful and impactful.Truthfully, there really isn't really much controversy at all around the Wiggles. They're squeaky clean! You can tell the doc is really trying to dig up some kind of dirt surrounding these guys but there's barely anything, which of course is a relief, but it makes for a boring documentary.Still, i learned a few things i never knew and that's all a documentary is really there to do.",False

1,10,Very inspirational,KatieDuncan44,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was crying the whole time I was watching this movie. I was inspired by how she showed love to everyone and to sinners, how she helped society's outcasts and the poorest of the poor and showed them love. How she the charity groups that still exist went to the poorest places all over the world.She was very brave and courageous as well to go into dangerous places. She wasn't judgemental but just loved and served.It was really inspiring and amazing to see her life. Everything she did was about Jesus Christ and serving him. Jesus said if you serve the least of them you are serving me.I really recommend everyone see this movie.",False
2,1,No saint,kevlabg,n/a,15/08/2025,"""MT Mother Teresa was not a friend of the poor. She was a friend of poverty. She said that suffering was a gift from God. She spent her life opposing the only known cure for poverty, which is the empowerment of women and the emancipation of them from a livestock version of compulsory reproduction."" - Christopher Hitchens
Please read The Missionary Position, Mother Theresa in Theory and Practice by Hitchens.Sadly the myth is perpetuated by movies like this one. The reality is dark, painful, and built on the suffering of others. Come to think of it, the reality is much more representative of religion than the myth. Anyhow, give Hitchens a read.",False
3,10,Touching,ancojay-24822,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went into this not knowing much about Mother Teresa. I didn't even know she'd been canonized (officially declared a Saint). She dedicated her entire life to the poor and sick. That's all she did her entire life was give her time to them. She'd go from place to place wherever she was needed most. She personally went into dangerous situations to get people out so they could get help. This documentary consisted of interviews from people that knew her. They talked about the kind of person she was and told lots of stories. That added films and pictures of her and it is so well done. This is truly one of the most touching and inspiring films I've ever seen and I'm not even religious. We all could learn so much from her. She didn't judge anyone, she just wanted to help.",False
4,1,False,dylanpatterson1987,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie highlights the good that she did and feeds into the positive stereotypical view people have of mother Teresa but doesn't address the less talked about evils she committed. Forced deathbed conversions, providing extremely poor medical care,her links to colonialism & racism, as well as her links to some questionable public figures as well. These are all washed away so they can portray her as an ideal, one that she really wasn't if you take the time to look into her background with objectivity. This movie needs to be labeled as a work of fiction for its portrayal of her as a ""saint"", and not the opportunistic money hungry sadist she truly was.",False
5,9,Inspiring,punitivedamages,n/a,15/08/2025,"I came into Mother Teresa - No Greater Love expecting to see a traditional linear documentary covering the life story of Mother Teresa, itself a worthy subject and I suspect would be a good movie. But as is pointed out near the start of the film, it has been 25 years since her death. Maybe that movie would be good but now incomplete.So what this movie does is show that her life - in terms of her impact upon the world - has not ended at all. The film travels to many locations to show the poverty that still exists in Calcutta where it all started, but far beyond also. We see that the Sisters of Charity are seemingly everywhere, ministering to the sick, the poor and in some cases just wiping the tears of the weeping souls. Always with the smiling Mother looking down, but now from her portrait hanging on the wall.It is impossible to walk out of the film without a newer and even deeper appreciation of the life of this Saint. The linear biography that I expected is still there and is done well. Her youth in Albania is shown as a staging point for the life of worldwide travel which followed. She leaves behind her own beloved mother to mother so many others and is not permitted to return until after her mother's death. We witness through the film the blessedness of her sacrifice and selflessness. She lived out the Beatitudes.The film is excellent for both those who are very familiar with Mother Teresa and those who know little. Inspiring.",False
6,10,A beautiful film that conveys the beauty of holiness,rick_rotondi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mother Teresa: No Greater Love is a beautiful documentary that will keep you captivated for the two hour runtime more than most other films.Episodes from the life of Mother Teresa - her childhood in Albania, her leaving as a young women for India as a Loreto Sister, her ""call within a call"" to enter the slums of Calcutta to serve the poorest of the poor - are woven seamlessly into present day vignettes from some of the more than 700 Missionary of Charity homes around the world today.To see Mother and her Sisters serve the poorest of the poor is to encounter the love of God. Thank you David Naglieri for producing this beautiful film.",False
7,10,Lessons for our present world,chaf-83581,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wasn't too sure if I was going to enjoy this movie, as I was alive when she was, so I thought I already knew a lot that there was to know about Mother Teresa. I expected to watch a movie about the life of Mother Teresa when she lived years ago and far away, but I was startled to see a movie about our current society. This woman treated every person with dignity, no matter their status, attractiveness or religion. To her, each one represents Jesus. I came away chastised for my own attitudes of the marginalized, but also willing to change and treat others as the beautiful persons they are. Worth your time.",False

1,10,THIS IS FOR THE DREAMERS AND BELIEVERS,estavro-78878,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Call Me Ted"", the title says it all. A skillfully articulated documentary about Ted Turner, elicited an existential ""wake-up call"" within me. Watching this Maverick, a wounded spirit that managed to stubbornly hold onto his childlike wonder to live his dreams honestly and stand his ground to defend his truth. Never giving up, this wounded human being unabashedly did and said things that most would not dare BUT all with a view to leaving this world a better understanding of its beauty and fragility. Ted shows us that it is normal to falter and be flawed, yet through the knock-downs and betrayals, he kept getting up stronger because he learned from it with humility. The benefic energy Ted Turner imbued in our world will continue spread like wildfire long after he's gone.",False
2,3,"LOVE TED, HATE THIS",Overly-Critical,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI still don't know how to properly provide a review for this cartoonish home video production from an elementary school's audio visual department. The format of audio narration and odd black & white illustration cards completely distract the viewer from obtaining the solid essence of Ted's genius.There must have been a much more entertaining way to present all of the thoughtful interviews from those that were in Ted's close circle of colleagues, competitors, family and friends.Kinda ironic...Without any hesitation I can state firmly that Ted Turner has been extremely instrumental in my motivation to attempt a robust life. Ted is an innovative risk taker and the entire world is better off for his contributions in a myriad of self-effacing enhancements for the public benefit.This presentation attempts to describe in raw details the actual childhood development of Ted, ranging from a troublesome home life and the genesis of his thirst for a 'playboy' and yachting life, and a dramatic immersion into a family advertising business.Making a solid foundation for his future business life, his father's untimely self-inflicted death had thrown Ted into salvaging the family's outdoor advertising business which became a personal success for Ted.He then utilized this business success to ABSOLUTELY revolutionize the '80s television programming utilizing a local station to connect with RCA's satellites which allowed for mass cable networks.He also utilized his survival from a tumultuous personal life, to respect humanity, animals and Mother Earth to present peaceful opportunities to the world and a repopulation of near extinction bison.",True

1,9,Nay-sayers likely disinformation agents,verbpierce,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredible documentary, highlighting the extreme extent of energy industry corruption and world changing technology censorship, from the highest levels of government and private industry.Would have been nice to learn more about how zero-point energy inventions actually work (on a mechanical level). However, the history, dating back over 100 years, of technology suppression is fascinating enough in itself.I was expecting your typical B grade doco, but this piece was superbly put together. Tying in UFO data and black budget stuff towards the end was a great way to end this piece. Looking forward to seeing what Dr Greer has planned for the future.",False
2,9,IGNORE THE NAY SAYERS - Judge it for yourself,casey-42712,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI got a kick out the one 2 star ""reveiwer"" who says he waited for it to come down in price and then just ripped on Dr. Greer with no argument. And obviously did not even watch this. - It was JUST released this week. Whatever, ignore that planted negative.I was very pleased with this - Names, dates, documents, companies, all here.The segment on just how far the Patent Office alone goes to deny patents for verified zero-point energy devices is infuriating.Boths sides, left and right, are missing big pieces of the puzzle, so you can't blame a left or right argument as being 'wrong'.Give it a watch - you may be surprised. No crazy 'reptilians vs the greys' war lunacy, this is how we have been stymied for a replacement of our dependence on fossil fuels. He also takes the 'green energy' fools to task.This is not all fuzzy pictures and crazy stories. Worth your time, and you may just start to see things differently.",True
3,7,Sort of fading the more I think about it.,kellycampbell-04309,n/a,16/08/2025,I agree with those who wonder how Greer became the man who had the keys to the kingdom that briefed presidents generals and three letter agency directors? However I can see how greed and the hunger for power could keep the fossil fuel industry essentially the same for the last 100 years when other areas seemed to evolve greatly such as communications and electronics industries. I would love to see the patent records for these banned devices along with the missing Tesla files. I found the information presented fascinating and well researched. While having my doubts on Greer's claims of access to programs and world leaders.,False
4,10,The Real Deep State,yode25,n/a,16/08/2025,"An eye opening look at how the corruption of Governments and Multinational Companies go hand in hand for the sake of profit and protection of their wealth. All at the cost of humanity.The well presented documentary guides you through the history, and what could have been if not for the greed of energy companys and their comercial interests. Clean energy solutions buried under aggressive governmant policies....innovative scientist bullied or killed. This not a cooked conspiracy theorist documentary, this is the real deep state, an expose of self interst groups and the preventable destruction of our earth.",False
5,10,If this is true then I am sickened by what has gone on.,feverish30,n/a,16/08/2025,"Dr Steven Greer blows the whistle on the constant shutdown of free energy machines and anti-gravity propulsion devices that we have had since the 1960's. If what he is saying is true, then it's pretty sad that this has been shut down by the powers that be time and time again.This is a must watch for everyone. We have the technology now to combat global warming and climate change. I don't have the knowledge to know if what he is saying is true but he cites quite a few relevant sources along with historical evidence from television news broadcasts and military and patent office documents.What gives us hope is that this technology is out there and will soon be open sourced. It goes back to the inventions of Nicola Tesla. It will be a worldwide paradigm shift.The suppression of this technology has been widespread and has resulted in deadly consequences for those who have invented these devices. The only solution is to open source it but thus far no inventor has been willing to do this.I am hoping that this is real, for the sake of humanity.",False
6,10,Yes! 100 % yes!,efsmiley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone should see this fascinating documentary. My eyes were opened and there is a serious amount of factual data here (historically as well) brought to the forefront of where we ACTUALLY are as opposed to where we ACTUALLY could be as a world. Brilliantly done. Bravo! I hope there will be more docs to come from Greer (and I've seen them all to date). I think the biggest obstacle here is how many can actually take the braces off their brains and wake up to the real truth, and then of course, become a part of the solution. I do suggest watching this documentary several times. There's really a lot to absorb, as is true for his previous docs.",False
7,10,Corruption at the highest level to protect only the world leaders & the 1% club,mike-90980,n/a,16/08/2025,I have watched every documentary featuring Dr Steven Greer in relation to extraterrestrial technology and UFO's etc. He is bang on the money what he is saying that all major governments are in possession of such technologies that could begin a zero point energy generation. There are 2 things that is stopping it becoming public.1. It will destroy the world economy and the 1% population who are in power will no longer be in control of the people.2. ReligionDisclosure needs to happen soon before it's too late. David Grusch & Congress hopefully have the ball rolling. Religion beliefs can co-exist with the reality of alien life.Very good watch and a MUST SEE PEOPLE!!,False
8,10,Believable but we will never change.,kurt-24894,n/a,16/08/2025,"A lot of the incidents and events are backed up with good evidence from believable sources. The theory's explained are more than not feasible and would make a difference to us all. But in reality our advancement in civilization and quest to travel past our solar system will allways be suppressed because we have never been civilized between each other. Dr Greer even says the solution is for the human race to become peaceful, however he's pissing in the wind if he thinks that will ever happen and if it ever did we would never be trusted. The human race is destructive and warlike, it's embedded in the DNA and incurable. However great documentary and a nice insight to how all life could be improved.",False
9,n/a,"Lost, Or Stolen?...",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"THE LOST CENTURY tells many stories about inventors who have either had their work taken, destroyed, or buried by government types (FBI, and others). This is all backed up by official documents, news reports, and / or testimonies. The stories are shocking, dating back to the 1920s-80s and even more recently.The common thread is that the inventions were all machines that could either save or produce huge amounts of energy without wasting or costing very much at all. One can see why the government and oil, coal, and gas industries would not want such devices to be popular, since they ran on alternative sources of energy. Even water!There is mention of global warming and other environmental issues, but it's not just the big oil companies etcetera, that are hammered. Solar and wind do not get a pass. They are just as useless as the rest, another industry to make enormous profits, while missing the point. We are in deep trouble, and only something revolutionary will save us.In light of recent governmental revelations on the subject, UFOs and extraterrestrial technology are also discussed, as well as possible hope for a brighter future. A well-presented documentary with tons of information...",False
10,5,It Was OK,npbrpgx,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was looking forward to seeing this documentary and even waited a while for the rental price to get marked down a bit before I took the plunge. To me, Greer's documentaries have actual authenticity and I find them to be based on more solid ground. It's not just the same Talking Heads regurgitating the same old conspiracy theories and re-counting the same old stories over and over again. If I have to hear about Roswell one more time, am I right?Anyway, overall I thought the documentary was fine, but I was disappointed in all the re-creations. I want to see actual footage and photographs. Not re-creations. Re-creations actually made this film less credible. One or two is OK but when the entire film is full of re-creations it kind of loses its potency.Also, Greer has yet to re-create the slickness of ""close encounters of the fifth kind."" That was an engaging documentary with lots of original footage of UFO craft, light beings, and other cool stuff.More of that is what we need!Not that anyone cares, but I think it makes more sense to just interview Dr. Greer in a traditional format rather than filming him give a lecture. It was kind of weird. I dislike these folks who put out so-called ""documentaries"" that are actually just home videos of them giving lectures. I know on the surface it seems like it would be dramatic, but it's not. It's just as boring as sitting through the real thing. Please stop doing this.",False
11,10,One of the most important documentaries I've ever watched,jamesdeberesford-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm 47 and I've been down a lot of rabbit holes. Naturally, at some point I came across Dr. Greer munching a carrot and whilst I broadly agreed with his contention that ET is in town I had some lingering doubts about his overall schtick and moved on. However, Dr Greer was just getting started.Revisiting Greer on a podcast in 2023 he hit me with an avalanche of intriguing facts that made me re-assess my impression of him as a somewhat vain and naive ET evangelist. I duly purchased this documentary, available for only £3.49 on Microsoft's Film & TV app.What can I say? I don't think Dr Greer's utopia will happen but I do believe this film should be watched by all sorts of people who probably never will watch it. Just Stop Oil protesters, for instance. It's one of the most important rabbit holes I've ever been down.",False
12,6,Pushes The Climate Change Myth,drisley-72230,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been following the UFO issue for many decades and have been well aware of Stephen Greer.Initially his documentaries were very interesting. In fact they mostly still are as they know how to produce a good doc.The problem I ask is ""why does a random emergency room doctor know everything about the universe and life, and is called in to debrief US presidents and generals"". It's kind of preposterous to say the least! It's like he's taken the Billie Meier cult nonsense and taken it to the next level.He has collected a very impressive rogue gallery of ""witnesses"" that are borderline credible. I think that's the most impressive part of his ""work"".But again, he's definitely got a messiah complex.In this documentary he's jumped aboard the currently popular ""Climate Change Crisis"" myth. Right off the bat they cite climate change claims and predictions that have been proven false decades ago. He even pushes the ""overpopulation"" as a bad sign when in fact any species that is growing is a sign of thriving.We know based on NOAA satellite data that snow coverage in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing for the past 60 years (nobody mentions this).We know that the earth's green spaces have increased massively - the size of the continental US - over the past 100 years. And NO this is not in snow covered areas, but rather in our deserts (Sahara has greened the most).We know that the earth was warmer during the Medieval times and Roman Warm Period - and humans and crops thrived.Polar Bear population has grown 500% over the past 60 years. Famine is at an all time low. Death due to climate related incidents (which mostly are from cold not heat) are at an all time low down 90% in the past century.The ""thousands of species are becoming extinct every hour"" is also a debunked myth.Most of these achievements have come from relatively abundant and affordable energy like coal. MORE people are dying from this energy being villainized and shutting down of things like coal plants making energy unaffordable.And btw, if this so-called ""free energy"" that he talks about does exist, guess what? It will cause populations to rise even more, cities will grow substantially faster, and third world countries will come to be 2nd and 1st world countries even faster than they already are. What then? The catastrophists are going to call that ""bad"" and do everything they can to make that energy unavailable to control ""overpopulation"".I guess he's got to sell views to make money from the grift and Climate Change Crisis is the current best way to get eyes on your cause.Other than that, again, well made doc but mostly fiction imho.",False
13,1,Post hoc ergo propter hoc,graham-319-209399,n/a,16/08/2025,"Because that, therefore this.What complete & utter tosh. It starts on climate change, with some broad, sweeping claims - then jumps straight to ""space aliens, we can use the same power source as them"" without any indication as to HOW we might manage to do that. We just can. Sure.After that we get a string of low-grade conspiracy-theory 'this guy invented this, then died in mysterious circumstances' drivel.I was yawning by this time.Then we jump back to how the space aliens' technology can fix everything... again with no mention at all as to how this might be achieved, as currently no-one has a clue how they do it; if they do it at all; if they actually exist.If they do exist, why don't they ever drop in where people can see them properly. Always some backwater where the only camera around can't take clear pictures.And, of course the entire underlying consipracy theory - the gubment is keeping all this good stuff away from us, for some nefarious purpose.Amazon ought to be ashamed of giving budget and air-time to this type of delusional programming... or at least market it as a comedy, not to be taken seriously.",False
14,10,I found the movie extremely insightful for why things have failed to progress in Physics.,benkohn-86965,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every Physicist that has been around for 50 years agrees that something has gone wrong in Physics. There was so much promise and discussion in the early 50's. Only to have in the mid 50's a very very GREAT SILENCE that began and continues to date about antigratics. Coincidences like this are like thinking bears use outhouses in the woods. I find almost the best comedy in those criticizing Greer as dumbos with no credentials. Stephen has 30 years of actual experience and I have followed him and his consistent building of the proof for all but mentards that refuse to even bother to look carefully. Incredible and disgusting as the power brokers' actions may be, who would not do the same to safeguard their power and empire worldwide if they could? With the funds just of the Petro-Chemical industry alone it would barely take their pocket change to buy every country off if and where needed in politics. It would not take much effort at all to see these corporations and those above them could so easily do what was needed and when. Just look at the replies of all the drones with the truth as they can not even accept the simplest facts from 100 years of careful but so so limited UNDUE influence, MANKIND HAS NEXT TO NO CHANCE even 8 billion against 1000 unless we at least are intellectually active enough to SOMETIMES throw of the shackles of such simple lies and the actions of so so few. We have been in a Matrix of undue influence just as we were obviously for over a hundred years till in the last 20 years also from the tobacco industry. Remember how no court or Congressional committee could break into that conspiracy that Tobacco was not a grave danger to those that used and those who even did not but were passive smokers too. No like the idea of the genocide of the American Indians and the Holocaust it is so much easier to act like an ostrich and just bury our heads in the waste of a sewer of ignorance, selfishness and apathy criticizing the serious efforts of others. We have two choices. Either work to make a better world by apposing those that want us servile and ignorant which almost surely would lead to a ""Mad Max"" kind of hell on Earth or just get one's asses in gear to stop all the nonsense of self aggrandizement. So if we raise up and tell all it is time after more than 80 year for full disclosure for all programs directly and indirectly funded or manned by people in our armed services or we shall just remain enslaved more an more tethered into a future dystopia, It would not even be at all difficult to throw off the bonds of tyranny yet not by throwing Dr. Greer and his 755 patriots who risked much by telling the truth. You decide as a brighter utopian future has always been prophesied but THAT future has never been projected as certain for lazy and selfish fools and cowards.",False
15,10,"Every Engineer of all specialties, a must watch for your awareness. Well done by Dr. Greer!",laniaulicino-61022,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerContains basic scientific explanations, case studies with evidence and motive given for suppression of free energy devices and more, guidance for current engineers and inventors with an entrepreneurial mindset and positive motives for humanity.Definitely not just for ""believers.""
This film is for scientists, true researchers, engineers, and all interested in technology development and the US Patenting office/system.Film really points to the moral crises of our times, the awful toll on humanity that we see today, because bottom line economic measurements (valuation) doesn't include true environmental cost measurements.Highlights the bravery, as well as unselfishness, needed among us as intelligent inventive beings on this earth.Definitely an informative and necessary watch for those who have a stomach for the hard truth of business as usual/ status quo/ and believe themselves to be in the know.",True
16,10,Believe and Take Action,emailrjw,n/a,16/08/2025,This movie will help you believe in the beautiful future within our grasp. The future Greer and his team are tirelessly working SO hard to help us manifest. But they cannot do it alone and we cannot be spectators in this. What is outlined here is 100 percent possible and it is our destiny if we make it so. Start by stepping out of the matrix and watching the real story of how we got to this place and the roadmap clearly demonstrating how we turn this earth ship around. Then follow through by sharing it with every single person you know. Those two steps alone and we are more than halfway there. Stunning work from Dr. Greer as usual. I'm not even going to discuss this as a film it is a prophecy. With deep gratitude I say Thank You to Greer and team from the bottom of my heart and the hearts of my loved ones brave warrior; we need you now more than ever before and you delivered.,False
17,10,A powerful documentary explains the race to fight to save our planet from the greedy 1 percents and the military industrial complex.,vhdonahue,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very courageous and brave Dr Steven Greer brings us this powerful and insightful documentary about the fight between greed and hope.The greedy oil,coal,gas industries together with the military industrial complex, will stop short of nothing including burning up our planet to keep their greed, power and control over the planet.The documentary talks about the Godfather style mafia suppression by the oil and gas industries over the sustainable zero energy emitting technologies . We have had these technologies for over a100 years.. done Tesla..Hence the lost century..
Dr Greer urges the scientist behind these earth sustainable technologies to put their inventions on open source, to share with the world so anybody could continue and none would be lost.Shocking to hear about the Shadow government wth a fully equipped super airforce operating on our tax dollar money's to reverse engineer other star system technologies for their greedy power and control of the world.And..Finally.. hope.. The Open Source Zero Energy technology base initiated by Dr Steven Greer with the help of the public.Very well done.",False
18,10,A vision of hope for us and planet,yvolpe-97559,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThis documentary was well done. The narrative was easy to follow. The science was understandable and the political influences behind global warming. It successfully represents 0 gravity theory and shows the hard truth of the cover up thats an ongoing deception regarding the earth's shift and change . We are the creators of our destiny and if we unify and demand change we can choose a better path to take. The film reveals the history of the dark govt's cover up of the ufos some which are man made copies of the real extra terrestrial samples. The ongoing deception around gas oil and the trillionares that control the overlay society with the rampant consumerism. The information confirmed for me the dome shaped homes I saw in a vision given to me by other evolved beings. Cheers to Dr. Greer and crew.,True

And it held my attention in a steady grip all to the end.This movie is thinking out of the box about realitie and it is happening now. They will continue to destroy our possibilities until enough people snap out of it.Are you so afraid to see proof of how peoples lame blind trust towards leaders and corpurations is used to continue destroying the possible future?By recomending some one ells to se This film - you contribute to save a life and change the outcome and future of many. Just by watching this movie.I think this movie is a important contribution to humanities realisation of ""enough is enough"".It may be The mark and the turningpoint in mindset for us all.I dare you to see this thrilling and entertaining film!",False
20,7,Revelations but with poor sound,boiler_splosion,n/a,16/08/2025,"I work in the TV industry and with some very talented people both on the engineering and artistic sides of the business. I watched the film yesterday and, although the content was ground breaking and very interesting, the production was marred by poor sound throughout. Steven's voice on the podium was boomy and distorted and the miserable droning music under (over?) most of the dialogue was very off-putting and annoying. Music played to add specific emphasis is ok but this must be applied sensitively. A highly interesting subject but difficult to watch. The groundbreaking research that Steven Greer has done since I saw him during a live conference in London must be applauded.",False
21,2,Same old Greer,garryoke,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, what can I say?Same old bullish, arrogant, aloof, rude, full of his own self importance, look at me look at me, Greer.The same story and message AGAIN as well.Don't bother unless its free on a flight somewhere and you've just seen a UFO out the window.I kept nodding off so Im sure I missed the usual Greer Tears, mentioning his Uncle was part of the Space Programme, or the Presidents and CIA men he's debriefed, ..and demands for our money of course.To me, he really is the TV evangelist of the UFO world now.Wait for it to get slammed on Youtube and watch others review just the highlights.",False
22,10,A must watch- May the Truth be Victorious,dazleon,n/a,16/08/2025,"We won't settle for anything less than the world that has been envisioned at the very end of the movie. Thats what our children deserve. Thank you for all your efforts and courage to come forward.This documentary is made beautifully. Its a talk that Dr Stefan Greer is delivering is front of an audience that seems to be containing bright minds. There's in depth discussion of all the amazing inventions that had the capability to change the life on our planet and how thet were suppressed violently.Who could stop these inventions from coming forth? To find out, watch and use your own dissernment.Is there something we can do? Are we able to reverse the effects of global warming/ climate change?There are answers in this documentary. Watch it and please rate it because more and more people need to see it. I am excited by what these people are upto. Its a mass movement for positivity and interplanetary harmony.",False
23,1,Scientific nonsens for those who want to believe,The_Mad_Scientist,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sorry but what is presented in this movie is complete nonsense. They take parts of science text books and use it completely wrong and out of context in order to advertise cheap unrealistic conspiracies.What is left is a global conspiracy theory about world domination, aliens and unlimited energy that is kept from us. With that idea it hits the nerve of many who want to believe in things like that.I understand not everyone can have a science degree. And it sounds so promising hearing about infinite energy and space travel. But you may ask yourself why would even a ""small"" physics teacher at school know this is wrong? These are proven facts! So ehy would anyone believe in someone talking instead of science?Trust the science instead of people making money from you buying/watching this movie.If the conspiracy were that big thet could influence almost every scientist on earth, why would it be possible you can watch it on any random streaming platform?I know life would be great if we could fly, have unlimited energy and could go to space as we want. But its just not a scientific possibility. If you feel like ""but this (science topic) is real"" (and it probably is) google a bit why this cant be used as they pretend to.Many things are really not that hard to understand (like one of the first things they mention is ""zero point energy"") why it doesn't work as shown in this video.Dont sacrifice your intellect for the small hope of having a better world.There is so much real science can still discover. And there is so much normal people like us should be fighting for. Dont waste your energy on stupid nonsense from people who just want your money!Start simple and dont watch this movie.",False

This is the best documentary I've watched in a long time! Thank you for bringing this to horrible injustice into the light! We could be living a whole other life right now but the powers that be have been shutting it down and unaliving anyone who has tried to bring this into the light. This documentary was so well put together and I strongly encourage everyone to watch it. There is no doubt in my mind that we can all come together move forward to get passed this. If there was ever something that people should be protesting at the doors of the Capitol about it would be THIS! I for one will be spreading the word of this documentary to anyone who will hear it!,False

1,10,AMAZING STUFF,lolly67,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe show was at times a tad slow, but to see the first person go to unheard of ocean depths made every second worth it. I loved watching the loaders show animals that I had never seen nor heard of before. It is fascinating to watch not just because of the amount of ocean on our planet that has never been explored before, but the creation of a submersible that allows a human to go to such crushing depths. For me, just seeing sharks that have not changed since the days of the dinosaurs is exciting. I would love to see more of this to find who knows how many species we have yet to even lay eyes on. FASCINATING!",True
2,9,Fascinating!,gavinkristyhowell,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTo be able to explore the deepest areas of our planet that have never been seen before was very intriguing! It was indeed over-dramatized at times, but the video footage was so crystal clear and breathtaking as they navigated the deepest and most treacherous underwater landscapes. I actually learned a lot; the marine life they acquired on the floor of the south sea unlocked secrets to treating glaucoma. And the Java trench revealed what appeared to be underwater avalanches that may be a contributor and future predictor of devastating tsunamis. Also in the Java trench, where the tectonic plate shifting occurs, ""speed bump"" like features on the floor of the west tectonic plate are causing the plate movement to become jammed at times, causing pressure to build up in the plates. When the pressure build-up eventually overcomes these ""speed-bump"" land masses, the result may also be a contributor to a sudden and devastating tsunami. I highly recommend this documentary!",True
3,5,Over dramatized and phony.,nvmsmfft,n/a,15/08/2025,"What could have been the most awesome discovery documentary of all time, this show quickly showed that it was going to be an over dramatized poorly edited soap opera. With fake scenes of chaos when nothing bad ever happens or happened it was really disappointing they have to prey on looming catastrophe every scene. For 10 minutes approximately of footage of the ocean bottom and creatures per episode it was almost unbearable to watch the 40 minute edit of the other filler. In what seems like another self journey of yet another millionaire with a hand picked crew rallying around him. This was a hard watch. There are far better shows out there and unfortunately don't recommend anyone going out of their way to watch.",False
4,3,Very good show- Terrible producing,gerrym-85798,n/a,15/08/2025,The show is very interesting. Drug out some times with filler but that's getting normal.WORST part is the producer has been watching too many You Tube videos... The back ground music is so loud that you can't hear the people speak. The only way to watch is to turn the Closed Captioning on and read the spoken words. Did no one watch this after it was put together and before it aired?,False

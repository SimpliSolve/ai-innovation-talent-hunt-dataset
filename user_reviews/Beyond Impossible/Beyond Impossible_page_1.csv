1,4,Who is paying these people?!,confirmeddeath,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought this was going to be a good documentary diving into the cons and pros, but instead, we got these so called ""professors"" and ""Doctors"" and philosophers and everybody else with a degree explaining how a vegan diet is impossible?I buy that they claim such things, but then the whole thing goes further by trying to discredit the cons of meat. They make excuses for anything that vegans supposedly say is negative about the meat industry.At one point, they try to discredit the water footprint of cows by claiming 94% of the water a cow drinks comes from rain water and that the cows piss it out into the green pastures so it's all good. No mention of how 99% of the milk and meat cows are locked cages, but rather insinuate they all walk the green pastures of heaven!What?!At one instance they show a clip of a guy saying if he could, he'd make the meat industry go into thin air and the commentary is ""Oh wow, did he really say that?"" insinuating the guy as some super villain and a soulless cow murderer...This is a bunch of people who have no empathy nor any sympathy for animals. I didn't watch the whole thing as it was absurd!I'm not a vegan, not even a vegetarian...",False
2,6,a meh documentary,crapacount6,n/a,15/08/2025,"This seems to be a reaction to the almost religious pro vegan documentaries, which was to be expected.However it does not give any new information.Eat whatever you want, certainly don't follow diet's because they are hip, just check your own results.",False
3,3,Very Biased,ret-63858,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like the premise of this documentary, but right from the start you can hear and see the hatred and condescension of vegans, in the narrator's voice and face. Instead of an open-minded disclosure of facts, it's almost like a paid advertisement from the meat producers' industry.I gave it three stars because there are some things in there that I can research on my own to come up with an informed decision.You may want to watch this because of the catchy title, but it is really just an attack on the owner of Beyond Meat with a lot of jealousy and vitriol thrown in - not very palatable.",False
4,1,Bad-bad-bad,innovate-76053,n/a,15/08/2025,"Incredible amount of misinformation.Just amazing to see such a bunch of ignorant people pretending to be right with ""smart"" comments in favor of the consumption of red meat, that global warming is literally fake and basically ""say-no-to-plants"" because they do more harm than good... ????Real science is invisible to them. They belong to the flat-earth cult. SAME level of intelligence!Just a total waste of time.Sad to se this kind of ""documentary"" in 2022.",False
5,1,Beyond Terrible,smetin,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a meat-eater, but making concsious steps to reduce my meat consumption - mainly to reduce my environmental impact and after watching animal cruelty documentaries.This 'documentary' was absolutely terrible - the main narrator had an annoying tone, which wasn't great to start with. It was badly paced and the points were all over the place. There was no flow or narrative that made sense. The 'experts' brought in were hardly leaders in the fields. There was also a distinct lack of balance and there was such a biased approach towards the brands that make faux-meat, that it came across as pro-meat show that condemns eating fruit/vegetables.I finished this show just to write this review and am just aghast that it was ever commissioned. The fact they compare vegetarianism/veganism to Scientology cult-like behavior should be enough to deter you. As a meat-eater, I am embarrassed that this is the best attempt to put people off a lifestyle to reduce meat intake.",False
6,10,"Brilliant, Eye Opening Unbiased Truth",HammBurger,n/a,15/08/2025,"Brilliant indictment of the Fake-Meat industry.This film exposes the very violent tendencies of the militant-vegan. For sure, not all vegans are like this. That is to say, those who want to hurt or end human life to save an animals life. But it is all there (truth) put on video for all to see. Unhinged vegans promising to harm or kill other people. This brilliant documentary is not anti-vegan, but its important to see (albeit a very small percent of them) how they 'the unhinged vegan' exposes them self to the world.This film also expose's very bad dogma from the likes of ""Dr"" Walter Willet of Harvard, who could be very well compromised by a food industry to push an agenda. As well as, ""Dr"" John McDougall (Now Dead at 77) who thinks sugar is good for people with diabetes. Dean Ornish has his own issues that need to be noted too. I can't even find the words to describe Michael Greger ""vegan doctor"" and the nonsense coming out of his mouth. Ethan Brown & Pat Brown, two of the founders of this fake-meat industry, and the things that come out of their mouth really need to be heard to understand how misguided they are when it come to your health. You truly need be lookout for this Eco-terrorism. Eat more ethically raised beef, pork & chicken. Its better for you and yes, the planet too.It should also be noted, the very thing vegans hate they love the imitation of. So, I'm really opposed to eating other animals, but no opposition to the look, feel and taste of that of which I hate. Huh, really...?Alec Baldwin (Militant Vegan, and Accused Murderer) doing his best to look hip, cool and relevant (complete failure) with a black background, and his ""tech innovators"" bit made me laugh out loud. Man has survived all this time with out ""tech"" in our food. His very dangerous thinking & views are going to make many people sick.I've viewed this amazing film more than a few times, and keep learning how unhealthy it is to consume fake food (processed with unhealthy seed-oils). The added garbage in this fake meat is not good for you. Vinnie Tortorich, who cares for your health, should have called this documentary: An Inconvenient Truth. Had that title not already been taken, by a film with much untruths.You really need to share this brilliant film with all you know. A very powerful documentary indeed.Please, Support Your Local Farmers. Grass feed / finished beef as well as other healthy and tasty animals (Pork, Chicken & Eggs) are so very good and full of nutrition for the health of your body. Again, healthy for the planet too.",False
7,1,An absolute JOKE of a documentary,boyjamesyboy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Vinnie, a 58 yr. Old anti-vegan who looks 68, calls himself a Fitness Consultant. First line of this doc is ""You've been lied to."" Yes indeed, Vinnie, if one attributes any veracity to this ant-vegan rant, then they will soon realize how you've lied. Never have I seen a doc so full of holes, misinformation and ignorant of veganism, that it emerges as a total joke, just like its filmmaker.Vinnie cries that no one would debate him about healthy diets, as he contacts professional doctors and nutritionists who have devoted their careers to nutrition, as if they should waste their time with this insignificant U-tuber who has a vendetta against the plant-based food industry. He slams this industry for its ""capitalistic"" endeavors, while he builds his own career and following of anti-vegans, the hypocrisy seeps thru the holes.Vinnie cries that this industry is too processed, too unhealthy and too inferior, while simultaneously ignoring the meat industries like Smithfield, JBS, Foster Farms...so many others, who process their enslaved and tortured animals with hormones, antibiotics, vitamin supplements and more to combat the feces, urine, ammonia, viruses and other diseases in which they are forced to endure until their execution.",False
8,9,Lot of biased reviews here!!,legnipj,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's interesting to read some of the reviews. If you come in with a closed mind and obvious bias, your review isn't really worth anything. Ths documentary is presented in a way to counter the health and societal impacts of eating meat. Could it be better, sure...it would have been great if some ""experts"" from the other side would have showed up, but they decided not too. There were some interesting thought provoking topics in the film. For example, the US has cut down on red meat by 40% of the last few years...but obesity and heart disease has still grown at alarming rates. There's a lot to take out of this movie, but again it would have been nice to get an actual debate going with educated representatives on both sides, but one side didn't want to participate.",False
9,1,The trailer is enough to know this is rubbish,hahnutube,n/a,15/08/2025,"""If you don't change your ways now the planet is going to end in 2 years""
Really. This guy is saying vegans eating processed fake meats is going to cause the end of the world in the next 2 years? What will he say when that doesn't happen?",False
10,8,"It must be true ,look at all the comments made by vegans",onlinevirtual,n/a,15/08/2025,Seems plausible to watch and interesting as you would have to be nuts to think fake meat is good for you.It brings into question the usual agendas and garbage being pushed through all channels to eat less meat.Why it tastes yummy.Animal rights ? You have the right to be tasty.,False
11,2,Bad documentary,kouts-48386,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a meat eater and a plant eater too.Trying to eat both 50/50 and enjoy good documentaries to learn things.But oh boy is bad, dont watch it, i only managed to watch almost 40 min.",False
12,1,Had high hopes!,rzbtmnqr,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am a cinephile and I love all movie genres, especially hard hitting documentaries, so I had high hopes for this film. However, it was an absolute dumpster fire. Other reviews claim it is misleading or contain misinformation without giving examples. I wasn't taking notes as I TRIED to enjoy its presentation but I would have needed a stenographer to catalogue all the BS. Some glaring highlights:1) plant based protein is tainted by the interests of ""big corporations"" such as Beyond/Impossible...ummmm big-ag anyone? The scale of big corporations in the meat industry absolutely dwarfs these emerging food technology companies.2) ""by catch"" of animals killed in the production of plant based calories (eg. Run over by combines, grazers killed to protect crops) means that vegans can't make an ethical argument. The reality is that the conversion of plant calories into animal calories is inherently VERY inefficient so not only do you have to kill the animal to eat it, the feed that went into raising it ALSO had this ""by catch"" effect - only it is magnified by that conversion inefficiency.3) Raising animals for food doesn't have a negative effect on land use and wild spaces because much of it occurs on marginal land. Here's an idea if you want to protect habitat: let these marginal lands return to the wild! Let them be resown by mixed species of plants, trees and their attendant bugs, worms, birds, bats etc. Etc.4) We needn't be concerned about methane from cows because it doesn't persist in the atmosphere like C02....except that in reality, before it breaks down has 1000X the greenhouse effect! Wow, just wow...The above is the tip of the iceberg of the stream of garbage that is Beyond Impossible - steer clear!FYI I am neither vegan nor vegetarian and very much enjoy the modest amount of red meat in my diet as well as the eggs from the chickens we raise (and when we need to ""dispatch"" a bird, we have a first hand connection in getting it into the meat freezer). I suspect the film maker never makes an authentic connection with the flesh from the meat-foam-pod tree that HIS diet consists of...I was afraid that I would see a take-down of Beyond/Impossible (I eat and enjoy both brands) in this film, fortunately I can continue down this path guilt free.",False
13,1,Teeming with misinformation,TheBrigand,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just awful, and teeming with misinformation. No doubt in part funded by the meat industry. The guy has zero credibility. And the ""one"" good review says he should post it on the ""conspiracy subreddit"". That explains a lot right there.",False
14,1,ALOT of false information,kaitlyncrozier,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you want to eat plants great. If you want to eat meat okay then do so. I won't judge what others choose to eat. However, this movie is rubbish! This guy is making so much false claims it's cringey! Claiming red meat doesn't result in heart disease but vegetarians get strokes. Really? A vegetarian can get a stroke depending on if they're eating excesses of fats, dairy, sugars, and eggs. Not because those foods are all necessarily unhealthy but in excess they can be. This guy argues about the classic B-12. It is well known even among doctors that all of us should supplement B-12. Animals have B-12 by eating manure and nasty soil and it's been said again and again it's not the best source of B-12. Also, this guy mentions obesity increase and correlates that with fake meat because it's fat free. Seriously? Obesity isn't directly correlated with eating vegan or meat. It's about what foods you're actually eating like fried foods and soda vs whole foods and leaner proteins. This documentary is far from being an intelligent discussion about plant based and meat eating.",False
15,9,Snowflakes will clutch pearls and many will get the vapors.,beezar-66805,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watch Vinnie's other movies, FAT: A Documentary 1 & 2. He destroys the opposition with real science, not the government and medical ""pros"" who have an extreme vested interest in treating an illness and not preventing illness.This movie shows every thing wrong with the latest fad of heavily processed 'meat substitutes' and who makes profit on making and keeping you sick and overweight.Atta boy, Vinnie. Thanks for your work. To celebrate I'm having a thick ribeye steak, butter on top, and a couple of fried eggs.",False
16,1,Disgustingly biased against vegans,kaylasallywilde,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not a vegan, or even a vegetarian, but why is this ""documentary"" trying to demonize people who care about animals or the planet and the future of humankind?? There is one weird, hateful man who goes on and on about how dumb vegans and vegetarians and conservationists are, and doesn't base anything he says on any science or real studies. For an hour and twenty minutes. It's extremely boring and not fact based, but instead one guys opinion that vegans are terrible. Most boring and hateful ""documentary"" I've ever seen.",False
17,10,Who is this guy?,blemmel19,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is on the scale of a very well-done YouTube video with alt media vibes. I was glad to see this film had been made. Lots of excellent new information and some great reminders.Vinnie, you need to get someone to post this on the conspiracy subreddit. They will love you and buy your films, like I did. Watching Fat now.",False
18,3,Biased as usual,snagssharkteeth-23785,n/a,15/08/2025,"Its a shame movies like this do not allow positive progress and always retard the every wonderful potential for biological advancement.I love beyond meat burgers and yes I have read the ingredients which makes sense as to why they cost so damn much and that is the reason I buy them sparingly.Any chef will tell you a good dish is a dish with a alrge variety of ingredients. The more ingredients you have the more potential you have for a very complex and advances dish. Which is why you have one beyond meat pattie at five bucks. If that will stop me from buying a twenty dollar box of pharmaceuticals meds, then that is fine with me.I cant stand the we need meat idea, its revolting and its the reason I stopped watching this. I had hope this was a pro life doco but it wasnt it.It was a stay wher you are and get sick doco.",False
19,9,Correlation between meat abstainance and MH,phildoesaikido,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are meta-analysis out there demonstrating the correlation between abstainance and mental health issues. To see vegans blow up the comments inclines me to agree.If the vegan lobby can pump out their propaganda there needs to be Ying to that Yang.Let's be clear here. For tens of thousands of years mankind has been omnivores.Documentary is a little bit biased at times, but no where near as much as vegan docs. Having sat through some of the vegan documentaries I often felt like the quiz master in Billy Madison ... Everyone is that bit more stupid having listened to it.Great thing about life is personal decision making and having animal protein in your diet equips you better to make good decisions.",False
20,1,Tinfoil hatters rejoice,lukebjcurran,n/a,15/08/2025,The trailer sums up the entire documentary. A great way to spend an hour for flat earthers. There is no solid thesis nor data that substantiates said thesis. Don't waste your time.,False
21,n/a,Mouth for hire by the meat industry?,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just wasted a credit on the Kanopy streaming service with this dud! I thought this would be an expose on sloppy food processing, but within a few seconds I saw that it's the man's diatribe against a vegan diet, and his tone is strident and condescending. Also, the sign of a poorly made documentary is the fact that he spews out a mish mash of specious claims hoping they'll stick to whoever.I'm 70 and stopped eating meat in 1972, and then (with rare exceptions) eliminated dairy a couple of decades ago. I don't preach about dietary habits, but this fakumentary riled me enough to comment.Thanks to all who pitched in to comment!",False
22,3,Pick a Side,jonthonyjohnson,n/a,15/08/2025,"I found this very informative but repeating the same message over and over and over. I also found if you remove the narrator, this documentary was subliminally promoting it's adversary. This documentary seemed to place me in a seat to pick a side.",False
23,10,Let everyone believes in their own,yazzswoop,n/a,15/08/2025,"Veganism is just current fashion and fashion is constantly changing. People have always eaten meat and no religion can change that. Vegans are constantly showing a great deal of intolerance towards people who think differently. Everyone can have their own opinion and everyone can live by their own principles, especially if it comes from our roots.",False
24,10,Outstanding expose on a dirty little secret,doogie-52166,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a well-produced, exceptionally researched, passionate expose' on a very inconvenient truth. Veganism and Vegetarianism are the only eating disorders that cannot be identified as such because of the powerful cult-like mafia that protects them. This is a very small step in the right direction to expose that.",False
25,10,A Must See!,ghouseck,n/a,15/08/2025,"You can learn something if you're willing to listen. Like with most people that can't defend their narrative, they just won't participate in a debate.",False

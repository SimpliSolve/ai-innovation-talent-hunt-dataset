1,10,Second actual review?!,Armageddan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Obviously if you love the series, watch this! Any excuse for me to witness the greatest MC in the galaxy, I'm all over it!!Man can I relate to MC Grinder, here to get you hyper, and all his turbulent troubles! I, also have had government council letters from DTI all up in my grill, just deal with it innit?!Just make sure you don't let the man dem house music, full arm sleeve wet wipe bring you down.To be honest, I'm still coming to terms with the fact that Decoy's fam ain't Jamaican blood, naa mean!?And don't mention tings but pretty sure I could flatten Beat's missus Roche like a self levelling compound just saying.Last but not least big up the Isleworth massive, I sees ya!Apologies, ignore all that rubbish, watch the series, maybe the film, and love it as much as myself!! Genius!",False

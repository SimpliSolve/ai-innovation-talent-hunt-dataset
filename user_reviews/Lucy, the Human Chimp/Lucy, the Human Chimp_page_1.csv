1,8,Why we shouldn't experiment like this,kagey-28769,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't really want to watch this as you'll know that it's always going to be upsetting and very emotional. It managed that in chunks .Why anyone ever thought it would be a good idea turning a chimp human is beyond cruel in reality.This programme was made in a similar way as C4 and it prisoners abroad series with reconstructions and narrative and the real person talking .It was a heartbreaking watch and you do hope in the end that Lucy did manage to find a life that she was meant to have , if only briefly.If anything good does come from it must be that Janis found her place in the world caring for more chimps in Ghana and still doesIf you don't want to have tears and a lump in your throat thinking about this for a long time then don't watch.",False
2,8,Amazing story about the bond between human and animal (and of human folly),socal_local,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've always had an interest in primates. And, though I've heard about the works of Goodall and Fossey, I never knew of Carter with Lucy. So, I watched with great interest because it's a fascinating, if not at times infuriating, documentary.First of all, I've seen some online criticism of Carter for her attempt to rehabilitate Lucy. The real scorn should be directed at the. Temerlins. It's abhorrent what they did with their 'experiment' to see if they could make a chimp more human. A mother being drugged up then stealing her baby to never be seen again is pure cruelty. Then years later, the Temerlins decide the chimp is no longer worth the trouble so they send her off to Africa to see if she can live in the wild. Horrible people. I give credit to Carter as their assistant for sticking it out all those years to ensure Lucy could survive on her own. But, I could not help think while watching, that Lucy's life was so domesticated with humans, that it might have made more sense to just let her finish her life back in the US, even if at a zoo.The documentary is done in a style that we're seeing more of lately where archival footage is mixed in with reenactments with actors. One thing that left me guessing was at the end where is was mentioned that a search party found the 'scattered remains of Lucy'. Scattered remains? Does that mean foul play? The director could have elaborated on this even if it was not certain.",True
3,7,Pretty Fascinating,mycannonball,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the end, this expose is as much about the young woman who devotes her life to trying to get a human-raised chimp to adapt to the wild. It's a study of human psychology and isolation as much as it is one of chimp behavior. Weirdly fascinating.",False
4,9,"Janis, the Simian Human",paul2001sw-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are many stories about ""human"" chimps; chimpanzees raised as humans, who fit in well with their adopted families until they reach maturity, whereupon they become tragic creatures, unable to live as either man or animal. This film is in fact more interesting than its title suggests; as what it really does is tell the story of the attempt to re-animalise its nominal protagonist, and of Janis, the woman who set herself the task of reintroducing her into the wild. As such, it's more a story of a simian human, who ultimately was driven from the chimpanzee community in the same way any chimp who loses a dominance struggle might be ejected. This person, however, who provides most of the narrative to the story, is not only still alive, but also intelligent and clear sighted; and has in fact devoted the rest of her life to rehabilitating chimpanzees, albeit with less intimate involvement than she had with her first patient. It's an absorbing story, illuminating by Janis's innate decency and her insight into what makes us human, and what we share with our closest living relatives.",False
5,10,❤❤,shaunskerbitz,n/a,15/08/2025,Lucy and Jane's story was such a beautiful story. Great job to the actors portrayal. I had all the feels❤,False
6,7,Worth watching.,jewelch,n/a,15/08/2025,A device that in many documentaries is either stiff or profoundly unreal but under Alex Parkinson's direction -- and with Lorna Nickson Brown in the role of Janis Carter -- rings true. The story is really about the companionship between a Human And a Chimp. James Welch Henderson Arkansas 5/4/21.,False
7,10,Fascinating story about folly and redemption,TheRealMarQs,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am absolutely and unconditionally blown away by this, and I am so grateful for this documentary, for it bringing this amazing story to my awareness!The only bad thing about this gem is its title. It says absolutely nothing about the depth and nuances of the film. It is about so much more than a chimp living with humans. That part is more or less in the films past. To my mind this is in a way a story about redemption, even penance. Lucy is done a great wrong by being taken from her natural state and brought up as a human (regardless of how much love they have had for her). And a human ""sacrifice"" is made, an innocent girl brought by circumstances to stay in the wild and become chimp-like, in order for the ""sin"" to be redeemed. It is an absolutely fascinating and breathtaking story. And it is to a large part told by that person herself, which makes it so real and heartfelt.As for the means of telling the story, I think it is done very nicely, with a well-balanced mix of archive-footage, present interview and re-enactment that has an authenticity to it that is not always the case in that area.How was I able to live almost 46 years in this world before hearing of this out-of-the-world-and-over-the-moon real-life story?! And how on earth could this film have been out for two years and not have more votes and reviews?!",False
8,10,"Born in the human world, raised by the human parents.",Reno-Rangan,n/a,15/08/2025,"Most of the human and (wild) animal relationship movies are comedies and mostly targeted audience were children, families. Its either entertainment film or the documentary film.Take for instance, take the recent film based on the real,The One and Only Ivan (2020)or any DisneyNature films. But there are some fine realistic films too we can find, and this is one of those.Very emotional tale, reminded me of the Jane Hawking, the wife of Stephen Hawking from the film,The Theory of Everything (2014). Yes, a woman who dedicated all her life for another person, like a servant, slave. The commitment she expected nothing in return.In this story, if she wanted, she could have looked after her own life, instead she dedicated to Lucy, a human chimp that's born in the human world, raised by the human parents and sent to live the wild life as it meant to be in the African jungle.Was it a right decision? Very debatable among the commoners and the experts. But 40 years ago the world was different than what human think and do today.They had not had the original footages, so they recreated it with the actors to accomplish the project. It was a short film, but very good. I hope this will turn into a real motion picture. I definitely want that.",False
9,9,"Watch this film, it is good",andras-ocskay,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was happy to see this documebt about Lucy and the others. I remember when I wasa kid I was very impressed with Janis, and as I kid I wanted to have a chimpansee at home also:')
It was good to see those pictures and dreamt a lot about them how they lived together, what kind of experience they have, and what could they share and learn about each other.I am glad to see this documantary.As a film I only have problem with the music, as its so manipulative. Also some visual effects and added sound effects takes from the enjoyment rather than add to it.Added effects was not needed in this film, I dont know why they ruin the feeling with it.Without this chesy music and special effects it could be 10 starts.I am still curious what they learned, and what kind of own thought Lucy had.When nobody ask anything but Lucy wants to express herself and say someting, or ask something.I am really curious what Lucy asks, what she wanted to know.I would love to see more of that part in the movie.Interesting to see also how much Janis learned, and what phases she went thorough.Never though her side that much in this subject before, I was always think about the chimps rather than the human part in it.If you love chimps as well, or even if dont like them yet, watch this movie!",False
10,1,Don't waste your time,gnew-73960,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a pointless tale. None of this matters. These people basically tortured an animal for their own pleasure? What's up with this weird old woman and her unnatural position on the relationship between human and chimp. This was weird and pointless and should not not be celebrated. This wasn't an accomplishment in science and nothing came out of this whole ""experiment"", except this dumb documentary however many years later. This was unchecked recklessness under the guise of science. Nothing positive was showcased in this movie and don't doubt multiple ethical issues were ignored or covered up. Nothing redeeming about this film.",True
11,10,SUPERB!!!,brandoncallen-58930,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is by far one of the best documentaries I have EVER seen, I had no idea going into this I would be so completely blown away. The story all though tragic in some ways left me with absolute love in my heart. I think Janis Carter is one of the most selfless people I have ever seen. Not to mention a complete and total badass. She met this chimp at a summer job to earn a few dollars to pay for school. This chance meeting leads to a life long love story, one that continues to this day. Janis is such a beautiful strong woman. What she did is so amazing it gives me chills. This woman lived on an uninhabited jungle island for 7 years taking care of Lucy and the other apes, can you imagine that long eating what you can find on the island, no freaking McDonalds people, only letters as correspondence no wi-fi people, no man or woman to hold her at night nobody to bounce ideas off of, no music, TV or Internet, just books and chimps and sunsets, oh by the way, no doctor when things go wrong, she was selfless and fearless and continues to be that way to this day and she is in her seventies, she is a true warrior, hero and should be an inspiration to millions, wow I don't think they have her the credit she deserved in this show their should have been celebrities, politicians and clergy all singing the praises of this woman what a remarkable soul, thank you so much Janis please continue to let your light shine.",True

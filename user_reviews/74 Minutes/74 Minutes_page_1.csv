1,1,Don't waste your time,jamiepmcguire,n/a,16/08/2025,"74 minutes of footage repeatedly played over and over. At the start he claims to have 74 minutes of compelling evidence captured throughout his paranormal investigative career. There is nothing different from any other ghost hunting show you would have watched, except you see every bit of evidence played over and over, to drag this documentary out. This could have been called 10mins and it would have been much better. I'll be sure never to waste time watching any of his previous work.Don't waste your time

2,1,No evidence,dust-30,n/a,16/08/2025,I had hope this would contain something compelling as evidence of any kind of paranormal activity. What's provided over 74 mins could be 5 or 10 mins and nothing is unexplainable or evidence.What really turned me off is when he said a low angle shot of a non thernal handprint proved a higher off angle no footage handprint appearing. What the actual?As with most in this industry...these guys jump from job to job and capitalize on people's fears and curiosity offering cleansings and what not.There is nothing here to see worth your time. It's 5 seasons of Bigfoot hunting or ghost hunters rolled into a pareodalia filled we have evidence snake oil salesman package.These people do a genuine disservice to all scientific research and clearly capitalize on look at this isms based on a hair on a lens or other random noises or made up handprints.Listen to how defensive about the handprint he is and how his proof doesn't prove didly.The truth is out there.,False

1,10,Very informative,allykilbrai,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent exposé of the wind turbine industry and the evolutions of the French national energy strategy that provide concrete answers to ""How did we get to this point?""",False
2,10,"Strong, brave and salutary job",sanchedeabravanel,n/a,16/08/2025,A super consistent movie that helps to better understand the how and why renewable energy rolled out so massively without any agreement done with the population. Congrats.,False
3,8,Great debunking of wind mills as clean power providers -- in the case of France at least,elmchaney,n/a,16/08/2025,"A somewhat militant movie, but which convincingly demonstrates that plans to increase massively the number of large scale windmills (on and offshore) in France is deeply flawed, with regards to their purpose --providing a decarbonised electricity-- and their economic model. Windmills cannot provide power when needed unless backed by gas-fired stations (which are emitting carbon dioxyde) and would have a negative economic return if not massively subsidised. The much less clean truth than what windmills advocates are hiding is that this technology is in fact a fig leaf for the gas industry, which explains why petroleum and gas corporations are so fond of windmills.On the less positive side, if the movie explains how windmills are subsidised, it is silent on the subsidisation of nuclear power plants, in the past when France had the Westinghouse licence made available for EDF by CEA engineers and researchers (CEA is a state owned institution), and today by the implicit insurance provided by the government.Also, some comments are tainted of die hard protectionism, criticising the ownership of some wind mills farms (the nationality of the owner is totally irrelevant) or their import content. This is economically inconsistent: French companies specialised in nuclear power generation are happy to export their technology, and rightly so.Because of the last two points, I am awarding a 8/10 review.",False
4,8,How ideology and greed are defeating climate action in France,Leuenberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDespite a few inacurracies (neodynium is almost never used in windmill design used in France), an overall very good eye-opener about the incredible waste of money to worsen France's production of greenhous gas emissions.The movie explain how opinion and governmental funds are diverted on a completely useless form of energy production in a country whose electricity grid is already almost CO2-free.",True
5,10,The truth at last ! The film to watch,benoitfra,n/a,16/08/2025,"How come, lobbies, politics and medias have let this lie spread for years !This film is outstanding in highlighting the facts, showing the adverse impact of wind farms on our country.Hopefully it will wake up people and french citizens, in particular, to stop this scandal.We want a better environment and fight for the climate change. Wind farms are NOT the solution. Instead let us bring up transport, lodging and agriculture on the table to help them with that money.",False
6,10,Very educational,stephanecanipel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Describes with facts the impacts of the deployment of windmills which is currently a non sense both from an economical and ecological point of views.Most testimonies are really interesting and convincing, the interviewees really master their topic without any. Dogmatic ideology.",False
7,8,Excellent exposé of the wind turbine industry in France with its vices,lnc-00279,n/a,16/08/2025,"How can French citizens let this situation go into that wrong direction, loosing the control along the years, and let things go into a cul-de-sac ! A hell of money spent stupidly !",False

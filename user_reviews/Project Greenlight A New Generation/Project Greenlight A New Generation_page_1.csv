1,5,My Issue With This Show,newharlemfilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely love the concept of shows like this and the Chair, but like the Chair my issue is with first and foremost, the finished product is always subpar. However, the most frustrating part of this show is 1. The Director herself is so meek and passive (understandable at 1st this being her 1st time writing a feature) but at some point she needed to STEP IT UP. Equally, if not more frustrating, are the passive agressive Producers who held meetings and then meetings AFTER the meetings w/the Director to complain instead of actually addressing their grievances in the ACTUAL meeting. They spent so much time walking on eggshells for fear of coming across as mean or hurting the directors feelings instead of actually speaking up about the issues. As Producers they failed at their job to show backbone and actually COMMUNICATE with the Director. Who herself, was very meek and passive.",False
2,5,"Disagree with many of the reviews - liked production, not the director",jackiee1970,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMany here seem to be placing a lot of blame and negativity on the production teams here... and while I did feel they should have been tougher and more outspoken with Meko (I was yelling at the screen sometimes for them to be blunt!!)... I felt Meko was SO resistant to feedback! And a terrible communicator, which you just cannot be as a director. Trying to be balanced again, I do think what the heck did the production team expect? She was very uncommunicative in the first presentation meeting, which is when you'd expect someone was putting in all their effort! So if she wasn't at that stage, what did they think was going to happen?!?I also don't like the excuses some reviewers are making about the time/budget constrains... everyone knew what those were going in! And those has little to do with how resistant Meko was to take on board the notes being given. I do feel a little bit bad that this series may scare away any future people from wanting to have her as a director.Overall I found this so frustrating to watch! I truly believe one of the other two of their top three would have done a better job dealing with the processes side of things. But we'll never know...
perhaps if they had fit the mould of what the show was looking for more (not just be a woman).. then maybe we would have gotten to see a different series, one where things ran a lot smoother. Then again, smooth sailing doesn't bring the drama reality tv needs I suppose.",True
3,7,Good director awful producers,perlshop,n/a,16/08/2025,"Project Greenlight showcases a stark contrast between the exceptional talent of director Meeko and the frustrating behavior of the producers. Meeko's directorial prowess shines, but the producers' demands, insistence on diversity decisions, and constant interruptions create a tense and challenging environment. It's a revealing look at the complexities of filmmaking behind the scenes.The producers' behavior in 'Project Greenlight' paints a disheartening picture of their relentless interference, incessant complaints, and inappropriate pressure tactics. Their actions not only undermine Meeko's creative process but also highlight the challenges faced by directors when subjected to unwarranted scrutiny and micromanagement. It's a stark reminder of the detrimental impact that such producer-director conflicts can have on the filmmaking journey.",False
4,3,Shame because there are so many talented female directors,aberrationfilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"Omg. This is torture. I'm routing for this show since I'm a female director and advocate for women directors but you need to hire someone who has a clear vision. On top of that, everyone is boring with no personality and with an energy level that's a four at best. Can't even finish it to see if her final film is any good. So disappointing. The other two finalists had a much clearer vision and point of view. Will this do more to set back female directors than to celebrate them? I saw female filmmakers who I know and who are talented as the finalists, but weren't ultimately chosen and they all have dynamic personalities. It's hard to be on camera when you're normally behind the scenes, but this is also a tv show where we want to relate to and route for the director, so she needs to be dynamic. Giving up on this show on episode 5. I tried. Frustrating.",False
5,8,I'm so angry,picklesandpiesnyc,n/a,16/08/2025,"The ""mentors"" slash producers didn't do what they should have. Not only weren't they hands on in making this a success but they chose the wrong person as the winner. Had they been present in any way we would have worshipped this show. We would cheer for anyone the chose. Don't start a project you can't half ass do.Plus notes. The actors are incredible. The casting director understood every assignment and was absolutely worth everything.I wish I could write a more positive review. Because I was rooting for everyone the whole time. And was so disappointed at the end that they really just chose the wrong person then couldn't be available to mentor them to succeed.",False
6,n/a,Disappointed with Hoorae,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Hoorae team really left Meeko hanging. The point of the show was to uplift female filmmakers and specifically first time filmmakers. They instead played the blame game and gossiped behind her back. I understand Meeko wasn't perfect and wasn't always receptive but the teams from the previous seasons of PGL were 100% more professional and stood by their director while being firm with them. No one on the Hoorae team was clear or direct. It felt like watching catty high schoolers.Also, the screening scene was rough to watch. I hope it was just edited that way but everyone saying no words at all was heartbreaking.",False
7,7,OK in a Different Way.,lreese-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"The woman only version is OK.It's not like the others which focus on movie making skills and production details.This version is happier and more relaxed, but the director still has battles with production.The hosts are all capable and seem to work well together.The 2nd episode explains that the series is focused on uplifting under represented women, even in the production crew etc. I'm OK with that premise.They spell out the rules pretty clearly.Watching them build a movie based on affirmative Action at its core is interesting to watch. It doesn't always work out as expected.The new group is much softer. They try not to offend each other in person, and don't get their points across. They're just too nice for the most part. The struggle they have, trying not to be aggressive is fun to watch too.I've seen the movie, the advisors were correct in their criticisms while it was in production, but did very little to correct the obvious weaknesses in the movie, other than to tell the director to fix it, without follow up, or actual ideas..
The director they picked was very competent, but not overly creative. Very smart though.. She did many things very well. Having her help write and direct was too much for her. Too many other director functions she had to work on to create new visions to the story and script them.If you like movies and want to learn about their production, you should watch this.",False
8,2,Set up to fail,mikestar-71355,n/a,16/08/2025,"This whole show just leaves you with an unpleasant feeling, watching unlikeable people strive to shift blame to a first-time director who, if you believe the edit we're shown, isn't putting much work in and has no vision for what she wants to do. The situation puts her in an impossible time crunch with a lack of resources, gives no helpful feedback other than ""fix the script"" (a script they gave her, not one she wrote herself), then to act surprised and disappointed when it doesn't work out. While Meko does not come off well, she had no chance of succeeding. We're repeatedly told that she's lazy (which is funny in a series meant to ""give a woman a chance"" the other women involved spend the whole time tearing her down), but no one flat out tells her this while the movie is being made. They hint and they bicker and they say it behind her back, passing the blame for a shoddy product away from the 10 useless producers and mentors to someone who had no clue and wasn't taught anything about how to make a movie. By the end you just dislike everyone involved and want them to stop talking.",False
9,8,So frustrating.,SecretlyBitten,n/a,16/08/2025,"My score of 8 is for Project Greenlight, but that said, it was incredibly frustrating watching chosen director Miko Winbush completely ignore producer's notes regarding shooting alternative versions of every shot. She was told time and time again to take advantage of the resources around her, but also to hold true to her vision. And all she seemed to hear was ""stay by your vision"" and ignored all the problems that were popping up from producers and the studio.She was also told about problems occurring between the personnel from PGL being in the way of the movie making, as well as other issues and she shrugged them off as ""not her problem."" Well yes, all those things are your problem, you're the director! She came across as arrogant and unwilling to make any changes to her process of making a movie. At one point she took off to go to ""look at the stars"" during the editing process when she should have been there with the editor 24/7! I have never seen someone so uninvested in the opportunity given to her. I really wish the people choosing the director, at the beginning of the series, had considered her lack of communication skills so they could have chosen someone who was better at communicating because she was horrible at it.",False
10,1,"Obnoxious, self-promoting people...",jdmorris,n/a,16/08/2025,"I gave up after a half hour of putting up with obnoxious, ""look at me, I'm so great"" show biz personalities. I stuck with it that long because I expected to see the 3-minute shorts the ""directors"" had produced and to hear serious critiques from the ""pros."" I gave up when it became clear we were only going to see mere seconds of those shorts - not even full screen - with multiple cutaways to facial expressions and un-helpful comments from the ""pros.""The original Project was flawed, but always interesting. You actually saw what was going on, and you got thoughtful comments from Ben and Matt, and plenty of enlightening comments from actors and directors. They didn't always produce great stuff, but they were always interesting.The reboot should have been better, but failed miserably. What were they thinking?",False
11,8,Incredible example of delusion,eleanorgreen-68402,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story they show thinks it's telling, and the reality hiding underneath, creates a fascinating tension. Ostensibly about a first time director, Project Greenlight quickly becomes about the production company, their demands, unrealistic expectations, lack of mentorship, and misguided advice.Watching the production team twist themselves into knots to cast themselves as the stars and heroes of this documentary is truly magical television. Even with complete control of the edit, the production company comes across as passive aggressive, controlling, and vain. They tell the director constantly to speak up and stand up for herself, but when she pushes back on their suggestions they accuse her of arrogance and a refusal to listen. The ""mentors"" are completely absent and working on other projects, making their concerns (only expressed behind the director's back) ring hollow.It's very telling when an HBO Max VP shows up to chastise the director. He admits that they really don't care about the movie; they're doing this for the reality tv show side. This prioritization was already evident from the many times the documentary production pulled key crew aside for talking head interviews about how they were over time and running late, or setting up shots in the way of the filmmakers.One of the most entertaining things to watch is the tension between the producers' stated values and their actions. They want to empower the director to execute her ""vision"", and then undercut her every time her vision clashes with their own. They want to create a diverse set of newcomers, but then accuse the Black 1st AD of being ""aggressive"" when he tries to do his job of protecting the film's set and crew. They want to ""do things differently"", but then insinuate she doesn't care about the project when she asserts boundaries over her personal time and what additional work she will take on. They say they want her to succeed and will do anything to help, but give her a terrible and unfinished script, insufficient time, insufficient money, and a total lack of real advice. The cast and crew seem to respond really well to the director and all the crises are common on a low-budget set, so their frustrations seem overblown.If you can refuse to give in to production's edited perspective, you'll have a great time watching the show!",False
12,1,Dont hire the White Production Designer why? Because a Black person deserves it more.,fatelaubach,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show litterally shows why Hollywood is failing today. They gave this Woman an amazing opportunity, and yet must force their views and opinions into every move she makes. All while forgetting that making film and tv has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with equality. They litterally had an uproar because she liked the creative input of a White man. So much so that they forced her to have meeting with Black production designers who they approve of under the guise of equality instead of their racism. Disgusting! Litterally pretty much said to the Woman, oh look at you your in your position right now because we put you there because of your Color and not your creativity. This is an extremely bad look for HBO.",False
13,3,"Hated it, and it's not Meko's fault.",mercercreed-34961,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI notice a lot of people saying ""Meko needed to step up!""Why?Meko and HER production crew worked tirelessly to try to get the movie done - in 18 days, without a script.During that time she was constantly being pulled away for meetings and interviews with Greenlight, Hoorae, and HBO staff. Useless meetings in most cases with people who have scant experience in movie production offering vague and juvenile ""notes""Remember, this series is being told from the side of Project Greenlight, who seemed to do everything they could to hinder production. Their interference in the table read alone was enough to almost derail the whole thing. Turns out, none of them knew what a table read is supposed to be.I was REALLY disappointed by Issa Rae's comments in the last episode. She was out of line and rude.Id strongly recommend everyone hop over to the Catch a Break podcast and listen to the new season in which they interview the production crew OF THE MOVIE, not Greenlight, Hoorae or HBO.There are a lot of other specific things those groups did that irritated and angered me, but I wont bother to go into them. Okay, the whole with the Art Production hire really made me mad. Sorry, had to say it.Anyway, if they do another season with ANY of the same people, I'm not watching. Frankly everyone not actually working on Gray Matter itself should be fired.As a post script I'll add that I went to create an account on IMDB just to post this, but found I already had one. LOL. As far as I know this is my first review.",True
14,10,Different Point of View,dlwat2331,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed seeing this show from a womans perspective. This current team is dynamic in contrast to the first team's more top-down hierarchical structure. I would love to see this type of show to continue. The thematic challenges showed the impact of making the new directors stretch their potential. If you are looking for methodical, vulnerability, intensity, execution of a project in the entertainment industry this shows gives a strong perspective. Overall, I really enjoyed this season, it was helpful to see what happens behind the scenes, how the visual ideation were made and the sharing of personal leadership styles.",False
15,8,Good relaunch,markricks-68-975207,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show was always fantastic. The process from start to finish is wild. Obviously the biggest draw is giving opportunities where there were none.My biggest criticism about this relaunch of the show is that the mentors were so busy with their own projects that the director was left on their own.Hopefully in future seasons they'll find mentors that have ample downtime to coach, instruct, and guide the directors so that their projects ultimately look the best.Kudos to all the companies involved in giving a director an opportunity to make a feature film. I imagine this learning process is something that they'll never forget. Bottom line, I enjoyed it, even the dynamic between the movie crew and the TV crew because that's real life.",False

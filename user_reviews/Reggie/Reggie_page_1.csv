1,7,Where's the Celebration?,rkaden-28150,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being a lifelong Yankee fan I looked forward to this documentary. Reggie gave us fans one of the greatest memories in Yankee histroy with his 3 HR game in the WS. All great stuff. However, like some reviewers stated, where's the joy in Reggie? Winnig 5 world championships and MVP awards had to bring some pleaure. Where also is the interviews with any of the Yankees on those late 70 teams? It would have been nice to hear from a few of them, good or bad. Not that I doubt for one second the hardships endured by Black Americans at the time. Tragic as that is, Reggie seems to have enjoyed a successful career and a good life, evident by his house and collection of expensive cars. He seems like he's still angry and was dealt the short straw. Not sure if that's the case. He obviously worked hard to accomplish what he did and deserved the accolades and recognition but.....he was outspoken and did, at least appear, to alianate some of his Yankee teamates. Where was a segment on the emotions shared by the Yankees and Reggie following Munson's death? I was at the game the day after. It was a sad, sad, place to be.It was great seeing the enduring friendships he has with his Oakland A teamates but, the only Yankee in the video was Derek Jeter who was not part of the ""Bronx Zoo"".That being said...thanks Reggie for providing lasting memories to all Yankee fans.",False
2,7,Reggie on Reggie,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"A cool documentary of the professional life and career of Reggie Jackson through his words and eyes. This is an interesting look at the evolution of Jackson's career in respect to role and life of blacks in baseball and the civil rights moment in the United States. Jackson was a controversial player and still a controversial figure, but a colorful one, no doubt. If you were a lover of the Oakland A's of the early 1970's, or the New York Yankees of the 2nd half of that decade, then this is an extra special look at the man. The filmmaking is not great but the subject matter makes it worth watching.",False
3,8,Surprisingly poignant,ryandring,n/a,16/08/2025,"Didn't expect much at first, so I was pleasantly surprised at the tone and style. As an older man, his reflections and self awareness are really poignant at times. Told in first person.Through all of his famous ego, it was all about searching for dignity, acceptance and respect - his insecurity he reveals conversationally is pretty moving. Especially as he vasciallated from being hated and shut out to being loved.Also great to see other famous players in the conversations.Wish there had been more teammate stories and some more laughs to break up the hard parts, but otherwise it's an unusually moving sports documentary.",False
4,7,Serious Hit!,ThatMonkey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fastball is without a doubt the best best Baseball documentary if not the best documentary ever made. Facing Nolan becomes a great companion to that title for reason I won't get into here.Reggie was a personal hero of mine growing up and his jersey was the first I ever wore as a child. I thought I was familiar with his story, but learned a lot here.I found this piece to be moving, informative and enlightening, however, I also found it somewhat depressing. It certainly paint a picture and drive home a message that it was a difficult time for black athletes. At the same time, the absence of laughter just left me with a burden I didn't plan to carry. Maybe we needed stories from Reggie's kids, or lighthearted interviews from his glory days. Seeing people like Dr. J, added a human element, but I needed more of that. Would have been nice to see a Ken Griffey as well, assuming there is a relationship there.I saw what the film maker tried to do, but their was no joy in this movie and no matter what the struggle way, it appeared to me, Mr. Jackson had plenty to celebrate.",False
5,8,Personal insight of Reggie's plight with racism that I didn't know,finance-90530,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI read one of his earlier books and was a big fan growing up.I didn't know some of the rough patch he had early in his career with racism, but I don't think he had it half as bad as Hank Aaron or Jackie Robinson. What set him apart was not racism, but his ability to speak up and he opened up the doors for getting higher salaries, as I recall him having the 2nd biggest contract, next to Catfish Hunter. With that said, today's players have him to thank for. I thought him not being able to buy a team is a bit of sour grapes, as he should be thankful for the opportunity he had, fame, wealth, etc. I thought he should have reflected more on the good memories that he had playing the sport, as fans, we thought he was living the life that we all dreamed of.",True
6,7,Baseball Basher on the Big Screen!!,mjpiro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerReggie is the 2023 documentary of one of baseball's most outspoken and successful players of all-time, Reggie Jackson. Jackson originally started in the Kansas City Athletics organization, the team that eventually became the Oakland Athletics, but his path to Kansas City was not a bed of roses. Jackson, a black man, faced much racism through his journey in the minor leagues even while being shielded by white teammates and friends. The story was much the same for the very talented outfielder when he reached Kansas City, where some of those same teammates and friends tried to shield him from racist culture but Jackson was still subject to racism from late 1960's American society. In 1968 the team moved west to Oakland and within a few years started having tremendous success on the diamond making it to three consecutive World Series championships winning all three!! Jackson was the key contributor to all three of those championships, gaining national fame for doing so but like with many superstars of his era - such as pitcher Nolan Ryan of the then California Angels - the Oakland A's owner did not want to pay Jackson the big bucks so he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles. Jackson spent one year in Baltimore before he signed a three million dollar contract with the New York Yankees taking them to two World Series winning them both!! American society was changing in the late 1970's and Jackson was changing with it becoming more outspoken as America's shift to equality for all. Free agency for all baseball players was born in the mid 70's and player's now ballooning salaries struck accord with Jackson and had him speaking out on many of these issues. Jackson still discusses many of these issues in his current job as a special advisor to the owner of the Houston Astros, the currently World Champions of Major League Basbeall today!! Reggie, the documentary, is very well done. It takes you through the highs and lows of one of the most successful players ever to play the sport!! The testimonials are well done and you get a great sense of appreciation for what Jackson has had to go through as a person and what he accomplished as a player on the field. 7 out of 10 stars!!",True
7,9,"I watched this without expectation, because I didn't follow MLB before marrying a spirts fan and reading the Sports Illustrated that arrived in our mailbox each week.I watched",yymvjrzhqn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched ""Reggie"" to learn about a person, a time, a place. I knew about his three home runs on three pitches in the 1977 World Series, and was interested in seeing some film of that building excitement. Who doesn't like the Hollywood melodrama Cinderella story in real life?That part then, was almost anti-climactic since It was was anticipated. What moved me and made me say ""Wow"" was listening to the voices and words of real people making their comments, telling their stories. It is an eye-opening history lesson.Like most all biographies, it is titled as the story of a person, but gives you much more to think about.What was going on daily, what was normal at that time, actions that other people, besides the main subject, were taking, what they were doing is also fascinating.I watched this documentary to learn about one interesting person, but as usual with history, came away with much knowledge and food for thought on more subjects than Reggie Jackson.",False
8,7,Thorough Documentary of Mr. October,iquine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a mix of Reggie Jackson's impactful playing career, with his experiences with race relations in baseball both on the field as well as in management, which extends into him working to improve civil rights. To the baseball portion, it is a good overview of his career and his larger-than-life personality at least compared with someone less brash like Jackie Robinson. I never knew he was the highest paid player when he signed with the Yankees, after a short stint with the Baltimore Orioles (shout out to my team!). If you know a moderate amount about baseball, you'll know the Reggie swung so hard he twisted himself up lick a corkscrew, so he was a power hitter that helped his teams win multiple World Series. He takes that experience today to help more black youths get into the sport as well as increase the percent of black ownership of MLB teams. Overall, this was entertaining and informative.",False
9,8,VIEWS ON FILM review of Reggie,burlesonjesse5,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""Reggie is a guy that can carry a whole ball club"". That would be Reggie Martinez Jackson, Hall of Famer and scalding, home run hitter. Jackson won 5 World Series titles, was a 14-time All-Star, and played for 4 different MLB teams. Oh and he also had a bit part in 1988's The Naked Gun. ""I must kill... the Queen"". Oh Reg, you slay me, you really do.With tons of interviews from Jackson's family, his major league colleagues, and major league players he currently mentors, 2023's Reggie is more than just about baseball. It's inching dramatis personae. There's racial oppression and monetary slavery involved and that all started from the beginning of this dude's storied career (1967-1987).In truth, I found Reggie to be a documentary that's a little off the cuff but effectively raw. I mean when you hear Reggie Jackson speak it almost feels like he didn't even know the cameras were rolling. It's as if he were talking to one or two people in the room, not a mass audience.Reggie is directed by Alex Stapleton, a woman who intersperses Jackson's likeness with his archived highlights of massive long balls and clutch performances. The whole effect is chronological and exhilarating, with Alex's subjects (mainly Jackson) being mildly angry and rightfully so (revert back to second paragraph).Bottom line: Reggie is candid, resenting, and opinionated. A little self-serving? Perhaps. A little bit of a platform for a guy who hasn't swung a bat in decades? Sort of. Oh well. They say as a human you are the only one who can represent yourself and Jackson does it better and with more bravado than most. I mean he wasn't a producer on this and always gives off that love or hate feel but Stapleton renders the former slugger well on both counts. ""Mr. October"" shines here in March.",True
10,10,Unapologetically REGGIE,mrred7,n/a,16/08/2025,"Understand something, Reggie was all about team and making sure he was on the same playing level as every other person. I loved the story as a Yankee fan but more importantly I loved the story about his humanity and culture. Great insight into his opinions, heart and mind. I would recommend this documentary to anyone, not just Yankee fans and baseball fans. Everyone needs to hear another person's story and struggles to shed light on the bigger picture that happens beyond self. The fact that people can't hear and listen to someone who brings something different to the table is just plain wrong.",False
11,5,It's one side of the story. That's always boring.,dedawson-82561,n/a,16/08/2025,"At the start of this documentary a calm, conversational Reggie Jackson says he's nervous about the film because he has no control over it. He needn't have worried. It's more a story about his career-long pursuit of diversity in baseball, all the way to the ownership level, than about his good guy/ bad guy reputation as a player. He's surrounded in this effort by friends, including Henry Aaron, Vida Blue, Rollie Fingers and Julius Erving. No contemporaries from his Bronx Zoo Yankee years are interviewed, so we don't get differing points of view about Reggie's clashes with Thurman Munson, Billy Martin, Mickey Rivers and others.Reggie credits several players on the Oakland Athletics for helping him withstand mid-70s racism, but fails to mention coaches, veteran players or mentors who improved his game other than Joe DiMaggio. The facts about slow acceptance of Black players, managers, coaches and executives are true. It's also fair to say that Reggie confessed to being too aggressive at times in the media. Still, the lack of critics in this two-hour project unfortunately make it more boring than it should be.",False
12,9,Biopic On Mr October or Mr Baseball,t-d-t-m82,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great in-depth interview with one of the most successful baseball players off all-time. Also an incredibly cool, humble and down-to-earth individual who campaigns strongly for the needy and under-privililaged in societyIt's a really important message and every young person coming through on the sport should watch this movie.I'm not a big baseball fan, I'm English, but I am a huge fan of Reggie. He's clearly the rockstar of Yankee baseball and set the standards for unionising against his club to get his deal at the Yankees.What a legend. What a gentleman. We need more education about segregation and the adversity which minorities face. This is an excellent showcase for that and the beautiful game.",False
13,1,Another black people are victims and white people are bad doc,Iceman-15,n/a,16/08/2025,"And Reggie seems to have no problem ripping the scab off of racial healing and hammering home this point.I grew up as a black kid in Oakland during the time of Reggie's notoriety in that city. I played baseball, football, loved the Oakland Raiders. The A's had just arrived in Oakland from Kansas City. Across the bay we had the Giants and Willie Mays, but Willie, although a legend, was coming to the end of his hall of fame career. The time was now, and it was Reggie Jackson and the A's.In 69, I must've went to at least 10 games with me and my friends, and it was all about Reggie! That year he hit 47 home runs, and I was there for each of them, whether it was at the game, on TV, or listening on the radio. One night after a game, we saw Reggie talking to Carl Yastremski of the Boston Red Sox. Imagine our excitement of seeing our hero. I was 11, my friend was 8. I didn't care about autographs from athletes, still don't. But my friend asked Reggie for an autograph. His reaction is etched in my memory forever. He looked down at us, with disdain, and with a wave goodbye motion, he just said, ""bye"". He not only did not want to give us an autograph, or say ""No kids I can't,"" he wanted to humiliate us, these two black kids, for even asking!Now, in this documentary, he recounts a story of what a white racist did to him as a kid, and how horrible it was. Well, Reggie, you ain't all that innocent, either!",False
14,2,Bring The Brie Because There's A Lot Of Whine In Here,Ootek_Says,n/a,16/08/2025,"Reggie Jackson is one of the most iconic athletes in the 20th Century. He was self anointed as the ""straw that stirs the drink."" Well the fizz is nowhere to be found in this flat and monotonous monolog on race and how Reggie was done wrong.The early sequences of him in Birmingham were quite eye opening and shed some light on the times and even his future team as he came up with guys like Rudi and Fingers in Birmingham, both of whom are in the doc.But it didn't stop there. For a guy that made hundreds of millions and sported one of the greatest, private car collections, you'd think Jackson was a victim of indentured servitude.I'm sure Reggie has some great stories but for someone baring it all, they're conspicuously absent.For someone so dynamic and exciting, Reggie comes across bitter and dare I say, a bit of a bore.",False
15,4,Negativity 101,TheFearmakers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here is another documentary that's not about the subject or what they did to become the subject of a documentary... much like the Rita Moreno doc, it's a chance for the young filmmakers to push their agenda down our throats by making whatever legendary person they are filming back up their agenda and skipping past what they lent to history...I was alive when Reggie Jackson ruled the world, and no one hated him or looked down on him... except the Dodgers, and Dodgers fans, who still thought he was fantastic... An icon...This documentary simply glides over his accomplishments on the field and what we get is another negative message through another messenger...Documentaries on famous people seem intentionally mired in propaganda, not towards the facts, which are merely opinions in these kind of whiny, navel-gazing self-studies.",False

1,6,Art the Clown and the trilogy,AvionPrince16,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA nice documentary where llke you can guess have some view of the behind the scenes of the movie Terrifier .Basically , we see some new images and how they made the scenes : the make up , process , all the prostethic elements and the blood and some stories of the behind the scenes and the POV of some actors and directors .So was pretty good and also talk about the beginning and the evolution in the inside was interesting to see ( Budget evolution , casts and how they lived the changements). Something made me laughed about the Girl who played Sienna and its the moment where she talk about her brother in the movie and the fact that he get more mature and play better : i need to say that i didnt found his acting very convincing at first but yeah its get better i guess . Because when he played , he makes a lot of facial expressions and everything felt so unnatural and i did enjoyed her honesty on that .Thats all to be honest . They were a lot of anecdotes more than filmmaking process but it was ok i guess and just for the new images and the behind the scenes it was worth it but of course i wanted way more but its ok and i spent a great moment seeing some elements used on the movie and it was pretty good overall. A nice documentary for those who are curious who are behind that movie and the franchise and the evolution troughout the 3 movies .We got also teased by probably a new movie in the future . So sound good for now . More budget , more things to see , more blood !Good overall.",True

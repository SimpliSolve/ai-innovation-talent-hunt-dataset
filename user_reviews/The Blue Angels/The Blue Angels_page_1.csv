1,8,Has It All,snowytoshoalhaven,n/a,16/08/2025,"Decided just an hour before showing time to take kids into the new IMAX in our city to see this. Youngest has had mind polluted by Van Halen Blue Angel videos, so was easy sell.Spectacular filming and as complete a capture of the various 'moves' and associated performances by the Blue Angels as you could expect. From about every angle. Worth it to see just for that. But it gave a fairly good insight into the cycle of induction/training/airshow events/handover for the Blue Angels, and an excellent snapshot of the focus, capability and teamwork attitude of the Blue Angels, mainly from the aircrew perspective. If they had more time, they could have beefed up groundcrew, though their essential role and integration was covered.All the individuals they covered were just made for this film. A varied but cohesive team, well led.I came out thrilled and inspired, an example of the pursuit of excellence in an environment where humility is trumping the ego.The narrative between servicemen and women is a bit hard to follow sometimes, what with a bit of jargon and fast pilot talk, but the single person speaking is fine.If you're up for a bit of inspiration and thrill, definitely do it. If you need to empty your ignorance quota, and see a bit what high standards service personnel can attain, see it. If you want some entertainment, also see it.",False
2,8,This Rocked!,subxerogravity,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel like Top Gun 2 is opening up a can of worms to produce movies about Ariplanes. It was a great IMAX experience but I have to say nothing overally spectcalar happen that i would recommend it over a reglar format.It was an intresting story and like a line of GI Joe action figures their was a Blue Angel for everyone. They could be more diverse but that's really not the point, the point it they did do their best to showcase everyone.This is why I say you can watch this on any format. For a film that was promoted as being for IMAX they could have done more airplane scenes or something. Not that what they did show does not blow me away, the documentary has a lot of talking overall. More suited for true lovers of Aviation.",False
3,7,Happy to be Here,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. My preferred method of movie watching means no trailer to set the stage prior to the lights dimming. Sometimes this leaves my assumptions a bit off-track, which can result in either a pleasant surprise or a bit of disappointment. Acknowledging that The Blue Angels seem tailor-made for an IMAX presentation, I was prepared for a combination of cool photography and a history lesson. The surprise here was that filmmaker Paul Crowder (probably best known as the Editor for Ron Howard's 2017 Beatles documentary) chose to only dabble in the history and instead focus on a single performance season of one team.Without a doubt, the camera work is spectacular and takes full advantage of the IMAX screen. Some of the shots are breathtaking, and yet the awe generated by the actual technical maneuvers performed (regularly) by the team somehow eclipses what would otherwise be more than enough to keep us engaged. Crowder takes us into the prep room as the new team members study techniques that if performed incorrectly, could result in death. Six Navy and one Marine pilot make up each team, and these pilots enter as well-trained and then take it up a notch.We do learn The Blue Angels were established in 1946 by Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Chester Nimitz, a Commander of Allied forces during WWII. His original mission for the team remains in place today. The Blue Angels are really a marketing device with a dual purpose: to convince taxpayers that their money is well spent and to motivate youngsters to pursue a career as a Navy pilot. Yes, it's every bit the recruiting tool of the TOP GUN movies, as The Blue Angels perform 60 aerial shows for hundreds of thousands of spectators around the country each year. If you are curious, this year's budget for The Blue Angels is $36 million straight from the Department of Defense by way of tax dollars. You might ask if that's a legitimate use of defense funds, but this movie is not going to answer that or even address it.The behind-the-scenes and up-close analysis of the pilots and the program is quite impressive, and a hierarchy exists, as one would expect in the military. They are now flying Boeing F/A 18E/F Super Hornets, and the precision involved with their aerial maneuvers is mind-boggling. I won't give it away other than to say inches are involved at 400 mph, making these visuals look like something out of a video game, rather than the actual sky with actual jets and actual pilots. While we aren't allowed much insight into the maintenance of the jets, Crowder does emphasize how many are included on the total team. We learn about the 28 deaths that have occurred in the program over the years, and the final act revolves around the selection of the new team (including the first woman, Lt. Amanda Lee) and the transition of leadership. Like the flying, it's all very precise. One thing becomes quite clear, they are all ... ""happy to be here.""THE BLUE ANGELS is playing for one week at IMAX theaters through May 23, 2024, and streaming on Prime Video beginning May 23.",False
4,7,Eye-popping photography,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""The Blue Angels"" (2024 release; 93 min.) opens, we are told that at any given time, the US Navy has about 3,700 battle-ready fighter pilots, of which 6 are assigned each year to the Blue Angels. We then go to ""January, first day of training"" in El Centro, CA, as the latest group of Blue Angels starts a grueling 3 months of training and flying as much as 3 times a day. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from veteran British director Paul Crowder. Here he takes us along on the entire 2022 season of the Blue Angels, from training to air shows and everything in between. Of course what interests us the viewer most it the flying sequences, and let me just say it: the footage is nothing short of eye-popping, a trye delight from start to finish. The 6 pilots are just the top of the iceberg as they are supported by dozens and dozens of additional support staff. As they go from city to city, it's very much like following a top band doing a national concert tour. You might say that this documentary is just one long commercial for the US Navy and you might not be wrong. But the fact remains that the footage of flying sequences is so spectacular that it doesn't matter.""The Blue Angels"" premiered on IMAX and Omnimax screens earlier this year, and it is now streaming on Amazon Prime, where I saw it the other night. This movie is currently rated 85% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels like a little too generous. That said, if you are in the mood to see our country's best fighter pilots putting on one heck of a spectacular air show, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
5,10,Brings back great memories,oakleyallen-196-123554,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was fortunate to spend 3 years of my navy enlistment with the Blue Angels. The movie is spot on and you some of the insights on how a team becomes successful. Glad to be here! It's more than just talking points. It's a sincere appreciation of living in the moment. The team is the real deal. Hardest days in El Centro but it was well worth it and this movie gives you a backstage pass. If you are a fan of the Blue Angels or aviation, you will love this movie. I missed it on IMAX but caught it on Prime. Would have been amazing to see at an IMAX theater but a nice home theater does the trick. Turn up your volume!!",False
6,7,Great documentary,Bmore-Hero,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Blue Angels"" is a visually stunning documentary that takes viewers inside the exhilarating world of the Navy's elite flight demonstration squadron. With breathtaking aerial footage and behind-the-scenes access to the pilots and crew, the film delivers on the spectacle, giving audiences a thrilling ride as they experience the precision and danger involved in these gravity-defying performances.What stands out most is the cinematography. The aerial shots are nothing short of spectacular, capturing the beauty of the Blue Angels in flight, set against vibrant skies and sweeping landscapes. It's a feast for the eyes, especially on a big screen, and fans of aviation will find themselves completely engrossed in the majesty of these aircraft in motion.Where ""The Blue Angels"" falters slightly is in its narrative depth. While the film offers some insight into the personal stories of the pilots and crew, it often feels more focused on the grandeur of the spectacle than on developing a deeper connection with the individuals behind the helmets. As a result, the emotional impact feels somewhat muted, and the film leans more towards awe than empathy.The pacing can be uneven at times, particularly during moments where the documentary lingers on technical details that may feel repetitive or overly drawn out. Some viewers may find themselves craving a bit more variety or a closer look at the challenges these pilots face beyond the cockpit.Despite these minor shortcomings, ""The Blue Angels"" is an engaging and well-crafted documentary that offers a thrilling peek into the lives of some of the most skilled pilots in the world. It's a solid watch for anyone with an interest in aviation or military history, though it may leave some viewers wishing for a little more depth beneath the spectacle.",False
7,10,IMAX excellence,bsherwood-92291,n/a,16/08/2025,"Always been a huge fan of the blue angels, this more than did them justice. So much behind the scenes I never knew or ever seen, and the shots are incredible. I love that glen powell was the one who helped shine a light on the blues. After drawing attention in Top Gun he used it to go even more in depth regarding the blue angels team and naval aviation.I also learned through this documentary about the blue angels foundation which I cannot wait to donate to. Fantastic mission and for a great cause. This documentary focused on the blue angels objective of striving for perfection and obtaining excellence and that is exactly what the doc achieved itself.",False
8,7,"It's a visual feast for aviation lovers, but lacks satiable technical discussion",Airman87,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Blue Angels delivers what may be some of the most amazing videography ever seen in aviation, at times even surpassing much of Top Gun: Maverick's blend of real and CGI. For an aviation fan like myself who has grown up near 40 years with the Blue Angels and calls Pensacola home, the action shots are worth the IMAX experience in every way possible, especially as many camera angles have never been seen before due to the unique and unprecedented way it was filmed.The documentary largely follows the jet demo team and focuses on their hectic season - from El Centro winter training, to weekly demonstrations, selection of the next Blue Angel members, and all the way to the Homecoming Airshow. Above all, the documentary focuses on showing the culture and purpose of the Blue Angels organization through lived experiences of its jet demo members.What ultimately lacked for me in this documentary was the technical discussion and behind the scenes look at the jets themselves. Outside of a visualized rehearsals and a centrifuge session, there was little discussion about the technical aspects of the jets and flying them. I would have loved to learn more about what kind of work the maintainers do throughout the season given how many hours these old fleet jets are flying. I would have liked to know what simulator sessions newcomers go through and how they time and place their maneuvers before even stepping foot in El Centro.While there is certainly more I would have preferred, it understandably was slimmed into a more palatable format for the average person. Aviation fan or not, it's definitely worth the watch.",False
9,10,Amazing,kmkrhia,n/a,16/08/2025,These pilots are truly amazing. They must have nerves of steel. I cannot believe they come 12 inches from one another. I watched it on prime. Would have been great to see it on IMax. I liked seeing how they run through the show at the table and how it has to become second nature to them. My brother was on the maintenance team for several years and I was fortunate to see behind the scenes at several shows. They are truly a top notch operation. You have to appreciate their dedication to share their skill with the nation. The travel schedule is rigorous. It was interesting to see how it affects their families.,False
10,6,Fantastic Aerial Photography,kgprophet,n/a,16/08/2025,"Back in the 1980s, the Science Museum in St. Paul featured an Omnimax theatre. Omnimax took Imax one step further and created a wrap around screen shaped like a dome. It also played normal Imax films. Back then, Imax films were documentaries, supposedly science related. However, the subject matter was really an excuse to show off spectacular photography shot with Imax cameras. I was hooked from the first high school field trip to the huge screen film format. After that, I remember showing up an hour early to Imax films to be first in line, all in order to get the choice seat.Omnimax still exists but in large was eclipsed by the Imax format, with a traditional flat screen. Of course, dome shaped screens took a huge leap with the building of the Sphere in Las Vegas. Even now, true Imax screens that are 7 stories tall, are being outnumbered by what I call ""miniMax"" screens, that are ten times smaller. Nevertheless, I solicit these ""LieMax"" theatres because ultimately it is the highest quality showing you going to get in your run-of-the-mill theatre chains. In the last 20 years, Imax has been expanded from photogenic documentaries into blockbuster filmmaking.Aerial photography is hands down the most stunning type of Imax photography. I remember a huge hit at the Science Museum was ""To Fly"". Space themed Imax docs also were pretty stunning. ""Blue Angels"" is a throwback to these documentaries with ""wow"" cinematography. Instead of being released to museums, it was released to the ""miniMax"" theaters. If you were thrilled by the aerial photography seen in last year's Top Gun 2, you will appreciate ""Blue Angels"". Interspersed throughout this in-depth look at the Blue Angels program are stunning aerial shots of the Blue Angels in action. Although the shots are only about 2 seconds a piece, they provide previously unseen angles in the air. Achieving smooth and kinetic camera moves mid-air, you are presented with really intimate views of the famous Blue Angels air shows.These money shots are thrown in amidst the story of new recruits to the Blue Angels program. If there was a complaint, it was the editor(s) decision to cut the film Michael Bay style, with no shot seeming to last more than 2 seconds. It certainly keeps the areial shots energetic, but to a certain degree unsatisfying. I think I would have enjoyed at least one segment following the airplanes through an entire airshow stunt. One exception is the emphasis placed on a single stunt, when four aircraft fly together in dangerously close formation. Extra time is spent studying this formation, as we see the wingtips of two of the fighters nearly come in contact with each other.The rest of the film uses interviews from the pilots to describe the details behind preparing for air show season, and what they go through to safely perform the stunts. I am somewhat of an aviation buff, having seen the Blue Angels in person 4 or 5 times. So I found the subject matter relatively interesting. Even if I didn't, I would still have found it worth the ticket price to see the astounding aerial shots, short and sweet as they are.Ultimately I give this a 6 out of 10. I didn't go higher because of the spastic editing and the fact the subject matter isn't captivating enough for most audiences, meaning I would have been more satisfied if there was more straight coverage of their air shows and less everything else.",False
11,10,Best Aviation Film I have Ever Seen!,black-91250,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film has the most exciting, dramatic aviation photography I have ever seen! Highly recommended to anyone who likes airplanes. It also shows the tremendous dedication and teamwork of the Blue Angels, and what can be accomplished when people work together toward the same goal and strive for excellence.The film also shows the grueling training and travel schedule of the Blue Angels team, and some of their history. Their story and achievements are heroic and inspirational at a time when we really need some heroes and role models in America. (I don't know about you but our Congress is not doing it for me.)",False
12,7,Left me wanting more,trtmcr24,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed this film. The shots of the planes in formation are truly breathtaking, and I can tell that was really the focus of the filmmaking process. Throughout the film you learn about the experienced Blue Angel pilots and how they get the newbies up to speed. I think I would have loved this more as a 4-8 part mini-series, that dives deep into the preparation, the struggles, the creative process, and gives more background on the pilots. At a runtime of 93 minutes, the film could really show a surface level view of the action behind the scenes, with an emphasis on the beautiful aerial shots. I was left feeling dazzled and impressed but wanted some more substance.",False
13,5,Visually Stunning but Shallow: The Blue Angels Documentary Misses the Real Story Behind the Show,rsshortvids,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Blue Angels documentary, while visually stunning with some incredible cinematography and impressive aerial shots, falls short in delivering a compelling narrative. For anyone who's seen their performances or understands the mechanics behind it, like I do as a former Navy mechanic, the documentary feels repetitive and lacks a solid structure. There's no strong story arc, and it misses a key opportunity to build to a climactic third act. Instead, it feels like they blew their most exciting maneuvers early on, and then kept repeating variations of the same formations.The film tries to focus on the power and precision of the Navy's flight demonstrations, but that's really only surface level. There's so much more to the Blue Angels than the formations we've seen time and time again. Where's the story about the history? The documentary could've delved deeper into the rigorous training these pilots endure, their personal struggles to become the best of the best, and what it really takes to be selected for the Blue Angels. And what about the crew that maintains these jets? The film barely scratches the surface of the behind-the-scenes work-the countless hours that go into making sure those jets are ready to fly. The real heart of the story lies there, but the film never goes deep enough.While they do show some of the Blue Angels' history, the problem is that we hear the same thing from multiple characters: it's hard, the selection process is tough, and time away from family is difficult. Sure, these are real challenges, but it's something everyone in the military deals with. It feels repetitive. A deeper dive into each individual's unique journey or experience would have made the documentary more engaging, rather than getting the same talking points from different characters. Honestly, this documentary could've been cut by at least 30 minutes, as it drags on with repeated themes and redundant information.The documentary also jumps around too much, cutting between montages of flight maneuvers without offering anything new. After a while, it becomes repetitive, almost like watching the same air show on loop. While I get the need to showcase precision flying, it's not enough to sustain the entire narrative. It would've been far more engaging to weave in personal stories, struggles, and triumphs of both the pilots and the ground crew, building up to something more impactful.Some of the shots, especially during the military bearing moments, feel over-the-top and almost exaggerated. Yes, there's a need to maintain professionalism, but some of it comes off as forced and cringe-worthy. Additionally, the interview shots with the pilots feel awkward poorly positioned and lit, which detracts from their authenticity. The attempts to have them speak directly to the camera come off as stiff and unnatural. Better positioning, more relaxed setups, and improved lighting could have made those moments feel more intimate and real.Ultimately, the documentary is visually captivating but lacks substance. It's a glossy, high-production showcase of something most people already know about. As someone who's both worked on these jets and now studies film, I believe there's a richer, untold story here the human side of the Blue Angels that the film just didn't capture. There's an opportunity to explore the real-life grit behind the precision, to tell the untold stories of the people behind the jets. Unfortunately, this documentary only skims the surface, leaving the real narrative untold.",True
14,10,Excellent. Breathtaking cinematography.,reviews1958,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. Simply wow.I wish I had the opportunity to see this in IMAX as watching it on Prime at home was excellent. I can only imagine how superb it was in IMAX.I rate very few documentaries a 10 star but this was so well rounded and done so extremely well.The pilots are incredible and none of them were arrogant or obnoxious. So refreshing to see that they personally own what they are doing and enjoy every moment of the talent and opportunity they have been given.So many of the images captured the ""reached out and touched the face of God"". They were so breathtaking and heart pounding in several scenes. It is incredible what the pilots can make these flying machines do and do it so well.I applaud the effort it took to put such a great film together. I will watch this several times and it will be the first documentary I have ever done so.",False

This docu shows how hard they work to give the rest of us an amazing demo to those of us on the ground. The teamwork is incredibly precise and they all make it seem easy that which unbelievably difficult. If you want to see what teamwork really looks like, this film will give you no doubt about it. Watching this in a film will give me a better understanding of who these hardworking pilots really are, their dedication, as well as the joy one sees on the audience's face as they watch the precision and the heritage of The Blue Angels.",False
17,10,Incredible cinematography and a great story,rfmil9698,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Blue Angels as a documentary beautifully shows what the Blue Angels are about: perfection, passion and camaraderie. We should be proud of many things in the U. S., and the Blue Angels certainly demonstrates an awe at what we can do together. The U. S. Navy is rightfully proud of such a talented team, and the movie really gave a great view of the talent and effort by all the squadron members to bring the team together. I clearly enjoyed watching the film, and the squadron pilots, flight surgeon, and maintenance crew were wonderful to watch and learn from. Besides their stories it was wonderful to see flying as it is, and no cgi. Bravo!",False
18,5,Basic,MajBlade2,n/a,16/08/2025,This got really corny by the end and to much of a recuriting video. I dont think they realy ever went to deep in details that I would have liked to see especially the slection process besides the ceremony. And they dont really get into their families or history. Just seemed lacking in a lot of ways then like I said by the end got super cringy and even to much rah rah for this old navy sailor.

19,9,Reeeeaaddyyyy HIT IT!!!,tdswn,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a life long aviation enthusiast (and holding a commercial multi-engine pilot certificate) I was excited for this documentary; especially in iMAX. Even with the somewhat high expectation, I was still blown away with the jaw dropping aerial cinematography. Not only that, the way it was produced is magnificent. I am so glad that I was able to see it on the big screen instead of watching it on Amazon Prime. With that being said, if you weren't able to see it on the big screen, it'll still be good on Amazon Prime! It get's a 9/10 from me. By far the best aspect of the film was showcasing the men and women behind the scenes. The families of the pilots and maintenance crews who hold down the fort at home while their loved one is off representing the U. S. Navy/Marine.The Blue Angels is a documentary that won't bore even the children in the audience, as it is filled with stunning shots of their aircraft maneuvering, as well as views inside the cockpit.

21,9,The Braves and their Heart-Stopping Stunts! Photography at its Best,samabc-31952,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was utterly electrified by this documentary, which takes you on an intimate journey behind the scenes of the elite Blue Angels flying team. Combining heart-stopping aerial footage with personal stories of courage, skill, and teamwork, this film is a game-changer. As someone who's witnessed many airshows during my NCC days - even serving on the cadets' organizers team - I thought I'd seen it all. But this documentary was in a league of its own, showcasing a level of precision, skill, and sheer thrill that left me awestruck.Watching the Blue Angels' performances was like soaring through the skies alongside them, with the ""Diamond"" formation's 18-inch distance between planes flying at 400 mph leaving me breathless. The grueling training sessions, including the 'G-Force Centrifuge Capsule', and the daring 'Sneak', 'Break', and 'Boss' maneuvers, were exhilarating. The stunning 360-degree roll was the icing on the cake.What struck me most was the bravery and dedication of the U. S. Marine and Navy pilots, whose commitment to their craft is beyond comprehension. Their stories are humbling and inspiring, and the photography is simply stunning, capturing the beauty and power of the F/A-18 Hornets in thrilling detail.As you watch, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat, nail-biting, and covered in goosebumps. This documentary is an uplifting and thrilling ride that will leave you feeling proud and inspired. Don't miss it - it's a MUST-watch! Watch on the biggest screen in your home for the best experience!",False
22,10,Great Documentary about American Patriotism,cherylbethjohnston,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am so happy I saw this on the big IMAX screen. I know it will be streaming soon, but honestly, the aviation, power of the jets, and the sound deserve to be displayed big time. Learning what it takes to become a Blue Angels team member was special, too. The precision it takes to fly those six jets in formations with very close proximity is impressive. I especially liked watching how the pilots train and learn to deal with the G-force they experience in flight. I also enjoyed seeing the # of air shows they must perform every year. I hadn't thought about how much time the team would have to spend away from their families during their two year duty tour. This film made me be even more thankful to be an American. See it, for sure!",False

The cinematography was second to none. This provided a backseat ride in the jets. Only gripe, I'd love to see more of Fat Albert. Between the jets, the all Marine Corps crew on Fat Albert could've rounded it out. Maybe they could be the stars of Blue Angels Part 2. Each and everyone one of these service members showed us all just how high the character of our military can be.This was a great watch, it's motivating, it's exciting and you will cringe in your seat when you see how close they fly.

25,9,Good 4th of July watch,richardrc-18596,n/a,16/08/2025,"We decided to watch this today before the afternoon festivities. And overall I'd say it was a great idea. The blue angels are the elite pilots. Hands down. The amount of training, preparation, practice, and time spent together is incredible. I never thought of it like that. I forget this is their job, not just a side sport they do at times. One thing I was suprised about was top gun movies where never mentioned nor was anything about that aspect. Strange. I would have imagined one of em woulda said I know we've all seen those movies but this is more advanced than that.The reasons I didn't give it a 10 are small but my reasons. I didn't think the story was designed well. They coulda did backstory/history more. Also, since the flight crews are all special assigned too, coulda more on them. I know the pilots couldn't help it but seeing the demon aka pride flag in the hallways of the gubmint buildings is just sad. Also, the hype of the first female member. I like how the boss basically said the media can hype it all they want but it comes down to can I trust u to not kill us or yourself and do the job correct. That's what matters.",False

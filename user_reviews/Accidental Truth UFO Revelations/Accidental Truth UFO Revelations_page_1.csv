1,7,Better than some of the reviews would have you believe...,pdcrowe,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary has been professionally written and the quality of presentation is pretty good. It was entertaining and occasionally very informative. I have no idea what the people who gave this a 1/10 were watching, but it wasn't this. So taking into account this documentary and other books and documentaries over the decades then we have to surmise that there have been at least 100 UFO crashes, and many of the vehicles and sometimes bodies have been recovered. I'm coming around to the fact that these things have crashed here and organic and inorganic matter has been retrieved. However before we start screaming Government coverup and dive down the rabbit hole of conspiracy theories, lets address the enormous Mastodon in the room. These highly advanced beings that can traverse space and for all we know time and dimensions end up crashing on little old Earth over a hundred times... Nah, I don't buy it, not for a second. Read operation Trojan Horse by John Keel. Whatever this phenomenon is it's been going on for a very long time. To me these crashed vehicles and occupants look more like the items that we might put into a Rat's maze to test them. Let see if the cute critter can eventually get the nut! Its really the only option that makes any sense at all given the changing nature of the phenomenon and its complexity. Some intelligence is testing us, why? I have no idea. Do rats in a maze know they are being tested? One thing is likely, when the rats (us) do figure out what's going on, the phenomenon will probably morph into something else...",False
2,6,Where is the movie?,six2561,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not a review because I haven't been able to watch it. Ignore the stars. Where's the movie? I see it was reviewed here on Dec 8 2023, so it recently was available to watch. But now no longer on TUBI and Amazon Prime says ""Video currently unavailable"". Where did it go? The fact that it's missing makes me more interested in watching it. I submit this hoping IMDB could place a banner or something stating when it'll be available again, or why it was pulled. I always say, these types of movies are either all acting off a script- in which case in some instances there should be academy awards handed out for this category. OR ..... it's all TRUTH. Maybe that's why it was pulled from viewing?",False
3,1,Oh boy.,thesunblindness,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm open minded and agnostic about UFO'S or UAP'S. But this is just more of the same. Don't be sucked in by the PR about this one folks, or the involvement of Matthew Modine and a famous Quantum Physicist. This is another in a long, long line of awful UFO documentaries with breathtaking interviews with the same Ufologists (breathtaking in their stupidity and/or greed), awful re-enactments of shadowy government figures and horrible CGI of flying saucers and aliens. Since the UAP hearings in congress in 2020, the Ufologist and UFO entertainment community has been in a tizzy to both capitalise on the publicity, while also simultaneously trying to reclaim their status as the only folks who know what's *really* going on. They fantasise about Black Hawk helicopters buzzing above their houses and having attended briefings with presidents and CIA directors while expressing irritation that their profitable conspiracy theories are suddenly being outdone by genuinely interesting mainstream events.They're either not the sharpest tools in the shed, or blatantly trying to make money. If you're interested in genuinely interesting UFO phenomena, check out the documentary about the South African school incident in the 80s called Ariel Phenomena. Or Moment Of Contact. These are the only two I've found that are made by serious, intelligent people and professional film makers. This one is just like the other 1000 UFO documentaries with bad covers streaming all over the internet.",False
4,10,Timely and relevant!,khprpy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ron James has created a real gem of a film here, and it couldn't be more timely, with Congressional hearings on the UFO phenomenon in the news, and what appears to be a new openness towards the subject in officialdom.Accidental Truth tackles this head-on, with multiple officials going on record about the UFO phenomenon, sometimes accidentally giving out more information than they intended to.This is the only film to date that approaches this subject from this angle, and Ron James does a beautiful job here.It's an excellent film, and should be seen by everyone who has an interest in this fascinating subject.",False
5,1,Just Wow.,gfind-01522,n/a,16/08/2025,"Imagine what happens when you have a used car salesman in the late 1990s with a Pentium computer make a documentary. It's that bad.The CG looks like it was produced using the original PlayStation. The narrator will be standing outside Bigelow Airspace saying something as mundane as ""I'm at Bigelow Airspace!"" in what could be described as the production value associated with a used car ad on tv.All of the material in the movie has been covered elsewhere, and the interviews with people are just mediocre. So Gary Nolan is going to say something interesting? Make everything in black-and-white totally dramatic! I don't know if the narrator was just putting the interviewees in a bad mood, because all of them have said more interesting things elsewhere. The interview with Colonel Alexander wasn't terrible, but the problem here is there is ZERO new information.Accidental truth? More like internationally bad.Another problem is the price. Honestly, $5.99 to rent it? That's just highway robbery. It's an hour and 20 something minutes and the production quality is just shockingly bad. There was a review on The Debrief that suggested it wasn't terrible, but the author of that article must be good friends with the producer of this movie because there's no other explanation for why anyone would say this movie is anything other than terrible based on a very, very low amount of effort.How bad are the production values? Well, they reuse the same backdrop that looks like it was from 1990s computer graphics for the bullet points. They use the same annoying sound effects to try and make things more dramatic. It's just not good.If you want to see a good documentary I would recommend seeing either ""the phenomenon"" or ""I know what I saw"" or ""out of the blue."" Those are all very diligently crafted well thought out documentaries. Even the UFO show on Showtime is much better. If you want to watch something good for free, go watch the secret of Skinwalker Ranch or unidentified on the history channel.So here the whole movie feels like just a flagrant money grab. And when people produce movies this bad, it does not make the UFO topic more serious. It makes it seem just silly and poorly thought out which it is not, but that's the way it comes off here.These are the main things you need to know about this movie and at this point I need to hit 600 characters minimum. So at this point, I would just tell you don't bother- go watch something else. And even renting this for ANY amount of money would seem like a total rip off. Honestly, I'm a little bit surprised that the interviewer managed to set up interviews with these people who are highly credible, but I honestly don't know how he managed to do it because the skill set from this person is so bad. I don't really know why anyone would sign up to do an interview with this person.Occasionally, a movie is so bad that it's enjoyable and is actually good. This is **not** one of those times.Save your money and watch any other documentary on UFOs.",False
6,10,Don't Listen To Govt Shills,someforthedoctor,n/a,16/08/2025,"The accounts trying to downvote this supremely important information must be government shill accounts. That's the only explanation I can come up with for anyone who would vote this a 1. The Congressional testimony highlighted, the WIlson Memo, and all evidence pointing to compartmentalized special-access-programs needs as much light-of-day as we can bring to bear. Don't let the bots win. We need as many documentaries like this as we can get. Think of how badly some of the people talked about here don't want to be known of. Make them known. Say their names, and share this movie everywhere you can. It's good.",False
7,1,Rubbish,thejeta1,n/a,16/08/2025,If you watch this and believe. Then you are not truly informed. The content included here is false and or misleading. I direct you to the New York Post video expose on Skinwalker Ranch. Further there are many issues here which simply do not stack up. Why? Because they don't have the real evidence to support the narrative. Instead they have only people onscreen talking. People can talk all day about what he said she said etc. Importantly I am very well versed in immersing myself in this material and subject matter. Why? Because I want to be informed by all sorts of content across multiple platforms. Sadly this doco falls very far short of properly informing. Instead it rehashes old or worse lazy misnomers. You've been warned.,False
8,10,Best UFO documentry,sedonajocelyn,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you enjoy the UFO subject, you will enjoy this movie. This is the best UFO movie I've ever seen! I saw this movie at the premier in Sedona and I got the last seat in the house... SRO. When the movie ended the house have filmmaker a well deserved standing O. Do not miss seeing this! UFO dialogue is coming and this movie is one of the reasons why the public knows that the truth has been hidden. These are not actors in the film, but well known researchers and officials who are. On are on the record- sometimes accidentally telling the truth... If you want the truth this is it. Highly recommended.",False
9,1,"More of the same rehashed info, nothing new",Xavier_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"They start out by detailing to the stars academy and the wonderful amount of info they have provided to the ufo community. Which if you are familiar with them, is exactly nothing. That is why they disbanded in 2020, everyone gave up on them after their talk show circuit was exposed for providing no new info.Lets show the gimball ufo video again, it's been out for 3 years now, surely it qualifies as new info. Lets mentio Project Blue Book, Richard Dolan and Lew(Lue, Luis) Elizondo and others in the usual interview settings and get their insights. Again, nothing new.At this point these shows are tedious. Funny this one didn't mention Roswell, perhaps at 1.5hrs they thought they had enough filler.",False
10,8,Excellent Overview Of the UFO Topic/Agenda,rocco-67568,n/a,16/08/2025,"I highly recommend this documentary for both those who are new to the topic and those who have been studying it. It covers the government's involvement and cover up, as well as the possibilities for the future.I have viewed many of the shows and documentaries out there, and this qas certainly worth while!Interviews with many of the more current players (Elizondo, Burchett, Bigelow, etc) reveal some information that has yet to be revealed and/or shows the direction things are headed.There is much speculation about this topic. Yet, this documentary tends to lend hope toward disclosure sooner rather than later. While past government programs have been able to fend off public interest, today's technology and information sharing may finally force them to admit the truth about what is really going on.",False
11,1,Poorly Put Together,Denniswatts1989,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am open-minded, and have a lot of time for the idea that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe. That, to me, is an exciting idea. Hence, for me to give up on a documentary on this subject after 15 minutes means something is wrong.To be succinct, it was boring! It seemed to be an endless series of snippets of interviews. There was no life to the thing. It was very uninspiring and dull. Maybe the information it was conveying was interesting, but it somehow contrived to make it as interesting as watching an episode of Friends. Do yourself a favour and find something else to watch.",False
12,9,Insightful with good re-enactments,MarkKnudson,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you like documentaries about the UFO phenomenon, cover-ups, and insider secrets, then you'll like this film. Even if this is not your favorite genre, the new information on the subject presented with authentic UFO's caught on camera, re-enactments and close-ups of craft should keep you intrigued. The authors, scientists and other officials interviewed are some of the top authorities on the subject including Luis Elizondo, Michio Kaku (Discovery Channel), Jimmy Church, and Nick Pope (British government ministry of defense) The film delves deep into the current disclosure movement still being held back by government cover-ups and lies. Accidental Truth inspires the truth seeker.",False
13,8,"Good factual content detail0, but production value hokey AF",stateofstatic,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGotta admit...when they started the intro with terrible cgi, fake photos mixed in with real ones, and over the top dramatic music I almost turned it off in the first 5 minutes. But I slogged it out and there were some useful bits to extract.1. Dr. Nolan gets caught in a lie that he had never examined classified exotic materials when he had.2. Robert Bigalow walking back that he ever saw or had classified exotic materials that he literally built a facility to study.3. FOIA release on materials research related to UAP.4. Chris Mellon had to get specific about his level of access to SAPs during his time in office to state that he was not privy to ALL SAPs, but rather some in intelligence and some within the military but NOT within the Department of Energy.Would have liked to have heard info about:Zodiac
Jehovah
Fort Detrick.",True
14,10,Well crafted and expertly executed,simonebcox-48166,n/a,16/08/2025,"Regardless of whether you're a true believer, agnostic, or skeptical, this documentary provides an astounding amount of compelling testimony and evidence from a vast array of subject matter experts (including military, science, education) on the UFO/UAP phenomenon. Ron James has created an exhaustive and in-depth incisive look as to the what, when, and how the movement towards transparency from government agencies has evolved.Perhaps the next obvious step is to discern the ""why"" this information has not been readily available. Apparently the mere mention of this topic causes extreme distress in those who rail against any further investigation.",False
15,9,Poor Production Values but Great information,Nekron98,n/a,16/08/2025,"Low budget CGI and annoying dramatic music but some important people giving a great overview of the UFO cover up thats been going for decades.This is much better than most of the UFO docs available.If you are interested in this subject then its still hard to beat
Leslie Keens book ""UFOs: Generals, Pilots, and Government Officials Go on the Record""For decades all we had was the testimony of civilians but since its publication in 2011 it has opened the door for many professional people to tell their stories without harming the their careers.Im not convinced its aliens behind all these UFO's but there is definately something going on.",False
16,10,Must see,lucastennise,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must say that Accidental Truth was an exceptional piece of work. The documentary brought together some of the most prominent figures in Ufology, and it was fascinating to hear their perspectives on the subject. From researchers to witnesses, everyone who is anyone in the field was included in this film.One of the things that impressed me most about this documentary was the timeline. The documentary covered everything from the early sightings in the 1940s and 1950s to the modern-day encounters. The timeline also included significant events in Ufology, such as the Roswell incident and the Phoenix Lights.Another aspect of the documentary that stood out was the diverse perspectives that were included. The film presented various viewpoints on the subject, from those who believe in extraterrestrial life to skeptics who dismiss the phenomenon. The documentary did an excellent job of presenting all sides of the argument, which allowed me to form my own opinions on the subject.Finally, I was impressed with the research that went into the documentary. The filmmakers clearly did their homework, and they presented a lot of evidence to support their claims. I appreciated the attention to detail and the thoroughness of the research.",False
17,10,Wow... Fantastic documentary!!!,astudios-08951,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching Accidental Truth: UFO RevelationsThat movie was amazing!ACCIDENTALThat was by far the most interesting ""documentary"" I have ever seen!Ron James did a phenomenal job incorporating the raw footage, animations and graphics with
varieties and great backdrops to keep everything interesting.Wow...
Fascinating!Even the interviews.. talking heads, were interesting with the incorporation of animations and live footage.Love the live footage of Ron on location.Even in front of the White House in Washington DC!It looked and sounded phenomenal.Especially liked the sequences with Lue Elizondo.He's so chill and interesting to listen to.Also like many sections with Garry Nolan & Mike Bara.NIck Pope had some great content and perspectives on UFOs.Nice detail...
Love the way Tim. Burchett ends his interview taking off his mike... I'm out of here!Dr. Kaku interviews had great content and remind me of Mr. Miagi from the Karate Kid.That may be my favorite interview.Personally....
I have always felt that if I ever saw a spaceship, or space being in person, it would complete my life.We are not alone! For sure! Or were they ""Weather Balloons""? Hmmmmm LOLGreat content and explanations for this otherworldly phenomenon.A MUST SEE!!!!",False
18,10,Compelling Viewing,gregmdhayes,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its the little accidental slips...here and there that shine an extra light here!! Reminds me of that Robert McNamara movie The Fog of War - Massive kudos to the filmmaker's research and knowledge here to put a chronological timeline based on known factual information that can be backed up - not just dragging out people's own opinions. As a comprehensive catchup to the subject he has done
a fine job - if you watch one movie on the subject this month make it this one folks. P. S.....its funny the way for some movie releases in this genre that 1 star movie reviews pop up....before the movie is actually released!!! ;)",False
19,10,Great UFO Movie,pvcckzc,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a truthful and well-intentioned ufo movie. Ron James did a great job putting this together and chose the right people and witnesses you make it shine. Everyone should take the time to watch this and study the topic for themselves.After watching some interviews with Ron James, it is clear that he has a great grasp on the subject, and is a skeptic when he needs to be. Please give this a watch and tell your family and friends to as well. This could be one of the most important topics going forward into the future, especially with all of the interest that our government has been showing!!",False
20,10,A Riveting Journey into UFO Revelations,jdavis-65630,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Accidental Truth: UFO Revelations,"" directed and edited by Ron James, is a compelling documentary that delves deep into the enigmatic world of UFOs. What makes this film stand out is the range of credible voices, including John B. Alexander, Elizabeth April, and Mike Bara, offering a diverse spectrum of insights. The cinematography is engaging, effectively drawing the viewer into each discussion. Ron James' direction is commendable for presenting complex subjects in an accessible manner. This film significantly deepened my understanding of the UFO phenomenon, striking a fine balance between skepticism and belief. Whether you're a long-time follower of UFO lore or new to the subject, ""Accidental Truth"" offers a fascinating and thought-provoking experience that challenges conventional narratives and invites us to ponder the possibilities of what might be concealed beyond the public eye.",False
21,10,Compelling,heraclitean,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've watched this documentary twice. Possibly the best documentary yet on the subject of the UAP. Experts Prof. Michio Kaku. Gen. John Alexander (ret), and NY Times reporter. Ralph Blumenthal weigh in on what these craft might represent and how the Government has controlled and continues to control the narrative. And that what has been released to the public is but a drop in the proverbial bucket. But full disclosure is not about to happen because so long as this phenomenon is considered a 'national security threat' then the public must be kept in the dark.Considerable evidence is brought to bear on the idea that the Government has known about these craft for at least 75 years. With the release in 2017 of the gimbal and tic-tac radar returns, the Pentagon admitted that what UFO hunters have always known: that there's something out there that defies explanation.",False

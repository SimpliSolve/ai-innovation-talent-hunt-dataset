1,9,Great show,glenhammond,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes it's July and I'm football starved but that doesn't matter because this is a great show. A rare insight into the games most important position & personalities that don't often get proper behind the scenes coverage.I enjoy hard knocks but you know what you're getting: football is back & here's some roster bubble players we want you to root for.With Quarterback the toned & focus shifts. Personally I enjoyed being able to see what Mahomes was really like away from the field. It's football rather than fame which drives him, and given all the previous press coverage about his wife and brother it's nice to see more rounded view of his life.If you love football you'll love this show.",False
2,8,I know nothing about this sport but still really enjoyed it.,lovemichaeljordan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I know close to nothing about the NFL but I still very much enjoyed this series. I don't know the rules, terms or anything. I don't even know how the scoring system works.It's a very good insight into the life of a worldclass athlete in a sport I know little about. Not only have I learned more about NFL but also the mind of different athletes.I understand if some people would like an introduction to the rules but that would put off actual football fans. You don't have to know the rules, because the music and narration will tell you when they do good/bad. It's more about the players' psyches rather than the sport itself.Very well made series in all aspects. If you are a fan of sports you will enjoy this. Netflix has been doing a great job with their sportdocs recently.",False
3,9,A Beautiful Show That Encapsulates The Meaning of a QB,ozzyweisberg,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an advid sports fan, being able to watch this show felt like heaven.Executive producer Peyton Manning does an amazing job showing the world of being a quarterback in multiple different ways.He shows the triumph of being a winning, successful player in Patrick Mahomes, the underdog story of Kirk Cousins, and the hard fought journey to work back to stardom with Marcus Mariota.The only con I have for the show is how it neglectfully presents Mariota compared to the other stars of the docu series. Watching the Mariota parts made me feel like he is a bad quarterback not fit for the job.Overall, Quarterback is a compelling tale adding to the already known 2022-2023 NFL season.",False
4,10,10/10 Incredible Behind the Scenes Look at the life of an NFL Quarterback,kchiefs1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Football fans will love the look behind the curtain into the personal life of the most important position in sports. Non-football fans will love the look at the lives of the rich and famous.It was interesting watching the greatest QB in the game today go about his daily business. Patrick Mahomes is not only a great human being but maybe the best teammate in NFL history. He wills his team to win.Mahomes is the star of this production. I'd say he gets 50% of the show with Cousins about 33.3% with Mariota about 16.7%.I thought there might be more of Andy Reid but it's not called Head Coach, so I get it. Might be an idea to do this on 3 different head coaches? Just an idea.Unheralded star of the show: Julie Cousins - she was fantastic10/10 - MUST SEE for all football fans.",False
5,10,Must See to get into the minds of a QB,jenniferfalck,n/a,16/08/2025,"The perfect series of you are a football fan and something to make you look forward to the the upcoming season.The 3 QB's they are showcasing are the perfect mix of where they are in their career.As an avid Vikings fan and one who likes the Chiefs, you get a glimpse into what really makes them tick. Not knowing a lot about Mariota, I enjoyed getting glimpse of who he is.Visually stunning, and a well produced production value is exceptional, and you really feel like you are up close and personal to the players and their lives.From the season preview, I'm really looking forward to seeing how the show showcases the biggest comeback ever in football history. That's going to be really exciting.I'm looking forward to the rest of this series.",False
6,10,Absolutely brilliant,rynoneill-74879,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary follows the life's and careers of 3 quarterbacks through a season into post season. Im English and do not follow American football, however love watching documentaries about them. The amount of clutch plays are incredible. I found all 3 players and their stories fascinating in particular Mahones & Cousins.Some reviews have an issue around players wife's/ family's getting so much air time... but these are the people that mould and guide these special talents off the pitch and are as much of the their story as anyone else.Whilst the star on the pitch is certainly Mahones... the star of the show is Cousins. The man is everything you'd want in a college, friend and family member. A true gentleman and an athlete striving as much to be a top level competitor as he is to be a great person.As for Mahones... just wow. You want to know what a warrior and a competitor looks like, well look no further. He also seemed like a great guy very focused on his family too.Honestly one of the best documentaries I've watched in a long time. I am a fan of the All Or Nothing series - but every single one finishes in failure. The fact this ends in success for one of the athletes makes it all the more special.Well done Netflix, you can't make movies. But you set the bar for sports documentaries.",False
7,10,Incredible Docuseries,renegadehayes,n/a,16/08/2025,"As an NFL superfan, this all-access pass to the toughest job in all of sports was by far my favorite sports-themed series of 2023 and I give it a 10/10. Looking back at Patrick Mahomes of the Chiefs (my all-time favorite quarterback and NFL player), Kirk Cousins of the Vikings and Marcus Mariota of the Falcons over the course of the 2022-2023 season was enjoyable in every way possible.If you're looking for something NFL-related during the summer while waiting for next season, then I highly recommend Quarterback if you have Netflix. Peyton Manning's Omaha Productions did a great job with NFL Films on putting together such an incredible docuseries, and I wish that there are more shows like this!",False
8,7,Could've been a 10,zxgxtzv,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerGreat documentary! I loved getting to know Kirk more. He was really a down to earth guy. Patrick Mahomes was great too but came off a little cringey at times. What happened to Marcus? I know he got benched and had an injury but they couldn't show what he was up to at all? He completely disappeared. Where the show really took a major hit is they made Patrick's wife the star of the show. After every single play they had to show her reaction. She was already a very unlikeable person before this so I have no idea why they chose that route. At the end I had to turn it off because she was so unbearable.,True
9,9,The Brittany Show,void-account,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great series about the 3 QBs. This series made me love Cousins even more, and he seems like an amazing guy (this is coming from a non-Vikings fan). Mariota's story is also interesting, especially learning about why he chose to separate from the Falcons after the QB change.My biggest gripe with this series is the amount of screentime Brittany Maholmes gets. She's not a QB, so why do they focus on her and her commentary so much? She's annoying! It's as if she's talking even more because she knows she's being filmed. They don't give the other wives as much screentime, and it's great to get their take and perspective into their lives, but it's not overboard like Brittany.",False
10,7,First Taste of NFL,dfsfkzy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant show, great insight into what it takes to be the best! However, Brittany Mahomes ruins it for me, craves the limelight & starving for attention, shows called 'Quarterback' not 'QuarterBrittany' shut the hell up! Apart from her wanting all the attention it's a great series & really shows how hard these guys work to do the things they do. Not a massive NFL fan either however after watching this it has made me a lot more interested in the sport, can't be a chiefs fan though after listening to Mahomes Mrs talk Rubbish and crave the attention living off the hard work & determination her husband shows weekly.",False
11,10,If you love Football this is it!,clkmellang,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a female and a huge football lover. I appreciated all the details that Peyton Manning and his crew did on this documentary. I think they spread the love evenly between the 3. Although of course maybe just a bit more on KC and Mahomes since they won the Super Bowl. Unlike some people I did not have an issue with the coverage of the wives. I loved seeing the more personal aspects of their lives. I'm a SF 49er however I kind of have a crush now on Kirk Cousins. And a new respect for that man! After episode 3 I was like "" How does he do it?"" I want him to win his Super Bowl with the Vikings but maybe not for 1 more year as SF needs it right now. I Hope Quarterback does some follow up-another Season maybe.",False
12,6,It would have been better without Mahone's wife,juandalf,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's nice to see the insights of a quarterback life, but dedicating half of some episodes to Brittany Mahone's reacts to her husband's plays wasn't nice at all.Producers of the show maybe thought it was interesting to show that part of their daily lifes, but she just destroys the mood of the viewers with her stupid comments.There are already few similar reviews about her and they aren't wrong.If there will be a new season: more players and less strident wifes.I also noticed how simple are these guys. Their conversations are dull and empty. Very simple/basic men who let their wifes to dress them and basically don't know much about anything else than football. Quite interesting.",False
13,5,Relatively boring for the most part.,beavanjb,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you followed the 2022 NFL season, then about 50% of this filming you've already seen. Early episodes feature all 3 Quarterbacks but eventually fades into nothing but loud mouth Mahomes family, unless you are a Chiefs fan I can't imagine how that would be interesting. To me Kirk Cousins was the star of the show and guy I'd want to meet and his wife seems real nice too. I wish there was more on Mariota, but I understand the players had veto rights and blocked a lot of the footage from being used. I guess this show appeals to Chiefs fans and those into Real House wives type shows, i don't know, but there's so much I'd rather watch.",False
14,9,Great behind the scenes look!,mikeypolo24,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust finished this NFL quarterback series. Absolutely love it! Great look at the behind-the-scenes aspects of being a QB in the NFL. I've really always loved Patrick Mahomes and do you believe he may be the best to ever do it. But looking at Kirk cousins from this standpoint I really have gained a lot of respect for him as well. Kirk catches a lot of flak but you can see he's a true competitor. Fought through a lot of bumps and bruises to make it through this season. I'd like to see more episodes to be honest and I really hope they do this again next season. Maybe Aaron Rodgers Joe Burrow, and Josh Allen or Jalen hurts for the next year. Only thing I don't understand is what made them follow Marcus Mariota as the third player. Maybe they wanted to watch someone struggle? Can't imagine expectations were too high for him coming into the year on a team basically rebuilding.",True
15,8,Payton Manning brings us some insight into the job of a working quarterback.,cgvsluis,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have to start by listing my alliances, born and raised in Seahawk country, I am a loyal Seahawks fan. Having said that I also bleed purple and gold as a University of Washington Husky. Now that we got that out of the way, it is not to say that I haven't appreciated and been fans of specific players...huge Howie Long fan from waaaaay back, even though he played for the hated Raiders, and Peyton Manning? Who doesn't live Peyton Manning? Also there have been a few USC quarterbacks that I have watched and cheered for, but that is kind of the extent of my football fandom.Having said all of that, my husband (the traitor that he is) is a huge Kansas City Chiefs fan...so I have been subjected to every one of Patrick Mahoney' games since we started dating and eventually married. Which is what brought us to watching this Quarterback documentary. Do I feel any affinity for the Chiefs? No. But I will say I have appreciated the head coach Andy Reid over the years. He seems to be a class act all around.That was a long explanation for why I don't have a horse in this race between the three quarterbacks followed over the course of the documentary: Kirk Cousins, Marcus Mariota, and Patrick Mahomes.The documentary did a wonderful job sharing the ins and outs of the job of the quarterback on an American football team in the NFL, every hit at a time over the course of a single season (the 2022-23 season). Each episode highlights a different aspect of their job from the mental game to dealing with the wear and tear to their bodies.The series was well put together and moved along quickly throughout the season. Personally I gained a lot of respect for Kirk Cousins. I am not sure that I saw him play a single game in the 2022 season and I couldn't even have told you his name before watching this documentary, but I am not going to forget him now. I appreciated his relationship with his wife and children. I appreciated that they sat in the stands, drove a minivan, took their kids to school, and carved out time to take a neighborhood walk with one another. There were two things that I saw Kirk Cousins do in this documentary that solidified my viewing him as a class act and will make me forever remember his name (and maybe tune in to watch him play football!): the first is watching him drive his wife and son home in their minivan after loosing a very important playoff game and not only taking the time to sign an autograph in the parking lot but to read a bedtime story and tuck each of his kids into bed which spoke volumes about him as a person and a father and the second which is something small and seemingly very simple...but the fact that he sits down weekly in this day and age and hand writes letters to his fans that write to him. I have a tremendous amount of respect for him as a human being. I might even have to write him a letter myself.Marcus Mariota's story was the hardest to watch as he doesn't finish the 2022 season as quarterback. He and his wife do community outreach and welcomed their first child into the world. Like the Cousins, the Mariotas seemed like regular people. Marcus seemed to be the most reserved and maybe the most insecure of the three. Unfortunately, right from the preseason training it was obvious that his head coach didn't spend the kind of time off the field and on the field that the other two quarterbacks experienced with their head coaches. For an outside observer it would be easy to see how that might play into the head game and insecurities of a quarterback. So, I guess you could say I lost a lot of respect for Arthur Smith, the head coach of the Atlanta Falcons (guess I won't be cheering for them any time soon, which works out since Marcus is now playing for The Philadelphia Eagles). This was quite the contrasting story since Andy Reid and Patrick Mahomes have such a great relationship and Kirk Cousins who got off to a bumpy start with his head coach Kevin O'Connell (in fact you could say they initially butted heads) but then really started to gel from game 8 onward. It made the absence in the communication between head coach Arthur Smith to his quarterback really noticeable. Bad on you, Arthur. I guess you get what you cultivate and work for.The one downside is I lost a little respect for the Mahomes family who came across as elitist one percenters sitting away from the stands in their private boxes at games, flying private jets, building mega mansions with swim up bars in their pools, owning professional soccer teams, and partying while they work as ""influencers""...meanwhile rape allegations are brought against Patrick's younger brother (another ""influencer"" who is depicted in this documentary). Yeah, I kind of lost some respect for them. The nicest thing I can say about them at this point is that Patrick met his wife while he was young and they are still together...she is embarrassingly immature and self-centered even though she is a year older than he is. I hope they are able to last, but it doesn't seem like they are laying the best groundwork for their future.While I am not a big football fan, I did enjoy this documentary tremendously. I looked at it as a study in the human condition and I was quite heartened to be introduced to a class act like Kirk Cousins. I think if you are a football fan this is a must see and I highly recommend it. If you are not a football fan but enjoyed learning about top athletes, their job and family life...I still highly recommend it.",False
16,8,"Great show, but cut out the wife's please!!!",jensnolting,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great show. Nice inside looks. Really like to be that close to the 3 different quarterbacks and type of players. But especially wife of mahomes and always showing the unbelievable annoying wife's in their vip lounges with all the annoying stupidity is nearly ruining the whole joy of watching the doc.Absolute useless. Complete non sympathetic. Why only her? All the other wife's where in the background. So please please please, just focus in the real stuff and not some stupid commentator stuff from a frontlight searching wife of a great football player. Sad and useless and nobody cares about this stuff.",False
17,10,Entertaining,zacharystephenson,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's been really interesting to see the life of these three quarterbacks. The show does a great job of showing so many different aspects of their lives, not just as football players. You never really think about what a player does after the game, and how they process things before and after.It's also cool to see how each quarterbacks trains a little differently. I really look forward to seeing how this show progresses and all the different quarterbacks they bring in. Would be fun if they could cover Aaron Rodgers in his first year as a jet. Possibly down the road they could even expand to different position groups. First season is 10/10.",False
18,6,"As usually with Netflix docs, too many episodes",Novaj9,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPretty good football doc, but they really could have condensed it into 4 teams r even 6 episodes. 8 was way too many and it felt like half of it was suffering through Mahomes and his wife screaming and saying ""let's gooooo!!!"" I know they won the Super Bowl, but they could have spent time on some other QBs and still had a compelling show. Also thought it was weird that Mariota was benched and he literally disappeared for the last two episodes. Overall an entertaining watch, but if you are already annoyed by Brittany Mahomes this doc won't do much to change your mind. Hopefully they'll make a second season and focus on a few different QBs.",True
19,10,Capt Kirk,dc530,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching the series, I have so much respect for Kirk Cousins ..... and Marcus Mariota, Missouri. I thought was a better person than he actually is portrayed to be in the game and Patrick Mahomes you have to respect him. He's a great player but I'm a Raiders fan so I don't like the Chiefs. Perfect but he's a good father and a good football player. Gotta give him his respect.All in all Peyton Manning has made a good series easily rivaling, Espn chart or anything close to it from there anymore so I hope they continue with this series and maybe next season bringing Derek Carr and Joe Burrow's and somebody else but I'm not sure, but I would watch it 100%",False
20,7,New QBs to root for,debbliz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love KC and wanted to remain a Mahomes' fan, but good grief he needs to clean up his language....along with his wife. Maybe it was just for the cameras? Makes it hard to watch, let alone with grandkids.So enjoyed watching Kirk Cousins. Has the drive, athleticism, and just all around incredible person. I've never been a Viking fan, but I am now. Can't wait to see his next season. Also, like Marcus Mariota....class act despite a less than stellar perfomance.I was also intrigued with Joe Burrow. He's going to be fun to watch.As of now rooting 100% for Vikings! Bengals trailing..............",False
21,7,Insufferable Wife,schmenga,n/a,16/08/2025,Sorry but how the editors and producers did not pick up on the insufferability of Brittany Mahomes is beyond me. This is not anti wife. Cousins and Marietta's were great.A bit too much Jesus mentions too but if Christian athletes do not care about their Muslim brethren that is on them.The rest was really good. Especially the Cincy KC dynamic. They also did a good job of presenting how in spite of Cousins being good and having good statistics there is something missing that separates him from the top QBsLess Brittany pleaseMore Kelce. Would have liked a little more on Mariotta but recognize they missed the playoffs.,False
22,5,"Get rid of the wife's, girlfriends and hangers on ...",AllanWB,n/a,16/08/2025,"... and it would be an excellent series. I'm British but have been an avid football fan since channel 4 in the UK started broadcasting it way back in the early 80's.The QB's in the series are without a doubt all great players and the series highlights that very well. However please, please get rid of the screaming wife's.There was one instance in the first episode when Pat Mahomes wife was in the VIP box with some of her female friends. Pat threw a TD and the camera cut to the VIP box where his wife was going ballistic. Screaming and shouting and jumping up and down. Her friend (I assume she was her friend) started doing the same thing but only after she realised what had just happened. She was a millisecond late in jumping , and shouting and seemed to me that she only did it to impress Pat's wife. The whole thing then became so false.Without the screaming wife I would have given it at least a 7 or 8.",False
23,10,One of the best,mickeyadamo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lenses into the life of a quarterback trying to balance his career against personal life and auxiliary pressures. I was so impressed with the level of training Mahomes goes through as part of his regimen to compete in the league. It really showed why this player is operating at such a high caliiber, especially when compared to that of other quarterbacks on the documentary.That being said, each player seems to have a way to play to their own strengths. I really enjoyed the focus on personal lives and how this dynamic impacts the players. The eventual transition to a major focus on teams that continued into the playoffs, and then the superbowl made the experience immensely enjoyable.Ok so disclaimer - I am a Chiefs fan, and probably carry a lot of bias as the show really began to focus on Mahomes and his journey towards the end of the season, but imagine if this was the QB of your team, and having this to reflect on after going on that journey with your favorite team throughout the season.. I think it was just epic timing by the show, and and super grateful to have been given this deeper insight into what the players go through to try and be their best. Honestly, I feel like the rest of the league might need to catch up to KC, because danggggg these guys take practice seriously. Rooting for them to get plenty more rings over the coming year, Go KC!!A+, would totally recommend.",False
24,8,Peyton Manning produced outstanding docuseries,dfloro,n/a,16/08/2025,"I haven't been a big NFL fan since my childhood, but nowadays I am a big Patrick Mahomes II fan! As a sportscaster is briefly quoted as saying in an early episode: I believe Patrick Mahomes may be the greatest quarterback in the history of the game. To which I would have to respond: Ditto! I've never seen a more charismatic team leader or one with a superior ability to find new and exhilarating ways to win games. But he's just one of the three QBs (and their kids and wives) on which this program focuses its 2022 Season attention: the other two are Kirk Cousins of the Minnesota Vikings and Marcus Mariota of the Atlanta Falcons. To sum up their seasons: ultimately disappointing and totally disastrous, respectively. I will say that I did gain a lot of respect for Cousins; I have never seen a single player be hit any harder or more times per game than he was. And then get right back to his feet, usually still moaning in pain (involuntarily, but not ""complaining""), and keep on going. Vikings ended the season with the third best W/L record after the NFL's two Super Bowl teams (Chiefs and Eagles). I won't spoil Mariota's conclusion, but it sure wasn't pretty nor was it inspirational. So I give this documentary a solid 8/10 stars; I look forward to many more seasons of Patrick throwing bombs between defenders, sidearming screen passes for unlikely first downs, shoveling footballs underhanded into endzones for TDs, and all the playmaking that may well make him the newest GOAT!",False
25,10,"Wow, what a treat!!",Fozthedog,n/a,16/08/2025,"I absolutely loved this series. And being a Chiefs fan this was extra exciting to watch. I loved the 3 qb's they chose for this series. So cool to see an indepth look into the QB position and from 3 different perspectives and places in the league. The episode about play calling and mahomes' workouts are wild!!My favorite story was actually that of Kirk Cousins. Even being a devoted Chiefs and mahomes fan, I just loved learning about this guy! He cracks me up! His story was inspiring and also how he seems like such a great guy. I'm so rooting for him.I know there's been some negative comments about Brittany Mahomes, but, it actually made me like her more. They seem like such a sweet family and their kids are so damn cute. I personally really loved learning more about their family and respect them even more.Hopefully this series continues! And would be cool to get the perspectives of other positions on the team. Next up...tight ends??",False

1,8,"Brilliant, Sly shows his genius",OfficialCoachDanny,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sly clearly wasn't happy with the original cut of Rocky IV, so now he has permission to cut it his way, as was originally intended, this documentary shows Stallone reflecting on the original movie and how he's going to make it better, sone fantastic insight and so interesting, Sly showing he just has a gift for tweaking the smallest scenes to make them better, a must watch before or even after you have seen the new Rocky IV directors cut
Rocky v Drago reimagined.",False
2,7,Fun Look Behind the Scenes,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is a lot of interesting aspects of this one. A very small documentary, shot on an iPhone, during the height of the COVID pandemic. Sylvester Stallone used the time to re-edit Rocky IV and make a movie he was more commutable with; 35 years after the fact. The documentarian captures a raw Stallone talking pretty openly about his vision and his process for filmmaking and acting. You get a senses, that regardless of the outcome, that Stallone is a very thoughtful craftsman who cares about his craft. He also is a man who understand the failings of his relative youth and impatience at the time he made the Rocky films. His approach is from that of a senior man and filmmaker that has seen a lot. This is a real winner of you are a Stallone and/or Rocky films.",False
3,6,Watch the original not the ultimate cut,madsgormlarsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"The original is better - it's just more fun and lighthearted. Removing the robot scenes is a good example of this, als√• extending the funeral scene - but also I think Sylvester is trying to make the fight more realistic - and that fight is just never going to be realistic. - it should be over the top, jumping the shark all out entertainment.",False

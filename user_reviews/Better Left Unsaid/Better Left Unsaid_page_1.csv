1,8,Time for something new,jasonitgod,n/a,15/08/2025,Forget everything. Planetary management instead of politics is our best hope.,False
2,6,It's not wrong,hootie-50879,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI was hoping for more of a balance. However, the context is accurate to one extent. It does expose the hypocrisy and contradiction in extreme liberal group think in the current US social climate. I would like people with progressive or far-left views to watch to discover reasons why there is resistance to a left radical agenda. Reasons that cannot always be blamed as racism.It would be nice to have a companion documentary about the far-right. The far-right is not a complicated matter. The far-right mantra is based on hate and racial purity and has no place in any society in a global community. The content states the extreme left want you to believe they are against hate and racial segregation but are creating their own.The ending is the problem. The ending takes away from a very important message and misses the opportunity to show how the far left and the far right both can create atrocity and misery. Instead the film chooses to show the view that the far-left is a catalyst for the far-right. Otherwise, my rating would be higher.",True
3,10,A Must Watch!,neonthrush,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerCurt jaimungal's film Better Left Unsaid is a gripping analysis of our growing modern political polarization, and an exploration of how we got here.Curt takes his audience through his journey of discovering how and when the modern left goes too far, and why reasoned debate has never been more important. The film documents the growing revolt against enlightenment ideals permiating politics, media and academia, and outlines the societal implications of our post-truth era.Better Left Unsaid is masterful rebuke of radicalism, and an appeal to sense-making in a time of growing division and conflict. A must watch.",True
4,10,Danger on the Left - A triumph!,knight_sky_la,n/a,15/08/2025,A phenomenal triumph! An artistic and erudite portrait of a rising ideological leitmotif gripping the planet. This would play well in theaters but is absolutely a must watch on demand.Not to be missed.To be savored.,False
5,10,Must see,CertainlyUncertain,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a must watch film for anyone interested in what is going on with western domocracies right now.,False
6,n/a,Intriguingly insightful!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,This is a fantastic eye opening piece that really makes you question your perspective in today's world. This discussion needs to be had and Curt does a great job in tackling all the important aspects of such a topic. I was hooked on to this documentary from the beginning and it was a great watch!,False
7,3,Beware of the fake reviews,Gorillaboi,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went into this seeking a fair, balanced look at the extremes that exist on both sides.Instead it's a one-sided critical analysis of the extreme left - to which the extreme right are treated as a by-product.",False
8,10,An entertaining but very important documentary,nancy-hildebrandt,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've been waiting to see this documentary...and now that I've seen it, it's living with me. There's much more depth than I can absorb in one sitting.Curt Jaimungal speaks fluent Wokese and is an excellent interpreter. He addresses this partial list of questions in his unique approach:Why does everything has to be political now?Why are we now compulsively assigned to race and gender buckets?Why are Leftist rioting and violence not only condoned but encouraged?Why have terms like racism and gender been redefined so we can't communicate ideas that can be understood by others?Where did all this came from, not just in the US but in many Western countries?Is there a way we can come back together?Mr. Jaimungal gives the most thorough explanation of Left (and Right) extremism that I've yet come across, with clips from experts to illustrate his points, plus many other imaginative clips, visual effects, and humor that kept me engrossed.As much as I love this film, will it change minds? The most important part of the documentary is the review of worldwide government-backed atrocities committed in the name of ""oppression"" and tribalism. Many of us (including me) want to stick our heads in the sand and have faith that everything will come back into balance eventually. Well, now I see the wagon is already careening down the hill with us in it. When will we wake up and see what's coming?Mr. Jaimungal, you had me sitting on the edge of my seat for an hour and a half. I will continue to follow you closely and will be interested in anything you have to say.",True
9,1,Highly biased take,pacocharte,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerNote the title: Better LEFT unsaid. Could it be more clear what the message would be? Ignore the absolutely insane 10-star reviews. C'mon 10 stars? As in better than ""Ghandi"", ""Schindler's List"", ""The Shining"", ""Chinatown"", etc?This is a highly biased and irrational take on the current state of our political polarization. Ridiculously it paints the far-right as a by-product of the so-called far-left, despite the fact that the former has for dozens of decades - at the behest of private capital - absolutely crushed any meaningful leftist movement in the USA. In fact, today's ""far-left"" identity politics are a predictable by-product of the right-leaning, anti-socialist, alternative-history teaching American exceptionalist/Western chauvinist narratives that have been crammed down this country's throat by the rich and powerful since independence from Britain was declared.If you're on the political right, or have been convinced that to be on the ""left"" means embracing identity politics at the expense of any other policies (pro-worker, anti-at-will employment, anti-offshoring of American jobs, pro-teaching American history as it really happened, etc.) then this is the movie for you. It will confirm all of your biases while pretending to be an objective look at ""both sides."" I also like how Noam Chomsky gets top billing in the cast.If you want American exceptionalist ahistorical rambling about how communism somehow killed more people than the United States has been responsible for slaughtering and starving, plunk down the $ and give it a watch.Otherwise, I agree with another review: ""Better Left Unwatched.""",True
10,10,Very good explanation why group thinking is very dangerous,florishub,n/a,15/08/2025,"Some other reviews over here try to explain why the documentary is biased or right wing. But i dont think it is.It tries to explain why group thinking is bad and hurts our culture and political landscape. Both the right and left wing go to far when they introduce group thinking. Albeit: Racism, critical-race theory, or any other thing that separates people only based on their color, gender or religion.I would highly recommend everyone to look at this documentary and try to understand what is going on in our western culture. We are moving away from the axioms that make the west so great for what we are. This documentary is one of the first steps towards a hopefull saving of rationality and the original strengths of the western culture.",False
11,10,"What every responsible, free citizen of a democracy should watch as a teenager",maltonif,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary analyzes the problems of cult-like illiberal and intolerant ideologies from the standpoint of philosophy and history.It is aesthetically beautiful and very easy to understand, nevertheless, its methods are rigorous, and uncertainties in the conclusions are presented, as per the rules of good research.The biases are analyzed according to up do date psychological knowledge, so that extreme political positions and their presupposition can at least be understood.This documentary should be seen by any young (and old) adult, and be the basis of non-aggressive discussion.Hopefully, the kind of thought exposed here will bring a renaissance of humanism and rationalism, and the marginalization of identitarian cults.",True
12,10,Excellent presentation,stevenmatthewscully,n/a,15/08/2025,"The analysis is definitely worth being said. Sooner or later, details matter and this documentary demonstrates that to be so. A spotlight is put on issues that are not commonly discussed but are most certainly worth being more aware of. If you are going to watch something, I would recommend sitting down and seeing what Curt and others in the film have to say.",False
13,1,Be wary of the 10-star reviews,jake_fantom,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is nothing more than typical far-right extremist propaganda all wrapped up in tinsel and presented as a ""fair and balanced"" blueprint for reaching some sort of non-specific political detente. In this telling, only the left is ""radical."" The far right lunatic fringe that stormed the Capitol is composed of right-thinking patriots. My quick review of Better Left Unsaid is: Better Left Unwatched.",True
14,10,"Great purpose, great implementation with great detail",secret4321,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe film and plot descriptions talk about the purpose of this film and its general techniques. But the specific arguments are extensive and they happen very quickly. The film begins with sinister images of the divisive and violent nature of current discourse on major issues such as Black Lives Matter. It then looks into some historical philosophic ideas behind the Left and Right, particularly Modernism, Post-modernism, and ""today"". It suggests logical argument is a minor issue today, and philosophy leads us to think there is not so much right and wrong, and more Us, who see things our way, and Them, who don't. It is particularly critical of how Identity Politics is being used. The film then shows how this Us and Them mentality lead to absolutely horrific behaviour in the name of major historic leftist and rightist movements. The film wants to conclude on a positive note but does not see ant simple common ground between Left and Right. But it sees a way forward where we are more open and thoughtful.",True
15,1,One of the most misleading documentaries I have seen in recent years,nafiskhalid,n/a,15/08/2025,"I haven't the faintest why this was originally produced. The basic flaw from the beginning is the makers set out to portray the problem as a far-left vs far-right issue, where a central position is supposed to have some moral high groud. Which is a fallacy, considering if one position was that the earth is flat and another was that it is spherical, it wouldn't necessarily mean the truth was that the earth is of a shape in btween the two.The gross misrepresentation of the left is absolutely driven by agenda, with bad faith. It picks out the most ludicrous and extreme points of view held by a handful, and tries to make it seem that the entire left somehow espouses these ideas. They don't. I have been involved with many leftist and progressives in rural America, and a grand total of zero people believed in any of those ridiculous ideas (e.g. ""all white people are evil""). The most extreme idea I have encountered from them (that too held by very few of them) is that you should not vote blue, because progressives are often shunned by establishment figures.The director does not understand simple concepts such as systemic racism, and portrays them as some sort of conspiracy cooked up by the left to create buzz words and mobilize people, where as the key issues that concern leftists are first and foremost economical. And when identity is used in politics by the right to wrest power, there is little recourse left but to use it to establish justice therein. Meaning, not all forms of identity politics is problematic.Regardless, the few good ratings this did get was possibly from the crew and rightwingers and moderates who cannot seem to find the proper arguments against leftist political positions. Absolute drivel.",False
16,9,Curt Jaimungal should stand in the Supreme Court!,mbr-36262,n/a,15/08/2025,"Just somebody go and buy the man a slightly less conspicuous suit and he'll strike for ten!Curt Jaimungal DESTROYS woke madness with mathematics, logic and reason!No, seriously though, it's a must-watch for anybody who wants to get super sharp on these issues. Loved the ending too, beautiful music, won't spoil it.Cheers Curt!",False
17,10,this movie needs to be seen and talked about,mrzckkwnh,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film, in a very effective manner, reveals how radical political views (left and right) are dangerous and oppressive to a free society, how history repeats itself, and why it is so important, now more than ever, to exercise tolerance, but NOT tolerance of intolerance, thank you Mr Jaimungal for your clearheaded story telling, Liberal Democratic Societies need more the likes of you, looking forward to your future work!",False
18,10,A must see film!,charlieifrah,n/a,15/08/2025,"Better Left Unsaid is the most important documentary of 2021.Thank you, Curt Jaimungle!",False
19,3,True but dull,brendancclarke,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yes, the presenter is right. The trouble is, most of the film is simply the presenter babbling away. He stands there and throws a slew of words at the screen with no concern for if he is boring the viewer to death... which he did. Yes... the extreme left are evil and are doing stupid things. Got it. This guy needs to learn how to make a documentary... dull as dishwater, it is. I made it up to the last half hour, and unless something totally thrilling happened in that time, the documentary seems unfinished. Most of it is the presenter talking or at best movies of skype interviews with intellectual figures.",False
20,9,Worth the watch,huntermlary,n/a,15/08/2025,"Informative, thoughtful, thorough and well made. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in politics, social science, political philosophy, history or current events.",False
21,10,A very powerful and important movie,yjxkpvc,n/a,15/08/2025,"What this movie has to offer is not best left unsaid, and I say this as a left-leaning person with very moderate views on politics.The movie touches upon some topics which have received very little attention in mainstream media, which is the extreme influence of the radical left that has hardly had any criticism, unlike the, in terms of number of people, the relatively much smaller far-right movement.The movie is very informative with respect to historical roots of the current political climate with many great interviews. It throws light upon the supressed subject of the far-left in today's media in a balanced, nuanced and rigorous way, while, despite the volatile political environment, keeping a respectful, non-inflammatory tone.I heard in an interview with the creator Curt Jaimungal, who said that both youtube, twitter and facebook have banned advertisements for the movie on their platforms, which is a shame, but at the same time very revealing how powerful the message of this movie is.This reminds me of a very powerful quote about the Chinese government, but it is equally applicable to the United States, which is both ironic, comical and extremely tragical at the same time:""My hope is that the Chinese government will come to realise that it is futile to repress free speech, and that contrary to what they believe a regime's strength rests not on its suppression of a plurality of opinions and ideas, but in its capacity and willingness to encourage them.""

22,10,important insights to integrate as we work together,gpgwyn,n/a,15/08/2025,An inspiring investigation into why and how historical conflict repeats itself as connected to ideologies that pattern within the human condition. I value these clearly presented perspectives and I hope that this pattern recognition can integrate into a broader community understanding of the dangers we individually and collectively face. Thanks to Curt for being willing to express ideas publicly despite an increasingly censored world.,False
23,10,Thoeries of Everything,Pika122689,n/a,15/08/2025,"Curt Jaimungal's take on the American political divide is great, so as the voices he gets into this documentary. Highly recommended, especially if you're a fan of his podcasts on YouTube.",False
24,9,Watch the uncomfortable free speech of this documentary...,sfagnew,n/a,15/08/2025,"I first learned about King's civil rights movement in high school in 1970 from my very popular black history teacher, Mr. Fletcher, at Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane, WA. I have always admired King and his movement and this documentary opens with King's civil rights movement. Next, you see the many conflicts that make up today's Great Culture War.""You will not miss your mother until she's gone"" is the fitting closing song of Curt Jaimungal's documentary and is the perfect theme for today's Great Culture War. It is somehow fitting that the 1885 tune recorded in 1924 by John Carson sold over a million records and remains an enduring theme. Curt Jaimungal is an Indie filmmaker in Toronto, Canada, born in Trinidad and raised in Toronto. His mother and father are very proud of the son they have raised to become an Indie filmmaker and appear in the film.The film goes on to show the origins of today's Great Culture War from the deaths of Russians by Lenin, of Chinese by Mao, of Cubans by Castro, and of Cambodians by Pol Pot... all in the name of the compassion of social justice and the story repeats itself in today's Great Culture War.Instead of factions talking to each other with uncomfortable triggers of free speech, factions today simply scream at each other in riots.. Thus, the Great Culture War has convinced some factions that we need more social justice by having less free choice and free speech.There are violent urban riots of the Great Culture War along with the uncomfortable rhetoric of free speech. If you want to know more, watch the uncomfortable free speech of this documentary...",False

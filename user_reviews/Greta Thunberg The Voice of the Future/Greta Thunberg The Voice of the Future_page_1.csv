2,10,the voice of young generations,Hayduke555,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film covers the initial three years (2018, 2019, 2020) of Greta Thunberg's activism. It's understandably quite celebratory because if we rewind to 2017, the student climate movement was still in its infancy compared to the robust presence it has today, despite its historical roots. Greta played a pivotal role in the establishment of several major global organizations, including Fridays for Future, which also operates in Slovakia, where I reside.

Greta emerged as the voice that resonated with younger generations, bridging a gap that older activists struggled to reach. She successfully mobilized and engaged millions of schoolchildren and students worldwide. A similar movie to consider isI Am Greta (2020).",False

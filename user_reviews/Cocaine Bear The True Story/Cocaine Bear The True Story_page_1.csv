1,9,The Truth About Cocaine Bear!,nqmedia,n/a,16/08/2025,"The real story about the ""cocaine bear"" and everything surrounded by this most bizarre of tales which inspired a hit horror film. This documentary focuses more on the drug dealers and their story and how they are connected to the now legendary ""cocaine bear."" This is a great look into all the facts of the story from the police detectives involved to the eye witnesses. It's an immersive documentary from beginning to end that leaves no stone unturned. This film is a treat whether you've seen the Cocaine Bear or not and will especially appeal to true crime enthusiasts. The film is a short feature and never over stays its welcome.",False
2,n/a,Not good,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Very boring. Not good acting at all. Crazy concept and just not fun to watch. Give it a 4 because i laughed 2 or 3 times. But it's not a movie your missing out on. It's more like an episode of an serie. I don't get the hype around this one. But Hey if you like a movie we're there's a not good edited bear every 5 minutes. Be my guest.,False

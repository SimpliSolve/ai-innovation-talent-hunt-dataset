1,10,Incredible Message,joudallahham,n/a,16/08/2025,"The narration was beautifully done, helping to contextualize not only the stories of those currently living in Lyd and those in the diaspora but also the city itself and how things could have been. It gently touches on recent events and ongoing issues in the region. The film powerfully showcases the struggles and trauma that those living in Al-Lyd experience and continuously endure, capturing their resilience and pain with raw authenticity. As a Palestinian from Al-Lyd living in the diaspora, this film will forever hold a special place in my heart and serve as a visual story to pass down to future generations. May we one day return and see a free Lyd. Amazing work, Rami Younis and Sarah Ema Friedland!",False

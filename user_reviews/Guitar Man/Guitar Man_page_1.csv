1,9,A superb documentary on a great guitarist,diluvium-68391,n/a,16/08/2025,"After reading some of the reviews here, I cam to the conclusion that the critics here probably didn't even watch the entire show before lashing out, denigrating positive reviewers as ""fanboys"".A documentary should illustrate the life's work of the artist in question, should make you care about the person involved, and give you a distinct flavor of the artist. This has it all in spades.Joe played with all the greatest blues and rock and rollers, and he was recognized and spotlighted early on because of his age and his talent. He was pretty raw as a beginner, but what new beginner isn't? I
Bonamassa is humble throughout the documentary, except for the moment he is on stage, then puts forth his talent professionally, without prejudice, but without mercy. He is deferential when playing with the master Clapton, and his attitude throughout the show is respectful towards the root of the blues, towards the greats who played before him.Comparing Joe to any other guitarist is pointless, he has earned his spurs, is still playing and improving, and isn't wasting his talent. He stands among the best that are out there, or who have passed on.",False
2,7,prodigy grown up,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's a trivia question likely to stump most of your friends: Who has more number one Blues albums than anyone else? The answer is guitarist extraordinaire Joe Bonamassa, and co-directors Phillippe Klose and Kevin Shirley serve up a documentary to remove some of the mystery for those familiar with Smokin' Joe, and an unveiling for those who aren't. If you are asking yourself, ""Joe who?"" you should know that he opened for BB King ... as a 12 year old prodigy!""I've got to go become the other guy."" Joe B confesses that's his approach to prepare for a gig. He's been described as bi-polar (not a clinical diagnosis) as he alternates between Joe in blue jeans and a ball cap, and Joe Bonamassa on stage in a suit and shades. And what a transformation it is. Joe is such a laid back guy that his Los Angeles home is nicknamed ""Nerdville"", yet when his stage presence and music is explosive and beloved by his audiences.A treasure trove of concert clips is provided, including a few from Joe's early years. We learn of his struggles within the music industry, including his time with the band, Bloodline, which featured the offspring of legends Miles Davis, Robbie Krieger, Berry Oakley, and Sammy Hagar. Joe's agent and partner Ray Weisman provides a great deal of background on the difficulty associated with helping Joe find his niche, and the risks and rewards of their founding their own record label in order to ""own"" Joe's music. It's fascinating to hear how a guy so talented faced so many challenges in discovering the right path.Speaking of clips, we see Joe perform at such hallowed venues as Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall, The Greek Theater, and Royal Albert Hall ... with Eric Clapton. A personal favorite is the clip of Joe performing as the great Paul Rogers (Free, Bad Company) sings lead. A concert at the stunning Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado shows up a couple times, and we see Joe and his producer Kevin Shirley (also co-director on this film) make a trip to the ""Crossroads"", where the legend of Robert Johnson was born. Other influences for Joe include Albert King, Freddie King, BB King, and Muddy Waters.Joe Bonamassa natural talent likely stems from his family of musicians. His great-grandfather and grandfather played trumpets, while his own father was a guitarist. His progression through producers and collaborators includes Miami Steve Van Zandt, Phil Ramone, Tom Dowd, and, Kevin Shirley. Of course neither genetics nor affiliation explains Joe's extraordinary work ethic and obsession with challenging himself. We see his joy in music as he's interviewed in front of a wall of Fender amps ... the same amps he once dreamed of owning.

3,5,The blurb for this is cringe worthy,adrian-m-miller,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Joe Bonamassa has single-handedly transformed Blues from a marginalized legacy genre to an arena-filling spectacle""I believe if you go back that honour in the modern age fits Stevie Ray Vaughan more than anyoneHands downSo we're not off to a good start....Joe and everyone post Stevie should tip their hat at the man who REALLY shot blues into the mainstreamI'm all for Joe, but lets be real folks...I like Joe the enthusiastic musician and champion of the blues, for which he gets my respect, and i love Joe the collector, even if my instagram feed is drool worthy on a an almost daily basis, and i love that he plays with at least one Aussie in his touring bandPrevious reviewer is so over the top he needs to take a chill pill and look beyond the fanboyism.Several stars lost for the sales blurb on this one, misrepresents what is an important, but not as lofty contribution to the genre by Joe.",False

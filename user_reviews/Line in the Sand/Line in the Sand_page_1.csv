1,10,The Truth Will Set You Free,dkent213,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a fantastic documentary that highlights all the wrongs with migrant crossings and mass immigration in general. Oh; and not forgetting the trafficking of children. This well made documentary by James O'Keefe literally exposes the truth when lying politicians and the rest of the liberal snowflake army continue to deny such things are taking place.It's hard-hitting, educational, and shows how easy it is to cross the border. What angers me even more is the fact that these migrants are actually encouraged to do so. This is a huge political scandal and what does Biden and Harris do? Nothing. They literally pretend nothing is going on at the border and turn a blind eye.James O'Keefe goes to great lengths; causing much risk to himself, to expose what's really going on. Brave and incredibly patriotic. There's no investigative journalist that will push boundaries like James has done. Kudos to O'Keefe and OMG Media.Fantastic documentary. It's a much watch and needs to be shared.",False
2,10,Shocking and heartbreaking!,tamcm-85632,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know how to describe this feature length documentary that was filmed over a year long investigative journalism endeavor. From the mass caravans of unvented people from every corner of the globe, to human smuggling, drug smuggling, gangs, cartels, coyote's,who are ruthless and pure evil, to probably the most heartbreaking aspects of the film, and the reality that children are being trafficked for purposes
you can't even imagine.You can feel the frustrated border patrol agents, who are completely overwhelmed and exhausted from the lack of action in our government to curb the monstrosity we see happening every day. You have to ask yourself, what kind of fresh hell is our Congress/administration, that they allow this madness?Bravo, to O'Keefe and everyone who put together this expos√©.Never forget that 300,000 children have disappeared into our country over the last four years. What has happened to them is unimaginable.",False
3,1,100 minutes of O'Keefe pretending he's in danger,jokpantythief,n/a,15/08/2025,"That's the the whole film.There isn't anything new in this, and it doesn't feel like a documentary so much as a hastily stitched together collection of footage from a middle school film project. There's no central message. Everybody on screen is performing for the camera. The camera is on O'Keefe 90% of the time, and he seems to think he's an action hero rather than a journalist. A very emo action hero who talks about his feelings a lot. He wants himself and his dramatizations to be the story, not the immigration crisis.If you really love O'Keefe and you don't have a picture of him to stare at for an hour and fourth minutes, you might enjoy this film. Otherwise save your money.",False

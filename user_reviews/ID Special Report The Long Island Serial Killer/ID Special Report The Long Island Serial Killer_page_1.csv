1,3,Just a Tabloid-Style Rehash a la Nancy Grace,kathleenmcbrair,n/a,16/08/2025,"If I'd paid attention and saw it was a Nancy Grace piece, I would have skipped it altogether. Wouldn't it be nice if there was more than opinion and conjecture by people who are wholly unconnected to the case. Nancy Grace needs to take her old-school ""hooker"" terminology and go do something other than crime gossip. As to her opinion, that matters even less.Unfortunately, this piece just drones on over unsubstantiated minutiae and irrelevant issues. Derrick Levasseur seems to be following the same path as Nancy Grace, no more than a commentator on a game not seen.Just another filler crime piece by those who love to hear themselves talk.",False
2,1,Unwatchable,ericalambbrown,n/a,16/08/2025,This should not be categorized as a documentary. Nancy Grace brings nothing but tabloid faux journalism delivered in her signature hyper dramatic tone to a sad and frightening case. There are real families suffering while Nancy Grace behaves like a carnival barker trying to make a buck. I had to turn it off midway through because I can trust nothing she says. Watching the folks she was interviewing uncomfortably respond to the absurdly sensationalized questions she posed became painful. It's shameful how she is so willing to openly exploit any case for financial gain. And the production value is trash. Skip this and wait for reputable reporting on the case.,False

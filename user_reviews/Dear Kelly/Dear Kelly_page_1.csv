1,6,Andrew earnestly tries to psychoanalyze and help someone with serious mental illness-,winstondehlin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler-and he fails. Let me start off by saying that while this review will be highly critical, I generally really support Channel 5 and have been subscribing to their patreon since it came out. (And will continue to do so) Andrew is a human and makes mistakes, and in my mind he's always had great intentions and seems to facilitate a lot of positive change. This is a smaller scale issue to me compared to the good he's done.Kelly paints a picture from the very beginning of the film that Andrew seems to buy into or at least trust to some degree. For a time the film even seemed to perpetuate this picture as well. I can understand why, its easy to wonder why someone like Kelly ends up the way he is. And even try to rationalize it and wonder how he's been wronged. Andrew does acknowledge this in the second half of the film. Kelly sees himself as a victim and he really does look the part. For Andrew, it may have also been compelling to see him (in person) get unfairly assaulted at a rally by like 50 people. At a protest where he was supposedly painted to be in the majority by the media. He came away bleeding. But still holding strong to his beliefs. He wasn't even violent or vengeful towards these people who hurt him. He just wanted his hat back. The problem is I don't think Andrew ever really realized or took responsibility for how wrong he was about his first impressions of Kelly. And the potential harm it caused to his family.While production of the film and music painted Kelly's home videos as a heart wrenching glimpse into who he once was- To me, Kelly's home videos were disturbing more than anything because it seemed like a continuation of the character that he is still playing to this day. It's a character that he probably truly believes he is. He is excessively smiling, laughing, and playing with his children in every video and talking about how amazing his family/household are. His excitement is almost like he's experiencing his family for the first time. Maybe it's just me, but my family's home videos are a stark contrast. There are obviously moments of love or playfulness in pretty much any home video, but his are recorded as if to PROVE how great things are and much of a loving caring father he is. Other people may experience it differently, but to me it was really eery.This is when the doc started to feel almost like a true crime or horror movie. Kelly genuinely seems to have a soft side and even good intentions, and the people around him are all convinced of this. But he is also legitimately an abusive monster who is perpetually harming and scaring people throughout the movie. It's a truly disheartening thing to watch when you consider the consequences of his actions on the people who should be closest to him. To him, his rally buddies are his real family. With a few exceptions, he has little to no remorse for his biological one.The documentary that was (to me) MOSTLY about trying to understand Kelly and humanize him ends with a spectacular finale of his neglect and utter cruelty towards his ex wife and kids. Directly after they spill their hearts out to him and try to offer him another chance. (that he may or may not deserve) The intervention where this happened was filmed by dudes in backwards baseball caps from every angle, zooming in on their faces and stuff. You could tell that this impacted how the family acted at the intervention. They dressed up all nice, put on makeup, and many parts of the speeches seemed super performative as if to prove to an AUDIENCE how much Kelly hurt them. Rather than to try to really get through to Kelly. 4 people in my immediate family, and many of my friends are licensed or unlicensed social workers. I'm pretty familiar with different kinds of therapists and psychologists. I feel strongly that a real licensed social worker or family counselor would have absolutely controlled for this. ""Performance"" is a pretty common issue in all forms of therapy, even when people aren't being recorded. But Andrew- how could you not see that making them feel like actors in a reality show (for the first time in their lives) would make it harder for them to be genuine?And all throughout this, Andrew gives a narration to the story that almost gives the impression that he feels his thousands of conversations with people are supplemental to real psychology. You are smart Andrew and I believe you DO understand people well. But that does not help you understand the nuances of mental illness and addiction. Or even give you the right to act like someone who does. Or theorize on what is causing extremism and seek to affirm your belief by studying a poor sad man and his family. I truly hope you consulted a real mental health professional to give you advice on Kelly- earlier on than the celebrity ""interventionist"" who isn't even an lcsw.This film was a case study really, and like many of them have been in the past- it was arguably slightly unethical. It was interesting, and it was well done. It seemed to me that the goal changed throughout the course of the film. Which makes a lot of sense all things considered. If a main goal was to humanize an extremist, it wouldn't be hard to find a better person for that purpose. There is no shortage of people who appear to be reasonable and harmless generally but get worked up around political issues that they've been indoctrinated around. This sentence does not describe Kelly at all. He is so lost and it's painful to see. I don't even think it's truly representative of most people with his set of beliefs either. I acknowledge how much Andrew cared for Kelly and how much effort went into helping him. I sympathize with the responsibility Andrew felt, and I truly do feel for Kelly Johnson too. But ultimately to me it still felt like a mediocre attempt to help him, a failed or non-existent message, and a devastating ending.I really hope Kelly's family ends up okay. It's been a couple days since I watched the film now and I can't stop thinking about them. They've been through so much and tried so hard.",True
2,8,Another captivating and entertaining documentary by a great independent journalist and filmmaker.,jjmontuori,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I saw it in July of 2024 in New York City while Andrew was on his movie tour. It's done in the classic Channel 5 style, but went very in-depth on a single persons journey, breaking down all of the variables that led him to become the person he is, and exploring potential solutions for healing. It's clear that an immense amount of time, planning and research went into this project, and it definitely paid off. It was an entertaining, funny, sad, and informative documentary. If you have seen and enjoyed any of Andrew's other work than this is a must see. Very pleased.",False
3,8,A great film to reflect on,kev-02383,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary had me going through a lot of emotions, having dealt with something similar although not as extreme with my own father it was a great way to get perspective on what makes people change the way they do. Kelly is just one more person of thousands of individuals going through similar hardships but in the end we are all human beings, looking and hoping for a better future.I do wish the documentary had a more neutral tone on Kelly's issues as I think other people going through a similar situation may close themselves off to the narrative.I highly recommend people to watch it, the pacing of the documentary is great and keeps you interested, great job channel 5.",False
4,n/a,Good in the same way as mild left lean center outlet media.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIts not openly or obviously heavily biased or framed by any means. Yet before we even begin lets point out it does lack any real balance or look at the topic from both sides of radical groups politically.This only takes one mans start to current points as an individual who became very vocal and motivated by recent political ideas extremes and even conspiracy style reasoned connections between multiple ideas that had not nearly enough hard factual evidence to support the level of obsession.Many reviews focus on specifics like its all about right win radicalization or right problems and so on. While the documentary fails to address any other persons or significant comparisons or correlations between radical polarizing political narratives of recent years and the increased promotion of them.Is this that kind of story at all? No one who watched it or even the trailer with half a mind could conclude as much. There is no shortage of sympathetic connections made to the sole central character. You will feel pity for him in the end like a lost hurt child confused and simply in a bad way.I think its far more a documentary about various vulnerabilities and how different people can be.What it fails to do entirely is get properly thoughtful and make its own obvious conclusions or to even sufficiently guide or setup proper open ended questions to guide people to the real conclusion and connection.The entire starting point for kelly first making the public radar was falling for what would be presumably an obvious fake post but being in the mindset that like the counter protest that showed up to protest an antithetical fake event one and all and many were fooled.The post was obviously meant to drag some paid or misguided activists from blm out just for mischief and amusement or trolling.Its focus is on one man and the ability to have a good take away from the documentary is entirely upon the individuals ability to comprehend depth and complexity.Overall i found it to be a good classical emotional intimate style documentary but with plenty of semi modern gimmicks of style this limited self proclaimed ""film maker"" is known for and for little else.Ive watched some of his other content caring occasionally for it in limited fashion. It does sacrifice that necessary amount of substance for style or presentation in order to be fiscally feasible.Thats the fine line between dusty old factual periodicals and reference materials vs the modern throw away popcorn chewing gum content.",True
5,7,"mildly interesting ""slice of life"" but with too much fluff for me",davidispizza,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI found myself a bored a times and skipping ahead.Maybe that is because I am pretty familiar with Andrew's YouTube channel and American politics in general or maybe it is just the pacing.I felt like Kelly's disbarment was glossed over.And I would have liked to learn about Kelly's upbringing (how were his parents financially?) -- as I get a sort of entitlement vibe from Kelly.Kelly doesn't want to take ownership of his mistakes and problems.I would rate this a 6 but it does get an extra star for showing how big of a house, how many children, how many animals (and possibly how nice of a car) Kelly had.It really does show -- that previous generations had it easier (or are you telling me Kelly used to be super smart and hard working and then one day his brain broke??)",True
6,10,Empathetic and heartbreaking look into political obsessiveness,jb_turtle,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust watched the film on release day January 15, 2025. I find that the most interesting documentaries leave me feeling quite a mix of emotions, which this one definitely did. My mix of emotions come from an incredibly complex set of topics from family, addiction, financial woes, radical politics, and self identityI was impressed with Andrew's thesis put together here, including the tough but honest ending that wrapped up this story neatly. Which, I find myself craving in many of Channel 5s mini-documentary style YouTube videos. The longer format helped fill that void while also being quite entertaining.At the end of this doc, I feel empathetic for Kelly J Patriot, sad for him and his family, but also pity for Kelly. He has gone through so much circumstantial but also self inflicted pain. His paranoia reminds me of my grandfather who is suffering through dementia at the moment and also seems to also have a mysterious boogeyman chasing him in the dark. It's sad to see and really hard to watch. I want to do everything to help the man but I just can't figure out how.I'm not sure how to help Kelly either. I think Uncle Pill was spot on that's it's kind of just up to Kelly. Whereas, my grandfather I think would need to recover from the dementia itself in order to reconnect with his family, Kelly just needs to kick out whatever voice has gotten inside his head. It's so hard to change your mind in today's media and technology environment though. It will be a tremendous challenge for Kelly to transform willingly and on his own accord.I hope that one day I'll see a YouTube update of Kelly J Patriot kicking his political paranoia out the door and reuniting with his loving family in the future. That would make my day.",True
7,8,Andrew's Style Shines,clayton_piskorski,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Dear Kelly"" is a gripping documentary that takes a look at the pshycological effects of trauma in men in modern america. From a basic setup the film delves into the life of its title character. This film takes a look at the effects of unchecked mental issues in every day americans and how those issues can effect our loved ones.I recommend this film. I feel like it was a bit long. I was curious to see where the story went but about half way through I assumed it would end one particular way. I was disappointed when I was right. Also, I am slightly disappointed that there was no moral to the film. Being brainwashed into the political war debate is scary. I wish this film came to a conclusion on the issue and how to resolve it.",False
8,10,"Incredible, Empathetic Look at Right Wing Radicalization",osheaa-96711,n/a,16/08/2025,"Andrew has done it again. Movie actually pulls the heart strings quite well at times. Its a blend of Chanel 5 at its best. At times uproariously funny, others thoughtful and provactive. This will hit xtra hard of course if you've been a fan of the channel for a while, but I honestly think that there's something everyone can take away from this about the human experience, media literacy, and life in the post COVID era. At the end of the day, people are just people, and they are flawed, but you love them anyway- even if you have to love them from a distance. I think this doc follows in the vain of Hunter S Thompson will a boots on ground look at the what the good doctor would call ""these strange and savage times""",False
9,8,Great as always from Callaghan and co,spikehowarth8,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have always had the utmost respect for Andrew and his team. The subjects they cover are always original, intelligent, well-executed, and crucially raw/authentic. Dear Kelly is no different. To be honest, it is not my favourite. Many of his other projects would've received a 9,10,11,100000 out of 10 from me. Andrew slowly discovered what is revealed in the documentary: some people can only save themselves. This is a damning thing to think about for someone with good intentions who wants to hear people out and help them, like Andrew. It is frustrating that we cannot change people even when we show them exactly where they went wrong and how to fix it.It's easy to watch this and think ""saw that coming"", but Channel five is real and true and raw. Even though Andrew's goal with Kelly ultimately failed, he still showed us insightful commentary on radicalisation. I would really love to see another piece that focuses on Men, the manosphere, depression, and radicalisation, but this time with a focus on echo-chambers and chronical online-ness.",True
10,3,A DIRECTIONESS LAZY MESS.,morganalecburton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Callaghan is clearing grasping at straws (admittedly) here attempting to expose the entire right as mentally unstable. He clearly rips off several brands here (John Wilson's titles, A&E's Intervention, too many YTers to mention) and his once quirky awkward style is exposed as just laziness and incompetence.This documentary has zero direction, an ambiguous ending, and it's honestly just a cobbelled-together mess. Andrew is just throwing stuff at the wall here and nothing sticks, as demonstrated near the end of the film where he admits incompetence and throws together a pointless intervention trying to save the film.This film is beyond saving.",False
11,10,Don't listen to the low reviews.,bobwit-18098,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone who gives this movie low ratings is incompetent. This film was amazing and explore the complex psyche. If someone going down a complex path that not everyone can understand. Whether you agree or disagree with the views expressed in the movie, we should all be able to see the humanity in what Andrew explores. The story and storytelling is unbelievable. The active engagement in the story to try and help someone come back to their loved ones and understand the impact of their actions is extremely unique and something we should all recognize as amazing and innovative filmmaking. Great stuff.",False
12,9,A documentary that hits close to home.,jared_nolen,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""Dear Kelly"" struck a chord with me, especially because it addresses a story many can relate to-having a family member caught up in political radicalization. The film excellently portrays how this occurs, connecting it to broader issues such as the decline of the middle class and how the wealthy use media to create division, obscuring their blame. It accomplishes this subtly, allowing viewers to draw their own conclusions without stating it explicitly.Kelly struggles to maintain his grip on reality amidst political views that can be tough to handle. Yet, despite everything, I found myself cheering for him, hoping he could turn things around and focus his energy on his wonderful kids. They are the heart of this story.",True
13,8,Extremely entertaining but...,Badlands1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can't say I'd want to watch it twice same with his former films. They're extremely captivating and colourful throughout. It's like a page turner of a movie. But it's kind of a mess.Andrew doesn't want to push too far left or right with his own opinions.But the biggest issue was Kelly is just an autistic unstable person maybe a touch of Asperger's or schizophrenia. Nothing to do with politics, we could see the way he blew all of his money neglecting his family decades ago. Before any of us were really that political.I've grown up around crazy mental homeless people, you can definitely see that soulless look in his eyes also. I just feel sorry for his family.",True

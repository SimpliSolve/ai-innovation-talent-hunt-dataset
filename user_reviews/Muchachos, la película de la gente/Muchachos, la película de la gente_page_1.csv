1,8,Emotional memory of an unforgettable World Cup,R_A_P,n/a,16/08/2025,"For those of us who enjoy, suffer and celebrate with the Argentine futbol team, this documentary narrated by Guillermo Francella is a reason to re-experience all those feelings again.A compilation of images of fans who filmed their own experiences as YouTubers, along with those who remember the main moments of each match, with good dramatization and timing, focused mainly on Messi's great participation.The narration excites and does not distract at all.The wonderful story by Hernán Casciari ""Messi's Suitcase"" brought to the screen by the direction of Jesús Braceras in a correct and effective way.",False
2,9,"Really good images compilation, great narrative",dianebiet,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary focuses on the way Argentines followed, cheered, suffered, enjoyed; and, anxiously watched every match of the National Team during the World Cup in Quatar. The main topic is not the skillful Team but the fans and this is what makes this documentary very interesting. There are scenes of the fans in Quatar and in Buenos Aires, Rosario, Jujuy and other remote places in Argentina. There are scenes of families, from a broad scope of social backgrounds, while watching the games at home. Also, there are spectacular scenes of the memorable December 2022 celebration in streets, avenues, highways with +4 million people gathered to welcome the Team back in Buenos Aires. The documentary effectively captures the spirit of the typical Argentine National Team futbol fan.",False

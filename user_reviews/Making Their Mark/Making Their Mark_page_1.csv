1,8,Interesting Timing!,damianphelps,n/a,16/08/2025,"This doco, first up is brilliant. However I do question the timing of the series considering the underlying theme of Covid. Watching the episodes reminds me of what the world has gone through and its a little close to home as much of the crisis still continues. Its a little eerie at times.On the other hand it is an incredible insight into what the players and the teams went through to provide some respite to the public when everything was so bleak. Being able to look forward to a game of footy was so wonderful that it allowed you to occasionally forget about the problems of the virus.The one weakness of the series (and a tough balance to meet) is that it assumes you are familiar to the sport. New fans or those curious may wonder what the hell is going on.Well done to all involved, for me it was compelling (if at times confronting) to see.On a personal note I got to see my team play more games than ever before due to the hubs and it was an opportunity I will never forget :)Go Tiges!",False
2,9,I'm new to AFL and i don't know much about the game,hallmitchell,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show blew my head off. It's that good. The editing is awesome, the footy rants are amazing. The intensity of the players and training is something watch. Great choice of players, coaches and teams to follow. I've really enjoyed this series and this is a genre/sport cross over. So well shot.",False
3,10,Finally... genuine AFL content,colwelldean,n/a,16/08/2025,"For many years I have wondered why footy doesn't have a media arm that produces top level documentary with high production value content like other major sports.
Finally, someone has done it.It's a great doco series that gives an excellent insight into life in the AFL, the hubs, and all the other factors of 2020.Really hope this sort of thing becomes a regular fixture for the AFL and Amazon. Fantastic viewing.",False
4,10,What stands in the way becomes the way.,goreboy-93283,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great banter
Inspiring coach speeches
Heartbreak
Isolation
Hope
Excitement
2020
BLM
CovidThe best 2020 based documentary-series I have seen so far. It gets its heart from not losing touch with the reality of 2020. It doesn't leave that pain and uncertainty as a footnote. It embraces it and digs deeper.",False
5,10,Fantastic series and inspirational speeches,didomenicosam,n/a,16/08/2025,Admittedly I am a fan of AFL and therefore I understand much of that going ons When perhaps those who are somewhat unfamiliar with the sport may have some difficulty following. But take the technical side of the sport aside for a moment and you see the hardship of players families and staff behind the scenes. This could be any sport. It could've so easily have been NFL or NBA or one of the European soccer leagues. Even as a business person you can take so much away from the words that come out of some of these coaches and how they inspire their players or really how they inspire their staff. You see what it means when they say mind over matter and how it can affect your work and try and find a way how to build yourself back up again. Above all this series shows about never giving up. Ever,False
6,10,Phenomenal Docuseries of Epic Proportion,peterjacobs-64449,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have admittedly never seen a single AFL football game but still found this series remarkable. With its ability to capture so well the highest highs and the lowest lows while zeroing in on several key figures in their struggles and heroism, Making their Mark is the quintessential film not only for sports fans but any human being who has lived through suffering and joys.",False
7,10,Tigerrific,cqtiger-51415,n/a,16/08/2025,As a tiger fanatic I am biased but what a great doco.Eddie betts and Nic Nat fantastic champions and the coniglio a sad back story. Editing is brilliant and the producers so lucky to have 3 Richmond icons miked up for the grand final. Loved it.,False
8,10,Raw,steve_odwyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"A seriously compelling look behind the scenes of our great game and an inner sanctum peak like no other. If you are not a fan of AFL just the story will drive you to be one, if you are, this series will deepen your understanding and love for the game. First rate, hope they back it up next year.",False
9,1,"Great, minus the political lecturing",FrankHonest,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerJust like every other non-political neutral cultural institution, sport too has to be weaponised into a one-sided political opportunity to patronise and lecture.... As bad as we all agree racism is, it is egregious that the AFL is pressuring its staff to condemn our country by kneeling. BLM is an actual group pushing policies and left wing messages. Why does a sporting team have get involved at all Stay neutral. If they want to help indigenous kids, maybe donate some of their salaries to education? But kneeling to condemn the nation? That is a divisive gesture that does nothing for anyone.Also, the tone deaf elitism to listen to multi-millionaire celebrities play 'victims' during a global recession? Seriously? Millions have lost jobs and forced into poverty, but you earn half a $mill yet someone posted a mean tweet? *That's* your big struggle? It's breathtaking in its tone deaf arrogance.Besides the political patronising, it's a good series about a great sport. So enough one-sided politics ruining sport. Stop hijacking every neutral, uniting, non-political area of culture, and making it divisive and political. To politicise sport in these polarised times, is to destroy one of the few things we still have in common....",True
10,n/a,Great drama and a worth a watch,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"First off, I don't follow the AFL at all but anytime
There is a behind the scenes documentary I will watch it. Well this one made me an AFL fan. Really loved the drama and intense world behind the game. Especially set against a backdrop like covid. Really well done and it helped that I didn't know who won the flag last year to up the drama.Watch it.",False

1,9,Fascinating,giguerm,n/a,17/08/2025,"I didn't know that much about Orelsan, one of the biggest artist in France. Since I've seen many music documentaries, I was expecting a certain format but nothing like this. Since it's his brother who's filming and doing the narration, we get to see and feel the realness of it all. An incursion into the world of rap, from nothing to everything. Orelsan is a fascinating and talented artist and his crew is too. A must see.",False
2,10,best music documentary ever seen,spaceman42114,n/a,17/08/2025,"I didn't know much of Orelsan before to watch the documentary but what a story!What an idea to record your brother for 20 years just because you believe he will make it. The style is unique, the story is beautiful, a must watch.You follow the steps of Orelsan from the very early beginning, really feel the pain and how tough it is to make it your way in the music industry and especially the rap industry when you are just a regular guy from North of France.Orelsan is somehow the French Eminem, nothing was done to make it a rap legend but he did it with always the same friends!Brilliant! Enjoy!",False
3,10,Likely the best documentary about a musician,amj-94343,n/a,17/08/2025,"An excellent and highly addictive documentary!! Especially season one.I have heard of Orelsan and listened to some of his music prior to watching this documentary but didn't really know much about him and/or his background stories. This documentary completely blew my mind!! Having 20 years of video footage shot by his younger brother was incredible, but more importantly the documentary was so sincere and authentic in showing the gradual growth, the painful struggles, the constant doubts, the phenomenal dedication and the hardwork of this artist. There were touching moments that moved me to tears, as well as funny moments that made me burst out laughing. From literally being a nobody in Normandy to a mega rap star in France, from being the most controversial/ hated rapper by the media to someone being widely adored and admired by the grand public, Orelsan has a career path that's truly inspiring to many.In addition, this documentary is very well-paced and well-edited. There's always a nice ""hook"" at the end of each episode that keeps the audience eager to watch the next one.Bravo to Cl√©ment and the entire production crew! Thank you for all the amazing work. I've thoroughly enjoyed watching this documentary!",False

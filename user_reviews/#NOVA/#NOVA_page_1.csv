1,10,#NOVA,adventureswithlucy,n/a,16/08/2025,"A difficult but mandatory documentary of the Palestinian Hamas rape, torture and murder of international festival music attendees on October 7th 2024. Footage is jarring - as it ought to be - and unpleasant. Young people from dozens of countries who attended a music festival - something Israel is known for - only to be brutally hunted and murdered by Palestinian terrorists who had the audacity to film themselves committing war crimes, then later seek the world's sympathy.The critical reviews seem to be from those who support terrorists and don't want you to see what savages are capable doing - whilst they film themselves.",False
2,1,Biased and low quality movie,ahlamibra,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am surprised by the bad quality of the movie and the weak investigation considering that there are a lot of people who are intrested in learning more about the war in the Middle East. The show lacks direction and is sadly biased.If you want to watch it keep in mind that there are many parts omitted and there is a room for growth regarding presenting the same ideas in a deeper way. Including other viewpoints and creating a more powerful realstic picture for us the viewers. Not to mention that it was very intense without providing suffecient information, I felt lost and confused most of the time.",False
3,10,"Hard, powerful",sharonshor,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst of all, this documentary follows victims of a music festival. It is hard to watch.I know that we all want to know what happened there, but please, if you feel like it would be too much, have a friend around and don't be afraid to have breaks.I had break, let myself cried, and called a friend. He was almost at Nova, but had school responsibilities, so he truly understood the fear I had.At first, you see videos that the dancers made as they partied. I kept imagining my friend's face between them.Then, in a contrast to the carefree, dancing youngsters, you see videos that the terrorists made.You can feel the youthful energy contrasting with the glee from violence and bloodlust.Again, it is a hard watch, but in order to remember and respect the victims, and in order to know what can always happen to us- we need to watch this.Not only that, but my friend and I decided that we refuse to be afraid. We won't stop going to festivals. We looked at the evil in the eyes and we won't live in fear because of it.",True
4,10,Sad event that could have been prevented,JamesCameron7,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPerhaps the most challenging moment in NOVA# comes early on, around the 7-minute mark. After a string of relatively routine videos from that night, the focus shifts in a chilling handoff: the right to document moves from the carefree festival-goers to the terrorists. What's unsettling is how unaware they are of the fate closing in on them. Adding to the frustration is the fact that many of the young people are, as we might say, 'lit'-caught up in the moment, partly numbed by the atmosphere. Even as the rockets begin to rain down, some remain in a strange state of complacency.In a more conventional docu-film, a director might have brought in an expert to frame the brutality of the situation, but here, it's not necessary. Parr's decision to rely solely on raw field footage isn't out of laziness or budget constraints-it's a choice rooted in stark realism. When you're working with such visceral material, there's no need to embellish or explain.NOVA# captures a staggering amount of documentation-so many people filming and being filmed-yet even after two months of endless news coverage, many of the faces and their stories remain unfamiliar. These young people, many without even stopping to process the chaos, instinctively understood the language of their generation: they turned on their cameras, even while fighting for their lives. Parr, who clearly invested in the film's cinematic design, simply had to assemble these raw moments into a cohesive narrative.The result? These 52 minutes should be seen everywhere. Precisely because they are not overly graphic. Precisely because they feel, at times, repetitive. Precisely because they focus on one horror, isolating it from the wider chaos of that terrible day.And even after seeing all of this, there will still be people who refuse to believe it happened.",True
5,10,"Superb, everyone must watch",gmjmdnjj,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAlthough it only happened a year ago- this is a terrible event that will forever go down in history.It's necessary to watch to understand the impossible reality this country faces- the struggle, the loss, the people, the strength.This is a humanitarian crisis and if you want to understand the world better and grow compassion, it's a must watch.I hope these families and survivors will rehabilitate and dance again. I hope the civilians will move back to their home and rebuild their lives.I also hope justice will be served. This mass massacre and atrocities cannot ever happened again. Ever.",True

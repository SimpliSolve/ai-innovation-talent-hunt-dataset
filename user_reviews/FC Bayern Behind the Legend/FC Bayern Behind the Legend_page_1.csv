1,9,A must for Bayern Fans,Wen6330,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a member of the Muller Mafia, I fully approve and recommend this! Gave me a lot of goosebumps. The only down side is the lame English dubbing (which I turned off after the first episode). Otherwise, ausgezeichnet! Mia San Mia!",False
2,9,Nice insights of one of the greatest football clubs,jannikpeveling,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a lifelong Bayern-Fan who was born and raised in Munich, who have been in the arena many many times and who has been in ""Säbener Straße"" for a training too, this series gave me more insights to my favorit club and even I have learned a few more things.A nice mix of history, great eras of Bayern Munich and of the current team, of the club and of several persons particularly. Very entertaining to watch and you learn more about the club, the people working for the club and the structure.BUT you have to keep in mind that of course only positive things were put into this series and bad things (that happened a lot in the past 2 years) were cut away. Nevertheless very well made and nice to watch for EVERY football fan, even for not Bayern fans.",False
3,9,BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS!,andrewchristianjr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. Beyond my expectations. I thought this docu would just be another basic sport docu, but it turned out to be really good. There are moments of happiness, angry, sadness, and proud in this. It's the episode 5 and 6 for me. Well done. Mia san mia!",False

6,10,Crazy genius ...,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"... legendary! No pun intended - they say to achieve greatness, there has to be some kind of madness from within. And it starts with the way this is edited and presented ... going back and forth ... showing us the past, but firs the (relative) present .. giving us sound bites from the players themselves, but also being inside ... as inside as a documentary can be and go ... we're talking about meetings and many other things - behind the scenes looks to say it plainly.For fans of the club a must watch - and I really mean that. But also for others who may be curious ... what is this club all about? Meet the players (no pun intended) - in front and behind the scenes. See what they have to struggle with ... the highs the lows ... everything in between.I almost wish there was a physical release with bonus material (interviews and even more clips from inside the locker room) ... but as it is, this is as definitive as it goes ... enjoy the ... not silence! This may not be Sparta ... but it is madness! In a positive always trying to achieve more and better results ... each year! We are the champions and all that talk ...",False

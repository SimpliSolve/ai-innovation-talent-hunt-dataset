1,9,GOOD NATURE SERIES,delakoh,n/a,15/08/2025,I have thoroughly enjoyed watching this series with my children.It is beautifully shot and well narrated by Helen Bonham-Carter.It definitely kept our interest.,False
2,8,Ignorance is bliss,danielforte101,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lovely series, beautifully filmed. It shows the harsh and also loving relationships of these amazing wild animals. I think it would also be nice to see the relationships and lives of the animals we usually farm. This series shows all the constant dangers of life in the wild for these adorable young animals although it never seems to discuss the biggest threat to their very existence...humans. I hope the next series will explore more how we can help to ensure these animals stay wild and help inspire our young generation.",False
3,10,Great family series,hobogirl-39603,n/a,15/08/2025,Something you can sit and watch with you kids or grandkids and be amazed at the animals and their young in the wild. Well worth your time. I highly recommend this series.,False
4,10,Excellent narration!,keasmith-30919,n/a,15/08/2025,"Helena Bonham Carter is an exceptional narrator. She is soothing, intuitive and informative, just like Sir David Attenborough. I hope that she will continue to narrate each new season of the series.I am really delighted to have found this series, being worried that we would not get the likes of the same in the future.The filming is awesome because you get to see animals living naturally, and most of us will never see them in the wild like this.The series is really beautiful! I highly recommend it, especially for animal lovers of all ages. So thankful that wildlife documentaries are still being made.",False
5,6,Made for families with children,x_mrsmtea_x,n/a,15/08/2025,"Lovely little series with very cute animals, and nice narration by Helena Bonham-Carter. The narration is fairly dramatic considering that there is always a good ending to every ""dramatic"" situation. It's also fairly clear that scenes are cut together to create dramatic effects. It is quite clear that this is a show for families with children, saving the children from the real life of wild babies. Overall sweet, and I am sure families will enjoy it very much, but not necessarily realistic.",False

1,9,Don't Be Like Andre,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.A brilliant and strange documentary about how one guy who is dying, crafts a tale about his life and background using humor and absurd atmosphere approaches which is both heartwarming, touching and engaging.With the main character named Andre, Andre is a highly interesting of a men as his personality and behavior is so watchable. His idiotic and brilliant personality is engaging and fascinating. Alongside with some great editing, discussions from peers, and a good sense of humor. It never takes itself seriously regarding it's tone at times and begins a long journey of one men and his weirdness.Presented with good camerawork, this documentary offers a good insightful about life and death, and how people just live and all. Perfectly capturing the moments of human life and happiness, sadness and death. Absolutely loved this one!Also, remember people. When you need it, get a colonoscopy!",False
2,10,"Poignant, hilarious, emotional ride",qfpwc,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a spectacular film... you can watch it multiple times and have absolutely different visceral reactions to the same scenes. You could cry one day and laugh as hard as you can the next. The storytelling is phenomenal and keeps you interested the entire time without ""feeling sorry"" for Andre.From the opening scene, as shocking as it could be, you instantly get a taste of what Andre's life has always been like. And then throughout the film you see how it's changed... All because he never got his colon checked.While some people may avoid because they think it is a PSA for getting a colonoscopy, which it is to a degree, the film itself is absolutely so well done and gives such respect not just to Andre, but also his family and friends. It's freakin hilarious at times and seems to hold true to Andre's vision and life.",False

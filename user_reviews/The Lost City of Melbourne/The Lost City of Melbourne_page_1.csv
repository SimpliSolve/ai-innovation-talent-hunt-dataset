1,5,A documentary that doesn't know what it wants to,bendi36,n/a,15/08/2025,"It starts out interesting. Lots about 19th century architecture and construction. Then ends up as a one sided vitriolic agenda driven blitz. Wheres the objective outlook. These types of documentaries are so spineless and dull; even when you support the narrative. Theirs nothing illuminative shown, just a bunch of conservationists bemoaning what's lost. At least have some coldplay to accompany the film if your trying to shamelessly pull on the heartstrings.I come away from this with more questions than answers. Theres no real deep dive into the names and people behind some of the locations. Just still shots and sad lamentations. Occasionally they get indignant and angry. Nothing about the forces behind whats driving the modern demolitions and changes to our architecture. Nothing about our future plans. No alternatives. The movie drones by the end, hitting the same emotional marks and crescendos of every one of these wake up docos do as it wraps up.",False

1,5,Valid pointd but ...,mike_bike_kite,n/a,15/08/2025,"He spoke of how his life was turned upside down by an incident at school and how his parents broke up but didn't see any correlation with his own actions. He spoke of his best friend who lived a ""dream life"" that was entirely false but failed to understand the guy was just a classic psychopath and not a role model. He spoke how he used to be shallow and self centred but now here he is in a film dedicated to his world view featuring no-one but himself. I totally agree with this main point that it's foolish to compare yourself with what's found on YT etc but I found the the guy himself quite sad.",False
2,6,More of a commentary than a documentary,Km0427,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have not read the book so I don't have much to compare it to, but the film felt more of a speaker making a motivational speech than a documentary. The entire documentary was the author talking about his personal experiences, which didn't resonate with me in any way. I just didn't ""give a f*#!"" about his own stories so it seemed a little pretentious to me that he was making us listen to all these very basic stories from his past. I did like the in between of talking about entitlement and taking responsibility, but it would have been nice to also hear from professionals to hear their take on it.",False
3,n/a,Who are ya??,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It won't take you long to wonder why you're watching this.I've listened to some of the audiobook and it didn't feel this meandering or pointless.Unlike superior theses like The Happiness Advantage which includes examples, anecdotes, psyche research and conclusions, this ""film"" is just a series of pointless anecdotes told by some random bloke in a chair.If I was with this guy at a party, I'd find an excuse to walk away from him. His anecdotes-whether personal to him or gleaned from somewhere else-have no conclusions.If the overall message to this thing is that ""life isn't perfect, make the most of what you've got"", then it was pretty much summed up at the beginning.I thought this would be an interesting watch. It wasn't.",False
4,7,Enjoyable. Glad I watched it.,lovecedu-647-415631,n/a,15/08/2025,"The reviews very nearly put me off watching this. No one wants to watch some entitled guy telling everyone what to think or feel. And that's what the reviews made me thing this would be.After the usual battle of searching for a film with enough decent reviews and plot, I eventually went full circle, came back to this film and took the chance.I don't know who this guy is tbh. But he has some good insights if one is open enough to listen. I learnt some things watching this and I enjoy a good grounding experience every now and then.The world is a hectic place and it's always nice to have the time to reconnect with the bigger picture.The stories were pretty amazing to think about I wish there were more of them.Glad I took the risk and watched this. I'd defo recomend.The pacing is good, the story telling is good and the guy is pretty likeable all things considered. Just a dude doing his best like we all are.Good for him for having made a success of himself through his book and now through a film. Pretty cool.If you've got a curious mind and you're trying to find something gripping to watch I'd recommend this film/story telling documentary. Defo doesn't feel like a waste of time, it's an enjoyable watch.",False
5,7,Surprisingly good,grantss,n/a,15/08/2025,"Author Mark Manson explores what is important in life and for happiness, looking at episodes from his own life, lessons learned from introspection and disappointment and general accumulation of knowledge. He also looks at some of the ""breakthroughs"" in self-help and self-actualisation and how some of these were false dawns.I bought and read Mark Manson's book of the same name shortly after it was released, more out of curiosity, trying to find something to read and the fact that it was the #1 selling book at the time than out of any genuine interest. I had low expectations for it as I am generally not into self-help books and my apathy levels are well above normal already.To my surprise I enjoyed it and while it is not earth-shatteringly profound it is still quite illuminating and thought-provoking,When I discovered that's there's a movie adaptation of the book I had similarly low expectations, this time because I didn't see how the book could be turned into a movie and, what's more, how could a movie add to what the book's already said (and, no, I'm not one of those people who always think the book is better than the movie).Turns out the movie is pretty good. It takes the content of the book and dramatizes it very well. In addition, Mark Manson's narration and descriptions are quite engaging and help the understanding of the subject.Like the book, the movie is not earth-shatteringly profound but is interesting and engaging and does make some good points. Despite being essentially a self-help film it is quite entertaining.",False
6,3,The Subtle Art of Mediocrity,iwcbaugh,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't want to give this a bad review.In 2019, I was going through one of the hardest times in my life and reading The Subtle Art was one of the few things that really helped me come to terms and .I will say that the film does do well to carry all of the witty cynicisms over from the book,. And I can hand pick a few a new additions I did enjoy that do stop this from going lower than a 3/10.That said, without enough focus on the reasons and purposes for us hearing these anecdotes, it just becomes a disorganised mess that, if you've not read the book, just sounds like someone saying ""you're not special"" without the ""but that's okay"" to follow it up with.The 'self help' part of this 'counter intuitive self help documentary' was heavily glossed over and massively lost a lot of the appeal that caused the books warranted success. Maybe it's just that the genre doesn't translate successfully into this media, but overall, very disappointed.My advise to anyone reading this review; pop on the audiobook and watch a 10 hour YouTube video of cats or something. You'll have a much better experience,",False
7,6,The subtle art of not giving a Fu@k,nicholasclark-71480,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this out of curiosity. Bizarrely I found it quite engaging. Not having read Mark Mason's book or otherwise heard of him prior, I watched his documentary with much interest.In my opinion, I found it to be more of an introspective of one's own life choices at an early age.Mark appeared to be quite rational and succinct when discussing his per sieved failings during his early adolescence and in to his early twenties.That said I'm not entirely sure who he was trying to preach to. Those that still give a Fu@k or those that don't.A lot if what he said does resonate. So I'll give him some codos, given he has opened up his life to some scrutiny.As a self help. I'm not completely sure his documentary does him justice.Maybe Mark should wait until he is a little older and has gone through the trials and tribulations of a long term partnership / marriage any subsequent separation, and or the consequences with respect to children , especially if he were to separate.He might equally have to deal with the death of any parents, close relatives, siblings or children, when he is a little older.He can then do a sequel. In order to redefine, what not giving a Fu@k really means.In retrospect, many other people in life also don't give a Fu@k , myself included. We equally appreciate that life is finite. It doesn't mean we don't take some responsibility.Perhaps if at the end of the documentary Mark had indicated that all proceeds including his fee from his Netflix documentary were to be donated to a said charity, of his choice.I might have truly thought that this guy doesn't give an Fu@k.",False
8,2,Pseudoscientific anecdotal nonsense.,olliemcdaid,n/a,15/08/2025,"A drawn out monologue that fails to engage with anything philosophical, responding only to anecdotes.It's odd that this philosophy only works with numerical identifiers of success. There is no sense of inner fulfilment, no enjoyment from the attempt of trying something new. You can only be good or bad at something.It's both critical of late stage capitalism and completely complicit. Perhaps justifying flogging these books.Mark Manson loves the use of binary, there is little to no room for nuance & balance. Promoting a circular philosophy that can only lead to self-pity & loathing.I'd offer this binary: watch this or speak to someone outside a club at 3am.",False
9,6,Subtle art of living,MB-reviewer185,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have not read the book with the same name by Mark Manson, but I hear it is good. So, I did not know what to expect from this movie other than what I knew about the main synopsis of both the book and movie.I thought this movie was not bad but not that amazing. I like that we follow Mark Manson's life and how he connects it to other things connected to the main story, along with why he made the book. The way he talks about certain things and his view on life is interesting.There are some nice-looking shots like on a cliff or simple shots like when he is floating on a pool or shots of everyday life. This movie has a simple ending, and the movie is something to watch for 1 hour and 37 minutes when you have nothing else to do.I do not know what to say about this movie, other than it is a fine movie/documentary that you can watch. This movie might be better if I read the book, or the book could be better than the movie and I just do not know.",False
10,4,Disappointing,nytol1-798-466578,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've been a big fan of Mark since he first started putting out his email which feels like over ten years ago?I REALLY liked the book, and still think it is excellent.This however was not so good.It didn't feel right, didn't flow, wasn't especially interesting, I'm not sure how they got it so wrong to be honest?I turned it off before the end, as it was borderline painful to watch at times.It didn't feel like Mark's work, so I can only assume he didn't have that much input or get final approval?I'd recommend spending your time with the audio book rather than watching this, you will get a LOT more out of it.",False
11,10,The uncomfortable truth,argentinedave,n/a,15/08/2025,"I see a lot of negative comments about this film (here and on amazon).There are those who sum it up in a few of Mark's words, yet seem to ignore the other things that Mark also says.There are those who say the message is obvious and nothing new to them, but seem to assume this makes it a bad film, instead of just not for them at this moment in their lives.There are those who say 'Who are you to tell me this? Where do you get your information from? Where are your citations?' to which I say: the study of psychology is mostly just ideas and interpretations. When you cite someone else's work, all you're doing is citing their ideas and interpretations.Mark has his own ideas and interpretations. He's sharing them with the world. You can do with them whatever you want. You can use them constructively. You can use them destructively. But it's up to you.Mark doesn't owe you an explanation, he doesn't owe you a citation, he's just giving something that can help. You can take it or leave it. Apply it or discard it.All in all I feel a lot of people focused on irrelevant details or completely missed the point of the film.What is the point of the film you may ask?Well, it's not for me to say, but I think that the more important things Mark talks about are uncomfortable truths. They are things most people don't want to accept about themselves because it means changing their long-held beliefs and making a very big mental effort.It's easy to get caught up in a judgmental mode and put all sorts of barriers in one's mind to dismiss what Mark's saying. I believe this is because acknowledging what he says feels uncomfortable. And doing the things one needs to do in order to change feels uncomfortable. And we are masters at trying to avoid feeling this.I do feel the title and cover kinda make you expect a step-by-step guide on how to live a care-free lifestyle. I don't think this is what Mark and the writers were going for, at least that's not what I take from it.In a nutshell, what I take from it is this:To be happy you need to go through discomfort. It's a necessary part of being a happy person, however contradicting that may sound. Accept this, and pain will already be reduced. If you expect painless happiness, you'll be in pain the rest of your life.Superficiality sucks (and you know it). If you feel meaninglessness, create your own meaning. You make yourself with every thought and decision.Any problem is an opportunity to solve it and grow as a result.Anything you want in life is worth the effort and sacrifice.Bad things are a part of nature. Nature is fine. You will be fine.Focus on what's important, and the rest will follow.Anyway, I hope this film reaches the masses, though I get a sense that it's being buried and won't get many views due to the production company's tight ownership... I hope I'm wrong.",False
12,3,I Don't Give A F@ck...,robroyboy2000,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's always so easy for people like Mark to tell us the how and why and what we should do to live a better life when they have $14,000,000 in their back pocket.Seriously, his ideas aren't new, they're just old ideas repackaged. If you have t figured out how to be a good person before you watch this, this film ain't gonna help. If you think your a pretty good and kind person before seeing this film, it'll just come off as sanctimonious nonsense.Listen to the audio book, as this certainly is a case of the book being better than the movie.And the 3 stars are for Disappointment Panda. He's the one thing that kept me engaged.",False
13,7,Pop culture merges with Philosophy.,gmorrison-99943,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerDEspite the fact that it isn't perfect, the presentation itself is a little passe and the presenter/author comes across as human, all too human. This had enough insight to keep going.Manson uses enough of his vast life experience juxtapositioned with pop culture references to make us think what is really worth it and what happiness is.SPOILERS -
His analogy with Megadeth and Metallica was very much on point. Mustaine did sell millions of albums got critical acclaim and sold out tours yet was never happy.I also liked the final message which was very Mansonesque (and Niezchean) .WORTHWHILE.",True
14,1,"Self help, but not for the viewer",mhinchliffe,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watching this is like eavesdropping on Mark's therapy session while he's had a few too many to drink. It's a rambling, one and a half hour, self-indulgent, bitchfest littered with sweeping generalisations to tell you that life is short, you're gonna die soon so you'd make the most of it and not sweat the small stuff, presented with such vitriol it's hard to watch.While I've only just finished watching it and still probably processing what I've just seen, my overall takeaway is how the #@% has he taken such a reasonable and sound outlook for life and wrapped it in such an odious wrapper? Can the book really be this bad?",False
15,4,This movie was (propably) not approved by Manson's writing team,sinkkumies93,n/a,15/08/2025,"Reading The Subtle Art of Not Giving a #@% as a 25-year-old self-help junkie and a fan of counterculture I found the book amazing. It was self-help disguised as something better than personal development. It was beyond that. Rooting in ancient Buddhist philosophies, fueled with great present-day stories like the one about Metallica (that thing just hits me every time).Fast-forward seven years. It's cold Saturday night. Snows. I've had a long day at work and coming home I browse new rentals eventually finding this piece. No need to check the trailer, I know it's going to be a good trip.Boy was I wrong. It's a sad video essay about Mark's trauma caused by his drug use which eventually led to his parents' divorce. He discusses the concept of entitlement and fake reality portrayed on social media - but then shows his own travel photos narrated with stories about douchebags (including himself) with a tone that displays nothing but entitlement. The delivery of these stories is so dull that not even the great graphics help with the boredom those one-dimensional and scattered diary entries cause in the viewer. It's a tone of a person who feels their experiences and observations to be inherently interesting, without putting effort into crafting their public speaking or storytelling. Awkward laughter after talking proudly about ones encounters with women while simultaneously realizing that no one really gives a #@%!Manson has stated earlier that behind his blog and books is a huge team of researchers. That's why the posts are always spot on with many interesting details. I believe like they weren't involved with this film, and I feel slightly betrayed.In the theme of the documentary, accepting that your life is going to suck, I finished almost the whole film trying to observe if it's the film or me that sucks. I received the results, and I can tell you it wasn't me.On the other hand, Mark shows in a sad way that what he preaches is true - he's not special.",False
16,2,Cut to the Chase,wwsmithe,n/a,15/08/2025,"Since this movie is a long, drawn-out attempt at some sort of enlightenment, allow me to perhaps save some readers an hour and a half of their time.I would sum up the entire message of the film by simply stating: 'The key to every situation is to change your perspective.'
Or, in other words, 'It's not what happens to you, but rather how you react to what happens.'Not exactly a new revelation but the author seems determined to drive home this advice to the point of sheer boredom. It's worse than watching a mundane TV infomercial.I'm not saying that the film didn't have a few good points, but rather the manner in which they were ""phoned-in"" to the viewer.",False
17,9,Source material 10/10,mitchell-lash,n/a,15/08/2025,"Source material 10/10. The documentary isn't as much a documentary, but a video lecture with photos & videos (some historical and very helpful to the narrative, and some stock photos/footage which are often less effective) as b-roll.Mark Manson helped me become a better person. Instead of trying to feel good all the time, figure out what you're willing to feel bad for. Stoicism with a dollop of Buddhism, but framed in a down-to-earth, modern-day, lens that most Americans born between 1980-2000, will find super relatable. Mark and his books are a 10/10. The documentary (which considering the source material, would be difficult to produce) is a 5/10. But still watch it, you won't be disappointed.",False
18,2,Mostly boring and uninsightful,FranklinDPoosavelt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Not sure what I was expecting. I've not read his book. But I guess I wanted it to be at least interesting and give even just one or two new ideas on approaching life/happiness. I got neither to be totally honbest. His life isn't especially interesting to me and his issues not very universal IMO. He seems to have been very entitled as a young man, as he admits, I'm not sure most other people are. The title is misleading as his approach most certainly DOES involve giving an F, just giving one about the right things. Well what a huge surprise! Nobody has ever worked that out before have they?!?...care about the things that matter, stop worrying about the stuff that doesn't. Accept life isn't all a bed of roses and includes pain, built in, guaranteed. Yeah mate, I know.",False
19,3,Shallow self-development doco without the bite,advertslyf,n/a,15/08/2025,"Manson tries to convey to us practical wisdom from his life and the modern era that is controversial and confusing.His narrative is one of first world drama where he discovers himself. It's okay, but not very well thought out or scientifically backed. I think one would do much better watching an Alain de Botton TED Talk.True some ideas are better placed in a motion picture narrative. Here the Director has used a mixture of 1980s BBC clips and B-grade acting scenes. It just hasn't cut the mustard for this critical reviewer.For a better experience I'd suggest 'Ravi Patel's Pursuit of Happiness' (2020)",False
20,2,Physcology for under 15 yr old Americans 101,james-67803,n/a,15/08/2025,"Maybe this guys insights help some people and therefore its a good thing.For me though it was like listening to a stoned, naive, teenage surfer dude ramble about the universe in cliches.What he explains is growing up. If you are an intelligent person who has self analysed from a young age it provides zero insight.What he was saying in many different forms was 'dont blame anyone else for your problems'. Combined with reminders that its healthy to think about death constantly and that puts perspective into his life.This maybe even more weird and even further from the truth for non Americans.",False
21,1,"Dreadful ""Documentary""",theravecave,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the worst ""Documentary"" I have ever seen. Get an over-privileged American nitwit who has behaved abominably throughout his life towards women because his first girlfriend cheated on him (Boo Hoo!) as he uses this as an excuse to explain his atrocious behaviour over the next 10 years towards women. He gloats at the fact he spent the next 10 years traveling the world yet we never meet any locals who have ever met him and all the photos are of him are in a tourist bar with women on his arm or doing dumb ass holiday rubbish. What has this guy done to contribute to society? Nothing! Exactly.. yet he is worthy of a 90 minute film! This Idiot talks for an hour and a half like a guru about how to live your life ... I wouldn't take his advise where to buy a burger ... and Netflix deem this in some way important ... only the social media generation would buy into this nonsense!",False
22,9,Wisdom engagingly packaged,Simon_Alveranga,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this with my 13-year-old son and we both really enjoyed it. After reading some of the reviews I think we benefited from not having read the book. This film packages some very valuable wisdom into an engaging 137 minutes. It clips along at a fair pace, blending various stories about the author's own life with fascinating morality tales taken from history, never giving the viewer time to get bored with what is essentially a monologue.I was very impressed with the editing, the opening sequence in particular powerfully demonstrates the futility of all the things that we think we need and crave for by juxtapositioning hundreds of clips from near and distant televisual history.The director is very creative with some of the scenes he created to drive home particularly metaphysical concepts and it's all beautifully presented as a resonant whole.I can understand why some lovers of the book would be disappointed with this film but for many of the current Instagram and YouTube generation I think this presents some important ideas and concepts in a format that will resonate with many of them. I personally look forward to listening to the book now and exploring the concepts presented in more depth.",False
23,3,Boreathon,chris-63307,n/a,15/08/2025,"The most interesting thing about this is its title. Some bloke rabbiting on for an hour and a half about some not very interesting stories from his life. If your looking for some deep insights into life then you won't find them here. Just waffle after waffle. I learnt about some Japanese soldier hiding out in the forest for decades after the war had ended (I already knew this story) and about some bloke he hung around with when he was younger who thought he was great. Oh and something about his first girlfriend cheating on him.He's a pretty well off bloke from a pretty well off family who has travelled the world. He spoke nothing new about life, no enlightenment and it was all devoid of wit and humour. Bore off.",False
24,2,"Didn't manage to finish this festival of ""life is crap""",ddaynnighter,n/a,15/08/2025,"I didn't read the book, I am simply a viewer who decided to click on this movie on netflix and give it a try. What a disappointment. I was hoping for a genuine advice on how to maybe surrender to life a bit more and not treat everything so seriously.I turned it off after 30 min of watching...I just couldn't. As a viewer my perspective on Mark was rather sad. It seemed like a commentary of a guy who's unsatisfied with his life and trying to convince everybody that life is crap, a constant struggle and u might as well just give up. Hopefully I just misunderstood.It's a weird invitation for a viewer to stay unless you love negative perspectives in life.Listen - life isn't a pain in the ass, or a constant struggle. Life is a balance , some days you will be at the top, some days at the bottom. Toxic positivity is not great but toxic negativity isn't either. It is all about the balance. To be able to enjoy the great moments and be grateful for all that you've got, and to be able to acknowledge the negative emotions, feel them and accept them, move forward. Life doesn't have to be a struggle - that does not mean problems will disappear.Problems will always be there , the more you solve them the easier it is usually. Life is here for us so we can experience it, enjoy it but also learn and grow. Life can be real tough, sometimes sad, sometimes so bad you wanna scream and destroy everything on your way, but sometimes it can beautiful and amazing things happen. At the end of the day it's your perspective that will shape how you experience life. You truly are the master of your own life.",False
25,3,Attempt at Self-help for the 20-30's ADHD crowd,sevsevencom,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a nicely packaged self-help docu made by someone in their 30s for a generation that will only understand anything if it's fed to them in a bunch of 10 second animated clips. I hope the panda Company got some money, because those ads are the only genius in this documentary. You'll be watching this hoping this guy will give you some magical insight about how to be happy, ..you might get a small change of perception about something if you haven't figured it out by yourself yet, but you might easily end up even more depressed after watching this too. I enjoyed the little side stories, but the end message, after all the other random change of perception messages, is that when you realize you're going to die, you think, why do anything.. but then again why do nothing.

1,10,A must watch for music fans,maniutin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a huge music enthusiast living in Toronto and i've never heard about this festival. The film is incredible and I had no idea that this event was that important in music history.It's engaging, entertaining and also wholesome and sweet.The story itself is so unbelievable and unlikely that it could've only happened in real life.It's truly unbelievable that such an event took place in Toronto, which, at the time was the number two city in Canada.This event needs to be celebrated as historic as its magnitudes easily matches that of world-famous festivals of the era.A must watch for music fans.",False
2,9,As Time Goes By and By legends survive,Manhattandatingproject,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Revival69: The Concert That Rocked the World"" offers a lot of great music acts and a peek behind the scenes to see what was going on in Music before the 80's. Our reviewer, actor & director Alex von Roon remembers some of the acts vividly and it is interesting & fun to explore what was going on behind the scenes aside from the yellow press assumptions which had ruled for decades. The balance between interviews and original footage is bearable. ""Revival69"" is not too opinionated either. The footage has been nicely edited and the artists get a chance to be heard. You will not regret having spend the time to watch this timeless piece & might learn a thing or two about The Doors, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley, Gene Vincent, Chicago, and Alice Cooper, as well as last-minute addition - John Lennon...Why the performance of the ""Doors"" has not been filmed, is beyond me. Maybe it can be found somewhere or put together?",False
3,n/a,Solid documentary on Canada's most famous rock festival,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"1969's Toronto Rock and Roll Revival festival is mostly known as the venue where John Lennon's album 'Live Peace In Toronto 1969' was recorded (often cited as Lennon's goodbye to The Beatles). REVIVAL69: THE CONCERT THAT ROCKED THE WORLD by Ron Chapman is a documentary about how the entire concert was put together.Chapman was able to get on camera interviews with several of the participants including the show's organizers. Originally, it was mainly conceived as an oldies show bringing together Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley and Gene Vincent. The then little known Alice Cooper band was recruited to be both a 'new' act as well as serving as Vincent's backup band. When ticket sales flagged, they paid The Doors to be the headliners. When that didn't move the needle much, they hatched a last minute scheme to get John Lennon to be an MC. Seemingly on a whim, Lennon not only agreed to appear but brought along his wife Yoko and friends (including Eric Clapton) to debut The Plastic Ono Band. It was such a hurried plan that Lennon and his entourage didn't land in Canada until after the show had already begun. The promoters hired a local Biker gang to escort Lennon from the airport and help with the logistics at the venue (fortunately, it worked out better than the Rolling Stones and Altamont!).Director D. A. Pennebaker (MONTEREY POP) filmed the show and Chapman uses that footage generously throughout. Pennebaker released his own short documentary as SWEET TORONTO* in 1971. The footage shows that it was more than just the John Lennon show. The other artists put on lively sets, in particular Cooper. This is the show where the legend that Cooper bit the head off a chicken was spawned (the reality was more along the lines of the 'Turkey Drop' episode of WKRP In Cincinnati!). L. A. Scenesters Kim Fowley and Rodney Bingenheimer were hired to be the hosts and Fowley is partly credited helping with create the cigarette lighter encore tradition at rock concerts. Unfortunately, The Doors refused to be filmed so there is only scattered footage of the band.It's a well put together Documentary with some interesting interviews with performers Cooper, Klaus Voorman and Robby Kreiger as well as attendees Geddy Lee and critic Robert Christgau. As usual, one wishes to have seen and heard more music. Fortunately, in addition to SWEET TORONTO, more of Pennebaker's footage exists online and on various home video releases. REVIVAL69 is a fascinating tale of Canada's most famous rock fest.On DVD the Doc is better known as JOHN LENNON AND THE PLASTIC ONO BAND: LIVE IN TORONTO.",False

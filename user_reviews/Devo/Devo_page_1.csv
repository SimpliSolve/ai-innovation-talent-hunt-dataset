1,6,Are We Not Men?....We Are Devo!,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.Chris Smith creator of ""American Movie"" creates a fun documentary about the band DEVO who are widely misunderstood with interesting choices of music, background observations and conversations. DEVO's background and story is pretty interesting as the documentary does a good job on exploring the band with some fun insights.Since I am not the biggest music documentary person, I found certain aspects feeling slow and uneventful towards the second act. Including some of the conversations feeling a little dry. Overall, there are some really nice fun moments together.",False
2,10,Best documentary,LeiaB-1,n/a,16/08/2025,This has to be one of the best and most well put together movie down to the overall feel with the music and the aesthetic of DEVO absolutely is amazing. I wish this documentary would be released to the public and not just in film festivals because it has truly inspired me and I've been trying to find this documentary since i saw it for the first time. This has also striked my idea on what my style is and has changed it for the better. I love how unique DEVO is as a whole and they are truly inspiring with their visuals and music. I truly hope that this eventually comes out and this is my last resort to write a review in hopes the director sees this!,False

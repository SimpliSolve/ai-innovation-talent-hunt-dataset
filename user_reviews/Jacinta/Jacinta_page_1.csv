1,8,Wish her & her family all the best.,ilovefoodcoma,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love watching documentary because it is real & tell the story better than reading in a book. After watching this film, I realize how powerful our parents' influence are. It is sad to see her life journey. After seeing her studying for her education.... so happy for her! Wish that would be the turning point of her life.",False
2,8,Hard Luck Story,keithdt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Film was very well done as well as engrossing, sad and sometimes hard to watch. But I wonder a bit about films like these zoomed in on the lives of particular troubled people. While watching it I kept hearing these lyrics from the Bob Dylan song ""Black Diamond Bay"" (from the Desire album):
""Seems like every time you turn around
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear...
And there's really nothing anyone can say"".",False
3,7,Surprising,becinreallife,n/a,15/08/2025,"When my partner put this documentary on, I honestly thought I wouldn't like it. I was wrong, got hooked on Jacinta's journey and more than surprised at the end. I wish her and her family all the best.",False
4,10,Heartbreaking,crazydancr28,n/a,15/08/2025,"This really hit me to the core. It was deeply moving, deeply depressing, and deeply heartbreaking for this entire family, especially Jacinta's daughter. Addiction is real and I truthfully believe we need to do more to help those struggling. This documentary will definitely sit with me for a while.",False
5,9,All too familiar story,elishawin2005,n/a,15/08/2025,"How many families do you know that are or were going through a situation similar to this? I'm pretty sure more than half the people who watched it would say many. I think they did a great job following the ups and downs over a period of time. I was so scared there was going to be a sad message at the end telling us that Jacinta or even her mom died. Choosing who you procreate with and when is the most important decision one can make in their life. Jacinta's Grandparents should not have brought children in this world when they did because it started a cycle of neglect and abuse. Truth be told, it probably started a generation or two before then. That's easier said than done in some situations but none the less important. Crucial! I applaud them for putting it all out there for the world to see because it just might help someone make better decisions along the way. I wish them all the best!!",False
6,8,Familiar,meangrl29,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI think everyone knows people like this. Maybe in your own family. I understand Jacinta's allegiance to her mother but I cannot understand how her mother treated her. She pimped her out at 15. How? Jacinta is blinded by her need for love from her abuser. Her mother, the abuser, is unforgivable. I'm not an addict. I've known many. Her mother could have endured unspeakable pain and shame to shield her daughter just one little bit.Jacinta said she needed to numb the pain from her shame. We all get that. But a big part of her shame was brought on by her mother.Then she went back in for a 4 year stint just to see her mom.It shows that abusers aren't just boyfriends, husband, or fathers. Mother's have the ultimate control.I could understand everything but that.",True
7,9,"Amazing, heartbreaking, haunting",dstarw,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJacinta is a story of addiction and the struggle that comes with it for a broken individual. The systemic brokenness in America is felt deeply in this movie. Our lack of mental health in this country is generations deep and Jacinta is another product of this. Following Jacinta through her heart wrenching journey in and out of jail then back in for her own safety is so telling of the deep seated need for structure in the country when it comes to helping those affected by addiction and poverty. I can only hope that Jacinta, her family, and her daughter all find peace and hope in the journey forward.",True
8,10,Ten out of ten,remylawler,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really in-depth documentary about the cycle of addiction, incarceration and family. I'm from northern Massachusetts and grew up going to Maine at my grandparents house. I very much appreciate the integrity of the story told here.",False
9,1,Intervention 2.0,ttray2,n/a,15/08/2025,This was like a long drawn out episode of Intervention. Nothing new or awe inspiring here.,False
10,9,As real as it gets,Ishmael_22,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the best documentaries of 2020: it is a raw and true telling of so much family trauma and addiction.You will be rooting for Jacinta throughout this documentary to turn things around for not only herself but her beautiful, smart, kind, and innocent daughter.",False
11,3,Shocking,ali-96563,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWell we're do you start, a documentary about a girl with an addiction!!a mother who is obviously not right in the head and a film maker who is has nuts as the documentary! So the only two people I see with brains here are jacinta's daughter and father! Yes I get the mother had a terrible up bringing but wether terrible or not does not give you an excuse to prostitute your 15 year old daughter and encourage her to take drugs she wants locking up never to be realised again what a great role model for her daughter! Then you got the film maker riding along in a car with a sky high addict what a tool.i suppose the best thing that came out of it is that jacinta kept her daughter away from her addiction!!!!her daughter had more brains then the lot put together.",True

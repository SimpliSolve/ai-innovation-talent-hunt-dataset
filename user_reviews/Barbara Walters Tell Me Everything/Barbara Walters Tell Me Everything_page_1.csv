1,7,"""She could be wily...and she was not above dirty tricks.""",moonspinner55,n/a,16/08/2025,"Entertaining journey of the first woman of television news, Barbara Walters, a staff writer at NBC's Today Show in 1961 New York City who was brought on camera to do puff pieces which eventually took her to the co-anchor's chair. Ambitious, competitive, but insecure, Walters faced down her misogynistic male adversaries until she grew to be so popular (with political heavyweights, with show business royalty, and with the TV-watching public) that her prowess in the industry couldn't be ignored. This documentary from director Jackie Jesko isn't exactly thorough, but then again Walters herself doesn't acknowledge an early foray into women's afternoon television with ""Not For Women Only"", a 1971-1976 precursor to ""The View"" (Walters also did two episodes of ""Girl Talk"" in 1967). Barbara's prized interviews are the meat and potatoes here, however I wish we didn't just hear her incisive questions but also the answers (Monica Lewinsky's interview--which reached some 70 million homes--gets the most time, though it was always one of Walters' least-aggressive and therefore most colorless chats). Still, the woman was an icon, a formidable lady, and yet somewhat of a mystery. We may never get to know ""the woman behind the fa√ßade"", but this is a great starting off point. *** from ****",False
2,8,A Once in a Lifetime Legend,CineChamber,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was still really young when Barbara Walters was at some of the heights of her career, so I never really paid much attention to her, or her legacy. This documentary really opened my eyes to the legend and legacy she has created for many many people, especially woman. This film shows a person who is fearless and bold, but yet can connect with anyone. With the way the world operates now a days, she was a pinnacle foundation in creating how news and interviews happen. RIP to a real heroin and idol.",False
3,10,It's realistic and well documented,dbuckshnis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who grew up in finance and was the only woman in the room - this documentary was well edited and realistic. While I grew up with her and also poked fun at her language skills (loved Gilda Radner impressions), she did grow on me and I became one of her biggest fans. I was too young to see all the ""inter-fighting"" with Reasoner or others but can imagine it was true and the documentary while bringing it up, did not dwell on it. I also like the behind the scenes pictures and interviews and opinions of other newscasters. The segment on ""event television"" was great and she was always great at these specials. Andy Cohen was a great - Katie Couric not so much - ...I have given this a 10 as I thought it was a well balanced piece showing her journalistic skills and pioneering methods. Bette Midler was great!",True

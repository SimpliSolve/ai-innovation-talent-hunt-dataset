1,7,a good resumee...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOf 2 lives lost and hundreds more shattered from the pain and anguish that joran van der sloot instigated upon them, by first killing nathalie holloway, then some years later letting his psychopathic talents strangling the lights of life of stephany flores of lima peru, a life that obviously could have been saved if aruban authorities and the dutch criminal justice system had done their job, by letting him go, free as the bird to further develope his psychopathic talents of extortion and multi-pathical lies and life, for one simple reason, his greed for money and mortal gambling habbits...there are series made , of great contents, made about nathalie holloway, her life and dissapearance story, have a look as these as well, and lets yourself into the sense of anger and avenging feelings that i felt when viewing these productions. Its a good thing that the '' aruban eel'',van der sloot is in jail, and i think he should never see the light of freedom ever again...to the holloway family, i will say that you should be proud of yourself in your fight for justice for nathalie, after 20 years of still searching ill bend in the dust in respect for your stamina to keep your daughters memory alive.So as a true life crime documentary production this gives the viewer a good overview of the cases, within a 90 minutes timeframe, therefore a thumbs up from the grumpy old man.",True
2,6,WELL-RESEARCHED,jeromesgabilo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I must commend the chronological and technical precision brought into this chilling documentary. From editing to research, this documentary was underrated. The scenes and interviews to the witnesses and families were central and relevant to the topic at hand. There was not a single scene that was not relevant to the plot. Every little detail was central to the plot. The chilling and revealing discoveries through police surveillance and interviews were the strongest suit of the film, as was with every other great documentaries. The narration was even outstanding and complementary to the vibe of the film.",False

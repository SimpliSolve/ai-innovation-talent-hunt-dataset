1,10,"""Such compassion, artistry & grace""",jeremiahhayes-666-675641,n/a,16/08/2025,"""What an extraordinary and moving film. It is so exquisitely and artistically crafted. The animation is perfectly integrated; the soundtrack and music fit the film like a glove; it is seamlessly edited; the choice of shots, archives and images is so thoughtful and intentional. And the pacing is so perfectly in tune with the content that it almost feels like breathing. I can't imagine a more authentic tribute to Audrey and Martin or to the unconditional love which is at the essence of their story. Not a false note. Dear Audrey celebrates the very best the human heart has to offer - and with such compassion, artistry and grace. Such a beautiful film"".Terre Nash, Oscar-winning director.",False
2,10,"Powerful film ""Dear Audrey""",jasonhope-57111,n/a,16/08/2025,"""It reveals extraordinary lives - truths are told - the astonishing images and words will be in my heart - must see again to find yet another deeper level - love and awareness of humanity.""

3,8,An Amazing Story,DavoZed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really two amazing stories, the love story at the center of the movie and the main character's life story.This is a warts and all ramble through the lives of that character, his wives and his children, juxtaposed against the world events going on around them, that they participated in.The central character is the main narrator of what went on and I found him and his story pretty disheveled at times.Still, worth a watch if you love great stories.",False
4,10,Dear Audrey delivers a love story for the ages,kikotamoko,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Martin Duckworth spent decades telling other people's truths. But the former NFB director is actually in front of the camera for some of his most compelling and candid moments in cinema...""""Dear Audrey is filled with touching moments showing Duckworth's deep love for his wife, who taught photography for 16 years at the Saidye Bronfman Centre in Montreal.""""The scenes in their rambling and sometimes chaotic household are augmented with glorious footage from the '60s and '70s and imaginative black-and-white animation.""""Topping it off is the warm, understated, and authentic original music by Walker Grimshaw. It's presented to just the right degree to reinforce this love story but not so heavy as to overwhelm it or become treacly.""""Anyone who watches Dear Audrey will undoubtedly conclude that Hayes is a masterful filmmaker.""Charlie Smith, The Georgia Straight.",False

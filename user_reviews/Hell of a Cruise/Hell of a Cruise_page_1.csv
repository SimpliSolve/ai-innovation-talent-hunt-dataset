1,7,Very good,anthonymortell,n/a,16/08/2025,"At 7 minutes they interview a member of the crew and hide him in the shadows. But then at 7:03 he shows up working, it's obvious he's the one being interviewed. LMAO.Anyway, good documentary. Bad plans executed by the cruise companies, but let's be honest, no one knew what to do at the time. Not even the World Health Organization knew what to do.At 7 minutes they interview a member of the crew and hide him in the shadows.

2,4,Skewed,rjgrund-123-603438,n/a,16/08/2025,"Instead of just focusing on the people and the event this became a politically driven story. Good documentaries have the topic and people as their focus not their hidden agenda. There are plenty of those and they are the ones who make a difference. This was a frustrating viewing experience. There were enough human interest stories to weave together but wasn't. Making me care about the people and their journey is what I would have wanted to see. If someone were to make that one and leave their political bent out of it maybe it would make a difference. For me, this one won't and I am truly disappointed.",False
3,8,Good documentary,EPMD57,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary had the right mix of archival footage and interviews. A wide variety of passengers were interviewed, and several of their stories were interesting.I went into this feeling very little sympathy for the passengers who chose to take a cruise just as the Pandemic was gearing up, but I softened my stance somewhat as the documentary progressed. People were caught up in something unprecedented, and once you were on the boat, you were already in too deep.From watching this film, you get a good sense of how bizarre everything was in the world at that time. The only thing I think they could have improved was the feeling of danger. They recited statistics of the number of deaths from these cruises, but a lot of the film was a bit too lighthearted in tone to really convey that sense of doom.",False
4,3,Some Good Some Bad,hkhdswdjz,n/a,16/08/2025,I really wanted to enjoy this documentary. Started off good and then it gets really political. I'm not sure why they decided to go this way. Especially now that we know that most of the people who ended up dying from the virus had pre existing health issues.I found it really interesting when the actual passengers where interviewed. Hearing the insights and what they were going through was very interesting. One item they didn't discuss was the food that the passengers were being given when they were docked in Japan.Over half way through is when we find out that it was all the governments fault. Even though the decisions were being made by the unelected bureaucrats. Definitely should have and could have kept politics out of it and shown us interesting first hand experiences from the passengers.,False

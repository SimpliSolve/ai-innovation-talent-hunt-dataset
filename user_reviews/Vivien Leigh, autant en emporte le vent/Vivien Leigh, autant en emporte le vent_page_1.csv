1,9,A legend the wind will never blow away.....,ulicknormanowen,n/a,16/08/2025,"A good biopic about one of the greatest British actresses of all time; although too short, it spans all her career ,handicapped by bipolar disorders , bouts of tuberculosis ...and certainly her beauty ,people having a tendency to believe that a gorgeous lady cannot be considered a serious character actress.But what a career ! Much time (not too much) is given over to ""gone with the wind"": most amazing thing ,she wrote Laurence Olivier she was certain the epic would be a flop !But other movies are evoked : "" a streetcar named desire"" , her second AA , showed a woman who did not think twice when it came to making yourself ugly ; as Kazan told many times ,they only got on together after some time because she was influenced by what she did with her husband in London (and London is far from the world of Tennessee Williams ) ; it includes extracts from ""fire over England"" ,her first film with Olivier, the superb melodrama ""Waterloo bridge"" ,and the film in which she had the guts to play her own role of aging actress ""the Roman spring of Mrs Stone ""based on a novel by her friend Tennessee Williams. The doomed effort "" Elephants walk"" (later replaced by Elizabeth Taylor)is also mentioned .She always insisted that she would be free to play on stage and on screen ,that's why her filmography is rather small .Much time is given over to her legendary love affair with Laurence Olivier (they were both married with children when they met); Leigh suffered from scathing critics by Kenneth Tynan who wrote that she spoiled her husband's playing .He was to revise his opinion later.After her divorce , actor Jack Merivale took good care of her (he knew of her health problems)
The biopic ends with pictures of her last movie which featured French actress Simone Signoret who showed sympathy for her during the shooting.A legend.",False

1,9,A wonderful and poignant story of a great team,grimdon,n/a,17/08/2025,"I loved this, for a number of reasons. The relationship between Mancini and Vialli shone through - a platonic love between two guys who spent large chunk of their careers together. The players were all likeable, eloquent but also complex. If there's ever a film made about this Samp team, Jason Isaacs has to play Gianluca Pagliuca. Pagliuca was probably my favourite interviewee of all - a cool, affable and articulate chap.The film also has an additional poignancy given Luca Vialli's recent sad passing, with extra meaning brought to every word he says. In all, a wonderful story of a great team, who like so many great teams were split apart again too soon.",False

1,8,Truly one of the best food shows I have watched,benjobling-55891,n/a,16/08/2025,Really do wish that you guys would just allow James and Nikki to co host rather than kicking Nikki out of the kitchen. Nikki and James just work together like pie and peas would love to see Nikki and James both at the Forefront of the show as co-hosts as the charisma between the two is second to none,False
2,9,A real cooking show sort of,arnoud-bekker,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like the show, because i can identify a bit with James. He is not an experienced cook, so he learns as he goes and teaches us some fundamentals at the same time. He does have the advantage of a good kitchen and professional help. But in the end he is stumbling through instructions, like most of us.I think i learned more about cooking then any other show and I especially like him trying out dumb cooking tools, to make life as an amateur cook easier. He should do that more in the next season. Because most tools do not work, or work very briefly. A sharp knife has to date been the best advise. However, some tools do actually work and i would love to know about them.Really hope there is going to be another season!",False
3,9,Might Become A Favorite,mirow-51098,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't wait for the next season. I've never found myself chuckling or bursting out loud laughing so much during any other cooking show. The mishaps were hysterical and I loved that the film crew were part of the show. James's sense of humor, the gadgets, and Niki make the show endearing, more than a straightforward cooking show. I felt included in the kitchen and had a glass or two right along with them. While a lot of the ""out of the can""recipes were so-so, I loved James's pride in his first cake, the cheesy cauliflower, the Spotted Dick and many others. I want to try his smoked fish and rice breakfast dish for sure. Only, don't keep shoving Niki back in the closet. That was a little cringy.",False
4,10,An honest cooking show,some-ordinary-reviewer,n/a,16/08/2025,"Perhaps what has been the most fun is how laid back the attitude of the show is. The crew are regularly included in some way and the process of how these kinds of shows are made becomes a part of the show itself. It's taken the cooking show format and made it something fun and actually human/real (i.e no fake chemistry between hosts or attempts to hide mistakes with the cooking).I've no idea if he made these recipes himself but his completely easy to understand way of explaining how to cook these dishes is fantastic for novices. It's also surprising that he's managed to keep a lot of these processes simple and not overly complicated, as that is his usual style.I utterly love this show. I hope season 2 will mean a second cookbook and that we HOPEFULLY get a season 3 at some point too.",False
5,10,SO FUNNY,aaronmills-02441,n/a,16/08/2025,This series is so funny if you are bored and want to watch something to pass time I would highly recommend this it's quite funny and definitely should be a second season.,False
6,7,Straightforward cooking advice with added value by James May,d-justins,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most people unfamilar with James May could regard this show as too laid back and possibly lacking all the flair of other cooking shows. That's kind-of the point of this show, however, because James isn't a professional cook. Instead, we're seeing his learning process. All the while he's including history and interesting facts with all of the very practical advice that most other cooking shows skim over. I watch alot of cooking shows and this is the best of them. Each episode has a specific theme. It does a great job of focusing on the points that make you a better cook, leaving the bunch of cooking fluff of other shows aside.",False
7,10,May greater than Ramsay,mjbyrne-36171,n/a,16/08/2025,"Perhaps May was inspired to get in to foodtribe and this show after making a better fish pie than Ramsay while drunk.
Anyway, I have always loved him as a presenter from toy stories and man lab. He has a knack for speaking while performing a task and makes his adventure in cooking very fun to watch. Especially because he is very passionate about it. The show is informative, it is funny, and it makes fun of traditional cooking shows by including the crew with more amusing banter.
If you liked previous May shows you will like this.",False
8,10,Good fun honest entertainment no frills - just what the doctor ordered,jmsl-7776,n/a,16/08/2025,I have watch travel cooking shows.I have watched in your kitchen cooking shows.All do what it says on the tin and the delivery is I suppose faultless but it is made for cooks.James May is just delightful. Like the rest of us is not a cook nor spending a ton of time in the kitchen cooking.But like the rest of us enjoys good food and good wine!This is so good. So funny. Not pretentious like most cooking shows. Honest. And James May - Captain Slow and precise at his best proves that cooking is about following well written instructions in receipes to the letter to produce good food. Really good fun. Keep it coming.Season 3 please.,False
9,10,If you know what you're walking into...,thomasdunwoodie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fan of James May? This is typical gold. James loads in his usual doddering antics, dry sense of humour, and for this show - limited cooking knowledge. Overall, a very meta approach to cooking.",False
10,5,It does what it is supposed to be mocking,jimmyc95,n/a,16/08/2025,I am a great fan of May's other projects such as toy stories and his wine adventures with Oz Clarke but this is definitely his weakest project. If you have seen the trailer like me you may have been expecting a funny take on the usual cooking shows with the twist of James learning to cook along the way. Instead we get a pretty normal cooking show with the slow mo closeups the only difference is the cook has a recipe visible. The joke of Niki coming out of the cupboard wears off in the first episode and I don't think anyone will try to make about 60% of the recipes shown as they are not very appealing or informative. May does throw in some bits of history which are interesting along the way but definitely not a reason to watch. Don't be fooled by those who rate it highly purely because James May is the host. It is a very average cooking show. If you do want to watch James May cooking his FoodTribe YouTube videos where he cooks odd dishes e.g. cat food pie is much more entertaining.,False
11,8,Surprisingly funny,rhysjamesmilner,n/a,16/08/2025,James may brings his usual charm and humour to a cookery show like no other. Funny and quirky will hope for a season 2,False
12,10,"if you want to laugh and have fun for 25 mins straight, watch it",nnnbooks,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brilliant, punny, quite informative (actually), light and fun.I loved this show. I laughed my way through the season.James May has a great sense of humor; what also enriches his show is the situational humor he and the crew mastered as well. Well edited. Makes the show super fun and ""relaxing.""
I will definitely re-watch.",False
13,10,Finally a cooking show for us mere mortals,washy-252-395886,n/a,16/08/2025,"As much as I love a good cooking show where a professional chef shows you how easy it is to turn out a masterful dish of culinary delight there is always something they neglect to point out, you won't be as efficient as they are, if a chef is telling you that you can do this dish in 15 minutes, add 45.However this is where Mr May comes in, he hides nothing about his cooking ability and even has to refer to the instructions putting himself on the same level as us. He even has plenty of interesting trivia about elements of what he is doing which make you sit there and think, ""wow I never knew that"". That accompanied with his usual wit and delivery make this an excellent cooking show, and one we can all relate to.",False
14,10,Does what it says on the tin,pikulskapaulina,n/a,16/08/2025,"Funny and factual. Great, best one yet. Does what it says on the tin.",False
15,10,"James May, as intended",Lauren-Monardo,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a long-time fan of James May and his works, I view this as a return to gold standard. While I was introduced to May through ""Top Gear"" and enjoy him as part of the trio behind that and ""Grand Tour"", I actually prefer him in situations where he's allowed to take center stage more.May's second most recent solo outfit, ""Our Man in... Japan"" was good but, in my humble opinion, ""Oh Cook"" puts him back where he does best: with a small selection of fantastic supporting cast and crew, tinkering with tools and experimenting. Think ""Man Lab"", ""Toy Stories"", and even ""the Reassembler"". The addition of Home Economist Nikki Morgan is really fantastic (if not underutilized) and brings great dimension to the experience.While I'm not sure what non-May fans might think of this venture, I for one am all for a second course!",False
16,4,a bit dull,djurrepower,n/a,16/08/2025,"In its essense its just a cooking show like any other, but with a little more transparancy. Also james is his usual self with some dry comments and little 'fun fact' moments. But in the end its just a cooking show, its not much more than that.4/10: quite boring tbh.",False
17,9,James May CAN cook (sort of)!,sam-carter180,n/a,16/08/2025,"Another solid and genuinely good show from James May. - it really is a cooking show!.. BUT it's nice and relaxing to watch and really, very entertaining!",False
18,10,Captain slow bites,slashism,n/a,16/08/2025,"So, Clarkson's farming, May's cooking and Hammond's lost on an island probably crashing into the ocean. Oh Cook is a better version of the Drivetribe cooking segments. I loved the out of focus food closeups. May's commentary is the soundtrack. This is a nice show to have on while going about the morning routine. In that little thing it accomplishes properly, its a 10/10.",False
19,8,Loved it. And I hate cooking and cooking shows.,chiaradm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never enjoyed cooking shows. I don't understand their purpose. And I hate cooking. I will never even try any of the recipes.
But after having known James for his series in Japan, when I saw this I knew I had to watch. And I am so glad I did. It was a great entertainment: not only James is hilarious and interesting as always, but the whole team in my opinion found the perfect recipe for a great show. I love the way they joke with each other, how they play with the editing by keeping 'behind the scenes' bits and the way they mixed all these ingredients together. I just finished this show and I am already missing it.
Please, do something else on any random subject before I'll have to go watch motors and cars, because it's something I really would avoid, even if James is in it!
Also, where can one get a personal Nikki?",False
20,10,Classic Jame May,fvdcvqwm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wonderfully charming and with James May's endearing quirks this was throughly enjoyable and easy to watch. Thankfully not taking itself too seriously whilst still being fun and informative. For fans of James May this is worth a watch, with his unique take on cooking, kitchen gadgets and the world around him. The recipes are easily accessible and not intimidating to prepare, perfect for James May to bumble through and maintain his level of entertainment. The dynamic between James and the guiding hand of Nikki adds another layer of endearment making this a very watchable series. It's meant to be a bit of fun rather than James May learning to be the next Masterchef so relax and enjoy!",False
21,10,I loved Oh Cook 1 & 2,chrissyrae-29488,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved to watch James cook. He doesn't claim to be any different than anybody else learning to try to cook new things. Not every recipe you try works. Even if they do your expectations of the results may be different than the result. I binged watched the entire second season and thoroughly enjoyed doing so. It is fun to watch a cooking show and to really get to laugh at the same time you are learning something. I hope there is a season 3. If there is, it will definitely be on my to watch list. Keep them coming James. Your pronunciation of humus was correct. Tell your crew they don't know what they r talking about.",False
22,2,Just what we lacked. Another Food Programme,Harroon,n/a,16/08/2025,"You would have thought a man with the knowledge of Mister May would have done a series dismantling Big Ben, or perhaps even a tactical nuclear weapon. But nope! He's in the Kitchen. You are not short of wonga, James so what the heavens enticed you to do this?",False
23,9,He cooks like I do!,ericfunston,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't usually recommend a television program until I've watched at least one full season, but .... I'm four episodes into this cooking show on Amazon Prime and I'm loving it. James May, who claims he can't cook, cooks just like I do and is as funny as all git-out! I like it so much, I'm going to buy his book.",False
24,10,Really fun show,iamprince-13526,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's just what you expect from a Jame May's show, don't have anything bad to say.",False
25,10,amazing!!!,abbief-30291,n/a,16/08/2025,"Funny, educational programme if you dont like it then youre a complete twonk",False

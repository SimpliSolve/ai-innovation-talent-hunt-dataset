1,7,"Yep, worth a watch",emurcutt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kick It Like Tayla does a decent job at showing us Tayla the kid, daughter, team mate ect. Whilst tracking the controversys and criticisms around her. Ultimately seeing the pain caused to Tayla, shows that the criticisms really have little to do with football, and more to do with causing pain for pains sake. As she is one of many female football players, this shows just what one person is having to through for the sake of our entertainment.",False
2,1,"Trash, no one cares",G-17208,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is so bad, I want to give you a zero, but that's not possible, so I give you a 1. Why are people trying to make her relevant? There are hundreds of athletes worthy of a movie, she is most definitely not one of them. Every athletes in the public eye has comments and messages, both positive and negative, posted about them... this does not make her worthy of a documentary or a statue.",False
3,8,add to your watch list,mark_AUD,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poor Tayla cops some hate , undeserved , she is a talented athlete both in the boxing ring and as an AFL player . This doco opens your eyes to the shocking Trolls out there , pretty disgusting what she has to put up with.",False
4,9,Must watch!,John-58489,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just loved this, it painted a moving story of what young female athletes go through and Tayla is an incredible role model and example to young women, regardless of whether they want to become athletes or not.I watched with my daughter and she loved every minute of it. Not only was it heartfelt and hilarious but it is the sort of film that should be shown at schools to educate on the impact of the dangerous online world.Well done Tayla, yet again paving the way.",False
5,10,A sporting doco you haven't seen before.,Dortsy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting to watch a doco about an elite athlete mid-career. Tayla's story has so much to give to young athletes of all genders, backgrounds, sports and levels of competition. Local kids get trolled and bullied, have to make tough decisions and get dropped from teams. There is something for everyone in this one.To hear how Tayla, her support people and the big-wigs of AFL, world media and Australian sport have viewed and responded to the real and constant obstacles she has faced was illuminating and heartening.It will be a doco to revisit at the end of the decade, to look back at where AFLW has come from. A pivotal time for the game and our sporting culture.",False
6,10,We all need to kick like Tayla,ChristopherMurray_,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautifully made documentary that gives a fantastic insight into the life of Tayla Harris. Shows she's more than an athlete to future generations. Would recommend for all ages. Tayla is a marquee name in the relatively new AFLW competition, and has dominated the headlines for a variety of reasons. This documentary dives into the pressures and stress of life as a female athlete, and shows that her spirit and a strong will to succeed can overcomes any obstacle. An on-field legend but Taylas biggest achievement comes off the field as she inspires and encourages kids of all ages to give it their all. Watching this doco with your kids is a must.",False

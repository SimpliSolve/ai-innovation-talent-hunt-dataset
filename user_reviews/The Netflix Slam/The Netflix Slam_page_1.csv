1,6,Match is great - talk during play: not so much.,azurb,n/a,16/08/2025,"We have two amazing tennis players and guys who comments love their voices so much, that they do not stop for a second DURING THE PLAY!!!! Why?!!Even if you have great and interesting things to say, there are not more important that the game itself!Watch the play - comment between the point! Not too complicated.Whole setup fit more boxing match than tennis match.Cut out to the studio also not helping. It was interesting to listen Agassi and Rodrick but some of other commentators looks like they are vaguely interested with the match and are here just for the paycheck. Shame as it could be one of the last opportunities to see Nadal playing (hopefully not!)",False

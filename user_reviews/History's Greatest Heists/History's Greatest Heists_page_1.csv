1,8,even though lots of dramatizations...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of each of the heists, very well presented and narrated by our most beloved 007 pierce brosnan, youll get a really nice insight and grip on some of the superheists that the world have seen in newer history, also some stil footage and former heistorical members of the hudlum crews tells their insight and stories, with a good help from crime historians makes this tv series a very well spent binging hours in front of the tv.Very little repetition is crucial for the flow of the story and the acting cast does a reasonably good job on the crime scene. So i look forward to more of the same, maybe nokas of stavanger could make an episode, anyway a recommend from the grumpy old man.",False
2,9,Well Presented and Fun True Crime Series,jburtonprod-802-759029,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been watching a lot of true crime for a writing project I'm doing. They can get pretty grim. It's nice to watch a series where there's some planning, intrigue and police work where a person isn't dead at the the end of it. (For the most part)Pierce Brosnan does an excellent job of presenting the series. There's a snappiness and lightness to the series. The capers are all interesting and presented in detail. Almost all the episodes prove no matter how well a caper is planned something is, usually, overlooked.I'm hoping this series is picked up. It's very informative and wildly entertaining. Any one of the capers could make a good movie.",False
3,8,"Done Well, Interesting",TrumanGire,n/a,16/08/2025,"After watching many movies with these kinds of heists (Ocean's Eleven, The Italian Job, even Goodfellas for the Lufthansa heist) it was cool to see how these people actually managed to steal millions, if not billions, of dollars from various places.Yes, the reenactment can be a little cheesy at some points, but overall it's really fascinating and does a good job of diving into the logistics and planning behind these massive robberies.The interviews are great, and they got a diverse cast of people - from actual criminals who were involved in the heist, to cops that were on the investigation and witnesses who were there when it was happening. While the narration is a little choppy, it doesn't downgrade this at all.",False

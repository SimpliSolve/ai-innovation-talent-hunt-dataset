1,4,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME,Michael_Arm,n/a,16/08/2025,"TMZ looking to make some money off of their previously run headlines. Sure, there are some interviews with individuals that were close to Diddy but nothing new is being said. This was clearly made in a rush and is filled with junk news from TMZ's prior reportings. You won't learn anything new and all the stories are ones you've already heard about. TMZ lightly goes over Diddys past criminal issues and lawsuits.....this is a simple fluff piece and insults the viewer's intelligence.I'm not even sure why some of the interviewees agreed to participate in this??? And I'll never forgive myself for sitting through 3/4 of it. All you need to do is Google ""TMZ DIDDY"" and there you will have everything this is about. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!",False
2,6,Diddy evil or Good ?,AvionPrince16,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo just finished the documentary and it was pretty interesting .I already had some info about Diddy problems with some people but in that documentary we saw also some people talking and some exclusive images of Diddy that i have never seen before even when he is working with Cassie and others .We see also the testimonies about people that found for a long time that Diddy was not what he pretend to be . And it was interesting to see . I saw also some new images about the Raid in his houses and how he gets arrested and the charges .We see also how powerful Diddy is and how others are afraid to talk about him even knowing him in prison : very scary to be honest and i think we still have a lot to hear if some people go beyond their fears. Diddy was also involved in drugs , sex trafficking and others things. So i hope there will be new documentaries on Diddy when new elements will come because i really enjoyed anyway to know that industry is not really clean and how dirty it can be .The case is not over yet.",True
3,1,Really hard to take seriously.,kintsukana,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSome of the most inauthentic speakers with robotic and monotone delivery I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. I made it 20 minutes in before shutting it off since all the background noise or ""music"" made it entirely too annoying to try and follow the random people (no one knows who they are) talking. There is like way overly ""tense"" and dramatic music copy and pasted on top of every interview even with nothing interesting being talked about that is super annoying.They really need to find a singular narrator that comes across as mildly serious and not rely on random tickytok clips by people no one has ever heard of.It's rather sad seeing an old man like heavy leavin trying his best to appeal to kids to prolong the already too long lifespan of tmz. Hopefully sooner rather than later they will go the way of perez hilton and disappear into the ether.It's VERY hard to take it seriously due to heavy leavin attempting to come across as a serious presenter but he looks like he just came back from a week long bender with the orange creature he loves so much.Aubrey O'Day must've needed a paycheck or something considering she has never been relevant. Last anyone even heard about her was when she was on that apprentice show with the orange thing...Hmm I'm beginning to see a trend with the people involved in this ""documentary"" are the same people that love the twice impeached and soon to be jailed orange thing.Not worth watching, you'd be better off finding a random youtube channel explaining the situation.",True
4,10,People defend this animal?!?!?!?,ivetto-83406,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot believe yalls comments that he is ""still human"" are you kidding me? Did you even watch the show? He raped women!!! Innocent women!!! We raped men!!!!!! He shot a teenage girl in the face!!! He hurt people and he got away with it! What a disgusting human being and what a horrible world we live in!I really hope that there is justice and he gets life in prison for all he has done. It makes me sick that theres people who defend him and judges who did nothing when it was their job to protect society from a predator like this guy.At last, I am glad that this kind of stories finally come out! There is hope!",False
5,10,You HAVE to Watch this one....,Alfred_Loves_Movies,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh boy oh boy, where do I even begin. Let me start by saying this: if you haven't seen this masterpiece of a movie, you are doing yourself a disservice. This marvellous film created by the geniuses at TMZ is nothing short of life changing. I would like to take some time to reflect on the day when I first got to experience the wonders of Diddy.It was a beautiful Saturday morning. The birds were chirping and the sun was rising over the horizon, lighting up my room. I sat up from bed and I reached to grab the remote to my brand new Roku smart TV that now includes voice search and controls. I turnt on the TV and there he was.... Diddy.... His encapsulating stare into my soul made me shiver in fear. I stuttered at the sight of him and my body acted on its own. My hand moved over to click on the program and I began watching. I was horrified... but little did I know i was about to have the best experience of my life...Thank you for reading my autobiography, now onto the show. Diddy is a masterpiece of a film. Throughout the roughly hour long movie you're introduced to many of diddy's accompanying characters. My favourite is Ian Smith from Pennsylvania. You're brought along on a journey of discovery with the most beautiful woman in the world. The interviews are mind boggling and really make you feel like one of Diddy's victims. I can't escape the Diddy party. The show also does a great job of making you feel like a freak.Anyways, great show. Please make more like it. Free Diddy. Sending love from Turkmenistan. Goodbye. Have a good night.",False
6,10,Masterpiece...,wrighcar-22120,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh my god. Thats all i said after watching this film. It is a masterpiece only the greatest of directors, actors, and writers could even fathom making. The emotions, the plot, the storytelling. All so amazing. It makes you feel like you are there at the Diddy party. The freak offs feel so real. And The cameo from Drake was awesome. I just LOVE this movie. No, its not a movie, its a work of art, pure art. I recommend this movie to everyone I meet. It has changed my life for the better. Diddy is my mentor in everything now. I now hold my own parties wiith 1000 bottles of baby oil and host freak offs in his name. #SAVEDIDDY.",False
7,n/a,Hmmm,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Is it worth it I hope so Diddy is a weird man yes he is. But at the same time he is human right. No excuses on what he's accused of by any means..... I'm just shocked and lost for words R Kelly's situation definitely won't help this one. Diddy Gona get it way harder then R Kel because everyone should of learned from this also there rich and people are going to think as well as the judge that they think they can do whatever because of the wealth the have. Man o man I just did 2 years in prison and it was a humbleing experience and im thankful for it. God has put me somewhere I learned a lot from.,False
8,10,The Diddler Spoke to Me,katiecollins-77539,n/a,16/08/2025,"When I tell you my life changed once I found this masterpiece. This enlightened me to a new path of diddy's life. I would like to take this moment show my appreciation for the women made of plastic. Her story really spoke to me with the many emotions that she couldn't show. One critique I would have however is the lack of baby oil present within this documentary as I feel it didn't accurately depict the environment of the freak offs. I'm hoping in the next two parts it would showcase this much much more. To quote my quote my favourite interviewee, ""Diddy's story has more holes then a Jamaican shirt"", which honestly really spoke with me on another deeper level.",False

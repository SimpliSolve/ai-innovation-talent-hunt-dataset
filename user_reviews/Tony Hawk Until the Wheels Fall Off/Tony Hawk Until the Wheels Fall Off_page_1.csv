1,9,Gave me chills,mansjo,n/a,16/08/2025,I never write reviews but there hasn't been one yet for this. I got chills at the end and I never get chills in movies. I never even was that big into skating as a kid I eventually realized it wasn't my thing. This documentary is inspiring and one of my favorite movies I have seen this year so far. More people should watch.,False
2,9,"I'm biased, as an old skateboarder, myself.",Erik_Stone,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you don't know what it looks or feels like to drop into a 9 or 12 foot vert, or crash and burn on a 6 foot bowl made of cement, you will still understand what Tony Hawk's life was like, from this documentary.It's very genuine, and tells a great story of one of the best skateboarders, and second generation pioneers of all of skateboarding.",False
3,8,Excellent docu on the one-and-only Tony Hawk,dfloro,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm slightly older than Tony Hawk, and I have never once skateboarded. Why watch this Tony Hawk documentary (or any skateboarding one)? Because I like to watch documentaries about the cultures and subcultures that I'm not a part of, mostly to try to gain a better understanding of them and their adherents. In this very good one from The Duplass Brothers, we get an up-close and almost too-inside look at the cross-cultural and multi-generational skateboarding icon, Tony Hawk. From the earliest footage of youthful, skinny Tony becoming more and more obsessed with the sport as his mother and father express more or less unwavering support, all the way through his amazing pro career, and up until he has a nasty fall and concussion (just one of his nearly countless concussions over the period of nearly 45 years) at a reunion he organized with his skateboard friends and rivals, we see how his non-stop, can-do, never-say-die attitude about perfecting (and in many cases, inventing) his tricks makes him both unmatched in his field, as well as helping also to make him emotionally & psychologically stunted, costing him intimate relationships including with his own children, as he laments here more than once. Like all that he does, he's continuing to work on these things, with his understanding wife and youngest kids. I wish him good luck, especially with these latter goals, but he does need to get a grip before he winds up in permanent traction in the hospital!",True
4,10,I wish I had a friend like Rodney Mullen.,skatin64,n/a,16/08/2025,"Good watch if you're looking to witness: passion, discipline, determination, faith, hope, friendship, love. Confusion, loneliness, myopia.Pretty well done doc. I gave it a 10 because I love Mullen. From my bias, he really stole the show. Layin down wisdom like it's his job. I love how they relate. It feels like they're both on the autism spectrum a little bit; I mention because it's a good thing and interesting.Hawk's kid Riley? Seemed really interesting too. It's a shame there wasn't more of him, but all of the ex-pros were great too.",False
5,10,Goosebumps,yfxkwjhqd,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA hard-hitting, skateboarding epic that hits in all the right places.Not only is this exceptionally edited, but the emotional beats leave you grasping at the true heights that skateboarding once was.I relate so hard to the explanation of how pivotal 99' 900 was. For the first time in sports history, a man went head to head against himself in the world championship in 100 OT.Skateboarding is about overcoming your own roadblocks and proving you can exceed and break your limits. Shout out to those who get how hard it was to finally get that second foot on the board while learning how to kick flip. I had to hold on to a branch of a tree and prop my hands on the washing mashing in my basement as a child to discipline my left foot to get back on the board. It felt like I concurred the world after landing it.Rodney Mullen's final line of dialogue will be something I show my kids.This is a masterpiece.",True
6,10,Full of Heart,brandon-659-681856,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've always had so much admiration for the world of skating even though I've never attempted anything more than turning a corner on a board. Traditional sports are full of excellence and consistence when it comes to performing. Skating takes all that to the next level and adds a level of grit, determination and persistence I could only dream of acquiring.Hawk's story, and in the broader narrative the history of skating, is one of passion so pure it's motivation at the highest level for anyone who's ever wanted to achieve something in their lifetime. The characters the Duplass brothers have assembled here do a phenomenal job rounding out Tony's life and focusing in on true themes of self acceptance, ambition and the human experience through achievement in sport.Critics have complained about the lack of focus on Tony Hawk specifically, but I found this to be so engaging with the broader things of what Tony has valued in the world, allowing others to also put forth their perspectives on his life. Wonderful piece for anyone who's sat on the sidelines like me. Hope to pick up a Pro Skater again to really pump that nostalgia back into my veins.The wheels haven't fallen off yet. Keep riding.",False
7,10,This is what true passion looks like,gustavobuquera,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows what life can be when you find something you love and commit 100% to it. Truly inspiring. Rodney Mullen's comments bring the story to the next level with some amazing insights.As a skateboarder, i watched the whole thing with a huge smile on my face.",False
8,7,Just Skateboard,DLochner,n/a,16/08/2025,"The film shows exactly what you'd expect: a man who has become a successful skateboarder and has made the sport into something he wasn't before. Unfortunately, honor is not included in the relatively boring and straightforward story. Tony Hawk has a lot to tell, but in this film it seems relatively banal. Too bad.",False
9,10,Lucky to witness this in SoCal,dude-97334,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was an awesome an humbling experience to watch Tony evolve during his early years at Del Mar. The Del Mar skate park allowed so many of us to take skateboarding to the next level. Meeting Tony there in the 80s inspired me for a lifetime, and meeting up with him again at the 2010 Olympics (watching Shawn W) inspired a renewed energy. I will always be thankful to have been present to watch him be unbelievable and extraordinary. - Doid.",False
10,10,Excellent documentary,Sasha_Lauren,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a fascinating documentary about the life of Tony Hawk, wunderkind skateboarder extraordinaire. A passionate, persevering pioneer of over 100 tricks, there is a reason he was the National Skateboard Association world champion for twelve years. The film follows Hawk back to childhood with amazing footage of the beginning of his career, his entry into The Bones Brigade, his father's managerial involvement in the sport, early struggles, landing the 900, his success at the X Games, the risks, sheer compulsion, and punishment his body takes, as well as his personal development. This film is so well produced. Tony and his fellow skaters including Stacy Peralta, Duane Peters, Rodney Mullen, Lance Mountain, Mike McGill, Steve Cabellero, and Christian Hosoi and more are interviewed, as well as Hawk's sister and brother. I enjoyed listening to them all, especially his brother, The Bones Brigade founder Peralta, and Rodney Mullen who is mesmerizing to listen to.",False
11,10,Wheels & Broken Bones,nrgigaba,n/a,16/08/2025,"Until The Wheels Fall Off is aptly titled.Its very inspiring seeing a man curve his entire life through something that was a hobby when he was a kid, rise up to then top, give up on it, then go back to it only to lose everything - but never get off those wheels and becomes an icon.If you're looking for a documentary about family, broken bones, and feel good moments. You'll love this documentary.",False
12,10,Inspiracional,allstarspfunk,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is what skate is all about... recently he broke his leg skating, 3 weeks later he was walking to present an Oscar. He just wont quit, he's already skating again because he has set himself to this demo. This Man is is over 50! He should be in the MCU!",False
13,10,Never let it end....,fmonteiro-07790,n/a,16/08/2025,Great to relive the moments...watching the beginning and seeing the toll it took on the body. Commitment to excellence of his craft and maintaining the discipline within his mind.Highly recommend watching and reliving it all over again.,False
14,10,Very interesting and worth watching,webbedfeetharleybabe-792-183458,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerVery poignant documentary. We enjoyed the rawness, grit and determination to succeed and the honest pitfalls of the addiction to perfection that ensued. The best of someone and the sadness of watching someone destroy their physical being. The support from his friends (Stacy Peralta is a wonderful example of a guardian) and family trying to thwart his absolute self destruction. Many lessons to be learned from Tony's story. Great example of how a family should be a supportive family.",True
15,9,an absolute must watch for skaters/fans of skateboarding,stylss,n/a,16/08/2025,"Inspiring, hard-hitting, fascinating, honest, & emotional look at the life of the legend Tony Hawk. This is so well-made, edited, an absolute must watch for skaters/fans of skateboarding.Honestly, the brief moments of Rodney Mullen stole the show for me and I would love to see a similar documentary made about his life. What a gem of a human.",False
16,8,Captivating,mariannasanchez,n/a,16/08/2025,So good. I'm a 90s teen and this was such a heartbreaking and heartwarming view into one of my icons. It was done beautifully and I just wanted to hug him!,False
17,10,Superb documentary,angelanwalker,n/a,16/08/2025,"Took me right back to high school when I used to save up to buy Thrasher magazines and watch Tony Hawk on TV. The documentary is very well done. Great footage, good interviews. It's amazing what the human body can do, and the fact that Tony and the rest of the OG's are STILL skateboarding is insane. Especially when they're in constant pain. This is a must-see!",False
18,9,wonderful retrospective,supersandor,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed watching this doc. I was only ever a half hearted highschool skater, but still found this an inspiring watch. The dedication, the heart, the work...all while enduring being a teenager, which is hard enough on it's own. The old footage is fantastic, and I love the slow build and history of how the sport evolved, died, was revived, died, and on and on. Tricks got bigger, skaters got older and stronger, and the context of the sport changed so much. I learned a ton from this doc. I met Tony in 2010...went to LA to shoot an interview with him, along with a few other celebs, for the olympics. Watching this doc really added context to the interview and the chats we had in the short time we all spent with him, and gave the film even more depth...for me anyway.Honest and moving doc. Great film making.",False
19,10,You don't have to know skateboarding to appreciate this doc,soccertrainy101,n/a,16/08/2025,"Caught about 90% of this movie while my husband was watching it. I know who Tony Hawk is but that's all I knew going in. Don't know skateboarding, don't know the history, and don't know a thing about Tony's life. This was an excellent doc that told an incredible (and devastating) story. As a therapist, I hope those men have good ones.",False
20,10,Brings me back to being 14 in the late 90s.,G-Joshua-Benjamin,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI still remember watching Tony do the 900. I had nobody to talk about it with. Haha But man it was amazing to watch.I have been interested in skating since way back then. I never got into it but I love watching it.This movie lets you see great skates and hear their stories.All the stuff Tony went through. The way he is now. He never gave up. He just kept on going. It's very inspirational.You get to see and hear stuff about his childhood. Then you see him as a young teen starting his life long passion. You hear about the tricks that started when he was first riding and how he tired to learn them.If you like skating then you will like this.I had a skateboard. I was always afraid I would hurt myself. I still remember that when I was a teen I took the wheels off the board and would do tricks in my room. Haha Believe it or not in 03 I had a traumatic brain injury while getting into someones car. It's it funny how you try so hard to stay safe. Things you want to do you talk yourself out of. Then life happens and you survive. Life is a crazy thing.,True
21,10,Hawk is an icon,KOOLAIDBRO,n/a,16/08/2025,"So I am biased on this because growing up Tony Hawk was one of the few people I really looked up to. He changed everything not just in Skateboarding, but in everything with wheels that isn't a car. It's crazy to look back and think about him in Gleaming the Cube and he's still out here doing it today. If you're into Skateboarding or ever was you need to watch this. If you are not and want to watch a good documentary? Go for it. I think you'll like it. It's kind of funny seeing some the people that came before him just angry because he changed the game for the better. The guy is the Michael Jordan of Skateboarding and he seems like he's basically got the same demeanor he's always had. It was refreshing to see.",False
22,9,Great Insight Into Skateboarding's GOAT,deepfrieddodo,n/a,16/08/2025,"A really interesting look into the life and career of Tony Hawk, from outcast kid to global superstar. Hearing from both Hawk himself and key figures from his life and the wider skating community, a holistic view is given of his journey, not shying away from personal difficulties and the perceptions of unwelcoming sections of the culture. These insights can range from the bluntness of fellow and rival skaters of the 80s to the philosophical ramblings of Rodney Mullen.Iconic moments from skateboarding receive great focus, such as the first 900, highlighting the key events within a profession which has fluctuated wildly across the decades.The timeline does jump around a little and certain topics are completely skimmed over, such as the video game series and his many pop culture appearances, but in thay way that does keep it faithful to exploring just the skating in his life.",False
23,8,surprisingly melancholy and heartbreaking,a-Me-with-a-You,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was surprisingly melancholy and heartbreaking. I had expected some fun skater music and vintage footage and there was certainly that, thankfully, but here we get a look at someone skating hours every day because he doesn't know how to be in a family and you get several hearstopping accidents where his skating obsession almost kills him with his fellow skaters and bystanders pleading him to stop.I've liked Sam Jones music documentaries so far too: the Wilco and Jason Isbell documentaries are as intimate as you want a look at a creative person to be. Sam Jones seems to have a way of getting the documentary subject to trust him and let him in behind the shield.",False
24,9,I'm 46 this is a great doc for me.,illusions102,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hawk was the best cause he stayed clean, if the Pappas bro's didnt burn out on drugs etc they woulda beat him at most imo. But as the saying goes its better to burn out than to fade away!",False
25,8,Overall a good documentary...but I have thoughts.,DGPTA,n/a,16/08/2025,"Put simply, this documentary is very pro-Tony Hawk. Obviously, right? Which is cool, since I do believe...yes, even considering one of the top grossing gaming franchises of all time is named after him...a lot of people don't really know what role he REALLY played in the history of skateboarding. So, I get it, and I enjoyed it, and I do recommend it to anyone with any interest in the subject. Good stuff.In short, Until the Wheels Fall Off solves that problem. It covers, extensively, Hawk's influence on skateboarding, and basically WHY he, among so many others, was the one that had the aforementioned game franchise named after him.Having said that...that's pretty much all it does. If you were expecting a documentary to learn more about the REAL Tony Hawk...this ain't it. It touches on some sensitive subjects, but it's more or less just a summation of his role in the skateboarding world...I'm fine with this. I'm not mad. It was cool to see some of the old stock footage from competitions and skate parks, as well as all the interviews with legendary names. But I was hoping to FINALLY learn more about Tony Hawk the person, and not Tony Hawk the skateboarder, since most of this can be learned via a Google search.So, this is basically a cool, nicely done compilation of what you'd find googling ""why is Tony Hawk important to skateboarding,"" but as a documentary.I really only have two complaints. I do wish we learned more about who Tony Hawk is as a person. There are stories out there, and they aren't all glory and dedication, and I think he needs to address these more openly. It's important people know legends can be flawed too. Including his past relationships. Which I OF COURSE understand wanting to be a private issue, none of us have any right to know ""what really happened,"" but, the rumors persist, and this doesn't do much to address them, when I was hoping it would. Understandable, but still a bit disappointing.It does touch on some of his non-skateboarding life, as well as his intensity in training, which by all accounts is VERY intense, and how he clearly has internal struggles that he tried to cover up with skateboarding, as well as his parents.... But it kind of glosses over all of this to focus more on talking about how great of a skateboarder Tony Hawk is. Which is fair, but the title very much suggests this is going to be a deep dive into Tony Hawk, when in reality it's more of just an overall retelling of his career.I also couldn't notice how severely downplayed the Activision games are. Which, on one hand, I get. They're video games. This is a documentary for skateboarders, not gamers. They are briefly mentioned, but when I say briefly, I do mean briefly.That said...And I've said this for years, but I don't think Tony Hawk gives the games enough credit for ""reviving"" skateboarding, which the documentary does admit was a dying sport in the mid to late 90s. It was very underground and nobody outside of the parks really cared about it. Tony Hawk on PlayStation in 1999 changed that completely, and introduced the sport of skateboarding to a broad audience and a whole new generation of kids who then played it, thought it was cool, decided to pick up a skateboard, and are now some of the top skaters in the world.It kind of suggests it was mostly the ""street"" efforts of Tony Hawk that gave skateboarding new life...and I'm just not entirely sure that's true. It definitely is part of it, don't get me wrong. And like, it also is, since the games are named after him...but it almost implies it was through his hard work and dedication to keep competing that skateboarding was able to then grow into an Olympic sport, and as nice as that sounds, it was only a piece of the puzzle. In my opinion.I truly believe the games were a key part of the ""history"" of skateboarding to get it where it is today, and I don't think this documentary appreciates that, even though they do come up and Hawk had a chance to finally do so...but instead more or less said ""I did the motion capture, but had no idea they were so popular. Now, back to me.""Missed opportunity, in my humble opinion.Still, it is a great watch, with TONS of great footage. I absolutely loved the interviews with greats such as Mullens, Caballero, Mountain, McDonald, McGill, Peters, and so many others. I recommend this to pretty much everyone, but especially to those with an interest in skateboarding. It is really well put together, very informative, and has an 'amazing' soundtrackWatch this documentary, but just watch it knowing 95% of it is just the history of Tony Hawk's skateboarding life, which is still a fascinating, highly entertaining, wild ride worthy of its own documentary.PS As another reviewer said...yes, everyone deserves a friend like Rodney Mullens. What a cool dude.",False

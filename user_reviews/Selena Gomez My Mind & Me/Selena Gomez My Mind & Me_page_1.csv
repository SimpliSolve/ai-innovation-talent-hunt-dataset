1,7,"Honest, raw portrayal of the toll of inauthenticity.",not_an_octopus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me is an engaging and engrossing view into the life of a pop culture machine that both nurtures and deprives the protagonist of her most valued need for connection and authentic living. The documentary takes us through Selena's life; from her humble beginnings as a child actor, to her struggle with autoimmune disease at the height of pop stardom, to a mental breakdown that lands her in in-patient treatment.As a mental health professional who also struggles with anxiety and depression, this is one of the most raw and honest depictions of mental health I've ever seen. One of the more poignant themes is how much Selena is affected by being caught up in an existential struggle for authenticity, in which she surrounded by yes men and people who don't appear to have her best interests at heart. There are many poignant moments in the documentary, and I am not a good enough writer to explain them all. I just know that there is something uniquely special on display here.If you struggle with your mental/physical health at all, this is a good documentary to watch to see how our struggles are all essentially the same; that we all struggle with stress and pressure and how we are all at our center living life for moments of connection, peace, and meaning.",False
2,8,A very interesting yet touching documentary,lisafordeay,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerSelena Gomez My Mind and Me is a 2022 documentary based on singer/actress Selena Gomez's life both outside her celeb lifestyle and going in deep about her bipolar and anxiety. The documentary was filmed back in 2016 when Selena was releasing her album Revival and struggling with psychosis (which actually shocked me as I had no idea she suffered with this along with her battle with lupus). We also catch a glimpse of Selena when she was a little girl with her mom Mandy Teffey(who is the splitting image of Selena) and she had her during her high school days at the age of 16 along with her biological dad.If your a massive fan of Selena Gomez do give it a watch.,True
3,8,Compelling,cardsrock,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a tough watch at times, but I appreciated the raw and unfiltered nature. Selena has gone through a lot in her young life and it was fascinating to see an inside look at how she manages it all.The diary entries written over the screen are a bit cheesy, but they provide another means of expression for Selena. There's also a lot of similar ground that's covered in most music documentaries, but the focus on mental health was a nice addition. Hopefully people will have a little more sympathy for famous people who struggle with the same things that normal do too. Obviously they have more means at their disposal, but the pain is the same.",False
4,10,i see Selena as an entirely different person now and it's beautiful,teneption,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was raw. It was emotional. It was honest. I applaud Selena for deciding to speak to the world in this way. I have always admired her for the many things she is and does. This movie took it to a whole new level. I've been battling with my own mental and physical health and knowing that it's gaining more visibility by people, it's becoming a bigger conversation, thankfully to Selena and people with her platform, it means a lot. Mental health pains is not a monster we should hide. What Selena is doing is important and so necessary. Every such conversation is a beat that keeps our hearts alive.",False
5,10,Excellent and touching,NS-reviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I will admit, I cried a few times watching this one. It was heavy and vulnerable in a way I wasn't even entirely prepared for. It was an extremely human documentary, not polished up with anything. Very little, almost no, sit down interviews and commentary about what we're watching unfold. Nobody is spoon feeding us their takes or opinions. We are just watching Selena go through all she went through, learning so much along the way.I've always liked Selena Gomez but I haven't been like her #1 fan. I'm happy to say I've never said one negative thing about her. And I'm glad, because she used this documentary to show why human beings need room to breathe and live their lives, celebrity or not. People have to get to make mistakes, struggle, get back up again, and be respected.Well done to the filmmakers of ""My Mind & Me."" The journal entry readings, the footage chosen, the way it was all left on the table, will all have an impact on me for a long time to come.",False
6,10,"A story out of Darkness into the light, breaks the heart",moviesfilmsreviewsinc,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is a moment in Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me in which it feels like the star's world has cracked wide open, and she's bravely invited viewers to witness what comes next. Both of these things are somewhat true of the Apple TV+ documentary, made about a six-year period in Gomez's life, which focuses on her mental health. But the hour-and-a-half-long film does something curious 20 minutes in, when the singer and actress receives a bipolar disorder diagnosis in 2019, following hospitalization for a psychotic break. Gomez, now 30, tells the viewer that when she first got out, she didn't know how she'd cope with the diagnosis.""I needed to keep learning about it,"" she says. ""I needed to take it day by day.""Then she tenderly recalls a childhood fear of thunderstorms, which could precede a tornado in her native Texas. Recognizing her daughter's terror, Gomez's mother provided her with books about storms, lightning, and thunder. This is paired with touching home video footage of a young Gomez being held in her mother's arms and playing innocently outside as thunder rumbles in the background.""She basically said, 'The more you learn about it, the less you're going to be afraid of it,'"" Gomez remembers. ""And it really helped."" For a moment, it seems like Gomez is poised to let her recovery journey unfold before our eyes, but this is not the film we're given. The intimate documentary shows Gomez in crisis, and yes, her revival, but not much of what happens in between. Though Gomez courageously allows the camera to linger as she weeps over anxious thoughts and stares blankly out the window, perhaps overcome by numbing depression, we never learn what bipolar disorder is, or how it affects her. This is not a criticism of Gomez or the filmmakers inasmuch as it's an attempt to imagine how else a project like this could address mental health in ways that help others, something that Gomez suggests is vitally important to her. What Gomez offers to viewers instead is profound reassurance that they're not alone with their pain. The genuine compassion she shows two young women who've attempted or contemplated suicide are standout scenes, not only because she recognizes their suffering, but also because she embraces them without judgment or shame. If only a fraction of viewers model the empathy she displays, Gomez may indeed fulfill her hope of saving lives.",False
7,10,Wow such an open look into Selena's life,khkelly-79758,n/a,16/08/2025,"Selena's documentary had me hooked from the beginning. I love how open and honest she was about her internal struggles with her health, fame, philanthropy and mental health. I think what makes this so special is that her thoughts are so relatable. The documentary makes you, the viewer, feel like you a friend on her journey.I've always been a Selena Gomez fan and this experience just confirmed why she is one of my favorite celebrities. The future of fame is vulnerability and Selena is a leader in bringing authenticity back in all walks of life. I highly recommend everyone to give this watch even if you don't know her or not a fan.",False
8,2,Nothing new- maybe even more narcissism,michellerandi,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm tired of celebrities saying they don't want to be famous when they clearly have enough money for them to retire. Selena has good intentions when it comes to trying to express herself and her mental struggles but fails at giving any context to anything. It was just her crying in different locations. I can tell she's working on herself but also loves being a victim, it's her identity.The doc feels unfocused and all over the place. For 6 years of filming we got very little insight and so many questions remain: her career with Disney? Her relationship with Justin? Her organ donor wasn't mentioned at all. Her relationship with her own body?It remained on a surface level and it felt too whiny. A bit of savior complex too. Just proved that even though she's a good person and a smart girl, she's out of touch with reality and lives in her own privileged bubble.",False
9,10,Fight against my eyes can't see!,snehaselvam-09577,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a victim of Mental demon, This documentary tells more than explanation and imagination. Mental illness is so cruel, if you have physical problems with that...i can't even imagine that! She's so strong after all this. I always proud myself for being alive, in her case I feel more than that. She use her position rightfully to speak and support to millions for making all strong by saying YOU'RE NOT ALONE!The song itself broke anyone. Nov 3 eve 6pm(India) I heard for the 1st time in my bed...immediately my mind rewinding my past 2 years of dark times and never stop that song for 6 hours and cry endlessly throughout that time. It's my honest review people!I just say THANK YOU SO SO MUCH to do that‚ù§",False
10,10,Life changing and vulnerable,viggoped-26934,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a fan of Selena ever since she was on Wizards, to see her grow, to see her glow, and to see her so vulnerable, so humble, so human is amazing, and really hard at the same time. I've never met her, but I kind of feel like I know her even better now, she is and will always be my idol, and biggest hero in this world. I'm so proud of her, and I love her unconditionally, not only is this the most unique documentary of a celebrity, it is also something that can really have a great impact on young people who's going through this. I cried during the entire movie, I'm so moved and relieved that you've shed some light of how big an enemy your mind can actually be! Nothing but love for her, and this amazing docu. If you ever see this Selena, know that what you do every day, and for everyone is lifechanging. You ARE good enough, and you desserve the entire world. Love you so much.",False
11,10,"The most humble, nice and carrying celebrity I've seen",rotaruirina,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe most humble, nice and carrying celebrity I've seen. It makes you sad to see what she has to go through, medically speaking, but it also makes you wonder what's going on with the people she surrounds herself with. Saw the documentary and apart from her cousin and mother, none of them give you the impression they're really connecting with her. When she was being angry about the interview in London, they were all nodding, none was saying what he/she was really thinking like they were afraid to say something. It feels like they're afraid to lose their job so they just support her in doing things that at this point in her life don't make her happy. An hour and a half and you can only see happiness in her eyes when she's visiting her childhood places or Kenya. What do these 2 places have in common? Simple people, simple things, no glamour, nature. This is what she needs to get better, not boring interviews, not promos, not fashion shows, etc.",True
12,8,Soul baring journey through the darkness of fame...,DukeEman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Welcome to Selena's mind; the uncertainty of her reality; the negativity of her existence as an artist; and the pain from health issues that also impacts her mental state of being. All bared in this observational documentary with private access to all areas of her life.This is a soul baring journey through the darkness of fame, where your purpose in life diminishes and privacy is nonexistent. It is all smiles for the annoying paparazzi, adoring fans and silly questions from so-called journalists. Selena's state of mind was already in the darkness, but all of this just pushed it further down the rabbit hole toward the mad hatter's party.An impactful and assuring piece on mental health, revealing that not all is immune to it, even the famous and creative fall victim, and fight the same battle within.",False
13,3,A documentary of missed opportunities,xgrxqj,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerWas a very raw and open hearted documentary and drew a lot of attention to important subjects of mental health and Selena's work with WE.However.It just felt like the documentary wasn't flowing. You could lose half of it because it was just Selena crying and feeling sorry for herself and telling us information that we already know. Nothing in the documentary is new information.I wouldn't loved for her to start off with how her career began what that led to just a chronological order to her life. She barely skims the surface of a lot of topics.Her career with Disney? What is the lasting impact now? Why does it trigger her?Her relationship with her body? I'd love for her to sit in front of a campers and be straight.Her lupus diagnosis how has that affected her? Same with her bipolar disorder I don't just want to see it I want her to talk us through and her personal experience with it. We saw clips of her getting her BP and being in hospital but we never really understood what was happen ring in her mind just the people around her.Her kidney transplant - was expecting a deeper dive into this and her relationship with Francia.Feel like this documentary was definitely a 'feel sorry for me' which is disappointing because I feel like Selena could definitely shift the narrative of the way people view in this documentary but she hasn't.,True
14,10,Always A selenator,nikhil-29819,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just finished watching the first documentary I ever watched in my life... and as said the first ones are always special
This documentary was so much deep and I just fell in love with her honesty and how she is not afraid to show her emotions.After every problems the life made her face, she rose up stronger than ever and with better perspective towards life
She had to face so much in life yet she is believes in giving , loving and helping people and is very noble and kind to all
Felt like yeah you're one of us common guys too...
I love you Selena (no matter what)
You are my inspiration , My role model , My love
Always with you Sel
Love from India.Your Fan.",False
15,10,Brave,pdyqqn,n/a,16/08/2025,I've always admired any person who acknowledges their mental health issues especially if they go and seek help and accept their diagnosis. I really like Serena. She is charismatic talented and so genuinely empathetic. I liked this documentary however the producer Pascalle I disliked tremendously. I thought she treated Selena as a child and had no comprehension of her at all. Sorry but needed to say this. This woman in my opinion needs to know how she came across in this documentary.It's so easy to criticise others online. I understand that. However perhaps just don't use Pascalle in future shows.,False
16,8,This is excellent!,UniqueParticle,n/a,16/08/2025,"I probably could've watched much sooner happy to regardless since it's nominated and I didn't know so much of what Selena Gomez has experienced except depression, I can't imagine what Lupuis is like I'm so glad Selena stays strong! I love Selena she's wonderful and great that gets so much support not enough famous people do I imagine. Raquel seems great I didn't know of her before this. The stigma of everything must be overwhelming it's always impressive how well anyone handles it all. I know more of the films and shows than the music id probably enjoy a lot of them after this id appreciate them more for sure.",False
17,10,Unbelievably touching and real,shalinipriya-46237,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would start by saying that this doc is a must watch for everyone. Thank you Selena Gomez for keeping it so real and sharing your story. Mental health isn't a fully understood issue and people, including self tend to take it lightly. This story signifies recognising ones feelings, to be able to take the first step towards helping oneself. This story will take you through the ups ans downs of life and the real takeaway it sailing through life and taking it head on. Full blown love and more power to Selena Gomez to share her vulnerabilities around physical and mental health. Must must watch! Only love to S!",False
18,3,It could have been so much more...,KCX12,n/a,16/08/2025,"This could have been really powerful, advocating for and shining a light on mental health, but instead it's a 90-minute promo for Selena's work and fails to scratch the surface of the issues that affect mental well-being. While I do not for a second doubt Selena's personal struggles - no one would want their child to grow up in the spotlight of fame - the people who controlled and edited this film have failed in her purpose to address a huge crisis and instead turned this into promoting the artist who pays their bills. Shame on them and a shame it missed its mark. I think it's just one for the fans.",False
19,10,Selena.,AnnaPagrati,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ah, I literally love this woman so much. No matter how many years, how many struggles, changes, happy moments, sad moments, no matter how much life is getting in the way, she is still this miracle of a human being. She is literally a role model. Using everything in her power to help as much as she can I'm every way. Such an interesting documentary, showing so many parts of her that we wouldn't have seen otherwise. All the songs, interviews, ups & downs, relationships & most of all, at least a really small fraction of this amazing woman's mind. As someone that has loved Selena since she was a little girl, and so was me, I have to say, I loved this so much!",False
20,10,I love you Selena Gomez,sdnrm,n/a,16/08/2025,Nobody's genuinely perfect and that's okay cuz we're a human. Please remember this that you're enough. There's a lot of evil people around you but you have to protect yourself and know how to do it. I could see you're just like us just living other world industry but you're not an evil one. Please choose your friends who really support you. If you have a good psychics please go see them. This movie really inspires me I wish it had more. Wanted to see more about a drama with Justin tho. She's very mature that didn't contain him much. We all wanted to know more about it Sele. Hope you're doing great and let those bad friends affect you in any way.SENDING YOU A LOTS OF LOVE.,False
21,9,So inspiring,aarontimmonds,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having personally navigated mental health challenges, I found this account exceptionally motivational. It has sparked in me a renewed admiration for her, as she displays immense courage in using her influential position to effect positive change globally. By embracing her platform, she is committed to raising awareness and championing mental health causes.Her candidness in discussing her experiences is praiseworthy, serving as an inspiration for those grappling with similar issues. Through her advocacy, she helps dismantle stigma and fosters understanding. She exemplifies how personal growth and resilience can triumph over adversity, and her dedication to social responsibility is a powerful reminder that we all have the potential to contribute to a better world.",False
22,8,Powerful and emotional !!,cbagane,n/a,16/08/2025,I've been a fan of Selena Gomez since her Disney days it was nice seeing latino representation on tv and she's also a cancer like me so she reminds me a lot of myself. I loved how honest she was in this documentary it's not ego driven or about money. It's about her sharing her struggles to help others and make them feel less alone and she did just that! I'm so inspired and I hope this helps others too. I've noticed a lot of young people more depressed after the lockdown and this is very necessary right now. This movie made me cry and inspired me so much it makes me want to be better and help others too. Thank u for this gift Selena u are truly an angel on earth.,False
23,1,Just no,SBarragan1979,n/a,16/08/2025,"I get what she was trying to do with putting it all out there (the good, the bad, the ugly), but it could have been an hour shorter and still arrived at the same point. I read all the reviews about it being real and raw, and it certainly is, but over 90 minutes of her crying...it just got to be too repetitive. I hope she finds what she needs to be fulfilled and at peace (truly) but please don't make another one of these ""I am enough"" documentaries. She goes through her history, her childhood, tries to explain her difficulties with her diagnoses, etc. We get it, life is journey, you're not giving us anything we don't already know.",False
24,n/a,Just wow,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,The insight she gave us into a very small but insanely personal part of her life is so inspiring and heartbreaking at the same time. The relatability to her due to her mental health and also to her friend and family is so honest and real. Having close people struggle with their mental health journey and all the things that come with being a friend that so much wants the struggling person to see how great they are but also recognizing the pain they are going through is a very complex feeling. Especially concerning the suicidal thoughts. It is very hard to watch but at the same time all you want is to support the person.I love how raw she got not just soley with her career but her hopes and lupus and connections and drive and especially her mental health. She truly is a great role model to have and particularly the openness make her fully understandable and therefore likeable.Everyone did such a great job. Thank you for sharing this story with us.,False
25,10,Selena is a queen,rezanabeel,n/a,16/08/2025,Best thing ever. Selena again proved that she is a queen and she deserves all the good things in the world. The shameless jobless haters can gth because selena will always keep on winning. She is an angel and the best human being ever. This documentary showcases perfectly what an amazing person she is. People been saying she is angry here and fights will raquelle lol that fight was for 30 seconds out of the entire movie and of course she can be angry when bs people throw hate at her for no reason so you useless worthless haters are actually the main reason for her anger so f yourself and get an actual job.,False

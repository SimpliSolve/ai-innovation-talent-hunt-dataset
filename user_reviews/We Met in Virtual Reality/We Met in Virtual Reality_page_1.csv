1,5,This is a documentary? Fooled me!,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""We Met In Virtual Reality"" (2022 release; 91 min) opens, the movie screen informs us that ""The journey began in December, 2020."" We watch people in a bar, then at a Community Meeting of some sort. We meet Jenny, who is teaching in a most deaf community. Ray, deaf herself, also teaches there. At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this movie is the debut of writer-director Joe Hurting. Here he gives us a glimpse into the virtual world where people, using avatars, interact with other people (also using avatars of course). What really threw me for a loop is that this is supposedly a documentary but it never left like a documentary to me. Instead it feels like a very scripted and highly stylistic look at today's dating scene as it plays out on-line and in other virtual settings. I must give Hurting props for the unusual visuals that he brings this in. But also strangely off-putting. When a male avatar asks a female avatar: ""will you marry me in VRChat?"" and she says ""yes"", it felt a little weird for me. Bottom line: I was quite confused by this movie experience and didn't know what all to make of it, to be honest.""We Met in Virtual Reality"" premiered at this year's Sundance to positive buzz, and the movie is currently rated 96% Certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. The movie started streaming on HBO Max last week and I couldn't wait to check it out. Alas, it was not the movie that I expected, and in fact I just felt confused. Regardless, if you are interested in what life is like in virtual reality, I'd encourage you to check it out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
2,6,Fun but Superficial,alexa2022sd,n/a,16/08/2025,This film was created entirely inside the VRChat platform. It's a neat enough gimmick but maybe not for 90 minutes? I've seen other documentaries about virtual worlds so this one didn't feel that new to me. I admit that if I didn't grow up online then I might like this more. But the film does capture something real about this virtual culture.One thing that's very impressive about this movie is that the filmmaker (Joe Hunting) is only 22 and already showing a feature at Sundance. Looking forward to seeing what his long career brings as he moves beyond the festival scene.,False
3,7,A surreal film that left me thinking about what's real anyhow,TheVictoriousV,n/a,16/08/2025,"We Met in Virtual Reality is a documentary (i.e., a movie format that concerns real life) shot entirely within a made-up world. More importantly, it focuses on the connections we discover via the World Wide Web when the physical world fails us -- and no, it's not from the vantage point of a scrutinizing old fart this time.There's a certain wave of films that seem to be emerging as Millennials (and some of the older Zoomers, depending on which scholar you ask) are growing old enough to tell tales of their own; no longer are these concepts treated with the same out-of-touch Boomerism as an Unfriended sequel or a cartoon based entirely around emojis. With pictures like Feels Good Man, We're All Going to the World's Fair, and now this, we can tell that life in the age of memes and social media is being depicted by those who truly lived it. (I feel similarly about the writing of Millennial dialogue in new shows like Harley Quinn and Tuca & Bertie, but will talk more about that in a future post.)Obviously, this film is made even more relevant by the fact that it focuses on virtual reality in the post-COVID world. Much like Among Us, Jackbox, and Discord, the game VRChat rose to major popularity during the early days of the pandemic and became the go-to place for many.For those not in the know, VRChat is essentially a more advanced version of Second Life; the sort of virtual platform that Ready Player One tried and failed to envision -- and the kind that Neal Stephenson ""warned"" about in his 1991 novel Snow Crash (which Mark Zuckerberg, ominously, also borrowed the term ""Metaverse"" from), albeit with even zanier avatars than anything he described in that book. The anime girls with questionable jiggle physics are among the most common, but a crudely modeled Kermit the Frog and Ugandan Knuckles aren't out of the question. I called it a ""game"" before but really, it's a place to just hang out and, in lieu of any strict ""gaming"" activities, simply interact with people. (One Letterboxd user quipped that even in VR you can't go to a party without some dude whipping out his acoustic guitar.)The film jumps back and forth between a number of figures, including a person running a VR dance class and another who teaches a group of fellow users sign language -- that is, ""to do so with the mobility limitations of their digital incarnations"", to quote Carlos Aguilar's summary. Another storyline concerns a romance blossoming between users DragonHeart and IsYourBoy, who have never once met each other in real life, culminating in a wedding where the attendees' avatars visibly weep. It is a surreal movie to behold, and I'm hoping to see a behind-the-scenes special on how they achieved this authentically documentary-esque camera work.Many essays have been written about virtual reality as a new sort of spiritual experience. Are these strange avatars/personae -- unbound by the expectations/demands of conventional society and even the laws of physics -- a closer representation of who these people ""truly"" are than their IRL bodies? Is it fair to say this new dimension is more ""real"" than the transcendence we try to achieve through hallucinogens, meditation, and mumbo-jumbo about ""souls"" from a religion or New Age blog of your choice? Or is it simply an addictive affirmation of our delusion and escapism? Perhaps both sides are onto something (recall that even Black Mirror occasionally has a hopeful view of VR).What of the future? How will this film be regarded in terms of prescience in a few decades? What other layers of expression and interaction are there to explore? Will these avatars, in turn, start programming their own virtual realities and make movies within those?Obviously, not everyone is intrigued by all this. Some critics, including Aguilar, have noted that writer-director Joe Hunting probably needed to focus more on the negative aspects of VRChat and how its creation allowed for a whole new type of bullying and harassment. I feel like we already know of that side of digital-age interaction quite well. Oftentimes, it is represented by those aforementioned skeptical Boomers and out-of-touch ""message movies"" like Cyberbu//y, but that doesn't mean it's invalid. It's just that we could do with some films that elucidate the positives: the life-saving capacity of online community in an age of isolation.More than anything else, however, We Met in Virtual Reality is a love story; one that explores how the connections some people make via wires and computer-generated images are more meaningful than the ones they find in reality. It's up to you, then, if you want to find this movie beautiful -- even spiritual -- or horrifying.",False
4,7,Good introduction to VR Chat for newbs like me,trinaboice,n/a,16/08/2025,"IN A NUTSHELL:
I was excited to watch this movie to learn a little bit more about virtual reality. One of my sons is a 3D computer animation artist for a popular video game company and he is very interested in VR. Every time he comes to visit us from out of state, he brings all of his VR equipment so we can play his fun games. I've even walked the streets of various cities around the world in virtual reality. It's mind-blowing how detailed the technology has gotten. He's currently designing some ""characters"" that will soon be for sale in virtual reality stores. He's extremely talented and so I know he's going to have a lucrative side hustle. I'll let you know as soon as they're available for sale!But when it comes to hanging out in a VR chat room, I've never done that, so I was curious to see what it was like. This interesting documentary allows you to experience the environment and understand why it is so appealing to thousands of players around the world.THINGS I LIKED:
How awesome is it that someone can create a movie in their bedroom by filming clips of virtual reality encounters?The scenes take us to many different kinds of locations in virtual reality. We get to ride in a bumpy car, look out over beautiful landscapes, feel the vibes in a dance club, learn skills in various classes, be there when a guy proposes to a girl, attend a wedding, and more!There are some very touching moments of honest connection and genuine support as people go through some of life's big experiences.You really get a sense that people are truly making friends all over the world and meeting people they would have never had the opportunity to get to know in any other way.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
In terms of classic storytelling, the movie doesn't follow the successful pattern at all.It might have been nice to explain to newbs like me how the virtual reality chat rooms work at the beginning of the movie. The first few scenes can be a bit jarring and confusing for viewers who have never been in VR before.I wanted to hear more about the first time the featured couple got to meet each other in real life. For example, did they physically look like they had imagined one another?Sometimes, the technology is glitchy. I'm sure it will just continue to improve every year.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
LOTS of female characters in very sexy clothing with tons of skin and cleavage shown.Talk of gender identity
Talk of suicide and depression

Connection
Romance
Sign language

5,7,Never thought a VR type filmmaking would exist until now.,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at the 2022 Sundance Film FestivalUsually movies about the modern digital media, the internet and social media tends to fall flat because many movies either don't simply understand how the internet works and how the modern media age goes by. Very few movies like Searching, Feels Good Man and The Mitchells vs. The Machines actually understands how the internet works and how modern digital media goes on. Director Joe Hunting clearly knows how VR works and this documentary did surprise me.Filled entirely inside the VRChat platform, it never once felt boring or uninteresting as there were many different and interesting discussions about how people are able to connect with each through the virtual worlds. Especially during the pandemic and how it had a major impact on this certain individuals. Hunting was able to capture the realism about how people go on their days through VR and he was able to bring many interesting insights about this topic. It's definitely not a perfect documentary as there were some technical moments that could be improved throughout and it did feel a little too long. About 10 or 15 minutes of the film could have been trimmed.I believe even if you didn't grow up through the online years or digital years, you will still be able to get something out from this. Being someone who grew up with the internet surrounding me, I was able to connect with the movie personally. I recommend this and I do look forward what director Joe Hunting would do in the future.Rating: B+",False
6,6,"Eye magnet for the first ten minutes... then, zzzzz",wvmotown,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fresh and tasty... but so is the #3 combo at Wendys...

7,3,An interesting concept without a story,lasher-michael-p,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a film, it doesn't really work. I found myself wondering what the underlying message the filmmaker was trying to send, but ultimately it came across to me as a clip show of a few people playing in a VR world. Much like watching someone else play a videogame, I found my interest waning about halfway through, so maybe there was a grand conclusion I missed; it just wasn't compelling enough to grab my interest.Credit where credit is due, though. It was a creative use of time during the height of the pandemic.",False
8,10,"A Beautiful, thoughtful Ode to love and technology",Roseplayer450,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film was so touching, the care that Joe Hunting had for his subjects is so tangible. This film could of easily portrayed this world as a strange, scary place full of creeps. But instead it lingers on the beauty, love, and tenderness of the space. Each of the subjects speak with so much maturity, openness, and respect. I walked away from the film feeling immersed in a new world, full of amazing new friends.I can understand why this film may of not landed with some, but I personally felt inspired and uplifted by this documentary. It is definitely on the slow side at times, and does not have a large, overarching story that most films follow. But that was what the film is about, its about just being with these people, in this time, learning about their lives when all of us were struggling IRL.I would give this a watch, for sure, just keep an open mind.",False
9,7,"Good Documentary, Confusing Pacing",Wunder_Wulfe,n/a,16/08/2025,"While this movie does approach and go through several different facets on VRChat's take of the metaverse and its own culture surrounding exploration and socialization, it ends up having a couple of strong points, yet a lot of moments where it falls flat.Scores where I base my rating:
G:GOOD, B:BADG1. Explores topics like depression, love, freedom of expression, and contains information to explain how VR affects these feelings and situations.B1: Sometimes speeds straight through some of these moments, not allowing them to fully evolve and be understood by the viewer, often cutting to something else shortly after.G2: Great variety in users and situations, with a lot of them being quite relatable and casual with a sense of truly being ""live action"" and unscripted.B2: Pacing was often difficult to follow, always cutting to long segments of content that catches the viewer off guard, made further disorienting by jumping between different people with almost no meaningful transition.G3: Shows how the culture of Virtual Reality is so similar yet so different from both the real world experience and the internet chatroom experience, as well as how immersive it may be to nearly physically be present in a room full of other people, and how their personalities are reflected.B3: Fails to explain a lot about virtual reality, including but not limited to: What certain VR jargon refers to (""Full Body,"" ""Avatar/Skin,"" ""Instance/World,"" ...), how VR works (controllers, body trackers, headset), how virtual characters in game are all actual people, how their movements are replicated into the virtual world, and what people are doing in the real world when they are doing something in the virtual world. This is where a majority of the audience may get lost, often having no prior background into the VR culture or concepts.G4: I have met the director in VR prior to and after the creation of this title, and have had a few conversations with them as well as have watched their prior videos. They seem very passionate about their projects and filmmaking, so I will give them somewhat of a pass for some beginner mistakes as well as some praise for a lot of good cinematography, and hope to see their future works as they develop their cinematic portfolio.B4: On the flipside, I feel like they focus too hard on aspects that are already very well known to the VR community and its players, yet present the information as if it is made for that audience. I feel like a movie like this should be designed for an audience of people who don't fully and truly understand virtual reality to be able to connect with players and relate to their lives, eventually leaving with more knowledge about how people ""met in virtual reality,"" rather than ignoring most of the ""virtual reality"" in exchange for focus on only the players within it.Overall, I hope to see a lot of improvement in the director's future works, as well as the continuation of projects like these and similar, because there is not a whole lot out there that really explores both the positive and negative sides of what a metaverse truly has to offer, and how the concept of socializing within virtual reality is not as alien as some may seem.",False
10,1,Gen Z discovers the Second life - 19 years later,Martha_P,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really tried but I don't see anything interesting or new here.Virtual realities existed many years ago and people used them massively, just like here. Nothing revolutionary or special about virtual weddings, communities, etc.""We met in Virtual Reality"" is just endless, boring display of a new generation discovering living in an avatar world. While there is absolutely nothing wrong with playing in virtual worlds (as long as one does not break any laws, of course), I don't see a point of making this movie, and it amazes me that it qualified for Sundance.So, move on, nothing to see here.",False
11,10,Shows the Potential of Social VR Platforms,herobrinexforeva,n/a,16/08/2025,"The people in this movie are real and their stories too which calls into my mind a question of just how many other people actually get to experience this incredible and idealized version of social VR. VRChat as a platform has a 24-hour peak of 24,000 players (according to steamchart). No other social VR game has that player count on the market. And as such the experiences one has in vrchat are variable to say the least. Joining any populated public world will expose you to the wild and unhindered vulgarity of human interactions. Kids screaming and obscenities thrown every five seconds from every direction. This is a far-cry from what the film tries to portray. But every once and awhile, you find a diamond in in a trough and suddenly you're talking to someone half way across the globe about their lives, how things are in their country, their interests and hobbies; and you start relating to them as a fellow human being. Added with the almost freeing expressiveness of virtual reality that no flat screen monitor or cellphone screen can compare to, it's almost mind-boggling how far technology has come. Such is the potential for social VR. We Met in Virtual Reality is not so much the true form of the ""reality"" of VRChat, but more so the potential of it. The quality of one's interactions in the virtual space seems to be one centered on the quality of the person(s). And the basic principle of ""treat others the way you wish to be treated yourself"" holds true even in a virtual environment.",False
12,1,A Waste Of Your Time/Superficial,Ceelou,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not sure how this even got nominated for an award, but watched it anyways, knowing it wasn't going to be that great and wouldn't portray how VRChat truly is. Doesn't speak about any of the dark side of the game that represents a big majority of the game.I also don't see this as more than just an advertisement for the game itself.Living in a virtual world is nothing new. People have been doing this for over five years now.VRChat has been around since 2014, and I was one of the first people to play it. Other titles such as Second Life, I was very active in, and once VRChat came out, I gave it a try and still sometimes play it to this day with friends.This just screams ""following the lives of two 'e-girls' on VRChat""To those watching that haven't played the game before, just know that you're seeing a false reality being portrayed here in this movie.",False
13,1,Just an advertisement for VR communities,cityofsn,n/a,16/08/2025,No plot. No underlying message. Nothing to remember or get out of this movie. It's literally like watching an interactive chat room for 90mins. It's just an advertisement meant to give the appearance of a movie.,False
14,9,Gives me hope,theclintdavis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very refreshing to see a doc that doesn't involve a homicide or general destruction of something precious. If you open your mind before watching this film, you'll come away inspired.It takes us into a nascent world that few in the mainstream would otherwise see and never once is the audience held above the subjects. They and this world they have helped create are treated with the utmost respect and we meet them entirely on their terms, which is another thing that separates this from most documentaries. There's also some real filmmaking muscle on display here, particularly in the establishing shots, general framing of shots and the subtle way exposition is handled.I was completely fascinated and greatly moved in several parts. This film gave me hope for humanity that I hadn't felt in a minute.",False

A whole film entirely set in VRChat that's airing on a big network like HBO sounds neat...but I can't think of such an embarrassing and cringe way this whole documentary is handled.We Live in Virtual Reality tries to pull your heart strings and make you feel sympathy towards these people, but it fails horribly because these people are talking about their issues and hardships while they're in anime and furry skins, the whole thing about gender identity being discussed by a hot dog is just absurd and ridiculous to the point it's laughable, when that's not even supposed to be funny.This is on HBO, this is on the same network as critically acclaimed programming like Barry, The Last of Us, The Sopranos, Curb Your Enthusiasm, all such high tier programming and some of the best of all time, and for this to be on the same channel as those is hilarious.Good for these people who are doing ok and doing good things for the world or themselves, but oh god please do not ever be in a part of something like this ever again.One of the worst documentaries I've ever seen.",True

19,10,We Met in Virtual Reality: A Captivating Film Showcasing the Transformative Power of VR and the Positive Impact of Online Communities,endasil-14885,n/a,16/08/2025,"""I recently watched ""We Met in Virtual Reality"" with a friend and was truly captivated by its beauty. My friend and I were both mesmerized and didn't want it to end.This film presents a breathtaking portrayal of VR Chat that defies my previous assumptions of the platform. Instead of the chaotic and juvenile environment I had initially encountered, the film showcases the platform's potential for authentic connection and meaningful relationships. It is a refreshing and inspiring representation of the positive impact that online communities can have on people's lives.As someone who is excited about the future of technology, I believe that virtual reality is a fascinating area that will continue to grow and evolve in exciting ways. This film is an excellent example of the transformative power of VR and its ability to create a sense of presence and connection that transcends physical distance. It highlights the potential for virtual reality to foster empathy, understanding, and genuine human connection.Overall, I highly recommend ""We Met in Virtual Reality"" as an excellent film that celebrates the possibilities of VR and the positive impact that technology can have on our lives.""",False

They refuse to accept reality, instead choosing to hide away like disgusting little socially inadept losers. It is truly a horrific viewing experience to watch these young people willingly throw their lives away to play pretend with other like-minded losers. A world where this is accepted is a world where we have failed, these people have been failed by everyone around them and now they can longer function as normal, healthy people.

23,5,It's okay but...,Snootz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having been a creator in virtual worlds of one form or another since 2,000... I understand the community, concept, and draw of these worlds. While I found the concept of VR Chat somewhat interesting, I got the feeling that there is a lot more to this world than was touched on in this film.To me, that was it's greatest letdown. It is like being given a 5 minute glimpse into a 3 hour opera. It's hardly representative of the world. It's okay to see the experience of individuals on this world, but that doesn't mean we wish to see the same person's experience over and over again. After the first trip to the Helping Hands classroom, I felt no particular need or desire to attend another six sessions of the same environment. Surely there's something else in this world to present to the audience.There were moments that were touching, parts that were funny, and parts that were somewhat mysterious (such as the Ghost Club-- so mysterious there was almost no information). The variety of avatars was interesting-- and for me one of the highlights of the film.

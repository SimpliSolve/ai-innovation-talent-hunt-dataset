1,5,Could've been better!,francoischristana,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have to admit that this Netflix special left me feeling let down. After watching him go viral for spilling all the tea during his Club Shay Shay interview, which attracted attention from all around the world, I expected more secrets to be revealed. Although Kat made a lot of noise about telling the truth, he stayed safe. We look on him to be honest, forthright, and to speak up when others would be too scared to. I really liked how he addressed several significant issues, such as the Alabama riverboat fight, black people receiving reparations, and self-belief. Although it was educational overall, it was not humorous enough to qualify as a comedy.",False
2,2,"I don't have an issue with the material, it's just not funny.",tontogringo,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love Katt Williams, and his material in this one is entertaining, but unfortunately, it's just not funny. It's not offensive or anything. It's just like watching someone speak for an hour. It's an entertaining talk from a motivational speaker, but again... It's just not laughable material.Maybe if you're going into this with the expectation that you're going to be watching a motivational speaker, instead of a comedy show, you'll appreciate it more. However, we went into it expecting Katt Williams comedy genius, and it just didn't meet those expectations this time. From a motivational speaker standpoint, this would be a 6 or 7, but from a standup comedy special, it's just a 2. Sorry Katt.",False
3,1,Unfunny,gdcdxgwy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Let me be clear that I hold no grievances against any of the subjects Katt Williams tackled in this special. However, the primary issue lies in its profound absence of humor. Throughout the entirety of the performance, not a single moment elicited genuine laughter from me. It was exceptionally uncomfortable to gather my family around the television, eagerly anticipating uproarious laughter from one of the comedy greats, only to be met with disappointment as it became evident that he had seemingly lost his once-remarkable ability to amuse us. Witnessing such a decline in comedic brilliance is truly disheartening and leaves one longing for the days when his comedic genius effortlessly brought joy and laughter to our lives. Time to hang it up, Katy.",False
4,1,wanted to love this but.... (yawn),michelle-birdsell,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was looking forward to this after all the hype, and hoped it would be raw, honest comedy, without the constant need to self-censor so as not to offend our ever more fragile society, but this was so boring I couldn't even stay focused. I truly enjoyed his viral online interview, and as much as he talked about how clever he is, I was expecting to have a grand time. Dave Chapell and Ricky Gervais both managed to have me nodding my head and laughing, but not this drivel.There was no humor here at all, and not even any new or interesting social commentary. Just a man on stage talking to hear himself talk. I lasted maybe 20 minutes.",False
5,7,Katt Williams being Katt Williams,martinvonmartian-39437,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI am not the biggest fan of Katt Williams's style of comedy, but it was entertaining.I cringed a little at the almost boomer tier jokes and showing a 10+ year old news story of a blind kid and he really shouldnt have used that, because it takes the flow out of the show, but luckily he didnt just use it for a cheap laugh and continued on this topic for a couple minutes until he went to the next and so on.I was entertained enough to finish the full hour, you might not be, but I like characters and boy is Katt Williams a character. Sometimes I can't tell if he is putting on an act or if he is genuinely this unhinged, either way he is funny enough to keep me listening and watching.TL;DR if you have an hour to waste, put this on and laugh for a bit.",True
6,2,Laughless Lament,xanndy-79589,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anticipating Katt Williams' latest Netflix special with fervent enthusiasm, I found myself profoundly disheartened by its underwhelming presentation. Despite the lofty anticipation stoked by his esteemed reputation and recent viral interview, the performance failed to enrapture. Throughout its duration, a pervasive sense of ennui overshadowed the experience, leaving me yearning for genuine laughter that never materialized. His once-celebrated jokes, renowned for their acerbic wit and penetrating insight, now felt contrived and bereft of authenticity.As someone who appreciates comedy and is not easily perturbed by controversial humor, I eagerly anticipated an evening of unbridled amusement. Alas, these aspirations were shattered by the disillusionment of an offering that fell tragically short of its promised brilliance. The dearth of his characteristic industry scrutiny left me yearning for more than mere laughter; I longed for the profound discourse intertwined with his inimitable humor. Regrettably, I must confess that I did not even finish watching the special, such was the extent of my disappointment.",False
7,1,Just terrible,braxtonanrileysmom,n/a,15/08/2025,Katt Williams has been one of my favorite comedians since I was a teenager. This was not funny at all. I didn't laugh once and he has become a race baiter. He makes everything about race. He used to at least laugh about all races not he just goes against one. While he sits in his mansion not knowing a thing about racism. What a joke this was! Netflix should be ashamed too. Just because of who he is. It isn't good. I was very disappointed and upset how he made me feel watching it because of his racial division. Enough is enough and it's getting quite old. Come up with some new material if you have any that doesn't involve stating false information that isn't even true.,False
8,10,Hilarious and Great Story Telling,jerrellanderson,n/a,15/08/2025,"I mean, Katt Williams is definitely super funny! I mean, I just love his comedic timing and body language. It's always amazing to see. A lot of stuff is very, very funny in here, but I can also see how a lot of people probably won't like this as much! But there are a lot of facts in this comedic hour, And I just love that Kat has such a personality that can bring out information about what we are going through as people!I definitely think this is worth a watch. I will be watching again and I encourage people to watch this. It's so much laughter. It's almost like a family member sitting around telling a story about the things that are going on in America and other parts of the world.",False
9,2,Disappointing and repeat material,einafets-70675,n/a,15/08/2025,"I really wanted to like this... I was really excited but that excitement soon died out with the lackluster material. Some of the jokes were repeated from his last Netflix special, ww3. Katt created a lot of hype about speaking truth but he really played it safe. In a time where there is plenty to talk about, this was boring, and really missed the mark.I kept watching hoping it would get better and then it was over. Maybe it's time to retire.. because it just wasn't funny. Katt should just retire and stick to helping other comedians have their day in the spotlight. He said he only puts on comedians that are funnier than he is...and after this latest show, the bar isn't set very high.",False
10,3,What happen Katt!,keithalu,n/a,15/08/2025,Man I use to be a huge Katt fan going back to his before fame material but geez his last few standups have not been good. The writing the subject matters gave been just blah.He seems to want to drag other comedians down because he has lost his way with his material. At the end of the day if you cant write funny material its no one else's fault but your own. He seems to want to attack follow comedians and political trends and all this stuff that's worn out and ppl are sick of hearing at this point.Even the audience seemed uninterested during the show half the time. Gone are the days of him having us in tears from laughing instead we in tears from being bored.,False
11,1,As a comedy special... unfunny,profsmichael,n/a,15/08/2025,"Several years ago, I used to laugh and enjoy Katt Williams' comedy. The last two specials have been particularly unfunny for me. Not a smile crossed my face the entire time. I actually felt like I was talking with and trying to get away from the office gossip/conspiracy theorist! I just wanted to get away! Not funny, and cringe worthy. Blind football should have been sad, but he made fun of it. I get the point of his comments, but if you are going to do it... it HAS to be funny. It really wasn't. Two specials in a row for me, and this is my last attempt to watch Katt. It was that bad. Fond memories of previous years past, but today's Katt is sad and not at all funny. Preachy and just weird subject matter throughout. Was just a weird commentary about ""facts"" (again) and the ""truth"" (again). He didn't fall on his stool after every single punchline like last time, so that was an improvement. Let's face it: The entire comedy special was more like an uncomfortable conversation with someone you get the feeling you don't really like and want to get away from the entire time. I just wish I had pressed STOP or maybe even not PLAY at the very start. There came a time that Jerry Lewis was not on my play list... that time is now for Katt.",False
12,10,Grand Guffaw,pinkzmusic,n/a,15/08/2025,"As for me ... ""I didn't know what I needed until I needed it"" lol!I plan to go back watch again just to see what the critics are seeing. Maybe my excitement and anticipation ""blinndsided"" me. Katt's comedic timing, perspectives on social and cultural issues were all delivered with his unusual talent for thought provoking "" ness"". Of course we all meet ""funniness"" from where we are, and I was delighted . He was witty vivacious and intelligent. But then again I looooove to laugh gregariously!! At first I was going to mention my top 5 comedians/comediannes which turned into top 10 which turned into top 20 and Katt was in all of them lol!",False
13,10,Woke Foke,IceCream-57,n/a,15/08/2025,"I thought this film was absolutely hilarious! Completely funny from start to finish! Katt Williams is crazy and has a crazy style that nobody else does. He is one hilarious man. He touches on so many things like the media, racism, politics, and so many other things just to name a few. One big take away that I have from his comedy is how much people are not realizing what is going on in the world and how ridiculous that the real news is that is in the world right now
How unbelievable some of the things that we see now and we just accept because it has become so normal. Also his jokes about slavery will crack you up as well! Great comedy!",False
14,10,Very good show! Laughed so much.,victoriaphome,n/a,15/08/2025,"Fall I don't understand all the negativity about the special. It was very funny. In fact, more funny than the other comedy stand ups I've seen lately. Some of it is may be a bit too much for certain audience is like the swearing in vulgarity comments but all in all, it was very funny, and I love that he was an equal opportunity offender. He appreciated his audience, which is a diverse one. He also showed video coverage of things that he wanted to talk about so we could laugh at understanding even more. I appreciated that because I would not have understood the jokes otherwise. My favorite was the talk about the Alabama river brawl that made me laugh so hard.",False
15,10,Witty and esoteric iykyk,svelterogue-76537,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI get why not everyone liked this. They are most probably white out of a particularly callow level, expecting base humour which many have mistaken Katt's style of comedy to be.I enjoyed this more than world war 3 which felt flat. But this was light fare, on the safe side for tv audiences ( and many didn't get the live atmosphere). I found 90% of the material to be insightful and relevant, and loved how he kept the theme of ""truth is in especially in 2024"" focused all throughout.Loved how he said that racists in this day and age are colossally stupid, which is, again, undeniable truth. He ended his set with a bang, and I salute him for the utter commitment to Black Love and Black People!",True

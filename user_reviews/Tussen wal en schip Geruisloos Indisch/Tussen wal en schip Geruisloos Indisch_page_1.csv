1,9,"Impressive, recognizable",RaymondH-73,n/a,16/08/2025,"A touching and insightful film
This film offers a powerful glimpse into how the first generation of Indo-Dutch people settled in the Netherlands. It's deeply relatable and at times emotional, especially when the grandparents use typical Indonesian-Dutch expressions-it hits close to home. The film also highlights how integration can go wrong, especially when someone loses touch with their cultural roots. That loss is portrayed in a painful but honest way. Even for those without an Indo-Dutch background, this film is highly relevant. It shows the humility that many Indo-Dutch people carry-born from a deep respect for the country they now call home. A humility and mindset that some refugees coming to the Netherlands could truly learn from.",False
2,10,"Brilliant, inpressive, touching",verakorblet,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary brilliantly and lovingly depicts the dynamics of first and third generation 'Indo's', by following three grandchildren who engage in conversation with their grandparents. The interactions are both touching and humorous and I noticed a lot of recognition in the theater. Personally, I don't have Indo roots, but the cross-generation interactions are something anyone can relate to. It made me realize I wanted to have had more of these interactions with my own grandparents. The film taught me more about our shared history and I feel like it's a very valuable film for all Dutch people to see.",False
3,10,Recognizable and moving,DanilleV-0,n/a,16/08/2025,"The concept of grandchildren having conversations with their grandparents about their roots is moving and recognizable for me as a third generation 'indo'. It resonated deeply so thank you for making this film. It made me feel less alone in my search of what makes me 'Indisch'.In this movie you follow three grandchildren and their grandparents. Although the first and second generation Indo's are very silent, they challenged the grandparents by using objects that reminds them of IndiÃ«. Sometimes it got very emotional. But I also loved the typical (Indische) humor, which the elder Indo's use to make a conversation end because it's too painful. During the movie there was also a lot of laughter (because of the recognition) as well in the theatre. I would love to see this movie again with my family.",False

1,7,Very special - watch it,Luigi Di Pilla,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was recommended from a friend to see this true heist story told by the perhaps greatest thief of history in France himself. Hey, it was cool to hear him how he planned everything. And I thought this is not possible and in fact it happened really.In this documentary Vjeran Tomic shows deep inside his character and entourage. It is told accurately step by step since he was little boy until
what he finally became and what was his dream.It was really a hell ride listening what he thinks about life and his partners in the robbery case.Just watch it if you are interested in heist movies.7/10.",False
2,9,"No shiny cars, no ""wolfs"" and silly spending portraits. Real life human thief. Exceptional.",Leo1950,n/a,16/08/2025,"I haven't had a clue about this guy and didn't expect a lot from this title. Most of titles like this are just built around few interesting facts told by people who weren't directly involved, like neighbors, relatives and local grocery shop owners etc. And that's fine while you are doing housekeeping to listen around...but THIS one is being told by the man himself, and you will not take your eyes of the screen so forget about ironing. He is not your usual criminal, he is confident, self educated, polite and well behaved. He is not aggressive neither he has any deviant patterns usually seen from this guys. Just not to spoil too much, piece is well directed with appropriate dose of drama, action and mystery and it is not pretending to be anything more than it is. Just as the main character. I would rate it 8.5 in this category, but I am giving it high 9 just to push it up. Great watch!",False
3,5,If re-enactments are your kind of documentary,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Vjeran Tomic: The Spider-Man of Paris"" (2023 release from France; 86 min) opens, we are introduced to Vjeran Tomic, who speaks into the camera. ""I steal from the rich. I don't regret it."" as we see (re-enacted) footage of someone prancing on the rooftops of Paris apartment buildings. We then go to ""Paris, May, 2010"", as Tomic is getting ready to rob the Paris Museum of Modern Art. At this point we are 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Jamie Roberts (Four Hours at the Capitol, Escape from Kabul). Here Roberts sits down with a notorious art thief and burglar. The big problem is that there is no archive footage of anything Tomic has done. Indeed, the entire documentary consist of (i) re-enactments and (ii) talking heads including of course Tomic but also some of the police force that got on the case of the art heist. As for being the ""Spider-Man of Paris"", that may well be the case but in and of itself has NOTHING to do with the Paris Museum of Modern Art heist, which is the center piece of this documentary. All in all, this documentary, even as short as it is, left me confused and unfulfilled.""Vjeran Tomic: The Spider-Man of Paris"" started streaming on Netflix a couple of weeks ago. Netflix ""suggested"" it to me based on my viewing habits. Most of the times these suggestions work out quite well. Alas, not this time. Of course don't take my word for it. So if you are in the mood for a look at the biggest art heist in France's history, I'd suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
4,5,Calling the kettle black,fvanleyen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watched this show on Netflix in August 2024. I do like a good documentary on heists, theft from the criminal mind.This also gives a good insight in the way a museum tries to secure their posessions. And often you see small errors leading to theft. Just like here. Won't spoil the fun.The documentary is well made. Good images, editing, sound. Particulary the scenes on the rooftops make it quite exciting.What didn't excite me was the character of the leading role: Vjeran Tomic. A talker who blames his own actions on his past and the fact that rich people are not his type of people. But if he has a little bit of money, he behaves like a rich person.That part annoyed me.",True
5,3,Idolizing a criminal mind ?,jarnix-957-867652,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even if some people might fantasize about stealing an artwork, in a famous museum, from famous artists, in Paris, I don't understand how this documentary about a criminal can have a title like a super hero movie.The documentary is well directed, there are some interesting facts along the images that you will learn about the art mafia.But the whole Spiderman story is just shown in the beginning of the documentary. You won't get any adrenalin from this film. The trailer makes it look this way, like a Casa de Papel in Paris, with parkour and ninjas.The criminal has nothing of a hero. He does not even speak correctly.This will be quickly forgot in a long list of trash documentaries.I'm really angry about the title that is in a way promoting a criminal to a status of a superhero.",False
6,n/a,What a great guy - LEGEND!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great guy, he is right on everything.He's my hero and I wish there would be more Men like him ahahahahahah.That female trying to psyco-analyze him so useless and such a waste ot time, she's just upset because she got rob by a genius.God Bless Him!

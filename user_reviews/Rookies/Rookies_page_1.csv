1,3,Repetitive,smavronas,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie was just repeating itself again and again and again. The only thing i liked was the variety of the children and the different characters inside the school. The camera man was definitely drank,some scenes are not even clear and satisfying to watch. The scenes where the teachers invite each student to talk about their progress are extremely boring and we see them over 10 times until the end of the movie. The end though is something that i didn't expect to happen and i have to give credit to the team behind the movie but the rest is just bad in my opinion. We never get to hear the music that the students dance with and we just hear a repetitive bad hip hop style music.",False

1,7,The 'True Stories' documentary is better,pauljamesfilms,n/a,16/08/2025,"First and foremost, Tim's story is heartbreaking and he certainly was and remains a musical genius. I've now seen both documentaries (Avicii: True Stories and I'm Tim) and in my opinion, the 'True Stories' documentary is a better overall narrative and composition. Because 'True Stories' captured the progressive discovery of Tim's mental health battle while documenting his journey from another angle, the developing story and narrative was naturally organic and pure. The shift in focus during that documentary helped make it more impactful. Whereas 'I'm Tim' feels like a constructed but purposeful look back at his life. This composition feels untidy and somewhat rushed in places. 'I'm Tim' is clearly supported by family and friends close to Tim, which should absolutely be respected, but 'True Stories' engaged my attention with more depth and emotion. Perhaps because it was first, but certainly because it felt more organic. 'True Stories' appears to have been pulled from BBC Select, and you can't buy it in any format, which makes you wonder if the release of 'I'm Tim' has ultimately played a part in that. Sadly, I think many people will miss out on the better documentary because of this, although they have enough similarities to make I'm Tim worth watching. Regardless, raising awareness regarding the battle for positive mental health and remembering those who have ultimately lost such battles, makes documentaries like 'True Stories' and 'I'm Tim' incredibly worthwhile and worth viewing.",False
2,8,What is success?,c-57622,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary showcases his most iconic tracks. It reached out, grabbed my heart and left me with a lump in my throat. Heartbreaking.A beautiful tribute, and I'm glad they documented part of his life (one cannot capture everything). To be ""successful"" carries so much weight, one never knows how heavy it is on the heart and the burden it brings to the soul.There are those who keep the status quo and give audiences what they are used to, and that's ok. Then there is the rarity, like Tim, who will give what the audiences expect but will then slowly educate and open their musical minds and tastes to new sounds. He was a true creative, one who goes beyond their comfort zone to break through EDM's borders by mixing different styles. A true artist.",False
3,8,Devastating.,Mimzzzz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the privilege to listen Tim on Ultra Europe in Croatia two times. He always put a great show, it was remarkable. I also have to say that I know literally every song he made, I used to love house music and EDM, and I still do, but I was rather a fan of Hardwell or maybe Laidback Luke, but never Avicii's and I must admit that I don't know why. Maybe there were songs that were to repetetive so I was annoyed, but I remember when I heard the news about his death, I felt so bad for him and everyone closest to him.Also, after seeing this documentary, it definitely showed me who Tim really was and who he really wasn't. After seeing couple of minutes of this film, you could clearly see that he wasn't made to be on that stage in that kind of a way, If you know what I mean. He was not ready, like he said - he was too stiff so he had to drink to cope with all this energy and madness. He was a big talent and such a great artist, he will never fade away. Some of his songs reminds me of my past, my growing with certain people, such a nostalgia in this documentary.The ending crushed me, I even let my tears to come out because I can't understand why he didn't find purpose in his life afterall, to even took his own life. Such a tragedy. You could clearly see how fragile he was, how he wasn't prepared for all the fame that came along, and sadly no one could help him. Avicii took Tim away from this life...He was so down to earth and that is very rare to see nowdays...I felt sadness seeing this documentary and I wanted to know him better through this film, and all I can say is that he was clearly such a beautiful soul.I hope he found peace, and only he knows what really happened and what was going through his head. Such a shame that he couldn't share that with anyone.Tim, you are missed.",False
4,10,"Not a fan but..,",azgygeg,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a fan. I like a handful of his songs, but this documentary made me understand the greatness of Avicii and the impact of his music.I mostly enjoy rock and soul music. After watching this documentary, the creativity of this young man truly resonated with me and completely changed my perspective on his music.But most importantly, it showed his pure soul and how his music truly came from the heart.I'm a relatively older man, and the mindset of this young guy made me reflect deeply and wipe the tears from my face.Whenever I listen to his music, I'll remember that I need to become a better person.",False
5,10,Won't fade into darkness,nico-50901,n/a,16/08/2025,"I cannot possibly write an unbiased review for this. I'm the kind of person who convinced my family to visit Stockholm just to go to the Avicii Experience, who has read Tim's official biography, who owns True, Stories, and Tim on vinyl, along with plenty of merch from the official website. I listen to his music almost every day-he remains one of my most-listened-to artists every year, even after his passing.As I write this on New Year's Eve, I'm still emotional after crying my eyes out watching Avicii: I'm Tim on its release date. The ending completely broke my heart. This documentary deserves to be seen alongside Netflix's other release today, My Last Show, which features some of his most successful and well-known songs.We may never truly understand what was going through his mind, but he left us with a powerful message in his final songs and lyrics. Tracks like ""SOS,"" ""Hold the Line,"" and ""Ain't a Thing"" are deeply emotional and hauntingly beautiful. As he once said after stepping away from touring: ""I will never let go of music. I will continue to speak to my fans through it.""Tim, you are deeply missed. I'm so grateful to everyone who made this documentary possible-it's a heartfelt gift to all his fans. The melodies he created are not just music; they're memories of my teenage years and an endless source of inspiration.I hope everyone enjoys this as much as I did.",False
6,6,Just something too rushed at the end,frosty-44431,n/a,16/08/2025,"So firstly, a great documentary. It started off great and he really did come across as a nice guy, and we all know at least one or two of his songs. However,we know most of that already and this would have been a great opportunity to explain to the audience more of his struggles, how bad were the drugs and drinking what friends were not the right type around him, why did the manager leave and not speak to Tim was it over money and lack of loyalty.Lastly, although personal but if your doing a documentary we just needed a better understanding of such an early death how bad it really was or was this not explained due to the guilt of the people around him who never done enough.",False
7,10,A Genius,dmorgan-18029,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA very very well made documentary which took me back to a time when life was so good. Avicii was a genius whether you like EDM or not.Was brilliant to see the creation progress of certain songs I still bop along to now, and the behind the scenes of all the highs and lows he through as an artist.I went to see Avicii in 2016 and can honestly say it's one of/if not the best gig/concert I've been to, and like I mentioned before, watching this documentary took me back to that night.Overall, the production value, the in depth interviews, behind the scenes and his mind at work making the songs we all know makes it well worth the watch!",True
8,6,Would've liked to see more,rjncharles,n/a,16/08/2025,"My only glaring observation is this documentary didn't go deep enough. It needed more exploration, more explanation and just more..... It never really climaxed and we're not learning anything new here that wasn't already known through the internet; Really disappointed to be honest. It did nothing for me.It did a good job, however of documenting Tim's climb, but not so much his downfall, making the documentary a bit one sided. Maybe I was just expecting something more comprehensive? I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve with making this documentary. Was it just an intention to only shed light on his music career and portray him in that light? That's what it seems like to me.",False
9,10,Just to the point of tears,leonricciofficial,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is really moving to tears, especially the ending. I can tell you. What it tells you about what was important for those who cared about Tim as much as the closest person. With his music, he helped many people see life in colors again, overcome difficult situations and obstacles and just smile. After watching this movie, I began to see the full depth of his inner state, which he translated into his music, and in fact, this fact is sad, because we hadn't seen it before and couldn't help Tim at the time. I would like to thank everyone who was involved in the creation of this film in one way or another, thank you for honoring the memory of this great man in this way and helping many of his fans get to know him better!",False
10,6,Tim deserves a better docu,AnnaWithinAsWithout,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a pity. This documentary doesn't add much more information than the public already has gotten from the 2017 documentary: Avicii True Stories.His life, is story worthy, he seems so humble, and a fantastic inspirational person. In every word in this review, I honour Tim/Avicii. In my opinion the documentary makers do him way too short.It is evident from the docu that he disliked his life. He seems to have the scandinavian introversion, which can be hard to handle when life goes too fast. If they can't enjoy spring and summer, the darkness of winter will keep on haunting. What I miss in the docu is more depth, yes he took drugs, yes he drank so much he got sick, but isn't there anything more to tell? Something more to show how Tim really felt, or what he thought. It might be all there is to know about him, but it makes the documentary unsatisfactory and even empty.The documentary describes attributes about Tim's life, like: ""this and this happened"", but it often lacks the feelings, the motivations, the specific struggles. It feels so general.Only a few special heartfelt glimpses, like when he made the song ""Hey brother"" with singer Dan Tyminski and ""Wake me up"" with Mike Einziger of Incubus and American soul singer Aloe Blacc.How I love to hear Tim speak. I wish there would have been more voice recordings, interviews, of Tim.What I also like about the docu is that it dives a bit deeper into Tim's musical relationships, and his passion and expertise in melody. How he tells the singers and musicians to make the melody he finds fitting for his songs. Another positive aspect is how they show Avicii's growth and break through step by step.It also shows his transformations, how he lost control over his own life, and how he got it back; or, seemingly got back the control. Since sadly, we all know how the documentary ends... Also in this transformations, it misses the final triggers. What made the tables turn, what did Tim like about his life, why made things go, how they went.",False
11,10,He is Progressive House,maxevertrust,n/a,16/08/2025,As a Fan of Electronic music especially Progressive House this Doc is a real treat. From an amateur kid from Sweden making house music on FL studio to an international star EDM producer/DJ making the world go Dance. It shows the good times and the bad times...The evolution of his music is remarkable from House to including country influence to his signature tunes. His studio sessions as a producer is so fascinating to watch. Fame and the EDM Life unfortunately took its toll on Tim. The happiness we see in the beginning became a curse in the end. From a Fan's perspective I see this Film as a celebration of his Life and his music.,False
12,7,Heartbreaking Memories,oconnors2nz,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a more mature EDM lover, being into House music since the 80's, but when Aviici hit the scene, it was something magical, much more than the house music of that era, Tim was a game-changer and his music will live forever.Great documentary with personal recollections from family and friends, including performing artists; honest and heartfelt, I was moved to tears at the end, as I was with 2017's Documentary, Aviici: True Stories. I think where this older documentary surpassed the latest, was in the expanded view of the downward spiral: how Tim felt, the cancellations in the final year, what he was feeling at this lowest point when his passion and what he lived for, became something he didn't want to spend his days doing anymore.Not to say I didn't like this documentary, just felt it was slightly rushed in the final third, hurtling towards a quick summarisation of the sorry story, ending abruptly.I remember where I was when I heard the news of Aviici's death. Much like you remember where you were when Princess Diana died. Such was Tim's impact not just on music, but on the world in general. He was one of a kind, inspirational and gifted creator. Such a shame his flame was extinguished way too early and in such a sad way.I play your music frequently Aviici and Will continue to do so. Much love.",False
13,n/a,The wheat from the chaff,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHow does one seperate things or as this doc even suggest merge two different things into ""one"".There is the literal on its face narrative which can only be trusted fully if you believe there is no conflict which is made obvious in the documentary over concepts like proliferation success and sheer profit over things like the art or keeping things to a normal natural healthy scale.This really shows someone simply being pushed or perhaps forced out of their comfort zone towards ever bigger stardom and ultimately supporting others.Yet how honest and good can that be when other forces want to make of you what you aren't yet?Is that normal or natural for a social group to offer support and momentum or direction perhaps even careful strategic for profit and purpose manipulation?I take some issue with accepting what is clearly a cycle of we tried to make him big before his own comfort and time and he fizzles and so we had a long road trying to rebuild the image and brand and make him great again.In short if you don't worship at EDM or the particular artists or the realities of creating content in the field there will be little enjoyment here.People say hes a genius. Is he tho? Is he actually a genius or a normal shy kid who puts his energy time and talents towards that one pursuit and creation and accordingly accomplished much.It doesn't seem like he has genius talent so much as he simply allowed that to be the vast bulk of his life time escape or solo pursuits. Perhaps a simple avoidance mechanism.Its really more of a tired confused creature where we can't tell if its about getting to know the real tim or seeing some abusive colonel management forces and influences trying to grow his brand and farm him out to the much more lucrative live performance big events that were ill suited to his core nature.What i see is a male brittany spears like situation carefully developing through exploitative friends and partners (so called) who only have tims best interests at heart as usual.When you can't see the reality that you are the golden goose and your friends can't be satisfied with the eggs you naturally produce. So they squeeze and soon they are leering over you with sharp knives looking ever more hungry and deranged.I'm Tim... and im likely a victim of abuse and exploitation.",True
14,1,A Disheartening Trend: Cashing in on Avicii's Legacy,kamecdesign,n/a,16/08/2025,"This reshoot of Avicii: True Stories (2017) feels like a disappointing cash grab rather than a heartfelt tribute.Reshooting a documentary so soon after the original reeks of an industry trend that treats fans as if they'll mindlessly consume whatever is served. Instead of adding meaningful updates or fresh insights, it often feels like a rehash of content we've already experienced. I couldn't help but feel insulted as a loyal fan - did they think we wouldn't notice?While Tim's story is one worth telling, recycling and repackaging it under the guise of ""new"" is disrespectful to both his legacy and his audience. The focus should be on creating something genuinely new and impactful, not just milking existing stories for profit.I truly hope this trend of reshooting recently made films stops before it becomes the norm. Fans deserve better, and so do the stories these films aim to tell.",False
15,10,"A great insight into Tim, his music and the struggles people have with mental health",Tsloby,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI never overly liked Avicii's music. I wasn't a big fan of EDM either at the time.This documentary changed my perspective on the artist and the music he produced as well as the side effects of making it big and the impact it has on people.A lot of brilliant minds struggle with their minds and it seems clear Avicii was one of those. A genius who made music that reached out to so many, ultimately his struggles led to his life ending sooner than it should have.A great documentary with lots of insights, a real tear jerker at the end for anyone who has ever understood what it is like having to deal with the struggles of anxiety of any other mental health issues.A worthy watch - 10 stars. Rest in Peace mate.",True
16,9,An emotional rollercoaster,whatgift,n/a,16/08/2025,"From the opening scene (which is where the title comes from), you know you're witnessing someone special, and this documentary is a love letter to his life. While it can reasonably be argued that it doesn't delve deeply into Tim's mental health struggles, it gives satisfactory insight into that along the way.This is not a typical showbusiness tale - Tim was surrounded by friends, family and business associates who obviously deeply cared for both his welfare and his career. While Tim's success undoubtedly contributed to his mental health struggles, the support he received and his ability to step back when things got really bad is quite inspiring.Tim surprisingly narrates most of this documentary, and you can really feel his insecurities and passion for life and music. You feel that he deserved every success in his career and life, being such an amazing human being in general. As a casual fan of his music, I found myself quite emotional at times at the highs and lows of this man's life.Highly recommended viewing.",False
17,7,A Poignant Tribute to a Musical Genius,DarklyDreamingFan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Avicii: I'm Tim is an emotional and deeply personal documentary that sheds light on the life, struggles, and legacy of Tim Bergling, better known as Avicii. The film offers an intimate look at the Swedish DJ and producer's meteoric rise, creative genius, and the pressures that ultimately led to his tragic passing in 2018.Positive Aspects:Emotional Depth: The documentary does not shy away from the emotional and mental toll of fame, making it a powerful and moving tribute.Unseen Footage & Personal Insights: Fans get an intimate look at Tim's life, with never-before-seen clips, personal interviews, and raw moments that make him feel more human than ever.Impactful Soundtrack: Avicii's music is woven seamlessly into the narrative, reminding viewers of his immense talent and influence on electronic music.Honest Exploration of Industry Pressures: The film highlights the relentless demands of the music industry and the consequences of burnout, sparking important conversations about mental health.Negative Aspects:Heartbreaking to Watch: While necessary for storytelling, the film's emotional weight can be heavy, especially for those who admired Avicii.Limited Focus on Musical Process: While it touches on his creative brilliance, some fans might wish for more insight into his production techniques and artistic evolution.One-Sided Perspective at Times: The documentary primarily focuses on the struggles and tragedy, which, while important, could have balanced the narrative with more moments of joy and triumph in Tim's life.Overall, Avicii: I'm Tim is a touching, beautifully crafted documentary that honors Avicii's legacy while shedding light on the challenges he faced. It's a must-watch for fans and a poignant reminder of the human cost of stardom.",False
18,8,You'll Always Live In Our Hearts,cutie7,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just finished watching the documentary 'Avicii: I'm Tim', and it struck me deeply. As someone who has spent her entire life coming to terms with the reality that I'll always live with anxiety, I felt so connected to his experiences. It's a lonely journey when your mind is constantly in overdrive - questioning everything and rarely finding peace.As a society, we must do better. We need to actively work toward destigmatising mental health struggles and creating spaces where people feel supported and understood, not shamed, for seeking help.This quote from the documentary shook me because it mirrored so much of what I feel:""But my dream would be to be completely, completely at ease and completely happy with what I've got already, and not really have any aspirations to do a billion other things. I just want to be free from all the ideas of a life. The thing that has kept me from living life has been that exact thing: having an idea of what life should be and what should make me happy.Nothing has turned out to be true. But I want to learn how to be content. That would be life for me. Being content.""These words hit home in a way I can't fully describe. So often, we're trapped in this endless pursuit of what we think life is supposed to be, only to realise that the pressure to chase a perfect life - one that doesn't even exist - leaves us feeling more lost than ever.We need to do better. Let's talk about this more. Let's remind each other that we're not alone.",False
19,7,A Beautiful Tribute to a Legendary Musician,irusvirus,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film offers a well-crafted portrayal of a remarkable career and an incredible musician who had an ear for music and an undeniable talent. Through carefully selected moments, it showcases not only his success but also the struggles he faced along the way. Sadly, it all came to an end far too soon-but unfortunately, that's the fate of many great artists.The film is beautifully made, featuring wonderful retrospectives that honor his legacy. The combination of archival footage, emotional interviews, and stunning performances creates a touching and authentic experience. Fans will appreciate the attention to detail, while newcomers will get an insightful look into the life of an extraordinary artist. A must-watch for music lovers!",False
20,8,A legend with an unfinished tale,bevanaaron,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary tremendously takes through the story of Tim's life from childhood to his far too early end. The main factor Tim seemed to struggle with was that balance between being himself and being Avicii, ultimately breaking any form of contentment and freedom. While in his peak, he was touring, developed a disease in his pancreas and used drink and drugs to aid the workload and the feeling required to perform. Ultimately, this film is about a very talented life, taken far too early, outlining the total contrast between money and fame, and happiness and freedom. From a personal note, Avicii's music was iconic to me, I was in my teenage years partying to every new song he'd bring out. He was also the first album I fully downloaded and listened to in numerical order. True & Stories were for me, albums with meaning that can make you think about things in life. The documentary covers everything pretty well and is a credit to the legacy Tim has left with his.",True
21,10,Wanted a trip back...,Nikkiangel002,n/a,16/08/2025,"I seen this documentary was coming on...I'll go back about 16 years or so... back to flat party's with my friends before and after nights out... where we'd all take turns of putting on songs via YouTube and speakers.I would always go to a track ""Tim berg - Bromance"" time again always went down well. I'd find it on a small YouTube channel with barely any views. The video I distinctly remember was just a spinning record... posted by Tim Berg.Fast forward a few years wow what's this Avicci!? He's using a sample!? No. Obviously not. I loved him before and after. I knew of certain struggles but was shocked by his death and saddened massively. Huge part of my vital years growing up and my music saturated years. His songs remind me of good and bad times with friends. But hugely the good times. Great doc and insight into what a genius he really was and showing how respected he was in the industry. Just feel so sad for him really and how much hope and love he shared with people and brought them. I hope he's at rest now. Heartbreaking to see how he couldn't rest himself at his peak. Rip TIM.",False
22,10,Emotional. Tragic.,Movielover0907,n/a,16/08/2025,"What to say about this documentary? It was very emotional and taught me some life lessons like to truly live and appreciate what I have in life after making it through addiction. I contemplated watching this because I became a fan of Avicii at the point of my drug addiction where it was still fun. I went to EDM concerts in the past high as a kite. But Avicii's music transcends EDM and he's one of the few artists from that time I can still listen to that doesn't take me back to a memory of being high. I relate so much to him even though we walked completely different paths in life. I relate to his anxiety and his desire to just be himself but wanting to please others. Tim, I'm sorry the world failed you. I'm sorry that the fame destroyed you. That's the double edged sword sometimes of being an artist and part of being successful as an artist sometimes means exposure. Watching this made me realize even more than I already do how lucky I am to be alive. This could've been me...the not famous version of course but having lived through addiction, depression and the thoughts that consume you, I understand.",False
23,9,Amazing!,Miphed,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are only a handful of documtaries that really capture the essence of a person Most of them don't do any justice as well to their legacy. I was blown away by this one. It just immerses you and there is no drama or scandals. Just Tim, a hugely talented guy and his passion for music. Yet I was mesmerized at how simple a guy he was, polite with no airs or arrogance. His music was beyond perfection, yet he had insecurities. Ultimately it's very sad, we lost such a great artist He achieved giant steps in a short time. Unfortunately not everyone can cope with success. Even with cutting back on gigs, and getting into medication, he was not able to find peace or happiness. We should all understand by now that life is not always happy. We have ups and downs. And it's up to each individual how they battle their struggles. Overall, this is a must watch documentary, for all.",True
24,8,Recommended to EDM fans everywhere,Cvspartan101,n/a,16/08/2025,"Avicii is a legend and I'll always regret not being able to see him live. This was the first time I've really watched any documentary or behind-the-scenes content of his life and I think this was a great watch.Definitely recommend EDM fans to check this out. DJ life looks glamorous on social media and I'm sure the big names are compensated very well, but all the that touring and process of creating music must be very exhausting both physically and mentally.I do wish we had more interviews with current DJs that he had a relationship with. I think the only one we saw was David Guetta, but would have loved to heard from people like Tiesto, Martin Garrix, Alesso, etc.""He said one day you'll leave this world behind, so live a life you'll remember"" Thank you Tim!",False

A highly recommended documentary for all those who love his music and want to know more about the life of this wonderful artist. Speaking of quality and not content, I liked the structure of the film, that is, I liked how this story was told and how past testimonies and interviews were used. In conclusion wow.",False

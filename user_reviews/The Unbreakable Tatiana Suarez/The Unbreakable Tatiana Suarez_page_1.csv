1,10,Great Inspirational Documentary,ethanwsdennis,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who doesn't follow UFC, I didn't know anything about Tatiana or her story going in, but I was blown away by her story of resilience. I was impressed to learn that she not only defied the odds by coming back from her injuries and cancer diagnosis, but created a path for female wrestlers. I loved the scene's of Tatiana's high school in West Covina because we were able to see how her legacy remains an inspiration to the young woman wrestlers of today. Tatiana is truly a one of a kind fighter and this documentary shows it. I highly recommend. It's a strong story, very well told. Streaming on MAX.",True

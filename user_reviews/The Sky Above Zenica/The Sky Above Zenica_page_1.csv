1,9,"Outstanding documentary that shows politicians ""tricks of the trade""",panta-4,n/a,16/08/2025,"This engaging documentary takes place in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and follows a group of activists from Eko Forum, a non-governmental organization dedicated to combating pollution in the city.

Another concerned father aptly stated, ""LET THEM POISON US WHEN WE KEEP QUIET.""A must watch for everyone...",False

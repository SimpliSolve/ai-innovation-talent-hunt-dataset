1,10,Uplifting and Inspirational,cksheard-31317,n/a,15/08/2025,"A great example of how to take a serious and potentially unhappy subject and turn it into an uplifting and inspirational examination of loving and caring. Trish's dedication to her mother demonstrates qualities we all should strive for. And Kyle's willingness to be a key part of this mother/daughter journey shows what love is really about. The comic touches and embedded mystery make this story easily watchable and engrossing throughout. I recommend this movie not only for those dealing with dementia in the family, but for anyone looking for a life affirming movie experience. A story very well told!",False

The commitment of Trish to her mother is a story of true love, as is the love and commitment of Kyle joining the journey. Trish's ability to manage the constant care of her mother, manage all the practicality and logistics of life, navigating the medical system, dealing with the discoveries of this disease, and documenting the journey with such grace and humor is a joy to be able to witness in this film. A beautiful and important story, this is a must watch for anyone care giving for a loved one. 10/10.",False
3,10,A Love Letter to a Mother,westcoastguy-00798,n/a,15/08/2025,"The very personal story of Trish's experiences as her mother became more affected from the ravages of dementia.. While you would think based on the subject matter the film would be depressing, it is anything but. While lots of us may have relationship challenges with our parents at times, this movie is a great example of a daughter stepping up and doing what needed to be done to help her mother. Trish also had a great supporting group of friends to help navigate these deeply emotional waters.The movie was well paced, poignant and thought provoking. You will laugh and cry.Highly recommend it!",False
4,10,Required viewing for any caregiver,mary-04489,n/a,15/08/2025,"What a gift this film is! Dementia is an almost taboo topic in society, and caregivers toil in silence, often unseen, very often in despair. By sharing her own and her mother's story, filmmaker Trish Neufeld has shone a playful, even joyous light on her mother's struggles with the illness, and her family's challenges in adapting to it. Ms. Neufeld's gifted cinematography is combined with wonderful animation, and follows Trish and her mother, friends, neighbours and family on a fascinating journey, sharing with us the profound love they all have for each other. Special mention must be given to Ms. Neufeld's husband, Kyle, who she meets after her mother's diagnosis. In true 'love made visible' fashion Kyle enthusiastically joins Trish in her quest to make her mother's final years and months as fulfilling as possible. In an era where toxic masculinity gets so much attention, Kyle shows a different vision, displaying the kind of generosity of spirit, kindness, love and selflessness that should serve as a blueprint for men looking to support loved ones with dementia. I cannot recommend this film enough. I left the theatre with a very different perspective on this heartbreaking diagnosis - and the certain knowledge that Love Conquers All. A really perfect little gem of a film.",False

6,10,Reverse Parenting,zuluturk,n/a,15/08/2025,"Who knows what the future holds for us? Only some live the bittersweet truth, the reversal of the roles between parent and child. Trish generously shares her personal story, arguably inspiring and motivating the audience about how the numbered days of our beloved ones could turn into a period of joy and fulfilment. Grief finds another meaning in her way,. It's not getting lost in misery but lighting a candle in the dark to help others.

7,10,A Story About Loyalty,aliciawendland,n/a,15/08/2025,"This story could have been so depressing, but I came out feeling inspired and hopeful. The director did such an amazing job with the story-telling and I believe that all those years she spent taking care of her mom, she was also preparing for this amazing story. Even though it was a documentary and not a movie, you could see the change in the people as the story went on which is a true testament to all those who worked behind the camera. I loved every bit of it, and even though I cried in the end, it didn't feel hopeless. This story about a mother and daughter is so rich with love, joy, and of course dancing! Even if your family isn't dealing with dementia personally, there are aspects throughout the movie that can be relatable for just about anyone. What a wonderful documentary!",False

While the events of the film tell the story of one family, one mother and one daughter, the entirety of the production is relatable to all and forces the audience to look inward and ask powerful questions. The creation and production of a story like this must leave the story tellers vulnerable and emotionally spent - sharing such an intimate story of mystery, love, hope and wonder is truly a gift to film watchers. I was entertained, educated and emotionally moved by this production - don't miss it.",False
9,10,Dancing with Mom,marliepoden,n/a,15/08/2025,"What an extraordinary story. Trish Neufeld perfectly captures both the angst and joy of mother/daughter relationships.Raised by a single mom who is larger than life, engaging, complicated and the centre of her universe, Trish develops both resiliency and empathy, both of which come in handy when her mother is faced with a devastating brain illness.This true story gives me so much hope for the future.

12,10,Awe inspiring,knewbert-773-670934,n/a,15/08/2025,"A story of love, commitment and perseverance. This movie brings tears of joy and utter despair. A true story that is really uplifting and thought provoking. This is like a road trip movie with both fun and heartbreak but still conscious decisions to carry on and not waver on a commitment made to a loved one and to oneself. Starting from childhood and a dream of a normal family to anything but that but still a childhood full of fun and adventure, never mind the loving and caring on all sorts of levels to the people in this anything but normal family. A perfect example of an abnormal family (what family is perfect?) being a joyous, happy family with more than its share of difficulty situations.A must see for anyone with a parent or relative with a crippling disease that threatens and entire family in the present and into the future.",False

The way the story is being told makes you feel you're right there with them. It's open, vulnerable, very human, emotional and still often funny.The film really takes the audience into the story and makes you think what family means, giving up everything to care for your parent and still bring joy and lightness into each day.

15,10,A fitting title,gabayley,n/a,15/08/2025,"I laughed, I cried, I cried some more. I loved watching this film. It brings attention to a subject not often addressed or acknowledged. Beautiful journey between two best friends. The use of animation throughout brought light to some heavy and emotional topics, and made me laugh while doing so. I am in admiration of the boyfriend and his devotion to the family, I don't know many men who would be so committed to their partners. Truly admirable. And the twist near the end kept you wondering and still does long after the credits roll. The foresight to get behind the camera while the story unfolded on such a personal level is to be commended.

But as I walked out of the cinema, I wondered what I would have been able to do. Who would have been there, how everything would have happened. It's a difficult journey, shown very truthfully, but artistically. Yes, it's another documentary, about a very strong woman, not even one.

Thank you for sharing/producing this very personal journey with the world.",False

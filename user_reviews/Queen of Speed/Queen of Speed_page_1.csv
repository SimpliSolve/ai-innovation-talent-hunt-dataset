1,10,Queen of speed is awesome!,sailor_r,n/a,16/08/2025,"Queen of Speed is a wonderfully realized documentary-film about the incredible Michele Mouton and her career. Her way from teenager age and early Rallyes uo to the absolute top of the world elite in rallye sport. Michele is undoubtedly one of the greatest drivers of all time in the history, what she has done, has never been achieved by any other woman. She has won world championship races in the highest class of rallye motorsport and excelled in the golden age of rallye sport, the group B.This documentary also shows the incredible, professional and nice Fabrizia Pons (most of the time her co-driver) and some of the biggest competitors and rally icons, Ari Vartanen, Walter RÃ¶hrl etc..For me Queen of speed is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Thanks Michele.",False

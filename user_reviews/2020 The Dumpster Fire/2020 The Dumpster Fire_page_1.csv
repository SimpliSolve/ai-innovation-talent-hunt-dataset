1,8,Eben,figliodianarchia,n/a,16/08/2025,"The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.The test will begin on the word start.On your mark, get ready, start.",False
2,8,Well done!,brittanymwinner,n/a,16/08/2025,"Made me chuckle while reminiscing about 2020, which is not very easy to do. The movie has a good balance of music and dialogue, while being chaotic enough to keep my interest. It's best watched 3-4 times to catch all of the myriad things happening in quick succession, and actually worth the time. Spend a moment with this film and you probably won't regret it.",False
3,2,"Started out entertaining, then become immoral",AJ4F,n/a,16/08/2025,"If he'd stuck with ribbing Biden and Trump it would have been OK, but it deteriorated into race-Marxist propaganda after the George Floyd segment started. The casual treatment of ruined cities, and childish attitude that police are optional, made this film a dud.We need a documentary that clearly lampoons both sides and doesn't play favorites. To be truly intelligent, you can't side with hooligans from any camp.",False
4,10,Phenomenal & spectacular!,hhiland,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary was 10/10! Fabulous, hilarious, informative, I loved it from start to finish! A true glimpse into the past 4+ years of the real problem going on in this country with the fascist president Trump and all his cult members. The horrifying response of law enforcement against left activists. I recommend everyone see this movie!",False
5,10,"You'll laugh, you'll cry, so see it before you die.",seraphm,n/a,16/08/2025,Great documentary of the year that was 2020. You'll see things you won't see in MSM covering the the riots and enjoy Rod's antics and street art trolling political events.,False

7,10,This is a FANTASTIC Documentary!,bmckluskey,n/a,16/08/2025,"I highly recommend that anyone interested in politics see this incredible documentary. It's one of the best ever.

8,10,These guys are awesome!,dab-21,n/a,16/08/2025,I can't believe how far they got with this. Politicians suck and the truth is starting to show. I call shenanigans on the whole system! The whole world needs to see this.,False
9,10,AMAZING!,kmartling,n/a,16/08/2025,"Superb, masterful, apropos for these irreverent times. Decidedly adept, satirical narration, of an event horizon for our species. The content we deserve. If you're going to relive it, do it with biting sardonic wit, weaving some resilience training into the collective memory of recent history. Genuinely poignant and touching. No one smelled my hair.",False
10,10,This film changes your life!,foxhuntingtrilobite,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel embarrassed for all of us watching this film, but I also look forward to more embarrassing futures.Vermin tells it like it is in all its unholy glory.",False
11,10,"Telling it as it is, for the most part",dmitchel-33313,n/a,16/08/2025,"A dumpster fire is right!This is a great look back on the past events from an amazing perspective. I don't agree with everything from a personal principles and opinions standpoint, but wholly appreciate the amazing trek this film takes you on.Always looking for more stuff from this team!

You will not regret sitting down to watch this documentary!",False
12,10,Absolutely Fantastic,AmberMoses,n/a,16/08/2025,"Went into the film with high expectations and it did not disappoint. It was informative while remaining entertaining, a documentary that was able to keep my interest for the duration of the film.",False

14,10,Fantastic,amkirkham,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's a fantastic view of our dumpster fire of a world. Vermin opens eyes and speaks a truth not many want or are ready to hear. A must see for anyone who wears or has been fitted for their tin foil hat! Lol, all joking aside, I enjoyed it very much.",False
15,10,Another gem,aaronwestongoss,n/a,16/08/2025,Vermin never misses! Yet again he exemplifies why he's the president this nation needed. We live in a worse world due to his defeat. Rod does a great job framing the 2020 election in his trademark style.,False
16,10,Awesome!,rmarulis,n/a,16/08/2025,"If it's not Vermin Supreme, it's just a meme. He is a really cool guy! We all have a Vermin in charge of us. But the one we need is the most supreme one there is. #vermin20XX.",False
17,10,EPIC & NEEDED,senatorjackman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Truly tour du force and an epic ride that shows how rotten, corrupt, decayed and outdated our ""system"" is. Some political satire with balls is typically in short supply, but not here! See this film!",False

20,10,Vermin is in it.,bwmorri,n/a,16/08/2025,Vermin Supreme is in the movie. What more do you people want? The documentary provides a perspective of the Great Dumpster Fire of 2020 that the corporate media has no interest in representing and will never accurately depict. It is definitely worth a watch for any person frustrated with the idiocracy and fraudulent system of government in the United States and wants to do something about it.,False
21,10,GREAT DOCUMENTARY!,justvhappy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary opens your eyes to the truth about what is happening in America. It isn't the people against the people, it is the government against the people.",False

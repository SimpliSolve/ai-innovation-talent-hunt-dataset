2,10,Stand & Applaud to this new INDIAN TEST team.,asifthevamp,n/a,17/08/2025,"Watch this incredible 3 hrs 50 min series as a cricket lover.

3,10,Rarely do we see a fairy tale like series.,anikb-87099,n/a,17/08/2025,"The kind of series that 2020-21 Aus vs ind test series was, it was like someone had literally written a blockbuster fairy tale script for it. Injuries, nightmare 1st test, body blows, racial abuse, losing your loved ones back home still bowling in Aus, underdogs, facing goliaths of cricket, still winning at the end....you see all the elements you see in a commercial blockbuster thriller like fairy tale are there in this series.The series was such, it could even leave behind the memories of the 83 WC underdog story but then WC is another next level story but you know winning in Aus against Aus in tests has always been classified as WC level achievement. I dont think any series for india till date has such twisted, emotional and inspiring tale written in it .What makes this particular documentary interesting to watch is the BGM, the interesting analysis and talks by experts on the conditions during that series , the way they describe the underdogs like Natarajan, Thakur for example, who had to fight their way into the test team and still making a massive impact. Siraj's story is sure to pull at your heart. He is a man of inspiration. His 5 wkt haul at Gabba and then raising the ball towards the sky dedicating it to his late father brings tears to your eyes. Pujji no matter how bad his form maybe of late, will always be remembered for his heroic stand he took at gabba taking body wounds from balls like bullets and yet making a 50. There are many such sub stories that make up this fairy tale.Today's youth in 20s who are cricket fans have got a perfect tale of cricket to narrate to their future gens just like our dads would narrate stories of the 83 wc. Watch this show its extremely well made i would say. Keep it in safe for the future gens to watch as well.",False
4,10,This series will age like wine!,Biswas_,n/a,17/08/2025,"Cricket fans of today need no introduction as to what this series is based upon, the historic test series win in Australia 2020-21. Very well shot . It is the SonyLiv or rather Indian version of the THE TEST available on Prime video. This series was like a fairy tale which one rarely get to witness. It has all the elements to become a blockbuster thriller.Makers should have waited another few years to release this as such fairy tale like series stories age like wine, they get better and more nostalgic with time. The impact would have been 100 times more, 100 times more emotional if it were released few years later. Still , even after a year watching it would definitely leave you tear eyed and joyful if you have followed the series closely and seen what horrendous things happened inside indian camp and then still come out victorious at the end.MD. Siraj 's tale of fulfilling his father's dream will surely bring tears to your eyes.The 1st episode felt exactly like an episode of ""Seconds from Disaster"" with each wicket along with time being shown.Save this series for your kids of future. If they become cricket fans, show them this sonyliv series, tell them, your dad witnessed this epic fairy tale even before you were born. A reason why such shows age well with time as more future kids would witness this story and get inspired.",False
5,8,"One of the best series, show a little slow and repetitive",siddharthgala,n/a,17/08/2025,"One of the best series to be played. Best of test cricket. Well done to make this into a mini-series.However the series is a bit slow, and repetitive. Should have done a better job in editing a lot of talks and more match highlights.",False
6,10,A fantastic Series & a Must Watch,kaumudi-63268,n/a,17/08/2025,"Down Underdogs- India's Greatest Comeback is truly a beautiful 4 part journey reliving one of the most amazing comebacks in the history of Indian cricket. Cricket greats like Sunil Gavaskar, Jason Gillispie, Sanjay Manjrekar along with Rajdeep Sardesai , Joy Bhattacharjya taking us back to the fighting spirit of Team India with their narration was an emotional roller coaster ride. A must watch for all cricket lovers & a great inspiration that shows that nothing is impossible if you believe. A Must watch!",False

8,10,Super series got a super story telling!!!,jaynairdrl,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is a MUST WATCH for every cricket fan and for sure all Indian fans.It's done quite well over 4 hours and the experts add to what India achieved.Many may not recall that India played with (according to me) a C-Team in the final match at Gabba. We had got an injured 11 alreadyðŸ˜…. Can you believe our 3 bowlers for this crucial match were Washington Sundar, Natarajan and Shardul Thakur and of course a 3 tests old Mohd Siraj. And between the first 3 we had 14 wicketsðŸ˜³ and 177 runs ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²And then they win that test match against a full Australian side and win the series.Did this really happen or is this a dream of a desperate Indian cricket lover??? ðŸ˜Š",False

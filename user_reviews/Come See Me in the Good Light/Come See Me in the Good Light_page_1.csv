1,10,Laugh-cry until it hurts,bsmyhzgfk,n/a,15/08/2025,"At Sundance we laughed so hard we cried. Two poets loving each other raw, with a deep sense of trust and honor... Highly recommend if you want to feel alive. Joyfully alive.The film was also stunningly beautiful. There is some funny high jinx going on outside that they return to and the landscape is breathtaking. The whole movie does that- holds two things at once.Some audience members had no idea who these poets were when they showed up, but said they were changed by all they saw. There was so much truth and beauty.If this comes to a theater near me, we'll make a night of it with friends and see it again.",False
2,8,"Heartwarming, touching, and exploration of love and poetry",peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.Get ready for tissues because ouch....this one does hit pretty close to home. The exploration between Andrea Gibson and Megan Falley of their love, relationship and life moments are well-explored as they are placed with emotional, humorous and touching moments throughout. Filmmaker Ryan White approaches Gibson and Falley's relationship solemnly as White is able to explore the aspects of mortality, especially with death approaching, love relationships and how humans and relationships are so impactful and important to one's self. Understanding the notions of human connections and the things humans all encounter and struggle together.Filled with great poetic atmospheres, presentation style, and some really wonderful discussions, it really feels humane. As if you are able to get into the lives of Gibson and Falley, observing each step and important moment of their lives. I don't know them personally at all, but this documentary does a good job on captivating my observation and leaving me with a sense of joy, tears, and heartwarming.Despite having a small gripe regarding certain sound designs (particular because I am a bit peaky with sound notions), it succeeds with it's purpose.",False

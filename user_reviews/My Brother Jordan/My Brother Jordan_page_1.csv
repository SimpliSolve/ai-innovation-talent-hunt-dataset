The film is a moving love letter that not only celebrates the life of a cherished brother but also underscores the profound power of sibling bonds. Justin's heartfelt storytelling draws viewers into his world, creating an intimate portrait of their unbreakable connection, leaving an indelible impact on anyone who watches. As the narrative unfolds, the documentary delicately weaves bittersweet nostalgia with the reminder that our loved ones may be physically gone, but their spirit and influence continue to live on in our hearts.

2,9,This Is Real Life,burnzyburns,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat I love most about this incredible documentary is the way it's told by Justin. Hearing him go through the stages of his brother being healthy and then sick to ultimately his death is told in a very non-fictional, super honest way. There is no sugarcoating this story, and there is nothing cliche about this story even with a lot of people that know and may have experienced someone with cancer whether they survived or not. What I absolutely loved most however was the bond of brothers between Justin and Jordan. I have a brother and I know I would be rocked if he had to go out like that. That was the Cherry on top, knowing what it's like to have someone that close to you, and I feel like that's exactly what loss is like if I ever had to experience it like Justin did.",True
3,10,A Sensational Masterpiece,pconns-77160,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is no way to accurately describe this film, you just have to watch it. It is an experience that takes you through the life of an amazing human being, Jordan Robinson, through the lens of the people whose lives he impacted for the better, especially his younger brother Justin. It serves as the highlight reel of an exceptional life cut far too short, and encompasses the innocent joy of childhood, intense living room boxing matches and driveway basketball games, hilarious homemade movies featuring even more hilarious costumes, the journey from a below average high school basketball player to the star of the team, and the tragic robbery of life at the hands of an infamous affliction. If you watch this film, you probably didn't know Jordan. But after watching it, you feel as if you did. That's the real power of this documentary. It allows you to feel the positive impact of a person you've never even met. After watching this, although it sounds clich√©, you will truly appreciate the loved ones around you so much more and live life to the fullest, because that's exactly what Jordan did his entire life.",False
4,10,Deeply Moving,SarahsSaga,n/a,16/08/2025,"""My Brother Jordan"" is a deeply moving film that touches on life, death, and the game of basketball. More than anything it is a story of a brother's unending, selfless love. 100% Recommend.",False
5,10,"What comes from the heart, goes to the heart",theard33-463-365808,n/a,16/08/2025,Wide open and raw. A beautiful tribute. This film resonates with anyone who has lost someone special to them.,False
6,10,Indescribably powerful.,haleydarnell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cannot say enough about the heartache and brilliance of this film. I laughed, I cried, I reflected, and I hoped. It is a labor of love but also a work of art.It is a filmmaker's job to tell a story well.
It is a brother's job to keep a memory alive.The power of the intersection of these two responsibilities in ""My Brother Jordan"" is indescribable.",False
7,10,We All Grieve Differently. We All Grieve.,jenagmoody,n/a,16/08/2025,"My Brother Jordan weaves honest interviews and precious home movies into a story of a family blitzed by loss.This doc is palpably cathartic. Anyone with a modicum of experience with loss will grieve along with Justin, rejoice in his joyful memories, and understand his process.If the relationship between Jordan and Justin (or Jordan and literally anyone interviewed) teaches anything, it is to love with reckless abandon.When you love big, you hurt big. But Justin tells us that that's OK and the reward far outweighs the risk.Justin's editing is rife with impeccable comic timing and lingering moments, allowing the pain of loss to breathe. A brilliant tribute to a man who, even in death, makes us feel like family.",False
8,10,Cannot be described,lvrcali,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautiful and humble reminder of what humanity is truly about. Engaging, well edited, thoughtful.",False
9,10,"A beautiful tribute to a brother who's gone, but always present",mnews-64985,n/a,16/08/2025,"I accidentally clicked on this documentary, but thought I'd give it a few minutes since I was already there.
I watched it not just once, but twice.
What a beautifully made tribute to a brother whose impact will remain forever with his family and friends. The interviews were so raw and truthful. May we all be remembered as well as Jordan is. Thanks to Jordan's brother, Justin, for sharing his brother with the world.",False
10,10,Masterpiece,noahwarnock,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film tore me apart, built me back up and tore me apart again. 100% recommend.",False
11,10,Incredible story of love and heartache.,austin-taylor-30516,n/a,16/08/2025,This film was one of the most heartfelt films I've seen in a very long time. Justin Robinson truly poured every ounce of his heart and creative potential into this project and it shows.,False
12,10,"Never thought I would write an IMDB review, but this documentary deserves one",franklintruax,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ever since I can remember, I have been obsessed with movies. From superhero Marvel movies, to classics such as The Shawshank Redemption, to hidden gems like Warrior, I genuinely love watching movies. However, while I very often rate movies here on IMDb, I have NEVER left a written review because I know that whatever I was going to say will have already been said by hundreds, if not thousands of others. But after watching this documentary, I felt urged to write a review because 1) this movie needs to be seen by EVERYBODY, 2) I don't care if someone has already said the things I'm going to say, this documentary deserves it.I do not watch that many documentaries. In fact, I can probably count on one hand the amount of docs I have seen; so the fact that I watched this was somewhat of a miracle. It was recommended to my YouTube feed three times, so I finally decided to at least click on it to see what it was about. I was hooked instantly.I don't know if it was the raw emotion right out of the gates by Justin, or if it was the editing of the beginning, but I started watching and could not stop. As a senior in college, I have a lot of things on my plate that I am juggling - and spending an hour just sitting and watching a video is not one that typically takes priority. However, after 2 minutes of watching, I forgot about everything else. I was even late to a meeting because I completely lost track of time.I realize I have not really said a single thing about the movie, but honestly that's a good thing because you should just experience it for yourself. My Brother Jordan is an amazing documentation of brothers and family and love. I am so thankful that this documentary was randomly recommended to me, because it reminded me of all the blessings that God has provided me and how I should never take things for granted.Give this a watch. It is only an hour long ... but if you are like me, you will want to watch it more than once. Fantastic documentary.",False
13,10,I cried constantly,LoverOfFilmsAndMusic,n/a,16/08/2025,"To have someone is create but to have them and love them is a blessing. Justin did an excellent job on this documentary. I have never cried so hard on a film or for a stranger. They had such a beautiful relationship. I envy that type of sibling bond. Jordan was well loved and he loved well. Definitely an angel while on earth. Some people are just too good for this world. My heart goes out to the Robinson family and for Coach's family. Honestly, I can't stand documentaries but this was so beautifully crafted. I felt as if I knew Jordan as well.",False
14,10,Life changing,naultfelixgabriel,n/a,16/08/2025,"My brother Jordan, changed my life. Never have I seen a documentary that convey such deep emotions in a heart-felt, personal and genuinely authentic way. Justin Robinson is truly a genius and exemples of his remarkable artistic sensibility are omnipresent in this masterpiece. My brother Jordan, will probably never get the credit and the recognition it deserves. Sharing an ""ordinary"" life doesn't win you oscars but it can change the lives of ""ordinary"" people and that is the true award. This documentary made me cry, laugh and scream in anger at the injustice of life and death. It renewed my faith and encouraged me to become a better man, a better christian, a better friend and a better brother. This is truly a life changing film and I can only thank god for the chance I have had to stumble upon it in a moment of need.",False
15,10,Beautiful,ricramey2000,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really only review the writing, directing and editing. In the case, it's all the same person. Only going to talk about two of the three. Through the writing and editing I give you a full 10. The writing was tremendous and the editing is truly ""Making the film"". You had me laughing hysterically for a moment then I was nearly a mess in the next 3 minutes due to flawless editing. I've made a film or two in my life (Different name) and I don't think I could've come close to this documentary. Justin, thank you for making this film from not only from your heart, but also sharing it with us. Beautifully done. I tip my hat to you and Jordan. Thank you again!",False
16,10,Everyone should watch,rjharpo,n/a,16/08/2025,Just watch it. If you have siblings this documentary is for you and if you don't then it's also for you,False
17,10,10/10,masimmo,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI never met Jordan. I didn't know who was Jordan before this documentary. Through out the minutes passing I started to realize Jordan was a light, that kind of person that makes us want to live life. We all need Jordan in our lives. I never met Jordan but now I wish I had. Love is for life and this documentary luckily exists to remind us we are alive and loving. An outstanding work by a brother about a brother. You deserve everything Justin and thank you for the courage.",True
18,10,One of the Best Documentaries I've seen,rstabc,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI heard about this documentary on YouTube and from the trailer I immediately knew I had to see it. The home movies had me crying within the first few minutes. This story makes you feel like you really knew Jordan. He left a mark on so many people; he was everyone's friend. Towards the end when you saw how many people attended his funeral, who were part of the documentary, who had tattoos of his name, who named their children after him- you could tell he was truly loved. I can't imagine a better way to commemorate such a great man.",True
19,10,It's unexpectedly perfect,becidgreat,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never heard of this movie before I watched it which I think worked out in my favor. Documentaries can tend to be cerebral and disconnected from the audience. Not this film. First of all the word documentary is less fitting than tribute. It's a tribute to love of life and bearing grief and.sometimes bad things happen to good people. The boy who lived down the block in the house with all the boys and their silly costumes making movies and playing basketball, tells the story. There's a thread of innocence weaving an impulsive and meticulous shroud that the writer never really walks away from with satisfaction that he told Jordan's story as completely as he feels it in his heart. I believe that is the thing I love most about it.",False
20,10,"A Simple Film, a Beautiful Story",trevormdm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I clicked on this video by accident and stayed for a couple of minutes. Next thing I know, I am captivated by Justin Robinson's story of his brother Jordan; watching the entire documentary and leaving with tears in my eyes.We see just how much Jordan Robinson meant to each and every single person that was in his life, and now we are seeing how his story is impacting everybody's life; showing the time that we have with loved ones that we should never take for granted.I am always very critical whenever I review something, so I truly mean it when I say this is one of the most impactful and beautiful documentaries that I have ever seen.Thank you Justin Robinson for sharing the story -
The story of your brother, Jordan.",False
21,10,"just watch it, it's worth it.",barbieriverosvidela,n/a,16/08/2025,"I do not know why this video reached my recommendations on YouTube, but just say thanks for that coincidence. I did not meet Jordan, but if I had wanted to, I feel that the death of a loved one, especially a brother, must be a pain with which it costs too much to continue wanting to live when that person could not, but I thank Justin that he was able to deliver the message that Jordan gave to his friends and family, now through his documentary. It is definitely worth seeing. That is why I write this comment, because I would like everyone to see how a person acting well and without hurting anyone can mark the lives of some forever.
I apologize for my English, I speak Spanish, but I wanted to leave this comment to recommend this beautiful documentary",False
22,10,Thank you,pensacolacomputer,n/a,16/08/2025,"I came across this doc by accident on Youtube. I highly recommend it. It is a very emotional, but important.

23,n/a,I only watched the first 25 minutes,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm sure Jordan was a great human being but I'm sure he also had flaws, like everyone else... hence the desperation I felt after 25 minutes of hearing how great he was at this and that... What is it exactly that will keep me on my sit? Morbidly waiting for the cause of death?",False

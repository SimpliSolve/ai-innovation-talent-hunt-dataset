1,8,I loved it!,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerKim Cannon Arm is a lover and collector of arcade cabinets. He's also a legend in the world of competitive video games, as he and his friends at Copenhagen's Bip Bip Bar are all masters at their own games - and unique life skills - while Kim excels at playing Konami's Gyruss. He's made it to 49 hours or more on a single quarter, but now, at 55 years old, he has set the goal of playing for a hundred straight hours with only quick breaks on a mattress in the corner. This is more than some kind of quest - it's a meticulously planned mission aided and abetted by a cadre of true friends.Director Mads Hedegaard says of the film, ""Probably not everyone in the audience has an interest in video games or arcade games, but that's okay, because you don't need to - I don't either. Ultimately, I feel that it has ended up as a film filled with warmth and subtle wit as well as the natural excitement that comes from all record attempts. Will our hero Kim Cannon Arm succeed in the challenge before him? The characters will hopefully over the course of the film emerge as actual people, who the audience will end up caring about, and perhaps also remind the audience that there is more to all of us than is apparent at first glance.""The players, beyond Kim - who is a laboratory technician, a grandfather and has a beyond world-class mullet, include epistemological rationalist, Bach student and Donkey Kong player Carsten, poetry slam and Puzzle Bobble champ Dyst, data analyst and Donkey Kong champ Svavar, tech and musical wizard Emil, The Shed arcade owner Trier and Bip Bip Bar owner Chrisstoffer.Yet this film is about more than just video games. It's about who we are in the world, what we leave behind, quantum physics and pattern recognition and what friendship can do. I totally expected nothing from this film and was astounded by the energy and emotion that it imbued within me. What a treat!As the director said, ""The film is my little tribute to these people, who in their own quiet ways are larger than life. I hope that the audience will go and see the film with their friends, their significant other, or perhaps even with their mother, if they are in need of a life-affirming and touching experience. And I hope that people will leave the film feeling uplifted, with a bit of food for thought to talk more about, and a warm feeling in their stomach.""Seriously - some of the most mind-opening and happiness-inducing cinema I've seen this year.",True
2,10,Your next arcade documentary after King of Kong,Riskager,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shows that arcadegaming, though often solitary, have a big component of friendship to achieve your goals.Kim is a wonderful person to follow throughout the movie, and his friends sets the tone for the big attempt for playing 100 hours on a single coin!Beware that everyone in the movie speak their native tongue (danish), expect for Svarvar, which for some might be off putting, but it goes to show that this movie is a intimate look at these people everyday life, and that they often react as if there is no camera.The director, Mads Hedegaard, is both witty, immersive and aesthetically pleasing in his shooting of the film. You can really feel his touch throughout all of the movie and it elevates it from being a good movie about arcade bodies, to being a arcade documentary side by side by the likes of King of Kong.",False
3,9,Arcade gaming and strong friendship portrayed at it's finest,ElgenDK,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary not only about a crazy record attempt of playing 100hrs in a row. But also a look into the lives of some fantastic people, their friendship and their community around the love for arcade gaming.Definitely worth watching.",False
4,9,Heartfelt community between outsiders,Captain_Killscreen,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a documentary not only about world records, but a rare look into a world where outsiders can be themselves.This is about the human condition from another perspective, being youself, nonconformity, quality of life and doing the things you love with likeminded people creating an emergent community filled with friendship, positivity and support to do things that seems impossible.Come join them and see if you have been missing out. There is always room for one more.No matter what, it will be an interesting journey.",False
5,10,Must see!,KarinLISp,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is fantastic! This is art with humor and heart, and I love it. It's intelligent, it's new, it's energetic, it's funny and it's enlightening.After watching it, you feel like you just experienced something extraordinary... and you did!Don't think this is a film about archade games! It's SO much more. This is about friendship, philosophy and life. I was both moved to tears and laughter. How often do you experience that in a documentary? I feel like this is reinventing the genre. Only true artists can create a film like this. It's like nothing I've ever seen before and I'm just totally blown away by the cinematic tone. The voice over, the editing and the music is just so captivating!It's a film that I can watch again and again.",False
6,1,Amateur hour,WonderboyDK,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sorry, but this is not a very good documentary. It seems more like a 8th grade school project...",False

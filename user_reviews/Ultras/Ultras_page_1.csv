1,10,Interesting and inspiring!,leahrohdell,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved the documentary! It was very interesting and inspiring! From a person who doesn't know much about football or ultras, the documentary was very educational but also informative about how the football community is a big part of people's lives in the whole world. I will definitely watch this documentary again, not only for the amazing music and inspiring stories, but for the beautiful way Ranghild Ekn√§r are telling the story of football culture and the people in it. I really love the way that all of the supporters that are interviewed in the documentary are anonymous because that's not the important thing with the documentary. 10/10.",False

1,10,A must see documentary,fred-74019,n/a,16/08/2025,The Price Of Freedom is a must see documentary. The influence of this lobby over our public safety has gone on for far to long. This documentary walks viewers through our history with guns and we learn most of our history was focused on gun safety. We also learn how this organization turned and the deadly consequences of that.,False
2,1,ALL reviewers rated this a 10. There is no biased agenda here.,zoolife,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is a microcosm of what's wrong with society. Blindness is growing exponentially, look no further then this film for proof.Unbalanced FactsUnbalanced NarrativeThis movie will never achieve even a middle 5 star rating unless it flooded with ghost reviewers.",False
3,10,Very informative documentary,bethlowthian,n/a,16/08/2025,A well done and very thoroughly researched film. The history of the NRA and it's original mission is well defined as is how the organization's inner politics changed its focus over the years.,False
4,1,One sided,vincerodriguez447,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe documentary claims to be 2 sided but the editors made it so that every time the ""pro 2A"" expert spoke he was debunked with what amounts to strawman arguments. I TRULY tried to give this a chance to be good but the narrative was 95% anti gun with WEAK pro gun arguments sprinked in small amounts throughout it. This is not a documentary, this is a CNN propaganda movie. I'm neither a dedicated rep or dem so I have no horse in the race here. I'm basing my rating on the basis of how lopsided and infactual this film is. They SHOULD BE talking about how I w racism fuels what happens in High crime areas but instead they just blame the nra. Absolutely trash.",True
5,10,Disturbing,dmwebster-99073,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary is very thorough and well researched. I found it quite disturbing and an uneasy glimpse of the extremism that threatens the future of America. The negative review campaign is an indication of how this movie exposes US gun culture and how the truth hurts those it exposes.,False
6,9,Fascinating to see all the Review Bombs,avatarlxxi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lets review: one side of this ""argument"" is VERY well funded, organized, and extremely passionate about the topic. The other side is anything BUT well funded, sporadically organizes a tiny bit after a major event, and, as a political issue, put it at somewhere between property taxes & addressing global warming. The only other main issue the ""Pro"" side really vote on is making abortion illegal and keeping phantom socialists out of office. This issue alone decides a plurality of votes for a very large and passionate demographic.Given this, which side is review bombing the hell out of this thoughtful, balanced movie?",False
7,10,"Powerful, compelling, frightening",wesolowb,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Price of Freedom is a captivating work that is sure to open the eyes of many to the NRA's march to deadly extremism. Despite the reviews of gun absolutists (don't believe them), the truth shines through in this film and should be a call to action for everyone who wants to end gun violence in America.",False
8,10,Important topic - we must stop killing each other in the USA!!,wwsfqnzm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone should see this film, whether you are a gun lover or hater. Please be as informed as possible of the patriarchal history and violence of the NRA. Could not recommend more!",False
9,10,This is an eye opening film everyone should see,sbrue-10154,n/a,16/08/2025,It is only through films like this that we uncover and expose the BIG LIES that divide our society. It was hard to watch an organization that began as a socially responsible group be corrupted. It is only through the free press and independent responsible film makers that truth can be told. We need to know truth and it does shine through in this film. It is a call to action and individual responsibility.,False
10,10,Must-see!,easthamosprey,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is imperative that all Americans, and anyone abroad who is mystified by our sickening attachment to gun violence, see this film. The storytelling is impeccable and eye-opening, and I'm grateful to have this deep-dive look into a world I don't understand.",False

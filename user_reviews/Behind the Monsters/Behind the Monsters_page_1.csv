1,8,Very Good....so far.,Ckrisis,n/a,16/08/2025,"The season premiere, which focuses on the Halloween franchise is an intersting documentary. Very similar to The Movies That Made Us...except in this the interviewees are not afraid to give their full opinions on negative aspects of the film(s).",False
2,10,love this series i hope it gets a chance to finish only 4 ep so far,buckeyefanohiostate,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love documentary's and i love Horror movies to this mix's both very well. So far there has only been 4 ep Jason, Chucky, Michael Myers and Candyman, so they still have a ton of icons and great new or newer monster's and slashers villain's. Each ep is filled with interviews from ppl who wrote the movie to the ppl who made and stared in the film! Really really cant wait till new ep!!!!",False

1,9,Masterpiece,xrwfkdspz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Such a real documentary! Giannis is a role model of a person who will inspire and influence many generations to come. I'm glad that Amazon created this masterpiece. The best documentary I've ever watched related to sports or a person in general. It is filled with fantastic messages about family bonds, integrity of character, loyalty and love. I believe that whoever watches this documentary won't be able to resist from feeling all the emotions that Giannis had been experiencing in various moments of his life, illustrated in the it. It's so emotional and inspiring for everyone to watch, regardless of wether they like basketball or not. It will give you a better perspective in life and help you be grateful for every little thing you have with you might be taking for granted! Absolutely amazing! üëèüëèüëè",False
2,9,From Humble Beginnings to Bucks Glory,mselby-01342,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow this is a massive step up from the last Giannis documentary I saw. This one got pretty emotional and is put together very thoughtfully. What really stood out to me was the blend of archival footage with scenes recreated by younger actors. It added a fresh dimension that was both engaging and insightful. It as also really cool to see footage from his earlier days in Greece, as well as the championship footage that I remember watching live. As a Bucks fan, Giannis is obviously our guy, but I realized through this documentary just how much of his journey and dedication to the game was unknown to many of us. Seeing the extent of his hard work and perseverance laid out like this was not only inspiring but also gave me an even deeper appreciation for what he brings to the court. We are witnessing the making of an absolute legend within the sport. Definitely a must-watch for fans and even the casual viewer who loves a good story of determination and success.",False
3,9,The family first,bahae19,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is a masterfully crafted documentary that dives deep into the life of Giannis Antetokounmpo, showcasing his evolution from a young boy in Greece to an international basketball icon. The film is not just about basketball-it's about overcoming obstacles, staying grounded in family values, and proving that hard work and determination can break down any barriers.The narrative weaves together his struggles, including moments of uncertainty and perseverance, with uplifting milestones that highlight his relentless drive and talent. The cinematography is striking, capturing both the energy of the basketball court and the emotional depth of his personal journey.What sets this documentary apart is its ability to connect with viewers on a human level, even if they're not fans of the sport. Giannis' story is a universal tale of hope and ambition, and the film handles it with care, authenticity, and heart. This is a must.",False
4,10,Well done documentary,RuthMariaK,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all let me disclose that I am an old broad who knows nothing about basketball or who is who in that game (except maybe for the old great ones like Jordan, Bird, James, O'Neal) however, this documentary moved me and it made me happy and made me want to watch a basketball game! It's an inspiring story of how someone dared to dream and worked hard for that dream because he knows it's the only way to get his family out of poverty and out of Greece. This documentary showed us what a person with faith and desire can accomplish in order to be great at what he does. This is the kind of documentary that should be seen by young men and women to inspire them to pursue with all their might what they dare to dream.",False
5,10,Refreshing,emmabmurphy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a refreshing documentary. Many documentaries made about celebrities is like an extended version of cribs ""look what I have now"". They come across materialistic and out of touch with reality. This documentary was different. From start to finish the most important aspect of Giannis' life was his family. His drive, success, and future ambitions were never about himself or his ego; they are fuelled by those he cares about most. He doesn't play down the hard work but shows where determination can get. Success is stepping stones and the support of a loving family is the most important thing along the way. New respect for this man. He's a true inspiration.",False
6,10,What an amazing young man,jfsbndr-10791,n/a,16/08/2025,"Giannis's life is one for the storybooks. If someone tried to tell you the story of a kid from the streets of Greece, who's family has nothing, would one day become one of the greatest players of basketball in the world, you would never believe them. When you find out it's not just about being successful at a game but caring deeply about your family and using that success to help them build a future, the story becomes even more incredible. I live in the Milwaukee area and was a season ticket holder in the years before Giannis. I've always loved our team but watching Giannis grow has been better than being just a fan of the game. You don't need to be a sports fan to understand this story. I hope you watch and I'm sure you'll agree it's about more than basketball. It's about desire, pride, and hard work. But most of all it's about family.",False
7,10,What An Inspiration!!!,zeusubani,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a must-watch for any person that believes in hard work, family values and perseverance. These lie at the core of the man Giannis we all know today. The documentary is a masterpiece. Outside sporting rivalries, it's hard not to love him and see how much of humanity he exudes.The theme around family survival and how it impacts his disposition and his performance was a masterstroke. Maybe this will affect people's thought process per viewing the immigrant next door as more than just leeches and grifters, but folks who, aside from just trying to survive, nurse noble aspirations too.The next documentary on him should be done after he retires. This crowns the earlier efforts to capture the story of the Greek Freak.",False
8,n/a,What a great story!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI was so deeply moved by Giannis, his journey from a barely surviving illegal alien in Greece to be drafted in NBA, his loyalty to Milwaukee Bucks as well as the City of Milwaukee, his filial piety to his parents and love to his brothers. I was so amazed that after his left knee buckled and seriously wounded, he could still force himself recovering in six days period and continued to play the next game. What kind of a willpower could make a man so tough and so endeavor simply by an iron-will did such impossible thing? His love to his families is also so touching and so deep to affect me when I watched this documentary.The direction, editing, scores, camera works are all first rated. Not a bit exaggerated or trying so hard to overly glorify Giannis Antetokounmpo, showing his greatness and also his down-to-earth humble personality. This documentary is one of the films that you don't want to miss. Highly recommended.",True

10,10,Earned it all,slavethemachine,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a basketball fan, but what this man has accomplished & become is incredibly impressive & inspiring! To see this man grow into this great athlete & experience everything new for the first time. Not for himself but the future for his family! It's true amazing, along with his loyalty & dedication to be & do his best,... it's unreal & unheard of!A must watch for everyone, after watching you'll be a fan!

11,10,Inspiring Story,bercemary,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm from Milwaukee, so I was vaguely familiar with this story. But wow. This documentary was so well done. Giannis is incredibly hard working. The bond he has with his family is beautiful and the reason why he is who he is as an athlete. You never hear much about his fianc√© and kids, so I loved hearing directly from Mariah and getting a little glimpse of who he is as a dad. Even if you aren't particularly interested in sports or basketball, this is a sorry of overcoming adversity, coping with grief, working hard, family loyalty and experiencing and cherishing both the joys and sorrows of life.As a Bucks fan the NBA championship win was a pure delight. This unpacks it even more, and what a huge deal this really was. Giannis deserves all the success and praise he receives. One of the all time greatest athletes, and we are privileged to have him here in Milwaukee. Loved every second of this production!!",False
12,1,Seemed contrived,docholliday-49393,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was really dissapointed watching this. It felt as though it was made in a way to make you really empathize with the protagonist of this autobiography, but in the end it felt contrived and dishonest. We have seen it time and time again, when star athletes want to make themselves into a god-like figure prior to the end of their careers by releasing these types of documentaries. I can name a few players which deserve to have their story told more, but they are humble giants who don't spend millions on PR stunts like this. The people who will enjoy this will be hus diehard fans. That's ok if your his fan, but give me great with a large side of humble instead anyway.",False
13,n/a,Great Documentary,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Very inspiring I'm not really a big fan of basketball as it's not a big sport this part of the world but watching from watching a few of this documentaries now I have a beta understand of the game. I shed a tear or 2 over the story just as an African living besides immigrants everyday nd losing my dad at an early age aswel I can relate better.I recommend everybody especially young ppl to watch they will be inspired.As for the treatment international countries give immigrants wish one day it can change there's a guy who says it straight Greece doesn't deserve Gianni and I feel the same pity they embrace the country as they were born there.,False
14,10,A few thoughts,ddlvwrkhi,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a very well told story. I've been a fan of basketball and the NBA since a young boy. This documentary made me think of a few things other than basketball. I couldn't help but think of the challenges my grandparents and my father faced on their journey from Hungary to the US towards the end of WWII. I couldn't help but remember the hard times and fun times I had with my kids when they were toddlers. I watched this fresh after the 2025 finals not knowing much about Giannis and I could not help to think of the restraint he had deep inside himself to not choke out Halliburtons dad when he approached Giannis that way like such an arrogant and cocky fool on national tv after a big game. Giannis truly played the game for his family and in remembrance of his late father. That ""man"" could certainly learn a few lessons from a real father like Giannis and his brothers had. Much respect for the whole Antetokoumpo family. I wish them all the best and another championship for Giannis would be great. Well, as long as it's not against my Warriors! Anyway give this a watch it was very well produced and I learned some things and couldn't help but think how blessed and thankful I am by the grace of God to be born in and have grown up in the USA.",False
15,8,pronounciation name,paulus53,n/a,16/08/2025,In Greek there is no character for the letter B and D.They are written as NT and MP.So the name is Adetokoumbo.The Greek delta is pronoumced as Engish TH.The Greek beta is pronounced as V/W.It seems that the commentaters have a lot of trouble pronouncing the name in the right way.So for instance the English word bar is written as mpar (of course with Greek letters from their alphabet.This a story about people emigrating to Europe out of Afrika. Most people would not prefer Geece and would prefer to go to the Netherlands with all their people coming from all over the world and not so much discimination.,False

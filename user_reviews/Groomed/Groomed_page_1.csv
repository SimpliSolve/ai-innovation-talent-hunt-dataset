6,10,A difficult story well told,lizkinchen-87776,n/a,16/08/2025,"I gave this series 10 stars because this kind of grooming and preying on young teens happens and it damages lives. The more this is brought into the public eye, the better. The betrayal of trust and the secret-keeping are corrosive, and the younger the victim is, the worse the harm. It really is a crime - morally and legally. People may not realize the long-term damage that can result from these relationships, but I speak from experience to say that it runs deep and is long-lasting, and the road to healing is not easy (although doable in part). To come forward is an act of courage, and I applaud Gwen and the other victims who appeared in the film.",False

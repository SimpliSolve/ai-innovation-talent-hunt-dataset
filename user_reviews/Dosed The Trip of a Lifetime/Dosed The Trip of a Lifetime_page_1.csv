1,9,Unexpectantly moving and thought provoking.,thompsonjg-53832,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great film very deep and warming and emotional. I've never tried Psychedelics but I am interested in Psychology, the soul, spirituality and Mental Health. I am a Mental Health Nurse and have recently been diagnosed with some conditions myself and on Ritalin now which is a small dose of an amphetamine..slowing my brain down. Would love research on these mushrooms more in the Mental Health field, so much potential. I am a Christian so I was interested in the spiritual aspect of this film and how psychedelics delve into your spiritual self and use parts ofvyour brsin undiscovered or unusrd before. This ladies story in this film was not what I expected and was heartwarming ...and thought provoking...what to do when facing your own mortality? I just wish this research had come years ago to help my ex who died following being addicted to alcohol..as I can see potential with this in the addiction field too and changing thought patterns in the brain sparking new pathways to discover awareness of self and to open up the mind and creativity and self awareness...and can help with addictive though patterns stuck. I also believe these mushrooms can open up psychic ability too which touched on in the film in a way. I do think this can have a good and bad side ...my Mum had experience with this and LSD in 70s...opened up psychic abilities which were dark so i think needs to be controlled though with the right people around and supportive and safe and to have a strong mind. Great potential for using these mushrooms for all sorts of medical purposes and these helped the lady in the film and her family greatly .. Great case more research and for legalising for medical purposes please...alcohol is the worse substsnce and is legal and a killer...this is not related to film...but the film makes you think about your own experiences with self or loved ones.",False
2,9,"Powerfully emotional family ""trip""",stephenhudecki,n/a,16/08/2025,"Beautiful and compelling, moment after moment in this film. Excellent storytelling of a family's journey through illness with the help of psilocybin. This is a story about a straightforward family who were willing to try something different. It was scary and mind blowing.The filming is first class. The way the camera stays with those times of intense silence where you know the turmoil that is happening internally. Amazing dissolve between one scene and another that was brilliant!A balanced look at the hyped up ideas of psychedelics and health. Well done to the directors and much love to Laurie and her family.",False
3,9,So incredible,bccanderson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such an important movie, timely and life changing information presented in a beautiful way that is sure to impact your way of thinking about plant based medicine and the way healing comes to this world. Laurie's journey is profound and so full of hope. Each person involved has a deep stake in seeing this medicine do what it is designed to do and the producers did an excellent job of capturing both the agonizing moments along with the moments of joy that this family has shared over these past 4 years. Anyone looking for support from trauma of any kind will benefit from watching this movie. Truly a must watch.",False
4,10,A movie everyone needs to see,bgoresky,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazingly well-done second chapter to the original Dosed, with a new story but similar subject matter.The culture around psychedelics is shifting, and this film is a crucial piece of that shift.Get your tissues and get ready for your heart to burst open. You will feel all the feels.10/10.",False
5,10,An incredibly moving story,jordanbakerpickell,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you take a cursory glance at the title, you might think Dosed 2 shows people talking about their funniest psychedelic experiences, or maybe it's a an indictment of the pharmaceutical industry. In reality, this film is a human story, a love story. The focus of the film is Laurie, a woman with Stage 4 cancer. While psilocybin is a key character in her arc, it is hardly what makes this film so compelling. Dosed 2 follows Laurie through difficult health news and decisions. We see her turn to psilocybin-assisted therapy to try to make peace with her own death, while wanting desperately to stay here on Earth with her loving husband, Glen, and 4 young adult children just coming into their own. And somehow, even with such weighty themes, the film strikes a balance by bringing in humour and love. So much love. Watch this film. It will make you laugh and cry and write to your MP/Senator in support of legalization.",False
6,10,Powerful,nokomisbysandie,n/a,16/08/2025,I really felt this film And the journey that Laurie has been going on Is incredibly inspiring. I have had family members and and still have family members with serious health issues. To see that we have other alternatives and to experience the possibilities of taking charge of our healing outside of mainstream.This is something we all need to be open to. Many other cultures use medicines to heal. This medicine That has been used for probably thousands of years By indigenous people.Gives the body The opportunity to take another pathway less invasive more loving more supportive. I would encourage anyone to have this experience. This was an incredible film very emotional.,False
7,10,Enlightening and Inspiring,andykidd99,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very well made documentary with an endearing lead character and a gripping story. Anyone with an interest in psychedelics for helping alleviate anxiety and pain caused by trauma would find this doc a must-see, along with Fantastic Fungi (2019).",False
8,10,A crucial film that resonates with all humans' needs,valerietian,n/a,16/08/2025,"No other film talks about how to live fully and have a healthy relationship with death by finding one's authentic self like this film so thoughtfully and beautifully depicts.Following Laurie, her family, and the filmmaker's journeys, we seem to grow with them as we see the lessons they've learnt about life & death and how to make it all worth it. There are msgs in this film that I think resonate with all humans' fundamental needs so you can't help but see parts of yourself that connect and relate to these people. It's a crucially positive film about topics we have or will face, and what it means to be human.A one of a kind film that would help everyone who sees it!",False
9,10,Dosed 2 - incredibly smart and enjoyable,briankehew,n/a,16/08/2025,"Of course, one would come to the conclusion that this film has an agenda. They're trying to introduce the information that psychedelic therapy can be very beneficial. It's not a new subject, but it is still foreign and somewhat fearful to much of the public - especially some of the public that might benefit from it the most.I saw the first Dosed movie a few years ago, and I was blown away by how good it was. Many of us are tired by CGI and explosions and dragons in films, which is why documentaries have taken on such a big life as part of the film world. Dosed, the original, shows a very clear look at reality (unlike reality TV) and one of the most honest and strong humans I've ever seen. The filmmakers captured her story gently and carefully.But tonight I saw Dosed 2 and I really understood the careful insensitive hand that guided this film to bring a new message. This new subject is more relatable to most people, which I think might be important. The treatment she undergoes is a lot easier to find, less extreme, and more likely to be understood by the general population. From watching the trailer I expected a certain thing, and the movie delivered that but then became very surprising at the end, even more positive than I could ever hope it would be. I won't give away any spoilers...The first Dosed is a must-see; strong and dramatic, educational, and heartfelt. This new edition is focused and easy. Comfortable with the topic, precisely edited and presented to carefully spoon feed you each piece of information so that you understand every step clearly. Anyone could see this film and understand, be they a novice or innocent to that world or an experienced expert. It's pretty remarkable filmmaking, to be able to capture a great story, play with honest emotions, and also bring us one of the most important messages our culture could use.Can't wait to see both films again.",False
10,10,Number Two Blew Me Away,kimleduc-81987,n/a,16/08/2025,"Laurie is a woman ready to make the changes she needed to make, look at the parts of herself that needed attention and willing to break herself open. I am so glad that she had the legal right, that we all need restored, to try an ancient medicine with a novel approach. She said to the audience, who attended a recent showing of Dosed 2, that the paperwork to gain this right was onerous and makes the medicine experience inaccessible. We know that many more people could be helped with existential anxiety at end of life.In this film we have a call to action. Our politicians need to hear from us that we want the right to try these sacred substances.I fell in love with Laurie and her family and all families who are facing ill health and death. We his is us.",False
11,10,A journey we all need to experience,michellephillip-65935,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am so moved by Laurie's journey in this documentary. It's not only informative and educational but it's an emotional journey you get to share on Screen through watching Laurie's story. I was honoured to bear witness to this. Thank you everyone who is involved in this project we need more advocation and understanding to peoples healing and health journeys. I am so inspired and want to try this myself for my own personal growth. One of the best Docs I've seen. Please let's be open like Laurie to alternative medicine and healing and remember it's our bodies and our own personal journey especially with health and I really took that away from this story. Thank you Laurie, her family , Tyler , Nick and everyone involved.",False
12,10,Amazing movie,kelvinwaldner,n/a,16/08/2025,Great introduction to magic mushrooms. Love where this movement is heading. Also grateful to be part of the movement so early on. A complete waste we don't teach about these medicines more.,False
13,10,WOW,baileybrooks-12661,n/a,16/08/2025,"What else can be said! This film is amazing! It's so well done and tells the story so well. Not only Laurie's story, but the story of the healing potential of psychedelics for any one facing any kind of depression (be it facing your own impermanence, feelings of unworthiness, or ptsd, plus so much more!). It brought me to tears. It's such a beautiful film. I recommend it 10/10 whether you are intrigued by psychedelics or are against them. WATCH THIS FILM!!!!",False
14,10,Amazing Must See,beccastillgotit,n/a,16/08/2025,The amazing story that was told will touch your hearts. Not only is it a beautiful story but it's very educational. Viewers will be left breathless. The world needs to see this documentary to see the hard work that the founders are doing to help people in need. What a great way to dive into the minds of what they've been through. The way it was shot is very appealing to the eye. You will feel the emotions that the family has gone through. Dive into a very touching story with a lot of information and questions coming your way. Thank you for this film! It's very special to the people struggling in any way.,False
15,10,Great exploration of psilocybin for therapy,hafiz-09718,n/a,16/08/2025,"There aren't that many movies that portray the experience of psilocybin, let alone do it well and this movie does a great job with explaining and showing how psilocybin can be used for emotional healing, curing anxiety and spiritual experiences. It does a good job of explaining how psychedelics were used and viewed throughout the 60s and how there has been a resurgence of psychedelic research for medical benefits over the last two decades. In particular, I like how the movie followed not only a woman who has cancer, but also her husband and her kids play a major part in the movie and of the overall healing journey.",False
16,10,Everyone needs to see this film.,evajwebber,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary will open your eyes to the true healing powers of plant medicine! Laurie's experiences were presented in such an emotionally raw, beautiful and vulnerable way- weaving her true testimony of psychedelics and plant medicine alongside a larger message of embracing life authentically. This documentary pulls on all the heartstrings and brought me to tears multiple times (while also providing quite a few giggles).While it is certainly educational, I liked that it didn't feel heavy and full of scientific information like many of the current documentaries have in regard to psychedelics. I also loved the visual depictions when she is describing her trip. I couldn't recommend this film enough.",False
17,10,Amazing documentary,jordanmuxworthy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just saw the screening in Abbotsford this evening. What an incredible documentary. The potential of these plant medicines is presented in such an accessible way. The love beneath interaction between family members, therapist, doctor, filmmakers is very apparent. This truly is a film that needs to be viewed by everyone. Being able to listen to all those involved speak after the screening made it very clear that the healing displayed within the documentary is genuine and has the potential to heal a lot of lives. Although it is an uphill battle, I really hope that this movie can garner more attention than the first. With a trifecta of cameos including Paul Stamets, Gábor Máté and Dennis McKenna it has a chance.",False
18,10,Incredible,mrssallybayley,n/a,16/08/2025,"Had me in tears, but in the most beautiful way. I was so invested in Laurie's story and still am, it accurately represented the sacred mushrooms that I know. They're not a party drug, but a beautiful tool and life changing gift that this earth has given us. Had me hooked from start to finish, when usually I can lose interest in things pretty easily. I hope this can open people's eyes and get into the right hands. Everyone needs to view this. Laurie is a gorgeous person too, I loved seeing the love and bond between herself and her family. And Gabor Mate had a small segment, but it was so powerful on being authentic. Such a thought provoking and inspiring movie, thank you. I'll be recommending this to others! I rarely ever review movies.",False
19,10,Touching and Informative love story.,vekis-94110,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazing journey of love, life, trauma and recovery. This film pulls on your heartstrings and allows for all your emotions to feel something. The filmmakers really allow you to feel the emotions that Laurie and family are going through. A lesson to be learned for outside the box thinking and going at things a different way.Anyone that watches this film will be able to resonate with something in it. At any one point you can agree, disagree or even feel triggered by something.There are leading scientists in the psychology and trauma fields (and other fields) that open your mind to how to deal with negative news and events.A great film that entertains and inspires.",False
20,10,Important Movie,ilovebeinggreen88,n/a,16/08/2025,"I feel this is a very important movie because so many people are suffering and the information presented could be extremely beneficial. Laws need to be changed and this movie really helps to explain why.I was very moved by Laurie's journey and her and her families' vulnerability. To see such a personal journey really helped bring home why psilocybin is so important to not just cancer patients, but all of us.I also went through cancer treatments and would have loved to have had psilocybin available to me to help ease my anxiety.It is far past time to remove the stigma and laws that prevent us from accessing this important medicine.",False
21,10,This is groundbreaking work. Please watch this film.,grahamgillies,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a miracle. It shows what is possible. Not a hippy dream, but a story of hard won truths and awakenings within the context of a family not dissimilar to many in the western suburban world. The filmmakers demonstrate the power of developing real relationships with subjects who show what true strength and vulnerability is when facing death. The film is breaking the ground on which we can lay new foundations for a better relationship with ourselves, our neighbours, families, friends and planet. Please don't underestimate the power of a gifted storyteller. It is pure vulnerability and love.",False
22,10,BEST TRIP EVER,tsnxxjjp,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went to see this movie alone. I wanted to do something different and push myself to go by myself. At first I was worried that I wouldn't have fun or enjoy it. My anxiety really wanted me to stay at home, but I'm so glad I pushed thru. I've been on my own mental health journey using mushrooms and cannabis for anxiety, and I know that it works for others, but it feels so isolating at times. I don't like to drink or go out partying like some of my friends do. And I'm very thankful to have a small support group, but I wish I had more of a larger community to access. I wish I could tell my coworkers about it and not feel like I'm going to get fired for taking care of my mental health. So to see a documentary like this and to witness Laurie's journey was monumental for me. Especially since I'm trying to get into the mental health field as a therapist, this was a huge night for me. Hands down the best experience ever. I'm never giving up now. I want to be apart of this huge shift and spread the word as much as I can. Thank you to Laurie and Glen! You guys rock.",False
23,10,Deeply moving and hopeful!,nnhshmbf,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hope this remarkable film Dosed 2, it's brave participants and creators receive the accolades it so deserves. It is an important film to move forward alternate treatments which are cracking open hope for end of life experiences and mental wellness. It is helping to remove the stigma of psilocybin and other treatments that work and moving away from pharmaceuticals and or combining them successfully. Clinical trials are proving it and the results are plain to see in this story. Kudos and gratitude to this brave family who opened up their lives so we could learn from them. This movie will change many lives.",False
24,10,"Engaging, moving, and thought provoking",sameerjain-07525,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI don't watch a lot of documentaries, because part of me finds them insufficiently entertaining.Yet I found this one gripping, moving, and thought-provoking.It particularly resonated with me because I'm interested in both psychedelics and cancer, but I think anyone would enjoy the movie given its gripping narrative, centered around a woman's ups and downs as she fights cancer, and how her surprising decision to take magic mushrooms to come to grips with her journey fundamentally reorients her experience of life.I haven't watched the original Dosed, but now you bet I'm going to!10/10, highly recommend!",True
25,10,Deeply Moving,thebroadsway,n/a,16/08/2025,"A deeply moving film. It asks the viewer to consider that other alternatives are available to anyone seeking to connect to themselves and the Universe we live in.Laurie's story was so touching and authentic. I was deeply connected to the film and felt the creators were attuned not only to Laurie but all of the loved ones around her.Psychedelics have to capacity to heal and the film asks all of us to consider that what we have come to be conditioned to believe, just might not be true.The film asked me to be Being open minded and open hearted. I really enjoyed watching this.Well done!!!!",False

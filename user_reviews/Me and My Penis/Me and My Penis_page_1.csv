1,5,Heath Class Film Predicktable - Me and My Penis,arthur_tafero,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everyone knows that black men have larger penises than white men; at least this is the folklore that has lasted for generations.In reality, they do not. Research has shown that all races are about the same size, give or take. So, that issue can be put to rest.As for the other topics in the film, most of them are covered in boys Health classes in High School, where you would get pretty much the same information without wasting ten bucks on a movie ticket. Not to mention this is not exactly a great date movie.The actors try their best to be engaging and sincere, and for the most part they are, but who wants to listen about penises for an hour and change? I have better things to do.",False
2,10,Revealing in more ways than you'd imagine.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a sentimental, moving and very human documentary, one that tried to break a taboo that has existed forever and a day.Some of the reviews and comments I read about this focussed on one thing only, the images, personally I've never understood what the issue is, such a short sighted mindset.There is so much more to this, we hear about abuse, disappointment, rapture, all of the complexities surrounding men, and their genitalia.Men are such complex characters, this may just give you an idea why.Great job Ajamu. 10/10.",False
3,4,Penis film lacking a core,lime-63833,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film presents itself as an intimate look at men and their relationships to their penis, and its centered around the photographer Ajamu who takes pictures of penises, wanting to break the taboo associated with the penis and erections. However, the film breaks no ground regarding the penis. Several men tell stories about their penis, and most of these stories are quite universal and don't bring anything new to the table. The film is riddled with graphic close up of penises, so the penis is certainly central, but all of the testimonials that actually have any emotional impact are not about the penis, but about unhealthy masculinity and the difficulty of being vulnerable as a man. The film ends up as being two different things; a superficial and faux-artsy look at the penis and how it feels to have one, and also a discussion about what masculinity is, has been, and what it should become. These two topics are not well merged together and the film feels unfocused and without any true mission, at least not one that's about the penis.",False
4,10,E S S E N T I A L !,dion_pangallo,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very important documentary for men in our times. Being a ""short"" man myself, I am glad to see that I am not alone in this. Bravo, well done!",False
5,4,They tried,thijsvaneijk1990,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kind of boring interviews with men about their penises. Nothing new, nothing groundbreaking. Nothing that i din't hear or seen before.I can see what they tried to do, it just didn't came across.What disturbed me the most was the lack of actual diversity in the penises shown. They message they where trying to send would be stronger if they showed all kinds of penises and not only the ""perfect"" ones. I only saw above average model penises. If I wanted to see that i just could have watched a porn video.For the rest I don't have anything to say about this documentary. As I said before, to me it was just boring.",False

1,6,Interesting though quite basic and dry,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary on how the Solar System, and in particular the Earth, was formed. We trace the forces, phenomena and pure chance that over billions of years created the Solar System, Earth and life on it. We also see how the Earth changed in the millions of years after it was formed.A reasonably interesting and edifying documentary. Content is a bit basic and shallow though: we get WHAT happened but are often not provided with WHY it happened. Some of the science and simple randomness of some of the major developments could have been explored in greater depth.Narration is also a but dull and dry. Graphics are okay but feel repetitive and aren't overly helpful.Overall, interesting enough.",False
2,5,Intro to Solar System History,davefoss,n/a,16/08/2025,"I will confess up front that I was turned off by this film right from the start so I only scanned it for content. From my quick review I think this would be a good film for someone who is looking for a quick first overview of the history of the earth or wants to catch up on the latest news since around 2015.The description, however, is just that, descriptive. It focuses on what happened but doesn't get into why. In ather words, it doesn't talk about the science. For example, there no mention of of why dust grains in the early solar system began to clump together, e..g static electricity rather than gravity.Over all I think the film is intended to create a sense of awe in viewers who are not science oriented. The narrator speaks in an intense, dramatic whisper throughout like he's conveying a great secret. Persaonally, I find that really annoying. And every event is illustrated with flashy CGI.",False

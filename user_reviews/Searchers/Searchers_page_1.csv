1,9,Authenticity,Siebert_Tenseven,n/a,16/08/2025,I enjoyed watching this documentary quite a bit. The director uses a method similar to Errol Morris' Interrotron with a news telepromptor type of device that allows a subject to look directly into the camera while interacting with online dating apps. This provides a view of people's faces that we do not usually see: What we look like while viewing a screen deciding who we like and do not like. The gamet of nuanced facial expressions approaches some of the best acting by professional performers. The individuals come across as interesting and authentic. The director also throws in a few scenes of Brooklyn the break the monotony. Very well done!,False

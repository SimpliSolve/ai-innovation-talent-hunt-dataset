1,6,DUDES & DAWGS,brohneskis,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched Trevor's special because I saw him and Young Gravy on Something's Burning with Bert Kreisher. They all got spray tans, it was hilarious. Honestly Trevor is funny comedian, great energy, I like him and his material. Having said that, I was really annoyed by that ridiculous deep voice he kept using, constantly saying ""Dude"" and ""Dawg"" in that voice. I think he said ""dude"" about 300 times in one special. Maybe chill on that weird deepened voice and all the dudes and dawgs and, in my opinion, it would be a better show. I will watch more of his stuff, hopefully it's just a one-off because I like him and think he's a funny dude, Dude!!!",False
2,7,Great start to an exciting career,elipowers-42760,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been watching Trevor for a while now, saw this special release and saved it for a rainy day. It was a good first special, and he was definitely ready for the big lights, but I don't think his material was strong enough yet. You can see the adjustments in real time and the incredible skill he used to read and adapt to the audience when his jokes didn't hit quite right. He made up for it with his quick witt and some classic self deprecation, but I can't help but think he wouldn't have had to if the material was a bit stronger. There's huge potential with his stage presence and great timing. Can't wait to see more from him and his career.",False
3,10,Phenomenal,tommyg-75388,n/a,16/08/2025,"Been following Trevor Wallace since the 2010s and it's beautiful to see his journey here. His stage presence is great and you can tell he's really studies his craft. He embodies the stand up element wonderfully and I felt like I was watching a veteran comedian. I was laughing the whole time and so was my girlfriend. Abive all I love how he could cover a wide variety of topics without being a misogynistic a**hole (unlike one recent standup) and he could even laugh at himself. His ability to refer to old jokes, his impersonations, his crowd interaction and energy it was all wonderful. Really look forward to seeing more of him.",False
4,10,Man of Talents,Dark-Samurai,n/a,16/08/2025,"Trevor Wallace's Pterodactyl is a fast-paced, joke-packed special that proves he's got serious stand-up chops. His quick wit and sharp observations keep the laughs rolling, from hilarious takes on Buc-ee's to awkward dating experiences. He's got a natural ability to riff with the audience, making every moment feel fresh and spontaneous. While he's still settling into his stage presence, his energy, charm, and good vibes make it an easy, fun watch. If you like rapid-fire comedy with a relatable edge, this one's worth your time. Wallace is definitely a comic to watch-this is just the beginning..",False

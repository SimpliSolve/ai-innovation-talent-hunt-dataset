1,10,"To the people who say- ""Not all of the people in this church are bad people.""",dgmdgynhp,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary doesn't imply that every member of this church is a bad person.What it does do:
-It shows that the founder of this church was an abusive man who used his pulpit to preach abuse. He then passed the church down to his even more abusive son to continue that work.It explains how purity culture creates both abusers and victims. By telling boys/men it's normal to not have impulse control when it comes to sexual urges, you're giving an abuser permission. When you tell girls/women that it's their responsibility to keep boys/men pure, you're telling them it's their fault if a man assaults them.It exposes a church system designed to protect abusers and harm victims. The church just shuffles abusive pastors around instead of holding them accountable. This not only extends the abuse, it tells the victim that they don't matter to the church. They are victimized by the church body as well as the abuser.It displays the consequences of the poor sex education these church schools provide. Many of these women didn't even understand what was happening to them.Ultimately, it shows that this is not just a few bad apples, it's a systemic problem with this denomination. That's why this documentary is so important.",True
2,9,believe...or not?,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is really a story about a vendetta brought ahead by a few brave women victims , out of a hoard of silence victims out there(there maybe 10000's of them), being used and mis-/disused in the name of god, a god that is is so strong and and unmercyfilled that my heart nearly bleeds out over these stories, taken out of the secretive ,pretty fundamentalistic and misogynistic IFB church, and showing you the worst parts of the daily life of being a female member of an IFB church of america.Many will disagree to the contents of this series, because people that are brainwashed to believe what the IFB (or other religious faiths ) wants you to believe, and will most surtainly condemn me, the grumpy old man , for believing in these womens tails of life.If you do disagree with me, then keep your eyes wide shut, because the rest of us that considers the love and beauty of life as the most important features of humanity will live on seeking out ways to make this world go around, without fright and punishment that old men once scribbled on a piece of paper.I will recommend this tv serie,along with other series on the same topic, there are many out there if you dare to look.",True
3,5,Normal chair?,carimyers,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fascinating stories that need to be told, but I'm wondering why the filmmakers refuse to let these women sit in a normal chair for their interviews. Twisted around in a pew, on the floor, at the bottom of a staircase, perched on a little crate in a box... it's reinforcing the victimhood of these women. How about a nice comfy wingback or something? These women deserve the comfiest venue possible but no.Aside from the weird blocking, these women deserve to be heard and they have earned our attention. I hope they received psychological support and the men who hurt them are tucked away in their own boxes.",False
4,5,Is half of the truth still the truth?,DeusWar,n/a,16/08/2025,"""I've been watching this. There are many good things being brought to light, but like always, they are broad brushing way too much. The things that happened at Jon Jenkins' and Bruce Goddard's churches do not represent 1% of the Independent Baptists I have known and loved through the years. There must be a clear distinction made between the small minority of men who cover up for sexual predators, and the vast majority of good men who fear God and operate their ministry with integrity."" - Spencer SmithLike many exposure documentaries these days, this one is no different in its treatment of a group in question. Although there are many clearly factual accounts that happened, this documentary goes on to slander all ""IFB"" groups for the sins of a small minority.The Hyles, Ruckman, and Andersonite sects of the IFB world do not necessarily represent the vast majority of honest people that claim this label. Often times the most vocal minorities give the appearance that all are the same way, which is not true at all.Although this exposure needed to happen to clearly show the evils of a minority, it unfortunately unfairly broad-brushed tens of thousands of innocents within this movement, and for that this documentary only tells 'half-truths'.Hopefully viewers will do research on Independent Baptists for themselves rather than accept the wild claims made to broad-brush the group as was done in this documentary.",False

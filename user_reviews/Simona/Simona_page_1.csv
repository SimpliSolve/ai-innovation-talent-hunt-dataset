1,9,"Extraordinary story, music, film.",marthayost,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA stunning story, luscious visuals, and heart piercing original music that will stop your mind. I wonder why this isn't on the Oscar's short list for an Oscar for documentary film?The film is deeply moving, a critical message for our time regarding how to be a human and how to care for the planet in one movie.There benefits and, of course, also repercussions of living in such isolation; not the least of which is misunderstanding communication from others living in a larger context. Alas, still a great film, Simona was a great woman, and kudos to her brilliant niece who made sure Simona's story was told.Please, Oscar, if you're listenini, put this film on your short list.",True

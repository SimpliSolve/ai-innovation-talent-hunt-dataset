1,8,Funny and professional,mhananader,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed watching Nadyia Bakes, her way to present the program was excellent. Hope Netflix repeat this program with another season.",False
2,7,Fun,Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fun and lighthearted baking show hosted by the charming GBBO alum Nadiya. The bakes looked great and she gave good directions and quick tips. Could have done without the baker spotlights, they didn't add much.",False
3,6,Sticky Sweet Comfort Food,owen-watts,n/a,16/08/2025,"Even though she was my hero in Bake Off and in many ways the Greatest Living Human I'd sort of avoided most of Nadiya's BBC output. She's been awkwardly crowbarred into the identikit chef model where in reality she's nothing of the sort. Therefore her often quite whacky recipes seem oddly out of place in the light and spacious model kitchen, cooking over the ""Greatest Inoffensive TV Background Music Hits of the Early 00s"". It all feels rather stiff and safe, when the great joy in watching Nadiya is her effusive joy and honest reactions.In the defense of the production team there is a pandemic on - so the slightly awkward ""cut to professional chef doing what amounts to a short promo vid"" was likely meant to be a cooking guest spot and the (by the end of the series) forced ""let's all get the crew to have some food finale"" bits make the whole thing seem off-balanced. I mean - it's a cooking show with Nadiya, you get to see her bake stuff and grin happily, there's a camera in the oven which is quite cool. It does the job essentially.What I sort of hope is that she gets even more of an identity - she's done ""travelcook"" shows before and they always work much better than this. There's another in the pipeline but... you know. Circumstances. The most important thing is that she's happy and baking on the Beeb - I still remember being overjoyed with happiness when she won Bake Off and her having this career at all is utterly magnificent.",False
4,10,She's a sweet treat .,sonjimorrissmith,n/a,16/08/2025,Nadiya makes me want to bake period. Her show makes me feel like I can not only are her recipes are easy to follow. She's a sweet treat that will make you smile with delicious foods.,False
5,9,Everything a Baking show should be,koolhandkarl,n/a,16/08/2025,"I rooted for Nadiya when she was on the Great British Baking Show and I was delighted that Netflix gave her not one, but two shows. I watched an episode of Time to Cook, but I find that I like to watch baking better. Nadiya is fun, sweet, energetic and makes some tempting looking bakes. I already have plans to make her strawberry shortcake cupcakes. The editing, color and videography are to be commended as well. Nadiya is a lovely host and very relatable and down to earth.
A great watch all around.",False
6,10,Therapy in a show,melissa-erin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nadiya's joy is palpable while she's in her element. It's a pleasure to watch. During these tough times for the world, it's such a sunny, happy, soothing show to watch of someone whose passion and excitement is contagious. I'm
not sure what the negative reviewer's expectation was; after all it's called ""Nadiya Bakes,"" not ""How to Bake."" The recipes are available if your goal is to learn. Otherwise, I'm content watching this lovely expressive joyful person bake to her heart's content.",False
7,9,What a charmer,wmarkdyer,n/a,16/08/2025,I mean she is a star. Is that enough? No it's not. Well she's better than the cooks they have on the Ametican shows. That's for sure.,False
8,1,Not a great Show to learn,bhushanpatil-55313,n/a,16/08/2025,Showed mostly frozen food - whatta waste! Every dish has frozen food in it. How can one encourage for it?,False
9,10,Upbeat and accessible,sugarqueen2,n/a,16/08/2025,I only wish her recipes were more translatable into American metrics.,False
10,10,Best cooking show for me,anwarkj,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is undoubtedly the best cooking show for me. Each episode captivated me, and I found myself thoroughly enjoying every moment. The host is truly on another level, elevating the entire experience with her charming personality. Her presence makes baking not just a culinary delight but a genuinely enjoyable journey. The way she effortlessly weaves motivation into her demonstrations is inspiring; even the laziest person on this earth-myself-felt a newfound enthusiasm. It's not just a cooking show; it's a delightful and uplifting culinary experience. Love love love love love love love love love.",False
11,n/a,flavors of life,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Her enthusiasm is the basic ingredient of a show not only, not first about food, dishes, art of cooking but about flavors of life.The joy to live, this is the precious gift of Nadya Hussain and the source of seduction of each episode. Sure, a reality TV. Special for a sort of fair familiarity , for advices and secrets and for the beautiful dosis of good feeling.",False

1,8,"Fascinating follow-up on the upheaval when the Copenhagen Zoo killed giraffe Marius, raising many questions about life, death and consciousness",JvH48,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at IDFA 2024, the documentary film festival in Amsterdam. Fascinating extrapolation of the upheaval after giraffe Marius was put down by the Copenhagen Zoo, an action that was misunderstood by virtually everyone world-wide. Compelling existential questions are raised and put before a variety of experts, and partly answered or at least reasoned about it while we watch and learn.Particularly interesting were the multitude of reactions from the USA. One celebrity tried to buy Marius, but his 3-million-dollar offer was flatly refused by the zoo-director, the reaction of the latter being described as cold and devoid of animal care. A zoo owner in Chechnya was also shown a few times, having other arguments to take over Marius, but he was refused too. The remains of Marius were dissected in full public view, including children, the latter fact also misunderstood, as per a Fox News show where was said that the children watched it ""in horror"" (we saw nothing of the kind, merely interested looks instead of horror). And on top of all that misconduct, again as per the critics, the remains of Marius were fed to the lions, everything in public view. The zoo-director got every opportunity to explain why he did what he did, over and over telling us that all this was part of normal life and there was nothing wrong with showing it to adults and children alike.Lots of scientists were consulted about the issues above, and many other related topics. That is where the existential questions come in. Think of what ""consciousness"" is (which animals have it and which not??), and what about ""life""?? Despite the variety of experts consulted, there were no easy answers and no easy solutions.All in all, a fascinating journey along notions of life/creation/existence and consciousness. Thought provoking, providing ample material to talk about after the screening. The horrified reactions all over the world went past me. I may be prejudiced because of being grown up on a farm where life and death are close by phenomena, contrary to people for whom it remains hidden where their food comes from.",False
2,5,A Story To Secretly Reveal Another Story,tomaspartl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLife And Other Problems tells a story of a man named Max who wants to find the meaning of life by interviewing mostly various scientists and asking them questions like: ""Why does life exist?"", ""What is the purpose of life?"", ""What is the difference between a man and an animal?"", etc. This storyline is somewhat frustrating, because the questions are vague and the answers are vague, meaningless, factually dubious or any combination of the above. But along the way, Max drops subtle clues that eventually tell another, completely different story, perhaps the one he wanted to tell in the first place but didn't find the courage to. This story appears if you follow Max's off-hand remarks about his personal life scattered throughout the movie. If you want to piece it together by yourself, stop reading now.--- SPOILER ALERT!!! THE REST IS ALL SPOILERS!!! ---The hidden story is this: Max is a middle-aged man and his eldest daughter is about to move out of his house. Max is incredible sad about it. It's a natural event but the loss of his daughter's company is crushing to him. To make things worse, Max is unable to express his emotions, because he has learned not to have any emotions in the first place. This runs in his family since his grandfather starved to death, probably in a concentration camp, during World War II. Since then, everyone in his family had to be strong, no emotions were allowed, because they could be devastating.But this time, Max's grief is so great it threatens to break out and wreak havoc on his perfectly controlled, emotionless world. So Max starts looking for ways to suppress his emotions once again. His preferred method is rationalization of the sort: ""It makes no sense to be sad, because... (insert a comforting intellectual explanation here).""He turns to biologists, hoping they could explain to him that grief makes no sense First, he tries to learn from a zoo employee who decides to kill a healthy giraffe. This man's resistance to emotions is remarkable. People are crying in his face, begging him to sell the giraffe to them for a million dollars, yet he always finds a rational-sounding explanation why he won't do it. It seems like he's perfectly mastered the skill of ignoring emotions but Max isn't satisfied (perhaps because the zoo man only ignores the grief of others and actually seems to kill the giraffe for his own pleasure).So Max tries other biologists and digs up an esoteric book from about 200 years ago. Then he uses the scientists vague answers to his vague questions and the material from the book to create an esoteric religion that explains to him that everything in the universe is connected, so he can never be away from his daughter, and God may actually exists, because some scientists believe he does. And that's it. This is enough to help Max restore his former emotion-free composure and the film ends.Personally, I'd be more interested to see a film about Max trying to muster the courage to tell his daughter how much he cares about her, and digging through his family's past but for that, we may have to wait until his younger daughter is ready to move out.",True

1,6,Why is this in the 4's?,woloszynn,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm gonna do JB a solid.For the record, I have never been a JB fan. I watched this movie because someone else in the house was watching it...ok, I'll endure. Though still not a JB fan, the ""rockumentary"" was good. It was personal, it was insightful, and it was entertaining. If you're a JB fan, you should love it. I walked away having listened to more JB than I ever have, like EVER, and even ended up liking a few tunes. I'm not running out to buy JB merch, but it's def a solid 6 stars. (Dropping da mic)",False
2,6,Good but not great,prateek-55271,n/a,16/08/2025,It's more about him performing and less behind the scenes footage. Should have contained more about his story and lifestyle and how he achieved everything and how being famous effect your life as a whole.,False
3,4,Good,wmuss,n/a,16/08/2025,I like the part where Justin is in it. He's just really cool yk yk.,False
4,3,Should have been pushed as a concert NOT documentary,ecgodon,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was really hoping it would be a documentary, with more behind the scenes and introspection. The trailer gave you about all you were going to get of the documentary portion this film had to offer. Lots of music, which was nice.. just not what I was hong for. Instead, I saw what looked like a very sad/ lonely man, performing and trying t show the world he is older wiser and happier.",False
5,2,"When the concert was over, nobody wanted an encore.",jaspercole,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bieber looks bored.While watching this, I kept on getting the feeling that he was offered a lot of money to return to the stage after three years and that he really doesn't want to be there. During the performance he spends half of his time looking down while he sings and the other half, with his head held up but not held high to actually look at the concert goers who are watching him from their hotel balconies.I guess Bieber fans will enjoy it because all the songs he sings sound like they do on the radio.",False
6,1,Can I move to Denmark?,Booya70,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why? Why was this made? Why? Lost, like a bottle floating from Massachusetts to an unknown destination. Somehow to be a found by an innocent stranger in perhaps a neighboring town, or perhaps not. Either way, throw it back. The bottle is garbage, and so is Bieber.Amazon, you deserve to be grounded for this.",False
7,10,Love this üíú,nikunjakishorebehera,n/a,16/08/2025,I can watch this again and again. It's an amazing documentary. Idk why people hate this is an outstanding documentary. Justin and Hailey have literally blessed me by giving this awesome documentary. This just made this year better for me. It's sad how people are giving this without even watching. This deserves better.,False
8,1,Clear moneygrab,Beevy,n/a,16/08/2025,"His fans will watch and admire any footage of him anyway. Shameless moneygrab and attempt to make himself bigger than he is (bc hey, every big star should have a docu right?)",False
9,9,I really liked it.,nat90505,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a fan, this will bring a smile to your face and you won't be able to help but dance along to some of the songs. So happy to see the man he has become. Haters gonna hate, but at 57, I'm definitely not his target audience age wise and I really enjoyed it.",False

11,1,Not really a documentary,reedandrea,n/a,16/08/2025,More of a concert. Not really a documentary. Boring. Didn't finish watching it. Not much else to say. Should have read reviews before starting it. Have nothing else to say but I have to hit the word limit to post this review.,False
12,2,Hard to watch,hodivamo,n/a,16/08/2025,This singer has silly songs and and attempts to enjoy them. Perhaps the singer outgrew the songs. It does not fit and unbearable to watch. Two stars for the lady that appears on film.,False
13,1,Toe jam or talent ....,paul_obe,n/a,16/08/2025,Got to 5 mins and turned it off ... little spoilt Canadian kid who thinks he's hardcore because why ? He sings songs ? .....Wake me up in the new world this planet has lost the plot .....,False
14,10,AWESOME Pandemic Concert!,pauditsilmikaffahbekasi,n/a,16/08/2025,The Pandemic Concert LIKE NO OTHERS! Look how they manage and set all this to be in places and the result is awesome! Justin always has story to tell he never runs out of it and people are always there to watch him and listen to him. Proud of his journeyüëèüôå‚ô•,False
15,10,perfect,gnanapiccino,n/a,16/08/2025,Always nice to see my childhood idol üíú this movie shows his back to the music world and the songs are all great.,False
16,10,Crisp glims to what it takes to arrange an concert,siddharthpal-94671,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is not like his Believe documentary, but its a sweet and exact description of arranging an virtual concert. Starting from preparation of team to making of stage, the lighting everything is covered in the movie.It is loaded with all of Justin's performances during his new year eve show. A 100% score from me.",False
17,8,I really like this idea!,erinrjuarez-78810,n/a,16/08/2025,"I like the idea of documenting a behind the stage look at producing a concert in a pandemic, with all the hiccups and road blocks that came along with it. There are not many artists doing this and ia more appreciated because of that reason. It also shines a light on the hard work and dedication from ALL the staff and JB himself. I enjoyed the concert and the cutaways of all the BTS cuts and/or candid JB and Hailey cuts. It made it feel like a more intimate BTS doc.I have definitely grown very fond of JB not only for his mad music skills, but genuinely for the human being he is in this world. He is unique, talented, and a true visual. Although he has had his fair share of struggles, he is a true reflection of being a real person. It just so happens he did it in the public eye. I admire that he did not to take his platform for granted and has grown into a very cool dude. I have had my fair share of struggles in life and can relate to him on many levels. He speaks out about his struggles and is giving others encouragement just by reminding others they're not alone.For those out there that ask if JB is still making music, have you been listening to legit music platforms or have you checked music stats over the last few years. The dude is killing it! He is soooo gifted and because he is on so many collabs, he doesn't get all the cred. But, still he is always topping charts and just straight up putting out crazy amazing songs. You should at least listen before you judge it. Just sayin.",False
18,9,still a belieber!,otisreviews,n/a,16/08/2025,"I definitely agree that this is more of a concert than a documentary. However, the choreography and the mixture of songs from all throughout justin's career was nostalgic and he did a killer job for this being his first performance in 3 years!! <3.",False
19,10,Amazing Grace,kcr-65095,n/a,16/08/2025,King of all genres. Above all this movie provides a determination in the music life and be worldwide superstar.,False
20,10,I love this movie.,kuldeepbharapte,n/a,16/08/2025,This is an awesome movie. It is simply great. The way it has been made is the great one. And after watching this movie you are going to be a Belieber. I too watched it many times. And I still love Justin Bieber....,False
21,n/a,Documentary?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"More of a concert than a documentary. There's a lot of music, the problem is the music isn't very good. Fans of Bieber will like it and he won't convert any new fans. At this point any Justin Bieber film is just a money grab aimed at his existing fan base. Nothing really meaningful to see here.",False

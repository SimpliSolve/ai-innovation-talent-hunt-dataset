1,1,That this movie is under the documentary category is an insult to cinema.,charles-f-berthoud,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThat this movie is under the documentary category is an insult to cinema.120 painful minutes of a one sided story with no cross reference interviews from anyone who is not on Ilary's side.Shot and scored like a thriller giving the fake impression that something is going to happen but ultimately the audience learns nothing new than what they did going into this snooze fest of a puff piece; that her husband cheated on her and to spite her hid her handbags and shoes. Mind blowing investigative journalism. Bravo Alessandro Marzullo, can't wait to avoid anything that has your name attached to it for the rest of my life.Special shout out to my girlfriend who dragged me along on this journey of misery.",True
2,1,Limitless self-expression,gsuennemann,n/a,16/08/2025,"Belongs in the family album, not on Netflix!This decadent self-pity of a millionaire is hard to bear and is not portrayed believably. She's probably using the story to make a little extra money. The tears are strikingly fake. She was even too lazy to carry the luxury shoes and bags hidden by her husband out of their hiding place by herself and informed the nanny. I think she finally softened, has her children around her and lives in an 18 million dollar estate. Producing a film out of this is the height of impudence. Other victims fall into the abyss and their future is uncertain. Overall, you should save this film and laugh at the method.",False

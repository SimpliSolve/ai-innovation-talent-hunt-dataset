1,9,PM ScoMo doesn't hold a hose...,andrewbunney,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great Australian documentary about the effect of the massive and unprecedented 2019 bushfires on a small community in NSW. There are vivid images, both hectic footage and grand still photos of the firestorm approaching the towns of Balmoral and Cobargo, and the response, and the inevitable tragedy of loss of life and property. But the real focus is on the aftermath.The town's ordeal is set in the context of the many fires that devastated the east coast of Australia that summer. There is also the context of the preceding drought, the changing climate and then the Covid 19 pandemic which too quickly pushed the fire damage into history and stymied reconstruction.However prepared, dedicated and even gung-ho the Rural Fire Service volunteers were, this fire left psychological trauma that had no precedent and still requires close attention. Generations of firefighters from one family are a focus, as are the other stoic but shaken diverse characters of the township; the Asian late arrivals, the First Nations fire expert, the mothers and the grandparents. There are many good stories from different threads.It is a tale of bravery, destruction, trauma, resilience and gradual recovery, told through the microcosm of one small community. Sometimes they are understandably inarticulate but other times guilelessly nail the issues faced by so many. This is true life & death drama and everyday, death-defying heroism. Lingering are survivor guilt, depression, financial hardship and family breakdown.But resilience is slowly fostered through talking, tears and psychological support, making the viewing experience ultimately upbeat and feelgood.(This film could well have featured the Australian Prime Minister holidaying in Hawaii at the time and saying he doesn't hold a hose. Chilling.)",False

1,7,Sad,kakaxplivebr,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMy second documentary film in my Disney+ marathon.I'm not going to judge the old man who decided to stay home, I would have left but I understand him.I'm shocked watching this documentary because the survivors interviewed seem to be happy for the catastrophe.Americans are strange, they didn't even think about the families that were left with nothing.Wow, the surviving cameraman managed to record the moment, I found that very interesting.Good thing the woodcutters survived, some of them.I loved the brothers who tried to save the horses, the best survivors of this catastrophe, as I understand the horses died, right?Conclusion: Sad for the people who didn't survive but sadder for the people who survived and say it was the best moment of their lives, revolting.",True

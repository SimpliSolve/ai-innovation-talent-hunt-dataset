1,8,Must view for any wrestling fan that remembers classic feuds!,blanbrn,n/a,16/08/2025,"New series now on Sunday nights after ""WWE Legends Biography"", on ""A@E"" and that's ""WWE Rivals"" which looks back at the most well known and remembered grudge feuds in ""WWE"" history. Featured are clips and highlights and interviews with the involved foes and roundtable talk and discussions are given the most notable takers and talkers are the late daughter of Jimmy Snuka and actor and mega wrestling fan Freddie Prinze Jr. Really takes a fan back in time as you enjoy seeing the hate between Shawn Michaels and Brett Hart and The Undertaker and Kane. A real vintage joy that any historical wrestling fan will love and cherish.",False
2,6,Great production but still towing the company line,anthonyjames18,n/a,16/08/2025,Once again a great idea and produced really well but unfortunately WWE trying to rewrite history in their favour. Using Bruce Pritchard you know you are going to get a skewered and disingenuous take on the events that took place and may as well check out while he is talking rubbish. It's really unfortunate as it seems a great concept but like anything with WWE you have to take what they tell you with a massive pinch of salt.,False

1,8,Stories about the People behind the Games,ianparmenter,n/a,15/08/2025,"As an avid boardgame enthusiast, I found this to be a fun look at some of the people who create games and their stories about why they create games. I was a little disappointed that they didn't go more in-depth into the actual process of making the games (design, playtesting, etc), but they added more of a human story to the making of these games, and how having created a successful game can change parts of your life.TL;dr: It's not about the games, it's about the people who make them. As long as you know that going in and aren't expecting otherwise, you'll enjoy it.",False
2,8,"If you enjoyed Indie Game, you'll enjoy this!",alyssamcarroll,n/a,15/08/2025,"Really interesting documentary. If you enjoyed the movie ""Indie Game"" then you'll enjoy this. It's a lot of fun to watch people navigate creating games.",False
3,6,Gaming made public.,zippocs,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie is a good idea, I've played loads of board games over the years. Unfortunately this feels like a long commercial though for games in the end. It's nice to see the persons behind the products though. If you love games you will enjoy this nevertheless, if not then don't bother.",False
4,10,Amazing!!!,huesteen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great documentary about the hustle and grind that go into making, marketing, and selling board games. Very informative and made me truly appreciate the art that goes into designing board games!! 100% recommend!! Watch it! Enjoy it! Love!!!! 10/10",False
5,5,Not what I thought,kur1su,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're looking for a documentary about the actual boardgaming hobby, look elsewhere. This is mostly about non-professional artists trying to get their stuff kickstarted - games you'll never have heard of, and one super casual but successful cardgame. There is not much focus on actual games, regional differences; mechanisms, or the boardgame culture (except that it is ""too white"") and while some legendary designers are being interviewed, these segments are rather short and not really about their games.",False
6,10,Frankly Superb,hectorlowe-95824,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary wonderfully captures the journey of several game-designers as they take their projects from concept to execution. A fascinating narrative unfolds across different people's lives, exploring diverse backgrounds and creative imaginations. Personal and engaging. Exactly what I wanted.",False
7,5,Great topic but lacks focus,blott2319-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"I adore the boardgaming hobby, and I was intrigued the minute I saw that this documentary existed because I was interested to see how it would approach the topic. I appreciated that the film involved some specific designers, and explored their different journeys in releasing/publishing their games. It's also a lot of fun seeing a number of slightly obscure games I know and love as they are discussed and shown throughout the film. However, I felt like Gamemaster lacked focus. It covered tons of aspects of the hobby, but never settled down long enough to dig deep on any one of these topics. As a result, I didn't feel like I learned much of anything that I didn't already know from being an active member of the Boardgamegeek community. I suppose this might be a bit more educational for those who are just discovering the boardgaming hobby, but even for them I feel it lacks some of the information that would be most interesting. There is not a lot of time spent relaying the stories of game players, and what it is about specific games that draw them in and make them love playing. The film was more interested in the publishing process, which I suppose can be interesting for aspiring designers, but not for your average person. I still appreciated Gamemaster for shining a light on my favorite hobby, but I wish it was better so I could tell all my friends to seek it out on Amazon Prime so that it might spark an interest in gaming.",False
8,10,"Fun, exciting and heartwarming",kmth3,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't know what i was expecting from this but thought it would be an interesting subject to learn about and I got a lot more than I bargained for it, was fun, heartwarming, smart and exciting! Never knew how much went into boardgames.",False
9,10,Fantastic Documentary made with passion and unique perspective,pinky1234,n/a,15/08/2025,"Whether you're into board games or not, it's hard not to love this doc! One of the things I really appreciated was the way it approached the artistry of game design, focusing on the creative drive behind some of our favorite board games (as well as more obscure ones with fun and interesting backstories), resulting in a newfound appreciation for the process and its pioneers. The best docs open your mind to worlds and paradigms you may never have understood, while unearthing deeper meaning for those already versed in the subject matter. This doc successfully does both but, most importantly, is made in an entertaining spirit that leaves you wanting more and initiates numerous post-watch Wikipedia searches. 10/10 from me!",False
10,10,Phenomenal Job,graytail,n/a,15/08/2025,"An honest inside view on the journey of boardgame creators. Refreshing and informative, this beautifully edited documentary sheds light on entrepreneurism and the whole creative process. A must watch",False
11,10,"A fun, heartwarming look at game creators",bebochiva,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't even play board games very much, but I really enjoyed this documentary. Not only does it give you a rare insider's view into gaming, game design, and game design competition, but you learn about the inspiration and tribulations of several aspiring game designers.",False
12,10,"LOVED - charming, enlightening and fun!",kaylievhart6,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a huge board game fan myself, I never actually thought about the world of games outside of my apartment and I am SO happy this documentary exists! It's the gift I didn't know I needed. It was so eye opening and just plain fun. I loved the journey we followed of these various game makers and learning what goes into making a game. I am so happy they were able to finally get their day in the spotlight too. I watched it with my family and we all came away from it with a smile on our faces, definitely a fun, family-friendly film to watch that leaves you feeling warm and wanting to play something!",False
13,10,Fun Movie,briannaopp-838-3552,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love board games so for me this movie was very enjoyable! It was so cool to learn more about this industry! Normally, I'm weary about documentaries but this one was awesome ! My family loved it as well! Highly recommend for all ages!",False
14,10,Fantastic film,MantissX,n/a,15/08/2025,What a joyful and thorough exploration of a wonderful hobby that has lived in the shadows for far too long. Kudos to the filmmakers!,False
15,10,Awesome overview of the game designing world!,Killashark21,n/a,15/08/2025,This movie was dope!! I'm more of a casual table top gamer and had honestly never thought about the ins and outs of how the creative minds (dare I say geniuses!) behind the games actually managed to get their projects from the spark of an idea all the way to the finish line. This movie covers a TON of ground - everything from indie game designers and their successes - and failures - with putting their games on Kickstarter to the big guns behind some of the best known table top games (CATAN!!!!). If you're already super into the gaming hobby I'd bet it's awesome to actually meet some of the people who created the games you love (I know it was for me - see earlier mention of CATAN!!!) and if you're not - there's honestly so much in here about the creative process v. the business behind it all and how these designers truly use games as an artistic format to tell a story. It was really relatable and universal for a movie about such a niche hobby. Love love loved it!!!,False
16,10,Fun movie about board games and the people who make them,CitizenSugarKane,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this on Amazon Prime. Such a fun movie. This is by far the best documentary on board games out there. It's not just a good board game documentary, it's a good documentary period. My girlfriend who does not love board games watched it and she loved it. Highly recommend.",False
17,10,Enjoyed every second,Omar-94,n/a,15/08/2025,Great to be introduced into a world and process I had no idea existed. Brilliantly done!!!,False
18,10,Absolutely Fantastic!,jnelsonoliver,n/a,15/08/2025,Fantastic telling of the story about game designers and bringing their projects to life! Very informative and interesting!,False
19,10,Great Insight into Board Games and their creators,heidigenrich,n/a,15/08/2025,I really enjoyed looking at the path of indie designers as well as insights from the big name publishers/designers. Lovely spread of games and conventions and people. I strongly recommend it!,False
20,10,Highly entertaining documentary,MollyLeland,n/a,15/08/2025,My husband and I loved this doc. I particularly liked the way the filmmakers captured how making a game is just as much a form of creative expression as writing a book or painting. I highly recommend this film.,False
21,9,A fun look inside the game box,t_miltner,n/a,15/08/2025,This is an entertaining look into what goes into creating a board game.,False

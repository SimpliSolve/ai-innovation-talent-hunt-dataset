1,8,I get it,almeisso-03950,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's a different approach. It highlights the stories of people in contrast to the trees, which are often generations old. If you think about it that way, each tree might have a thousand stories. The documentary also highlights how fragile trees are.I know this. I have a few acres and lost about 20 trees in a tornado. I've spent the last four years planting about 100 or so trees of which perhaps 60 are alive. My point being, they are easy to destroy, but hard to reestablish.We need trees. And they can grow back. Subduing the earth does not mean destroying it. Good stewardship is vital. It's part of all of our stories.",True
2,8,A Different Way to See the World,Sil-Azevedo,n/a,16/08/2025,"I would not be normally drawn to a documentary about trees. In this case, what caught my attention was the fact that the director was Irene Taylor, who recently released the excellent documentary on Celine Dion. I was not disappointed. In this film, different stories intertwine in unexpected ways, very much like the branches Irene and her son clear from an old tree at the beginning of the movie. The lush cinematography doesn't hurt either.Today I was watching my grandchildren play at the park and my wife called my attention to a gorgeous tree behind the playground. I wonder if she would have noticed before we watched this film. I can say that I certainly looked at the tree with new eyes, more full of wonder. This alone tells me this documentary was worth watching.",False
3,10,Fascinating and moving,tcbueti-536-762615,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary explores some of the many ways humans interact with trees, and how trees hold our stories. From logging, planting, and photographing trees to the art form of bonsai trees and the people who create them, in collaboration with nature. I know this will encourage me to take a closer look at the trees around me, and a greater appreciation of how powerful and persistent they are. The way the stories are interwoven is very artful, and they overlap in interesting way, most coming to a satisfying stopping point, others leaving the viewer with concerns and/or questions to pursue. This film is also simply beautiful, with some of the most striking scenery I've ever seen. Very memorable. Perfect title, too.",False
4,1,"trees are ""useful""",pbpgbqm,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is really about how trees are ""useful"" to people, as well as a hagiography to Weyerhauser. Far from being inspired by ""The Overstory"", it is almost devoid of either the science of trees, or the feelings people have as the great forests are being destroyed. Sure, lots of shots of miles of felled trees, but then we learn that hey, Weyerhauser has planted 2 billion trees. We even meet the ex-hippies that planted alot of them. What we don't learn is that by planting them as mono-crops, they are destroying what was once a diverse ecosystem, and merely delaying the inevitable environmental collapse and the soil gets depleted.There is no spirit of investigation, of challenging power (so central to ""The Overstory""), and for a film set in the Pacific Northwest, not a word about Native Americans!",False
5,3,Another one for the wood chipper,fbcxxw,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a lover of trees and nature, I was immediately hooked when seeing the thumbnail on HBO. But unfortunately the doc failed to deliver value past the cover.The story feels scattered and the storytellers did a poor job of making me feel invested in the characters or the picture they were trying to paint. It could have been the Mona Lisa- but instead it feels more like a childs crayon drawing on the street.Mid-way in a grown-ass woman is hysterially crying about her parents cherry tree being cut down years ago, which was supposed to be a powerful moment of empathy. But instead it made me feel unsettled, wishing that the filmmaker would lay down the camera and get that women to a therapist ASAP.After one hour of watching, Im honestly not even sure what point the doc is trying to make. It somehow made me feel less appealed to both trees and humans at the same time. Which is impressive.Spend the 1 HR 49 MIN out in the woods instead, it will be far more rewarding. A solid 3/10.",True
6,3,Was this a Weyerhauser PR film?,crimsonwolf-96374,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerUltimately, not sure what this film was actually about. At the outset, it implied that it was all about trees. Okay. But although each segment did have something to do with trees, it often wandered off into people's personal stories that had only superficial relevance to trees. In addition, many of the segments seemed to circle back to things to do with Weyerhauser. Yes there were some segments that didn't, but those seemed to be included as ""window dressing"" to lure the viewer into watching the segments that were related to Weyerhauser. All in all, this ""documentary"" seemed very disjointed and lacked focus. I found myself asking ""who cares"" and ""relevance?"" about big segments of this film. If you love nature, the environment and trees, you won't find a lot here actually addressing that in any meaningful way as it meandered off into pointless ""personal"" stories that were largely off topic. Very disappointing and confusing. I gave it 3 stars because some of the photography was beautiful.",True
7,4,"I was curious so I wanted it thing it's a ""documentary"" on trees and our relationships to them.",bevvybrands,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis somehow ended up on HBO, but after investigating, since they are a distribution company, it's perfectly normal for this to happen.The description lends to the idea that we are all entagled with nature. Which is true. However that is not what the entanglement meant here. I think it's important to note, and you will see for yourself if you watch it that "" the richest person in America"" who owns the biggest logging company that is taking our thousand year old trees down in a heartbeat, paid for this documentary. If he didn't then the company definately paid the director.Everything seems to take place in the Southwest, and you meet a few different characters and they're the actual entanglements. Some of them talk about their relationship to trees and their stories are real and heartfelt. But not too many. The photographer, the mother who saves trees by cutting ivy off of trunks that are eating and feeding off trees was amazing. However the bonzai guy Ryan Neil, whos name shojdl not get any publicity from this review, not does he deserve any, basically self advertises that this ""talent"" was immaculately conceived! He spent years in Japan feeling rejected by his mentor who must have caught on that he was mutilating a very old Japanese tradition by using drills and power tools to cheat creation of what he comes bonzai's.In the end apparently someone catches on this type of malpractice on trees and breaks into his yard and brakes his prize bonsai trees, then undresses and leaves his property after smashing his interior home up.And then entering my stage left is this wealthy logging company president who it's cutting down every single good tree. But he makes a point of going on and on about how his company has now planted 2 million single trees since cutting them all down. But what he fails to mention is that he's already destroyed the ecosystem where these trees grew. And there's no going back because every 30 years he goes back to those same sites and cuss those same trees down again and does it all over.Throughout the movie this guy is speeches are being played and then they show him as a really old guy which really doesn't elicit much emotion for me as a spectator or viewer. After a while it became painfully evident that this was a giant advertisement to show that parts of his company are operating not just in the green for financial but to make it look like they really care about trees not as a crop but as a part of this world.But they're treating trees like crops which is obvious by the actions. They're charming black and white photos and old film of loggers working together chopping down trees that look like they're about 20 ft wide at the bottom. And I understand that this is just an industry. But it's not a documentary about the intertwining relationships between people and their trees and the love they have for nature. Not at all this is not what that film is. It's just a paid advertisement so they could write off a certain amount of money towards some kind of renewal benefit with their tax people.Some of the more beautiful shots are of the Joshua tree that you see in this film with this incredible photographer using an old camera and taking 10 shots of this beautiful tree over the course of the day. And then developing them using platinum process. This was amazing
Unfortunately the movie itself is not worth a look once you get halfway through you're invested and you're not sure what to do but let me save you the time you should watch one of those Morgan Freeman voice overs of nature. Or the UK documentaries. Those things are on point. Nature doesn't lie, people do and that's one thing you need to understand there's always an angle. I'd much rather watch a fictional movie then be told something's the truth.",True
8,1,Lost interest remarkably fast,madamsjr_claytona,n/a,16/08/2025,"A trip on shrooms during the daytime, had me seeing trees in a whole different light, so I was super excited to see a documentary on trees.. 30 minutes in i had to check out reviews because maybe I was tripping.. I wasn't.. As soon as it starts to touch on something interesting, it switches to a totally different story.. I think this would've worked better as a series, to be almost 30 minutes in and haven't even started to dive into at least one story is wild. I was very engaged during during the G. H Weyerhaeuser story that began, then boom, NOTHING..I'm not interested in no documentary milking it's stories on top of being all over the place. I gave it a try at least.",False
9,3,Trees where beautiful the people not so much,arthurHarr,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed the short burst we had about the trees. Every now and then we would get 5 mins of knowledge about trees and interesting facts about them. Then we would get straight back in to these peoples mundane stories about there lives.I came in To this Documentary expecting to see how the tree works,lives,dies,communicates but unfortunately this Documentary was far from that and was more like a home video for the families of the people who was involved in the show.In summary if your coming for the trees start running if you've come for the people stay. Not enough actually happend in this show at all.",False

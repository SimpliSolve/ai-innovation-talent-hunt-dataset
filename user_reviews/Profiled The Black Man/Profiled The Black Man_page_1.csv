1,1,Black men are the white ppl of the black community,cgjjphsr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Straight black cis men literally oppress women, girls, children, and LGBT black folks tirelessly. They rape, beat, abuse, and manipulate us constantly. Every 6 hours a black woman or girl is murdered. This documentary is nothing but woke propaganda meant to silence the actual marginalized groups. Black men are treated worse than any other straight MAN but they turn right around and give back all that abuse to those who are weaker than them. Makers of this documentary should be ashamed.",False
2,1,They aren't profiled enough,icantstandtherain-80198,n/a,16/08/2025,Black women are dying every 5.5 hours at the hands of black men. They aren't being profiled enough if you ask me. Stop coddling these grown boys. It's pathetic and it's not a good look black woman.,False
3,1,These men aren't profiled!,vvxhcxh,n/a,16/08/2025,"The stories of the black women and girls these men terrorize constantly go ignored! We are a minority group in this country yet have the highest rates of domestic violence, sx assault, and murder primarily at the hands of these men. Statistics are not lying and their victims aren't lying. Tina Knowles refuses to even live in a black community for a reason. Why doesn't she move to Buckhead, Atlanta where homicide rates are up 60% since last year? Go for a stroll in Chicago after dark to the sweet tunes of gun shots and sirens with no security while on Instagram live and prove to us how ""safe"" these men are. Black women and baby girls are killed EVERY 5.5 hours, WE ARE NOT SAFE! Protect black women!",False
4,1,"Misleading, Misinforming, and Disgusting",mydreamythoughts,n/a,16/08/2025,"Blk males are only 6% of the U. S. population , YET they commit 77% of the crime. Blk males murder blk women every 5.5. Hours and this doesn't even include the global numbers. Blk males are not victims, they are the victimizers. They love to blame everything on D'Wight Man but that's just a manipulation tactic they like to use. Long story short, this documentary is deceitful and disgusting.",False
5,1,The Assignment Was Misunderstood,TASQM,n/a,16/08/2025,"Tina Knowles had some nerve to think she can speak on the behalf of everyday black women and their experiences with black men. Nothing has been debunked in this docu-series. If this mockumentary is meant to speak on the truth then the black community would exude excellence and prosperity!This is the real truth!""Black Men are dangerous""
Look at the IVP and femcide rates amongst black women in the community.""Black Men are absent Fathers""
Look at the single mother rate of the black women compared to their counterparts.""Black Men Devalue Black Women""
Rap Music Industry enough said.""Black Men Don't Cry""
They are definitely crying with this mockumentary. The tide is shifting, black women are waking up and seeing the BS rhetoric that's being spewed about these Black Kangs.Stop trying to gaslight black women collective by promoting the extreme minority of black men who love and respect their families and communities. They do not represent the collective of all black men.A. Smith, Tina Knowles, OWN are out of touch with reality and FACTS.",False
6,1,Ahhh...More BM Fragility,tmbethel-61470,n/a,16/08/2025,"Go figure *hard eye roll*.....It's like, we simply refuse to acknowledge that the biggest threat to Black men? IS OTHER BLACK MEN!!! Maybe if they devoted more energy to creating better communities and some sort of financial infrastructure for their families, they would be less ""vulnerable"" to ""profiling"". As a Black woman, I am so incredibly tired of the coddling. Especially when THEY are the biggest threat to Black WOMEN. Waste of money on this excuse of a documentary.",False
7,1,What planet is Tina Knowles living on ?!,lanu_tu_tu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wish I could give this mockumentary a 0. Black men are running rampant killing black women and girls every 5 hours. They're not building, providing or doing anything that contributes to society. They continue to terrorize their own communities, then cry that they're victims. We are no longer giving a pass to community terrorist. We're calling them out.We are not our grandmother's! The reckoning is here.",False
8,1,This docu-series is a slap in the face to black women,hawaiirealadvanced,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here's a few examples to debunk these myths in this docu-series that no one told Tina to make. She got a lot of nerve I'll tell you that.Black men ARE dangerous. Every 5 1/2 hours a black woman is killed by a black man. They are killing pregnant black women at a high rate. BLM got exactly what they wanted because these violent men are now a protected class. Now the police have backed off of black men and they are wreaking havoc in the community and black women are now REALLY unprotected. They can now beat and kill black women in peace.Black men are absentee fathers to ALL races of women. They leave Black women, White women, White Hispanic Women and White Asian Women single mothers. They don't value fatherhood and they don't care about their children. Just look at the statictics and everyone already knows they are absentee fathers.Black men devalue Black women and they will tell you and show you 24/7 how much they hate and devalue black women. Black men value white women (including all ethnicities of white women) and put them on a pedistal. They don't respect black women, they don't marry black women, they don't protect black women and they don't love black women. They have devalued black women to where they refer to us as ""females"" not women. Another example is the black manosphere & Kevin Samuels and his followers.Black men cry for hours upon hours on their YouTube struggle channels like victims. Everywhere black men go they cry and they will whine about anything and everything and take no accountability whatsoever. I have never seen any race of men cry an endless fountain of tears like black men do.BLACK MEN NEED TO BE PROFILED!!",False
9,1,Gaslighting to say the least,jesuslovingcitygirl,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary should have came out 10 years ago where fake pro Blackness was accepted. Not now where many people are waking up. By people I mean Black women.With the femicide rates at an all time high it is very insensitive to put out a documentary like this that paints the collective of Black men as victims when they are perpetrators. Most of the statistics in real life dont back up this documentary. Whats ""profiled"" on them is actually what they do. They are profiling themselves at this point. Dont get me wrong I have great Black men in my life, but I'm not naive enough to think that the whole collective is great. These people are harmimg Black women and Black children and ransacking the Black community including other Black men. Its a no for me.",False
10,n/a,Nope. Don't Waste Your Time,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched the first two episodes of this farce and that was enough for me. Is it thought-provoking? No. Is it saying something we haven't heard before and examining the topic in a way that's unique to other documentary's exploring similar subject matter? No. A propaganda piece if I ever saw one. It's way too dishonest and used manosphere talking points instead of LEGITIMATE data. I cannot take documentary series this seriously and could not stomach it long enough to watch the concluding episodes. If I could give it zero stars, I would.",False
11,10,Very interesting,florenceidika,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's obvious that from reading the reviews that there has a coordinated mass downvote of this, glad that no one really judges docs by imbd. Looks like a good concept, i will like to see more focused on the justice system.",False
12,1,HERE WE GO AGAIN...,nadiatarver,n/a,16/08/2025,"Here we go again with another documentary about how hard black men have it when in reality they are the main ones causing strife and discord within their own communities.. They off each other left and right and enact violence against black women and black lgbtq...Its so bad that them offing black women was deemed a health crisis by the CDC. If you don't believe me look it up!!.. and my God have you seen those disgusting foul videos on YouTube they make about black women?!? Kevin Samuels, Tommy Sotomayor , Fresh & Fit just to name a few ... Now THAT is something that needs to be discussed.",False
13,1,WHAT PLANET ARE YOU LIVING ON?,rachellermitchell-33258,n/a,16/08/2025,"BLACK MEN ARE NOT THE VICTIMS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY, THEY ARE THE VICTIMIZERS. MOST OF THEM CAUSE SOME FORM OF HARM WHEREVER THEY GO AND TINA KNOWLES YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO PUT THIS TRASH OF A DOCUMENTARY OUT FULL OF LIES WHEN THE DATA SAYS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS SAID. I KNOW YOUR IN A DIFFERENT SPACES OF BLACK BUT IN THE REAL WORLD OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY BLACK MEN ARE THE WHITE SUPREMACISTS TO BLACK WOMEN AND BLACK CHILDREN, THE SAME CHILDREN THAT THEY ABANDON IN HIGH NUMBERS. YOU MAKE A DOCUMENTARY TO UPLIFTS THESE KANGZ WITHOUT A KINGDOM WHEN THEY ARE KILLING BW AND BG EVERY 5.5 HOURS BUT I GUESS YOU DIDNT NOTICE THAT BECAUSE THATS TOO MUCH OF A REALITY OF WHAT AND WHO THEY REALLY ARE. THANKS FOR NOTHING.",False
14,1,Misses the mark,mls4182,n/a,16/08/2025,"I agree with an earlier commenter who is tired of the promotion of division and victimhood. These types of shows promote division, depression and a feeling of powerlessness and give the impression of taking no responsibility.This show should have featured black men in the military, in law enforcement and every day good guys we admire and respect. It is these many men who prove negative stereotypes untrue.Blaming current problems on events decades or centuries earlier gets you nowhere. You want move forward.",False
15,1,WHAT YOU SEE ON TV IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN REAL LIFE,dejarandle,n/a,16/08/2025,"The media is doing an AMAZING job at pushing the narrative that black men are facing so much injustice in society, when the reality is that black men are extremely problematic in their own community. The media is only showing and glorifying one side of the ""story"".",False
16,1,Black men aren't victims,mintandroses,n/a,16/08/2025,"Black males in this country are much more likely to be an assailant than a victim - and when they are victimized, it's most often by men who look exactly like them.The reputation these men have cultivated for themselves is one of violence, degeneracy, delinquency and shame. And that's no one's fault but their own.If they don't want to be 'profiled', perhaps they should just be better.",False
17,1,BLACK MEN ARE NOT VICTIMS!,shawnay-22175,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hope this narrative will come to an end. Black men kill each other, black women and black children. It's time they take some accountability because we as black women are tired of carrying the community on our backs. I am glad it has 1 star and if a 0 star was offered then that's what this garbage would get.",False
18,1,Victimization at it's finest,mcqzfvsjhw,n/a,16/08/2025,Black men whine and cry about being emasculated but are all for this victimizing bs. They are killing everyone in their communities including themselves?,False
19,1,Absurd,AroDemiDive,n/a,16/08/2025,"According to Black Femicide U. S. and the FBI, a Black woman was taken off this Earth every 5.5 hours in 2021, every 6 hours in 2020, 8 hours in 2019, and 16 hours in 2018. Over 60% Black girls under the age of 18 are inappropriately touched. The rate of murder of pregnant Black women rose by 30% in 2021. Almost all these crimes were perpetrated by Black men. The rest are by others who know there will be no consequences because Black men have abdicated their responsibility to protect the black community. Black men are dangerous, and getting more dangerous every day. Over 70% of Black kids will grow up without their fathers, and over 90% of Black kids won't have their fathers as the breadwinners in their household. Black men provide nothing, protect no one, and are happy to allow others to pay for their faults and failures. The profile is correct, and anyone who says otherwise is lying. Even the ""good"" Black men are at fault, for not requiring their male family members and friends to make better choices for the community.Anyone who cares about Black women and girls would never support this project. Black men already get low bail or no bail for their crimes and ample opportunity to re-offend, usually on another Black person. The ""stereotypes"" are true. This documentary is a disgrace.",False
20,10,They want the stereotype perpetuated...,atgdotcom,n/a,16/08/2025,The women that give birth to Black Men doesn't like this movie because they want the less than .0009% To represent all Black Men and that shows a mental illness...,False
21,1,Victimizing and black male worshipping.,markitahayes,n/a,16/08/2025,Black men kill and disrespect black women at alarming rates. But we don't want to talk about that tho. Any black woman that agree with this should be ashamed.,False
22,1,Black men should be proud!,snoopyisin5,n/a,16/08/2025,Oh my god these sad sad men in this series is disgusting. Please don't destroy what has taken proud strong black men so long to accomplish!This series says to others that black men are fragile and ALWAYS a victim!,False
23,1,"Tina, you tried it",seunpurty,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIs this a joke?! Black men have always been a menace to society but since the pandemic, they all have become really unhinged and problematic. They are terrorizing black dark skinned women/girls the most. A black woman is killed every 5.5 hours at the hands of black men, but we shouldn't be fearful of them right?! Murders are up, robberies are up, and so is rape. Build more prisons, and put black men that keep hurting black women/girls there. Black men don't build, provide, or protect. Stop the coddling now!",True
24,1,Just spit in black women's faces instead.,rashidahee,n/a,16/08/2025,"I won't call the women who participated in or promoted this documentary delusional or stupid because no one as wealthy as they are is this delusional or stupid. They can afford therapists and should have plenty of time to read like the rest of us average, everyday black women.If I know the statistics, why don't you when you're making a whole documentary about it? The statistics speak for themselves. How African American men are perceived is 100% in line with reality. It's no one's fault but their own.I guess since this was directed towards a black audience, you thought you could essentially throw feces on a paper and hand it to us.You women who participated in this documentary don't have any self-respect or respect for other black women. And you don't deserve the daughters, granddaughters, nieces, etc you have. You're an embarrassment and an utter disgrace to this community.",False
25,1,Where are the rappers?,qvslogistics,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was annoying just rich media figures dry dribble. We have a Blackwoman being nominated for Supreme Court Justice. Can someone spotlight Black women and the trials and accomplishments we face we have?What was this mess? Black males create the worst media representation of our race an sellout to the lowest bidder. Chile I cannot, no mention of the dope dealer super pimp killer culture they created themselves. JZ routinely degrades Black folk N in Paris Big Pimping etc. This coddling has to stop they are killing us every 5 hours.",False

1,4,Check out all the 10/10 ratings!,TurnerburnB42L8,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sort of ironic don't ya think? Almost seems like someone copied and pasted under multiple temporary accounts. Sort of ""Like"" mimicking wouldn't you say? Gosh, I think even some of the titles are repeats.Waste of time actually. I only gave a rating of four because of the creative and interesting intro. Other than that, just a bunch of grown boys using subjective terms such as ""I felt"" I sensed"" ""I thought I saw"", but aside from the rocking chair which was no predictable as soon as we see the room's furniture, not much else to pique one's interest or give the neocortex (logic) pause for consideration.",False
2,3,I wasn't that impressed,nvqfghss,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was so hoping for more. It would have been more interesting if they did a s√©ance or something.. just walking around and old house that is drafty is hardly scary. I looked st the tickets online and they are ridiculously expensive, to view a this old house. Smh . Seems like a con job. I had my own experience, and it was haunting & changed my life. This is just hype. If there was something there they are way to loud, to experience anything. Just set up cameras and watch. The end. Otherwise it looks like a bunch of grown men who are more interested in scaring one another. Hope they redo this with less talking more action.if you need a haunted hollow hit me up.",False
3,3,üôÑ,truereviews-71742,n/a,15/08/2025,"The narrator sounds so stupid and mocking which removes credence from this story overall. The voice is like they're purposely trying to sound spooky like at a campfire for children. The sounds/music too is annoying & distracting amongst the talking - LET'S HEAR GENUINE SOUNDS...if there is silence, okay. It's insulting to me as an adult who is genuinely interested in history. But if you want to be playful & silly about scary stories maybe you will like it. Also, I do not comprehend why many (not all) ""investigators"" are showy or bad actors and STUNNED when they get what they want...which makes things seem fake because HELLO you got what you came for...something you supposedly believe. Why are you surprised? If all were non believers there would be genuine surprise. I believe something happened BUT perhaps it is people being followed not so much the place. How is it a daycare at some point was there without issues? It's all frustrating &annoying. Why can't there be anything authentic?",False
4,1,White Noise Killed It!,cbjami,n/a,15/08/2025,That horrible high pitched background noise you injected in this program was just horrible. It made it impossible to watch and gave me a headache. Were your findings not enough that you had to add fake music to add to mood. I wish I didn't have to write so many characters because there is little to say except it was a total waste of time for you to make and me to watch. I can not recommend this show to anyone. It was okay in the beginning before you started the investigation and didn't have that dumb noised going all the time. It was a good idea to do a documentary on this property but it was so badly done.,False
5,1,As far as all these 10 out of 10 ratings I call BS,frogsj,n/a,15/08/2025,SpoilerThere is nothing here that would warrant a 10 out of 10 rating. This is a very lukewarm paranormal investigation. That hyper focuses on such things as a rocking chair that happened to rock when one of the Paranormal specialists happen to walk by it. That's the height of all the evidence in this extremely boring paranormal investigation. There's a whole lot of drama with a certain investigator who basically throws himself on the ground and then gets up and says he needs air. Oh and then there is a faucet running in one of the bathrooms but of course there's no cameras to capture when it turns on. What do I say to all these 10 out of 10 hyper enthusiastic ratings. Take a look at the dates of these over the top reviews. It looks very very suspicious. And there's no shortage of fans of these guys since they're all YouTubers. Most of the 10 out of 10 ratings come within days of each other using words like masterpiece over and over again in supposedly separate reviews. Much of the language in the overabundance of 10 out of 10 ratings is the same. I give it a 1 out of 10. Cuz I don't think you can give it a zero out of 10. This was the biggest waste of my streaming time. And all the hype doesn't really add up whether it be watching the whole thing which I don't recommend. This is a paranormal failure if anything. And if you do make it through this tedious documentary. Please help out by setting the record straight and give your honest review of this POS.,True
6,1,Are you kidding me,judyyork-63307,n/a,15/08/2025,"These supposed ghost hunters need to just get under the covers and cover their heads up, get some other hobby, I'm Scared! Oh no whats that? Any little noise or light was Sooo scary for this bunch. How interesting is this bunch of obvious newbies to the paranormal .This was the most boring ghost hunt that I have ever seen. Get some pro's
in there instead of this bunch who are afraid of their own shadows .Did we go too far(end of doc)? No, you didn't go far enough. The cast has all of the equipment for the subject and they stare at instead of getting EVP's..This should be a B movie with a cast of bad actors.",False
7,1,C'mon people!! A pile of garbage,kdwhbcnbj,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm rather amazed at how simple minded so many people are. This documentary received so many excellent reviews and I just don't get it. This was a terrible piece of garbage that caught very little to no actual paranormal activity. These clowns even went to the extreme of doing the ever popular ""random man acts bizarre and wanders into the darkness so he must be possessed"" gag. Super original! That hasn't been done a million times in other B movies. Don't waste your time. One other thing worth noting. Their claim to fame in this doc is a rocking chair rocking on its own. There you have I just spoiled it for you. No need to waste your time. üëéüèªüëéüèª",False
8,1,Sad Commentary on Confirmation Bias,chaplaindad,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerPeople either believe in the paranormal or they don't. Depending on where you stand on that spectrum, this ""documentary"" will prove your theory. Why? Confirmation bias. Nothing that is recorded: sound or movement proves anything one way or another. But, there are some perfectly silly moments. For example, the rocking chair that moves on its own. Just as the investigator steps, the rocker moves. Then there is a cutaway, and then the investigator jumps up and down to ""prove"" it wasn't his step. Yet, video of the chair shows clearly that one rocker blade is pinned against the baseboard, keeping it from moving. Who moved it and why the video cutaway? Was it the ghost, or someone very alive who manipulated the scene? Also, there is the radio that finds interference. Any first responder with an LMR has experienced this at times. Cellphones have tower in one place, and just inches away, have none. Such is the issue with electronics. Ghost, or not? Shot in one dimension, video makes it easy for the ordinary to appear extraordinary. The film abounds with noises, moving doors etc. In a mid 18th century structure. For the non-believer, physics and age are the cause. For the believer, it is the paranormal. So, how do you break the confirmation bias tie? By adding what almost no paranormal investigator will add: on-scene neutral parties and individuals from the non-believer side to prove what is presented to us as true. It's good science to do so, adding positive and negative controls to the experiments to remove any possibility of filmmaker shenanigans or scientifically explainable occurrences. Without controls, this is nothing more than people who make their living and bind their reputations to the existence of the paranormal, showing viewers what the filmmakers want the audience to see. A sad confirmation biased reality.",True
9,2,Don't waste your time! Spoiler alert,bluesandshoes-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWe were very excited to see this and it was such a letdown. Amazing how with great equipment, nothing was caught live. Lots of the usual suspects, guys with black baggy clothes, a hipster beard, tats, solemn faces, scowls and hysttiond behaviour. A perfect place to film yet nothing gets captured. The obligatory rocking chair movement in old wooden floorboards, the ""possession"" and being pushed by an ""entity"" and running out of the house into the darkness to get ""fresh air"". üôÑ Interference thru the walkie talkie, please. You're never showed anything paranormal.. These YouTubers need to stick with just that,YouTube. The only thing that was real were there imaginations and bad acting. One of the worst things is when ""investigators"" continually talk and move around filming their idiotic ""expressions"" in night vision. Like I said, we were hopefully, only to be horribly disappointed. Good drone footage and slightly eery music, but too much and at the wrong places.",True
10,10,A Paranormal Masterpiece,crowofjudas,n/a,15/08/2025,If you're into paranormal of any kind this is a mandatory must see! From start to finish I was glued to the screen! Never a dull moment this documentary was superbly done with one of the best investigations I've ever seen. Seriously do yourself a favor and watch it!,False
11,1,YouTubers trying hard but still fail,RayRoy8,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely nothing meaningful was captured!The background noise forced throughout the movie gave me headache and was the real paranormal!Just because you name the movie : the harrisvile horror ""The real Conjuring "" doesn't make it any more worthwhile.I enjoy the real event documentaries but this was like 4 friends ""Let's do this and if we lucky it will be a hit like the Paranormal Movie ""Desperate attempt to make something that is Nothing! Just 4 youtubers gambling on this movie to make it a hit is not gonna happen!Seriously if few high schoolers could make a better horror factual documentary than this guys.Not hating but did not enjoy at all!2 hours of my time I can't get back!",False
12,1,"If you like the word ""Like""",shawninaugustaga,n/a,15/08/2025,"These youtube guys walk around with all of this great equipment and all they have to show for it is a chair that rocked for a second. So, let's spend like half an hour on that and try to dubunk it. Ok, like the guy has an experience and of course must leave the house to get fresh air, later says he does this to be scared and wants the entities to attach themselves to him, or even come home with him. Yet, he runs away so scared he can barely breath? It is like you say you love jumping out of planes, you have done so a thousand times, yet you have never stepped foot out of the plane to just go back in and say you are too scared like really like really? Let's like spend another 40 minutes on a walkie talkie have interference. Like come on man, with all the equipment and the house riddled with already installed cameras we get ziltch, I used the word ""like"" a lot in my review because i want you to know what you are getting yourself into, hearing the word like 572 times. Yes I counted.",False
13,1,"Same old ""paranormal"" junk",thelostthelucky,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe trailer for this film made it seem a lot more interesting than it actually was. Most of the ""evidence"" shown in the trailer was not even shot while the team in the documentary were visiting the house.I'm not a skeptic of the paranormal, but man I am tired of these ghost hunting paranormal shows and docs that do a whole lot of ""I can feel an energy here"" or ""Oh someone just whispered to me/blew on my neck/touched my back"" with shocked faces in night vision shots, yet nothing is ever shown to the viewer that might be interesting to watch. They just want you to trust and believe what they're saying is happening and frankly, it makes for a really boring viewing experience.And I'm sorry, the whole scene in the upstairs room where the guy ""sees something astounding"" and calls all the other guys in, and it's a freaking block with a 7 on it just sitting on a shelf? That's supposed to be amazing or astounding to any of the viewers? I honestly had no idea why they were all so impressed by it, until a little snippet of explanation referenced their other hunts (which I assume are on their YouTube channels? They aren't in this movie) and why this number has significance to them. Pretty lame.The only interesting thing to me was the history of the home that they got into a little bit at the start with the interviews. I had to turn it off shortly after the rocking chair ""moving on its own."" I couldn't sit through another 40 minutes.",True
14,1,"Yawn, this is trash - I caught a goof before reading it in the goof section",Puscifer206,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off, before I even clicked on ""play"" - I knew what I was going to get; the same old shoddy, fake, over acted footage that I've seen the last 50 yrs in these types of ""investigations"". I already knew that nothing ground breaking was going to be shown otherwise it'd be on every legit source of news, not crappy YouTube channels.But when the guy asked the question with the recorder I was expecting a (fake) voice to respond. However, I started laughing when he had to record his question & play it back (which made me lol because if there is any chance of the voice being legit he wouldn't have to ""record"" himself). But once he ""played back"" his ""recorded"" question you can obviously hear that the question he asks is in a difference cadence then what he said in front of the camera which makes it obvious that his question was pre-recorded along with the fake ""FY"" response. BTW - I like how his response was to casually laugh and just sit there. Yeah, ok. You already gave it away that it was staged because of the cadence being off but if it were real, like you'd just casually laugh & keep sitting there - after an undead voice told you to ""FY"".I also like how backward hat guy w/ glasses has to ask ""how do you work this thing"" regarding a walkie talkie when they're in the basement. Yeah, real professional when your giggling like a girl and have to ask how a piece of basic equipment works that I had when I was 5 yrs old. Nice observation that the air is cooler & crisper.....while in a basement. Yeah, no kidding Sherlock.I like how in this investigation (and most others) stories of unreal things are reported like levitation, tables & chairs hovering, people being thrown etc (like it used to be an everyday occurance) - but now that we live in the era where we can have 100 cams in the farmhouse none of this incredible things happen. No levitating tables? Right. Because that never happened in the first place so it's not surprising that it doesn't happen in front of a camera. Just easy things are faked like books coming off shelfs, doors that are ajar a few inches suddenly close, etc. - easily fakable things.I did have to also LOL when there was all the hoopla (when the guy came sprinting outside to grab the other guy to let him know that they ""finally got it - clear as day!"") about the rocking chair. At least if you're going to fake it, do it when there is nobody in the room. But you did it when the guy was walking right up to it and you can't see his feet or the bottom of the chair. People that are lying usually preemptively say things ""Oh and if anyone thinks that was fake his foot would have to be at another angle etc."" rather then not saying anything.However much $$$ was spent on this production including time, gas money, equipment etc. Was a waste. You might has well just taken that pile of cash and put it outside, soak it with gasoline & set a match to it. It accomplished the same thing; nothing.",True
15,1,The Eric Connor Show,bjbrodarte,n/a,15/08/2025,"This dude is an absolute joke. He tried so dang hard to make this whole thing about him. He's loud and obnoxious and ruins this whole documentary.The camera movements and sound in this documentary are so horrible that there's no way any of their ""debunking"" can be taken seriously.Why can't someone with all this equipment actually do a good job?I get that no one wants to watch a show where nothing happens but I also don't want to watch a show where all of it is made up.This whole thing is a joke. Stick to your YouTube channels. And in the future keep Eric out of it. He really just ruins the whole thing.",False
16,1,Hilarious,MrLoops,n/a,15/08/2025,"For the first 30 minutes I was convinced this was a parody film, a funny skit that was goofing on Ghost Hunters. I couldn't help but laugh! Then it just became sad once I realized they were serious. The audio mixing is also hilariously bad, as are the sound effects and ""mood"" music. The funniest part of this film, however, are the 10 star reviews. It's pretty obvious what is happening with those.In short, you'd be better off spending your time shoving half cooked slices of ham in to your own eye sockets instead of watching this awful, horrendous ""film."" And I say that as someone who is a believer in the paranormal.",False
17,1,This movie could not have possibly gotten any worse.,john-v-lillywhite,n/a,15/08/2025,"Never have I seen such a pathetic bunch of hyper-drama and lots of *man-gina"" acting. Pure junk. Bad sound. Stupid lighting. All of it was just over the top ""yuck!""Paranormal? Not a bit. Just a bunch of wannabe YouTubers and bloggers trying to steal a buck from you.If you're of the paranormal ""profession"" you might want to have a word with these oddballs, tell them to grow a pair and to never ever try to make a movie again.Don't give these phonies any more reason to make another stupid movie, please. Change the channel, block their blogs and YouTube channels., Run away quickly! You'll thank me. :)",False
18,10,A MUST WATCH & A PARANORMAL MASTERPIECE,natalie-72084,n/a,15/08/2025,"This feature documentary film The Harrisville Haunting: The Real Conjuring House is a true masterpiece. The true story and some of those who were involved in the original story behind the movie ""The Conjuring"" were involved and able to talk about the truth of horrific events. The researchers and investigators conducted a controlled and structured investigation. I have such a huge amount of respect for everyone involved in making this film. I was emotional by the end of the movie, and as an investigator just completely inspired. The evidence captured was absolutely mind blowing, and as professional investigators they were able to proceed with a clean investigation at every turn to make sure these unexplainable events were not contaminated in any way. And thank you so much to DEVIL'S HOUR Productions and Entity Seven Films for bringing this film to life and to the world. Until next time...BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!",False
19,1,Really Stupid,rsmiller-62627,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI am a paranormal junkie, but I'm neither gullible or ignorant. Synopsis: A few guys, two of which are obviously fan boys of Zac B, go to the conjuring house and find absolutely nothing. What little they say was evidence is so easily explainable even a caveman could do it. For instance, the rocking chair is so obvious. Funny how the chair rocks with the guy shifting his weight while he steps forward and backward. Give me a 16"" piece of window trim with a bed to block the entire thing and I'll get the same visual. The one evp they captured sounds exactly like one of the guys that's in the room. Oh yeah, it's mimicking. Give us a break.",True
20,1,Waste of 2 Hours,tficeto-00217,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't understand all of the 10 star reviews. I am wondering if I watched a different move. There is absolutely nothing compelling in this film that suggests anything paranormal is going on at the house they are investigating. Amateur cast, bad production and severe lack of anything that would make you a believer of anything except that you wasted 2 hours of your life on this movie. The paid hypers should not be allowed as they do not reflect the reality of this horrible film. I blame myself for not turning it off one hour in. I just figured something, anything would happen to show that this film was worth making. Didn't happen....",False
21,1,nope...just nope,munchkin-61518,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerJust a bunch of hipsters in a cabin in the woods, trying to scare one another and creating ""loopholes"" for the most gullible of viewers...""ghosts"" mimicking the appearances and voices of the investigators...uh, okay...i mean, the dude who looks like the lead singer of Weezer couldn't even remember that they HAD JUST discussed this a couple of minutes later after supposedly having the ""creepiest moment of his life""""that ghost looked and sounded just like you. It must be mimicking us!""and pretty much 95% of everything they say they experienced in the house...voices...happens when no one's filming or cameras happen to be ""turned off""...and all that is ""captured"" on camera is a rocking chair moving and a supposed ""possession"" where the demon haunting the place seems to be ""confused"" about the place it's been inhabiting for the last hundred years...seriously, what the f---supposedly, this is the actual location that the movie ""The Conjuring"" is based on...if you saw that movie, you know those ghosts f'ed up a lot of people and made everyone in the house's lives a literal living hell...WELL...not here...here, you get ""demons"" and ""ghosts"" who do the VERY BARE MINIMUM of anything ""paranormal""...in the movie, you see people getting possessed and thrown across the room and entities coming in and out of closets and clapping right next to people in the dark...HERE...oh, we're just going to rock this chair a little and repeatedly tell you to leave (in the investigators' voices because, well, mimicking)basically, this is the type of movie that REALLY, REALLY, REALLY wants you to ""oh"" and ""ah"" and get chills at everything they're presenting...but, all you end up feeling is bored and putting on your ""Conjuring"" blu-rays instead.",True
22,2,Nothing happens,irvinecindy7,n/a,15/08/2025,"Nothing at all. Over 2 hours long.It's dangerous to play around with demons. There are no ghosts. They are demons impersonating the dead.Six hundred words. Okay. I'm at a standstill/crossroad in my life. Nothing is really happening and I'm not making anything happen. I've always been content to let others do the work. I'm lazy. I have aspirations, but I don't act on them. I'm a bit rudderless. I hate to admit that because I believe in God the father, the son and the Holy Spirit. If you listen to the Holy Spirit he'll guide you. So you don't have to be rudderless.

23,2,Storytelling and production were a mess,jschultz-53756,n/a,15/08/2025,"Almost an hour of the documentary was telling us what they were going to show us. It felt like watching an amateur YouTube video, not a produced film documentary. It didn't help that audio was all over the place too. Sometimes the voiceover was too loud, while other interviewees were near impossible to hear. This had a lot of potential to be a great investigative documentary, but the lack of professionalism, weird editing choices and production quality make it feel fake and forced. The historical section at the beginning was good, but again, don't waist time telling me what you're going to talk about, just talk about it and introduce the people as they are interviewed. That's what bottom thirds are for. Next time, watch other successful documentaries and analyze why their formats work well and how to layout documentary professionally.",False
24,4,"Too ""Animated"" and Too Many Background Effects",misslolasynastry,n/a,15/08/2025,"The music, the filters, the narration, the background noise, waayyy too loud and disconnected from a modern audience. This was a missed opportunity for realism and its as if the editor or producer is more of a horror movie fan than actually performing a paranormal investigation.You have to do away with all of the fancy editing and just shoot whats going on when it comes to documentaries. Less is more. No filters, no loud horror mystic music, just talk and film. Alot of times silence is just as loud as special effects. The first 10 minutes were hard to watch. And even the interviews were hard to hear/watch due to all of the unnecessary music, white noise, and effects overlays. When you want to capture realism you cant hide behind the extra nonsense. The music should NEVER be as loud as the commentator. The documentary seemed more focused on the music and sounds and trying to invoke fear, than the actual content. It was hard to catch what people were saying and also could barely take it serious.",False

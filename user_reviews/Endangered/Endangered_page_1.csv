1,6,Suffers from a lack of narration,Lennie_G,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary takes on a very important subject, the subtle and not so subtle attack on the press by power hungry politicians and those gullible enough to believe them. The film suffers from a lack of any narration that would stitch the disparate anti-press videos together. To me, it's as if the documentary was made to be shown to reporters alone as a kind of solidarity film. The film does leave no doubt as to the extremes politicians and others go to threaten and smear reporters. As an example, Bolsonaro of Brazil says of on one female reporter that she is ""using her hole (sic) to get a story""",False
2,8,"""There is no democracy without freedom of the press""",paul-allaer,n/a,15/08/2025,"As ""Endangered"" (2022 release; 90 min) opens, it is ""2020"" and we are introduced to Patricia Mello, a journalist at the well-respected newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, in Brazil. She is at a rally of President Bolsonaro, who screams that ""We must destroy the mainstream media, and exterminate these journalists."" (Sounds familiar?) Soon thereafter, Bolsonaro attacks Mello by name... At this point we are10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from longtime documentarians Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing (""12th & Delaware"", ""One of US""). Here they follow 4 journalists for an entire year, two of which are working in the US, 1 in Brazil and 1 in Mexico, as mainstream journalists are under unprecedented threats and attacks by Putin-wanna-be's like Bolsonaro in Brazil, Andrés Manuel López Obrador in Mexico, and last but not least, the Big Loser & Liar-In-Chief, who claims without a shred of decency that mainstream media ""are the enemy of the people"". No, sir, they are not. YOU are. I have to admit that when I started watching this documentary, I had low expectations going in, as I pretty much figured I knew what I was going to see. While that turned out to be true as to the core substance of the film (one talking head correctly observes ""There is no democracy without freedom of the press""), I was nevertheless amazed and frankly overwhelmed by the footage of it all, and even more so, by the utter courage and leadership demonstrated by these journalists. The concepts of ""courage and leadership"" is something the Liar-in-Chief wouldn't know the first thing about, even if it hit him in the face, as the recent January 6 Committee hearings have made clear time and again. Thuggery and lawlessness, now that is something he knows quite a lot about! Please note that the film's overall rating currently showing here on IMDb (5.7 based on 115 ratings) is grossly misleading--almost certainly resulting from low ratings given by Trumpist trolls who have not actually seen the film, because you know they simply hate the idea of democracy and freedom of the press), and that all posted reviews to date have this rated 9 or 10 stars.""Endangered"" started streaming on HBO Max just a few days ago. If you are interested in seeing a well-made documentary about the courage and leadership of journalists standing up against the pressures and intimidation to bring us the facts, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion. After all, ""democracy dies in darkness"" (the Washington Post's tag line).",False
3,8,VIEWS ON FILM review of Endangered,burlesonjesse5,n/a,15/08/2025,"Spoiler2022's Endangered is not so much a documentary as it is a painful reminder of what's been going on in the world via the last two years. Protests and violence and COVID oh my. Man it's been a bumpy ride. Watching Endangered is like witnessing a multi-vehicle car accident. I know I sound like a broken record but you just can't look away.Endangered is the definition of a docu because it's factual, reported, and raw, with the camera always peeking in like some sort of spy or curious bystander. Did I mention the film does the split screen technique as well? Endangered's directors (Rachel Grady, Heidi Ewing) are experts at what they do. The footage they capture is so in the moment, so undisguised. Channeling a little Steven Soderbergh but with real people instead of actors, you wonder in surreal amazement how they shot this thing (but they did cause it's there).Endangered makes you feel sympathy for the media even though some of their shtick I find annoying (I shouldn't cause I'm a writer myself but whatever). Hey, as they say they're just doing their job. The flick follows four reporters from different parts of the planet who have received threats of inhumanity and persecution while on the beat.With Endangered, helmers Grady and Ewing create 90 minutes of subdued, journalistic discipline that is quietly powerful. They get right up in their subject's grills but veer away from interviews and just go with hushed narration (it works). The fact that this pic was filmed at the height of the pandemic just makes it more neoteric to watch.If you're a fan of documentaries (and I am) then Endangered will satisfy that particular, cinematic palate. The movie ends with a sort of metaphoric fog being lifted. Gosh, it's great to know that not everyone will forever be put ""in harm's way"".",True

5,2,A divisive film,deeszymanski,n/a,15/08/2025,An unnecessary film to cause division within the country. Completely one sided but meant for all to watch and grow more hatred by the minute. Let it just die and go away.,False
6,9,A closer look in the life of a reporter,vkrommenhoek,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow! This documentary gives a good view of how tough the life of a reporter can be. They get abused, physically and emotionally, and keep on going. We are so fortunate there are still journalists who will go through such hard times to get the rich and powerful accountable for their actions.",False
7,1,Keep political opinions out of our news,pwdriskel,n/a,15/08/2025,This documentary is a good example of what's wrong with news and media today they can't show it how it is they will always lean right or left to indoctrinate younger audiences into believing their ideology this is propaganda.,False
8,n/a,Grade A Propaganda,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This propaganda would make Stalin jealous. How anyone still believes anything in the news, out of Hollywood, etc is beyond me....
What happened to the days of Cronkite, when facts were presented and the viewer made his or her own opinion?",False
9,10,Must see beautiful documentary,darianna,n/a,15/08/2025,"Beautifully crafted documentary on the dnagers faced by journalists in this age of disinformation and lies spread by social media. Heartbreaking analysis of the death of print journalism and small town newspapers. The film follows 2 photojournalists and 2 reporters in different parts of the world: Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Miami and Washington DC. What transpires is the constant harassment journalists face from police, politicians who make them targets of hatred, and uninformed bigots living in their own echochamber. Masterfully shot and edited, the film is riveting, suspenseful and thought provoking. A must see film.",False

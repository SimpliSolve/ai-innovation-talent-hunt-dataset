1,4,Longform Asics advert which fails to sell exercise,lewis_pritchard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'll preface this by saying that I am brand loyal to Asics; their shoes got me through my first marathon 5 years ago and since then I've only purchased Asics clothing. The fact that this documentary was produced by Asics was the main reason I watched it so I was prepared for a glorified advert, which is not my issue with the film.Mind Games sets out to show the correlation between exercise and mental ability which is already a clearly established fact evidenced by countless scientific journals. Filming it for an audience could be a more entertaining and accessible format, but the point is lost because we barely see any improvement in our 4 competitors. One competitor wasn't even able to compete at the end because they contracted Covid-19 making their entire section feel pointless, why not just edit this out?In the epilogue they show statistics suggesting mental capacity has increased, probably since they couldn't show it in the competitions, but this is also questionable because the results are self reported. The improvement is likely a placebo effect since exercise is great for mental health. If they were able to test mental ability beforehand why couldn't they repeat the test after the 4 months of exercise? And if it is an experiment, 4 people is too small a sample size, and what were the control variables?Perhaps I'm being too harsh. All of the competitors were really likable people and it was interesting to see their fields of expertise. It's nice to see people exercising on TV who aren't Olympic standards which can be motivational for new comers. Lastly, the film is well produced and has a positive message, people should get more exercise because you will feel better.",False
2,9,Need a follow up series on Ben!,alex-88112,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFound this documentary very motivating and inspiring. I loved the characters, especially Ben. He needs his own series as a follow up!As a society, we are in a period of time where so many people sit in front of their screens all day without even considering exercise. This documentary is a great reminder that exercise is essential and can help you perform better even when doing ""ming-work"".Casa and Sherri were also excellent case studies and I believe their commitment to exercise in connection with their craft will eventually pay off. Hopefully their success leads to others in their respective activities follow suit!",True
3,10,Amazing documentary!,francesca_wallis,n/a,16/08/2025,"Super interesting and a different motivation to exercise!If you are interested in fitness or learning more about the body/mind it's a must watch. The characters are entertaining but real. Ben is super fun, I could watch him all day. ASICS have done a great job to find the link between cognitive performance and exercise in such an entertaining way. Recommend to all ages and fitness levels , you don't have to be into exercise to find this interesting. 10/10.Makes you want to grab your trainers and get on the track. I especially like the fact it's backed by research and it's global and varied in its approach. It made me believe it more.",False
4,10,Not your average documentary,almeripelser,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're used to snooze-inducing documentaries, then be prepared to experience the opposite effect! Mind Games - The Experiment will have you reaching for your running shoes, inspired to get up, go out, and exercise more.Both informative and entertaining, ASICS have managed to showcase the power of movement on the mind with no false pretenses or over-the-top frills. I truly enjoyed following each character's fitness journey, delighting in their progress both physically and mentally.I believe there is a great misconception that the outcome of exercise is purely to improve physical (and visible) aspects of the body, while this documentary scientifically demonstrates the cognitive benefits that can be reaped by even the simplest forms of exercise when performed on a regular basis.But don't just take my word for it, watch the full documentary and see for yourself.",False
5,9,Great concept... Geeks & nerds unite!,nick-796-750597,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the concept, which resonated loudly with me. As one that is allergic to 'physical sport' & actually any proactive exercise, and has geek & nerd tendencies in abundance, this piqued my interest. More than that, it's actually got me moving a bit.Bravo for that alone.The film is engaging, interesting & even has one developing a connection with the characters/subjects.As scientific research goes, it's very limited, with the sample size so small, but there's so much existing research out there, we geeks & nerds are more likely to seek it out, because that's what we do, we just need a nudge with the right stick. And this documentary is that stick.Is this an advert for Asics? Of course, but actually it's gently done and didn't feel cynical, unlike if it were a big pharma documentary.I happen to like Fry and his voice, and knowing the man from his autobiographies, with his own neuro divergences and struggles with physical exercise, he's well cast for the commentary, adding credibility in spades.Without doubt this will get some of us moving, and that will inevitably prolong lives.Well done for a super concept well delivered.",False
6,10,Interesting and exciting documentary!,pachevallier,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really loved this film, in fact more of a documentary highlighting a quite unknown fact: the beneficial effects of sport activities on the brain and cognitive skills of humans. Also fun and easy to follow, I highly recommend to watch it on Amazon prime. Through the lens of different people, we see the evolution and the perseverance that more physical activity gives them. Fortunately no fake marketing but a well done production, especially for a quite small budget, this film is really not boring for a second. It actually conveys really well the values of a sound mind in a sound body which is a beautiful morality.Don't wait any longer and go to the cinema ... or to the gym!",False
7,10,Is exercise good for your mind as well as your body?,moomoocows-53770,n/a,16/08/2025,"Is exercise good for your mind as well as your body?. Can exercise actually boost your cognitive function to give you the edge in competition? Beautifully narrated by, national treasure, Stephen Fry, this topic is explored with the help of some very talented, but self confessed couch potatoes. From gamers to chess players you are introduced to the participants of the experiment. All are hoping that starting to exercise can give them a shot of progressing to the next level of their chosen mind games. You are soon rooting for these people and hoping all their hard work pays off. How does it go? I wouldn't want to spoil it for you would I? Watch it now, you won't regret it!",False

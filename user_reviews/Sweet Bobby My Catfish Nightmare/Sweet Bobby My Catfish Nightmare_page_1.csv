1,6,"Interesting, bizarre, but overlong.",Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,17/08/2025,"Kirat falls for a man named Bobby, who seems to enjoy a jet set lifestyle, unfortunately the relationship remains an online one for years, and when a meeting is arranged, there's always an excuse.People are calling her out on stupidity, naivety and more, I get that, but I'd say it's worse than that, I'd call her out on need, a desperation to be loved, and on that basis, I'd say what happened to her was cruel.For a documentary it's just too long, it really does lag in the middle, if it was punchier, it would have been so much better. It's definitely an interesting story, though I feel that most people, self included will be wondering just how on Earth it happened, after four years.I struggled to understand the whole point of the catfish, there was nothing financial, it just seemed twisted, what did they hope to gain, it should have resulted in some sort of prosecution.Bizarre isn't the word.6/10.",False
2,6,I needed more info...,irishjenna,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was an interesting watch, but I needed more at the end of all this.As someone that was not catfished, but in a LDR with someone in another country off and on for over a decade, I could see how you can become so intensely involved with someone online. Though I shook my head at some of the things she went through, because in my relationship we actually did talk on the phone, had video chats, and met in person. I think the ridiculous excuses she was given would have sent me running for the hills.But on the other hand, she was duped pretty hardcore by her female cousin who literally made a whole social media world with 60 different characters to fool her. She kept all the pages active with photos, posts, likes, comments. And not only that, but she was using these various accounts to contact her cousin and send messages so she would think she was connected to Bobby's family and friends. And this cousin knew this guy cause she previously dated his brother, so she trusted her cousin as the liaison that everything he was saying was true. This cousin not only fooled her but also fooled other family members that Bobby was real as they were also in communication with him. I mean, their grandmother died thinking this guy was real and that they would be married.So to say I needed more from the story, I need to know the possible psychology behind what her cousin did. I know the cousin refused to be interviewed, but it would have been cool to have an expert there giving reasons behind why someone would do this. What did her cousin get out of this ongoing facade for a decade? She apparently went to college and had a lucrative career as an upper executive with a bank, but had to have spent all of her free time in this fake relationship with her cousin.Also, some of the family was interviewed, so how has this affected their life, how do they feel about their family member now or have they shunned that side of the family? What about the real Bobby and his wife? They interview them, so how are they doing in the years since this happened, did they change their social media presence, did their trust in others diminish?So many unanswered questions.",True
3,7,How did this go on so long???,lisachristianc,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThe ending of this story really got me! During the whole documentary I was thinking how did sweet Kirat stay with him (Bobby) for so long?? She's a smart, careered and beautiful woman. How could Bobby toy with her emotions so viciously? When he did (after many years) end up flying over to see Kirat, how was she so naive to believe he couldn't come down to see her after weeks??? Why did she let him (aside from the lavish gifts) treat her so poorly??? 10 months is a long time to fall victim to catfishing but 10 years. If all this is indeed real, ""Simran"" does deserve time in jail. Unbelievable!! How can both women be consumed with Bobby's life for son long??",True
4,7,My goal is for Catfish victims to not feel shame,Basicpleasuremodel,n/a,17/08/2025,"Hopefully Kirat doesn't read the reviews shaming her. Unfortunately at times of vulnerability we are all vulnerable. A woman who is going through a bad breakup finds solace and comfort from a friend on Facebook. The friend is connected to family members who know him so she of course thinks he's safe. The relationship progresses and like any story of abuse she finds herself in a web that's hard to get out of. Then her whole world turns completely upside down when she realizes she's been catfished. I thought the documentary on the whole was well done. I think it actually would have been better to not have disclosed the catfish crime in the title. Basically as I'm watching I'm distracted by wondering who 'sweet Bobby' really is and not the story. Other than that I applaud Kirat for participating in making this film, couldn't have been easy. I appreciate her courage and hope that films like this do save others from being victimized.",False
5,7,Unmasking the Dark Side of Facebook,pal-gandharv,n/a,17/08/2025,"Sweet Bobby: My Catfish Nightmare touches on the darker side of social media and its impact on individuals, particularly within the Facebook ecosystem. It highlights how the documentary exposes stories of countless victims whose experiences often go unnoticed, shedding light on how people become consumed by carefully curated images rather than real-life connections. The point about gullibility, especially concerning Kirat, challenges viewers to consider the widespread nature of this issue - suggesting it's not just about individual naivety, but a reflection of how social media platforms like Facebook shape behavior, particularly in places like India.While I acknowledge that people are more aware of these dangers now, it is an interesting contrast, noting that they weren't as cautious in the earlier days of social media. Conclusion, giving it a 7 out of 10, seems fair and balanced, recognizing the documentary's relevance but also implying there's more to be explored.",False
6,6,"This is a documentary about gullibility, not catfishing.",roxanne_1985,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm very sorry to say this, but the documentary is not about catfishing, but about the consequences of utter lack of sense and gullibility. I understand being manipulated, it's insiduous. I can understand the first year or so. At top!! When whe sees Bobby at the club and just decide to pretend like they never saw each other and never brings it back? She just wanted it to be true and went all in into denial. Getting married to a man she never saw in real life? Was she that desesperate to be part of a rich family? For it to last 10 years, with all the technology that would allow facetiming with Skype, she really didn't wanted to know the truth. I have a lot of respect for victims of catfishing, but she isn't. She's a victim of herself.",True
7,6,Actually Annoying. All Parties Need Counseling,Mehki_Girl,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerA lot of stuff to unpack here: First of all, Kirat doesn't have any personal boundaries. And, apparently, little self-esteem. She hung on to a relationship for nearly 18 years in the hopes of getting married.The parents spent all of their daughter's young life pushing for her to get marriedm when this was obviously a woman with a career who didn't necessarily need to be married.I'm not even sure that her desire to be married was even her own idea and whether or not she knows that or not.Everyone was so desperate for a woman to be married that everyone allowed themselves to ignore red flags and engage in this charade for nearly 10 years.No one along the line said, wait a minute, this is completely implausible. Okay, you want to believe that someone was shot in Kenya. Crime happens, but why would you believe that this person was put into witness protection through the USA? Aren't you all British subjects? Why would the United States be involved? Why wouldn't you question that?This young woman was involved in social media and hasn't she ever heard of people being fooled by con artists who are always in the CIA? And you believed this nonsense? And then you carry on an intimate relationship with someone online never having seen them. And your parents are involved as well because they're overly involved in your life and pushing you to get married because that's the end all and be all of your existence.Doesn't matter who the guy is, just as long as my daughter gets married and, yes, I understand the cultural implications there.So this poor, not particularly savvy nor bright, woman despite her career, falls for this along with the rest of her family, including young relatives who also should have been social media savvier, but... Did anyone have braincells working beyond married, married, married?!The cousin who did this and kept it up for so long is a disgusting human-being and the statement at the end shows that she has zero remorse because she's basically a sociopath. She's trying to blame it on youth but, no, she's one nasty piece of work. The final statement supposedly from this cousin also talks about lies or something told about her - apparently forgetting that she confessed to catfishing her cousin. Like what was up with that and what's wrong with you? The first step to getting help that you claim you want, is to admit that you've done something wrong.I don't know, maybe's Kirat's and her parents' desperation for her to be married was just the catalyst for her cruelty to show itself.But just wow! There she was pining for a guy who had no idea she existed who was married and had a child of his own.There should be a law!",True
8,2,Very hard to digest,romanaromihasan,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerHave lot of sympathy for Kirat but very hard to believe the story. Even if you believe that during the time she was dating Bobby on line she didn't have a video call with him even once because of the excuses he made. But what about his acquaintances that she was in touch with why she never had a video call with them. During the period she never thought of visiting him or his friends and agreed to marry him
without even meeting him once physically. The movie should have addressed these queries. Overall the viewer is left with a lot of queries which are not addressed in the movie. If Simran had a job how did she manage to take out the time required to manage so many social
Media accounts.",True
9,7,Bobby's Girl,Lejink,n/a,17/08/2025,"On-line scams of different types are now almost a staple of the TV schedules. This Netflix production told the story of how a mature, (35 years old at the outset), seemingly intelligent single career woman was romanced on Facebook by a man she'd only met once years before and even then accidentally and fleetingly. This was the Bobby of the title, a handsome, successful and well-connected male (an important consideration in the Sikh community of which she is a member) to whom she ended up in an ""affair"" which runs for over ten years without their ever meeting.At the time they first hooked up on-line, Kirat, the woman in question, was a successful London-based career woman. Her day job was as a marketing executive, while in her off-time she deejayed on a local radio station. She was also in a long-term relationship and seemed ready to at last marry, with the point being strongly made that this was very much a desired outcome by her family, as the testimonies of both her parents and others close to her make clear.However, when her romance breaks down, she takes comfort in the messages she starts to receive from Bobby, who appears to be free too and is keen to get to know her better. So their cyber-connection deepens with all-night Skype calls, gift-giving and soon enough, professions of love, all without ever physically getting together. Kirat gets to know Bobby's circle of friends and also starts inter-communicating with them, but matters take a dramatic turn when Bobby is apparently shot and badly injured in Kenya and as a result enters Witness Protection in New York for his safety. His injuries mean he can't speak or appear on video but still the messages keep coming, leading up to a marriage proposal which Kirat ecstatically accepts. As Bobby slowly recovers, all she needs now is for him to finish the protection programme and actually meet up with her so that she can introduce him to the family and get on with the expected happy-ever-after marriage and succeeding parenthood.But when he continues to prove elusive even after his ""return"" to England, alarm bells at last go off for Kirat with disastrous consequences for her, when after she tracks him down in person, an almost unbelievable revelation explodes the whole concocted story.Watching this compelling documentary, one is again reminded of how easily apparently responsible people fall for on-line tricksters again and again although the eventual reveal in this one was especially difficult to fathom in terms of motive. It is very easy to criticise Kirat herself for being so foolish as to allow herself to be strung along for so very long without becoming suspicious about what turned out to be a fantastic web of deceit contrived by her long-awaited dream man. It has to be said too that her neediness and susceptibility do occasionally portray her on-camera as a touch delusional and even as something of a fantasist but nothing can excuse the actions of the callous and twisted perpetrator who finally runs out of loom and is finally caught up in their own web of lies.As a programme, it was sometimes difficult to watch Kirat walk and talk us through her obviously painful story. Told with mock-ups of the texting and messaging which were exchanged and the staging of key events as they occurred, complete with blurry images of actors playing them out, this was another cautionary tale of modern life and the pitfalls of wanting something too much. The only saving grace for Kirat here appeared to be that at least she wasn't swindled out of a large amount of money but she certainly got cleaned out emotionally. As the old saying goes, if something seems too good to be true, it probably is but try telling that to someone who thinks they're in love.",False
10,2,Are people this unintelligent?,chamboemail,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerSweet Bobby is a documentary that left me both astounded and frustrated. It tells the story of a woman who falls for a man online and gets swept into a whirlwind relationship that almost leads to marriage, despite the fact that they never meet in person or a video chat? The sheer gullibility of the woman in this situation is hard to comprehend.As the documentary unfolds, it becomes clear that she ignored a staggering amount of red flags. Her naivety, combined with the manipulative tactics of ""Bobby,"" makes for a frustrating yet compelling watch. While the story is tragic, it also highlights the dangers of online relationships and the importance of being vigilant.If you're interested in stories of catfishing and human psychology, Sweet Bobby delivers, but you'll probably find yourself shaking your head more than once at the sheer absurdity of the situation. Idiot....",True
11,8,How?,spagnolo-gm,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerGreat documentary, but how does someone go 9 years talking to someone, planning a marriage while never hearing their voice, seeing them in person? As much as Simran was psycho, Kirat needs to be evaluated aswell. The documentary really keeps you engaged on wanting to find out what happens in the end. In the end, the real issue is someone entertaining great lenghts of an online relationship more than 6 months. If after 6 months you haven't even seen them on video, or spoken with them on the phone, then you should end it. Online dating has gone in some weird directions.Nevertheless, great watch, enjoy!!!!",True
12,6,How???,kirsten-kairuz,n/a,17/08/2025,SpoilerKirat clearly had mental issues before this whole saga! No sane person would have kept this going for so long with someone they never even met in person or even seen on video! Her obsession kept this going! That aside - it was a really interesting story and almost unbelievable! I still can't understand the WHY!!! Rated a 6 because you could probably just read the story online - didn't really need to be made into a documentary as there aren't any major pivotal moments...more an ongoing Saga! That said - it was an easy watch and well told...and ok to while away some time on a rainy Saturday morning!,True
13,5,I feel for them,amritstoor,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI listened to the podcast and eagerly anticipated the Netflix film adaptation. Unfortunately, the podcast is far superior, which is why I rated the film a 5/10. Kirat and Bobby's experiences moved me to write this review, as their story deserves more attention and nuance than what the film provided.Many critics will label Kirat as naive, but this perspective overlooks the profound depravity of someone who meticulously plans and executes a crime of this nature. The film glosses over the complexities of the situation, failing to capture the emotional weight and impact of their experiences. It's disheartening to see that Netflix didn't delve into the details as thoroughly as the podcast did, leaving the story feeling incomplete and lacking the justice it deserves.I truly believe this could be a Hollywood blockbuster with the right approach. If I were directing, I would focus on ensuring the real culprit is brought to justice and highlight the need for the authorities to recognise that this crime warrants a serious investigation. The story has the potential to not only entertain but also to shed light on important issues that must not be overlooked.",True
14,6,Stupidity at its worst,lizb-96573,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThe story begins with Kirat explaining that she has been in a relationship with the same man for 15 years or more. What supposedly intelligent woman dates a man for that long without a marriage proposal even though she wants to be married desperately?After the breakup, she meets a man online named Bobby. He appears to be the perfect man for her. Then she falls for the insane story that he was shot in Kenya and had to enter witness protection in the U. S.. They text and talk via Snapchat for hours each day. Kirat is obsessed with him to the detriment of her own health and job.After a few years, he's released from ""witness protection"" and will fly back to the UK to finally meet her. After leading her on wild goose chases through London, she finally finds his house and rings the doorbell. This Bobby who answers the door has no idea who she is! Turns out it was her cousin catfishing her the entire time.It was a cruel thing for her cousin to do but an otherwise intelligent, mentally stable woman would not have participated in the fraud for years.",True
15,6,A bit superficial and slow,isabugga,n/a,17/08/2025,"The story itself is interesting but I would have wished to hear more about the intrinsic motivation what made her stay in that 'relationship' for so long. You just hear a story of someone being catfished. Are there any reasons given why this could go on for ages? Not really. Judging from their conversations he didnt even present himself as a knight in shining armour, rather opposite. And the documentary fails to deliver an answer or at least some kind of explanation. Probably 90% of the documentary is about both of them exchanging messages. Thats it. I was in a similar relationship and the motives to remain in this are deeply psychological and this documentary could have investigated the psychological side too in order to maybe help others who are in a similar situation and to make it more interesting. If a man is interested but doesnt want to meet you, he is either married or in a relationship, is a fraudster or you are being catfished. There is nothing in between. I wished the documentary was a bit more elaborate and not just 90% showing messages. It is difficult to understand why someone as intelligent acts so gullible and the show does not give any answers at all. It was a bit boring in between too. I didnt quit because I wanted to know whats behind all of this.Alltogether it is a nice time pass but dont expect too much.",False
16,6,I'm Shocked ...,keikoyoshikawa,n/a,17/08/2025,"I feel this documentary would have been better if it had covered a few women or men who were catfished under similar circumstances, instead of just one person.While the story of Kirat is compelling, I feel it couldn't really fill nearly 1.5 hours. It just felt too stretched out and repetitive at times.Alternatively, had the documentary also interviewed the fake Bobby or a few others who whose identities were stolen, then I think it would have been really interesting.Of course, that might have been too difficult, given the sensitive nature of the events. Still, it would have been useful to the audience to understand better what and why it happened.Definitely a cautionary tale for all.",False
17,7,Why no FaceTime?,brenzbrenz,n/a,17/08/2025,"Very interesting how this sort of thing can happen. But my first thought was throughout the whole entire movie was how come they never did FaceTime? I don't know if it was mentioned in the movie if maybe I wasn't listening as to why there was no FaceTime? She was on Skype! Because that would solve the mystery straight away!It is very sad what she has gone through. I don't know if I could've been fooled for that long tho. I would have been wanting to see them in real time! Plus also how did this female cousin trick and speak to her and sound like a man? I don't know it all sounds very suss to me. She seemed like an intelligent woman, I don't know how she could be fooled for so long?Either way it was enjoyable at the end of the day so I gave it a 7.",False
18,1,Another Netflix factory-line production,DrBobUK,n/a,17/08/2025,"The documentary feels rushed and lacks the emotional nuance needed to truly engage viewers. Instead of a well-crafted narrative, we get a series of talking heads and text messages that do little to elevate the subject matter. The production quality is subpar, with minimal effort put into the storytelling or visual presentation.Overall, it's another hastily produced, low-quality addition to Netflix's ever-growing catalog of true crime documentaries. If you've already listened to the podcast, there's no compelling reason to watch this rehash.Avoid, unless you're doing a drinking game where you down a shot or sip every time something stupid happens.",False
19,6,Interesting.,sashadaniels-16070,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerWe all love a juicy documentary don't we. We'll this has some juice. However, it's hard to stay focused on it when the person, or self proclaimed 'victim' in this case is so darn stupid. It doesn't feel normal. Is it a cultural thing? Has she been that sheltered to think that having this type of relashionship online is normal in anyway? She seems intellengent enough and I feel terrible to not feel bad for her but honestly.. In your 30s surley you are not that naive.Anyway, it's fast paced which is pleasing to the eyes and ears, easy to understand and follow. Has the right amount of drama to make you question everything from the off (take note, lady!). Good twist at the end.",True
20,1,And the trophy for the Moron of the century goes to...,House-32182,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary was an incredibly bizarre watch. I knew this woman was dumb when her first boyfriend kept running every time the idea of marriage was presented and then she'd let him come back to take her on the same merry go round. She wasted nearly 18 years of her life being strung along by him and then wasted the next decade on an unfathomable online fantasy, and then cry's about how shes now middle aged and childless. Well duh! As the documentary unfolds, it becomes clear that she ignored a staggering amount of red flags. Her naivety, gullibility, desperation and astounding stupidity is what allowed any of it to happen in the first place. Never cared to verify a single thing or person in real life! She was sending voice notes to all these different characters and never got anything back except written messages. She sent countless voice notes and video's to Bobby and never saw him or heard his voice! Even after the fake witness protection was over, she never did a 2 way video call for months, maybe years! Like what?! Towards the end she says she doesnt want any sympathy.... Dont worry, you're definitely not getting any.",False
21,8,Worst judgement from viewers feeling so smart was expected,marcelajonkisz,n/a,17/08/2025,"As I watched the film, I thought about all the judgement the lady would now have to face from a lot of people hearing her story but still, it turned out to be worse than I predicted.I didn't come here with intentions to defend Kirat because I was frustrated with her actions A LOT but I am actually more appalled by the reaction to her experience; the attacks and the total lack of empathy. So I decided to add something different.I cannot understand why people are so extremely angry with her that she believed the story of the abuser. And I mean, extremely angry, even furious at times! It didn't happen to you. She didn't hurt you or anybody else.The question of ""how could she be that stupid?"" is repeated with harsher synonyms, even though the main reason is provided in the film multiple times: Kirat was born and raised in a family and culture that believes getting married and having children are one of the best and most important things in life. I don't believe that at all but I accepted the crazy thought that there are women with different goals and priorities than mine ;) Kirat explained what she felt at that time: inside and outside pressure to be like others in the community, fear of being too old to have a baby, being judged, disapproved and simply alone. It's nothing new and uncommon that she was easy to be manipulated and abused in that situation.If you have never met a smart person struggling to get out of the abusive relationship and if you didn't check but you know you could have never ever been manipulated and exploited by a close person nobody would even think of suspecting, then this film should make you feel very clever and superior. But also very angry at the victim for blaming a particularly twisted perpetrator. But I wish you didn't watch it or at least comment unless you have some empathy ;)",False
22,6,An interesting look at the subject,easternautumn,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI went into this thinking that this catfishing scheme would be something so intricate that it would make sense as to why the woman in the story does not realize she is being catfished. Maybe this is due to my knowledge of the subject from the MTV series, but it was almost immediate that I figured out who was catfishing her. The signs were there, and yet she was so blind to the truth.The catfisher is obviously the biggest to blame for the situation, but the woman being catfished is just about as equally to blame. She spent 18 years in a relationship with a man who never wanted to marry her, feeling blindsided by the real end to the relationship. Then she meets with Bobby, and he allegedly goes into witness protection, but breaks the rules to contact her? That typically would never happen.I think the real sign that this woman needs some psychological help for herself is when she takes it upon herself to confront Bobby in-person, and does not believe a single word he says (which I understand, but she was coming off creepy--and she does not acknowledge that she did).It's an interesting film, but you spend most of it screaming at her to see the giant elephant that is in front of her face.",True
23,1,Absolutely Insane Gullibility,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,17/08/2025,"So you see someone you have supposedly chatted with, but who has NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE- and you brush it off that he's intoxicated and busy so there's nothing wrong, AND YOU PROCEED TO FABRICATE A NINE YEAR IMAGINARY RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE YOU DO NOT KNOW?!?!This is the most garbage documentary I've ever seen in my life- this woman is a complete psychopath that's insanely unhinged and because she's unable to fathom reverse image searches she was duped for a DECADE and then drug the husband and wife into the middle of this mess because she's so delusional that she can't see how ridiculous she's being, and her incredible lack of sense and insatiable need to have any type of boyfriend led her down a path of nonsense that could have easily been solved with a simple search of social media.What's lacking here is the countless opportunities laid before her to use COMMON SENSE- when you're so controlled you can't use the restroom? When there's myriad excuses for not meeting, or someone just randomly says 'I love you' and asks you to marry them AND YOU HAVE NEVER TALKED IN PERSON? This is a painful watch because it is so hard to fathom this level of naivety.Save yourself the time. I watched it so you don't have to.",False
24,7,So long,anouk-hougardy,n/a,17/08/2025,SpoilerCatfishes happens for many reasons. I understand that she built up a friendship and later on the relationship. However 3 years should have been the maximum of this all. 10 years is just crazy of Kirat to go trough however the niece itself to. It shows that both of them didn't really have a life outside their family members. Any friend outside would have protected her and talked reason into her. They were all to much into the 'getting married' and look where that ended. The moment where she quit the radio show should have been a massive red flag. I feel sorry for her that she had nothing else in her life fighting for. She needs to put herself on the first place.,True
25,7,Sleepy Rating Scale 3.5/5 sitting in bed,thebimp,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI first heard about this story when I listened to the podcast. Chile 9 years of a catfish is absurd. I mean if I have not talked to a human face on some sort of FaceTime or Zoom within 48 hours or a week of meeting you we are scamming each other then. When Bobby entered witness protection after getting shot then was mumbling to her then was somehow emotionally abusing her, I was like lady you gotta get some sort of backbone. But I will say I was quite impressed with all the multiple characters the catfisher played at once. That was quite masterfully and there is no way someone has a whole job doing all that.",True

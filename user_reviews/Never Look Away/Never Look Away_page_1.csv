1,7,Good documentary about Margaret Moth and her works,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.""Never Look Away"" is an interesting documentary about photojournalist Margaret Moth and presented with insightful discussions, good presentation and a strong sense of direction and tone. Documentaries about photography and war are not new as the documentary structure isn't something grand nor amazing but the core of it's emotional message, the direction and the style of the documentary still kept the investment to be strong and many of the conversations and concepts well-explored.Moth is an interesting individual and the documentary does a good job on telling about who she was, her impact on her work and what made her special. While there are some cheesy use of music and some of the editing choices are a little confusing, I found myself overall enjoying it.",False
2,10,Absolutely amazing and riveting,paulpaz,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is so incredibly well done, powerful, and moving. Lawless has knocked it out of the park in her directorial debut. Wow. I am shocked I never knew Moth's story but I am in awe of her - her resilience and bravery. This is a must see film and I can't recommend it enough.The story itself is really powerful, but the way Lawless tells it opens up a lot of new facets and insight into who Moth was and why her personal life was so compelling in addition to her professional career.Lawless also lets the people in Moth's life tell the story and the messy conflicting tales really show how people are often seen to differently by others in their lives and leaves it up to the viewer to decide who Moth was.Great great film!",False
3,10,"Well-Crafted, Visually Engaging Documentary of the Amazing Life of a Fearless Female Photojournalist in the War Zone",Peripheral-Vision,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe life of Margaret Moth is vividly told through her lovers, co-workers, friends, and family members. Her lovers, in particular, offer the most insight into Moth's life as they were the ones who were closest to her, spent the most time with her, and frankly knew her persona better than anyone else. Tho, there may be some conflict between their versions. The doc doesn't shy away from her darker side. She was wild, flawed, and very controversial. However, her contributions to historical war footage were extraordinary. She was deeply committed to documenting the realities of war and showing its impact on innocent people, especially children. At a time when there are authoritarian leaders who are vilifying journalists for showing the world the truth, this film may just be what we need right now.Margaret's own footage is featured, and it's amazing to see what she captured through her lens. The film touches on her troubled childhood, though it's hard to piece together since she was not here to tell it herself. Still, the glimpses suggest a very bleak beginning which may explain her bold and fearless nature.The focal point for the doc has to do with one of the most significant events in Margaret's life. Her jaw is shot off in Sarajevo, depicted through a creative scale model since there isn't any footage of the event. She was a strikingly beautiful woman so she was completely jarred. Her face was disfigured, her teeth were gone, as was part of her tongue, she could not eat and had a feeding tube, and could not talk clearly. However, after recovering from surgery, she picks herself up, as shown through a wildly dancing woman representative of Moth, and heads back into war to continue filming.The visual approach is striking. It uses graphics, re-enactment scale models, dancers, music, and sound effects to set the tone and tell a compelling story. It's meticulously organized, and richly layered, combining interviews and archival footage to paint a portrait of a woman who lived life to its fullest. By the end of the 85 minutes, the documentary feels complete in what it was trying to do. The main focus is in describing the type of person she was, so the viewer gets a sense of her persona and drive as we watch the lead-up to the Sarajevo event. Then continues with her picking herself up afterwards and going right back out to film again. She was determined to go into the middle of war zones in order to document the truth. Margaret remains somewhat of an enigma. I think she would have liked the air of mystery that still surrounds her. 10/10.",True
4,10,"A biography of an incredible, wounded human",ericrwiksten,n/a,16/08/2025,"This may be the best biographical film I have seen in years. This is the story of Margaret Moth, a bohemian woman who was a cameraman for CNN, obsessed with filming the truth.The reason this is so incredible that all the warzones she filmed in are either still hot or moved down the road, but the realities are the same - dead innocents and no resolutions. She risked her life, and paid the price, for presenting to the world the ugliness of war we in America are all shielded from.She was part Anais Ninn, part Grace Slick, part Ernie Pyle and one hundred percent original. A child from hard circumstances and a lady tougher than coffin nails. After seeing this, I can't imagine anyone not wanting to have met this incredible woman.",False
5,10,I was in awe of this documentary!,charliescuriosoddities,n/a,16/08/2025,"I usually am not a fan of documentaries but this kept me on the edge of my seat , wanting to know more . We gasped , we awwwed , we sighed and we cried . Lucy did a great job capturing the many perspectives of how moth lived her life .The graphics were great , the clips were amazing . I love how Lucy dug deep revealing things we didn't know about moth creating our own perspective of her . She was both a protagonist and an antagonist in this documentary. There is a lot of graphics that small children shouldn't watch but if you want something new to watch , I promise you won't be bored !Highly recommended.",False
6,9,A phenomenon of a woman,LilyWai,n/a,16/08/2025,"Margaret Moth was a unique, trail blazing, no BS woman who was ahead of time & who clearly thrived on adrenaline.This documentary shows just how born for the job she excelled at she was - no compromise, no shying away, no backing down, her role as a war camera person was an integral part of illustrating to the world what was happening in these regions of war & conflict.The interviews with her various colleagues & partners was a fascinating insight into what attracted her & excited her in life & it certainly wasn't the humdrum facets that so many eventually fall into.Well worth watching to find out about this one of kind woman who was committed to her job, faced down events that most would run from & who was taken from this world far too soon.",False

1,10,The best documentary I've ever seen.,kristarosephillips,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an outstanding documentary about a 1970's prison NY incident (to say the least) that is informative, gripping, and emotional.I had no idea this even happened. Unbelievable.This documentary should be watched by all - Elizabeth Fink, all her allies, and those inmates deserve to have their story told. ACAB.",False
2,10,Disgusting American History,ictcabinetcompany,n/a,15/08/2025,The very government that makes the laws they will jail you for breaking don't apply to them. A physically gut wrenching atrocity. Abuse of power. Inhumane crimes against mankind. Racism. Fake news. Ultimate betrayal on many levels. All terrifyingly relevant today.,False
3,10,Powerful and heartbreaking,keberg2003,n/a,15/08/2025,One of the absolute best documentaries I've seen in a long while. It's gut wrenching and a must-see. Even though the events took place in 1971 they are just as relevant - maybe even more relevant - today.,False
4,10,A Revealing Expos√® Of The True Goings On Of The Ruling Class Powermongers!,silicontourist,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a video that should be seen by the masses (around the world and not just in America) and especially by every generation of schoolchildren. There are a great many Americans who will choose to disbelieve this documentary for a number of reasons i.e...
1) ...because a lot of national citizens find matters of inhuman corruption, of this magnitude, too incredulous to believe!2) ...that it happened because they were part of the voting system that voted these monsters into positions of power; so they choose to make it easier upon themselves by denying it actually happened (a typical worldwide human reaction by weaker willed people governed by their own FEAR!).3) ...that many people are racist fools etc, etc!If we had more people like Elizabeth Fink, the Civil Rights lawyer in this documentary, we could have such a wonderful justice system worldwide. That of course will never happen as it doesn't suit the power-mongers way of thinking and the corrupt members of the bar who think only of money (which is most of the qualified lawyers of the world).Its been 50 plus years and we still have the judicial system i.e. Police killings, Judges, lawyers, politicians covering up and lying about the killing of citizens in America (and around the world)!Take the power out of the hands of the corrupt. Do a better job of monitoring and holding those in official positions to harsher account for corruption.Failure to actively get involved with your world means you have no right to complain if you just stand/sit back and allow this greed motivated abuse of people to continue!",False
5,10,"what really happened in attica, and the grooming the bad dogs who did it",ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"I cannot and will not try to make the headline smaller than that, because this was an unfalsified well documented movie on a modern time massacre in attica prison 1971, and , my god, am i angry for not knowing...., rest in peace ms. Fink, job well done under the circumstances of the times, that still are todays times too.A great big monsterous hug goes to the ducumentary maker that has let his life and reputation in the hands of the new york state judicial system, for breeching the state laws by disclosing deep secret documents of the state of new york, secrets that wouldve been released in 2188 if it hadnt been for ms. Fink and this brave researcher of history...well better stop here, do not view this film if fainthearted, cause there are graphicness that goes beyond my grumpy old mind, and ive seen alot, and do grab the motto,''attica never again'' to your heart, and let all the lost and wounded soles forever rest in peace, cause now we kno.",False

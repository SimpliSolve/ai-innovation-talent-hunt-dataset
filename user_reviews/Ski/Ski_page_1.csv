1,10,Can't take your eyes off the screen,rachell-47,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the privilege of seeing Ski in theater and my only complaint is having to wait until the end of the month when it's available on streaming platforms to watch it again. This movie was phenomenal-exhilarating, inspiring, motivating and captivating from the second it starts to the moment it ends. It's anything but ""just another ski movie."" It's an emotional journey through the eyes of the top performers in the industry striving to accomplish the impossible. For skiers and non-skiers alike, the story is as fascinating as the skiing is unbelievable. 10/10 and I can't wait to watch it again and again.",False

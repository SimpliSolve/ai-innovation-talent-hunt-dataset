1,9,Always thought Blaine as a fake until this!!,vikrantbajpei,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm all for magic and sleight of hand and stuff like that, but David always took it a notch further, I hardly believed his videos thinking that might be AI, until I stumbled upon this documentary.. Sure there's no such thing as magic but the hunger to learn has earned the respect I have for David, mann, he went all out in search of knowledge, and that is commendable, we see magicians performing and think it's a piece of cake for them but never have we understood the trials and ordeals they go thru to perfect one act.. This episode was just incredible..I always perceived David as an egoistic guy, but this documentary changed my perception about him.. U guys nailed it...",False
2,9,Amazing Blaine!,shoguncrosse,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was one of my favorite David Blaine thing since his earlier specials a decade or more ago! Its beautifully shot, the stunts these people do around the world is so motivating, and for david blaine to learn and perform these things is insane! Kissing a king cobra? Just breaking a bottle over your head? The arctic episode, the placing fire on your head...like wow! Just wow! This makes me have the urge to travel to all these places and befriend all these amazing people. Our world is so much more beautiful and amazing than we know. Blaine has outdone hinself with this docuseries. Highly recommend watching this series. I really hope he makes another series like this as I know theres many more amazing places and amazing people in the world :)",False
3,9,Great examination of human endurance and ability...,ccvhftgjh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler...But there is a missed opportunity to explore social/economic class dynamics, both within counties and in a global context, that could have made this show something extra special. The awe inspiring acts are not performed by people of privileged backgrounds, the people who push the extremes of endurance are from the underclass. I never considered that magic/endurance could shine such a bright light on the humanity of people just trying to survive in our global socioeconomic environment. No one tests the limits of their body by throwing itself on glass, when you can afford a glass of champagne.",True
4,10,Amazing,enddayswitness,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is explores David Blaine like we have never seen before. The stunts he pulls are intense, but he also does a great job in tying them to the culture of places he visits. David also opens up alot personally with stories of past magic performances and we also see a more human side to this magician that we haven't really seen before. We also get an inside peak to his mind and motivations with personal stories. If you are a fan of David Blaine or if you are fascinated by him this show is definitely for you. For me he opens up that magical imagination inside of you that ponders for the unknown. David Blaine is a treasure.",False
5,10,Out of this world,new859,n/a,16/08/2025,"David Blaine outdone himself again. This documentary belongs to another world. My went through an emotional roller coaster while I watched the first three episodes. Surely, I didn't expect it could be so intense. Sometimes I have to covered my eyes with my hands like a little kid because the scenes are so scary. When I watched the king cobra moment, my heart was beating like I experience it myself. The shocking experience is beyond my expectation of watch a documentary. However, I fast forwards some acts of sharp subjects because I literally feel physical pain watching them. Besides the enjoyments of watching a good movie, I also got some inspirations from David's comments about those incredible ""magicians"". My daily ""troubles"" seems so small compare the challenges David willingly took upon himself.",False
6,10,Pleasantly Surprised,AmeliaF-9,n/a,16/08/2025,"David Blaine has taken magic to another level in this show. I have to admit that I was never really a Blaine fan. He seemed more hype than anything else but in the National Geographic series, Blaine has matured into an incredible man and magician.In this series, he takes you around the globe to find magic in the smallest and largest of places. He is so respectful of every culture.I highly recommend this as something fresh, real, sincere and some super cool magic.Blaine and National Geographic have really created a show that is wholesome and much needed today with everything so fake. Funny, I use to think Blaine was a fake but he has really showed me that I shouldn't judge a book by its cover.",False
7,10,I love this!,Fitzniryk,n/a,16/08/2025,I was a huge fan of David Blaine back in the early 2000s. I remember vertigo in particular and I got to see drowned alive. The last one I saw was electrified back in 2012. I think he was 40 at the time and it was very impressive to see him still pushing the limits. The guy is now 52 years old and he is still doing it! It's not about tricks. He shows us what humans are capable of through determination and hard work. David Blaine is such an inspiration to us all. With the new series he is taking to opportunity to show us incredible humans around the word. Each is a master in their own right and David shares their story with the world. Love the new series!!!,False
8,6,Very slow paced....,NullUnit,n/a,16/08/2025,"While all the ""tricks"" are rather remarkable and amazing. And the series in overall pretty interesting......I find Blaine's ""comatose-like"" narration just sleep inducing. He speaks fine, and NORMAL, in the ""live"" footage at the settings with other people. No issue.But then the voice over narration kicks in and it feels like it's at half speed and designed to lull you to sleep. Or perhaps somewhat condescending in nature. The narration is entirely unsavory to me for some reason.There is quite a bit of ""filler"" in each episode.. but ultimately the things on display are pretty miraculous and worth the watch.. truth is, one doesn't *really* need the audio anyway.---------- Meh ----------",False
9,10,Genius! Magic Masterpiece!!,imdbfan-9675802642,n/a,16/08/2025,Absolutely magical! David Blaine and the people he meets around the world will literally give you goosebumps. This show is absolutely phenomenal. Don't miss out on the opportunity to watch this show as it is probably one of the best you will see in 2025. Traveling the world and finding people who do amazing things with years of training. This journey David takes you on is one you will never forget. The show is a home run and will leave you wanting more. From cobra's to katana swords to being under the ice and much more. You will never see anything like this again David Blaine at his best!!!!!!,False

Hawa is a symbol of love and determination, a person who does not spend her life whining about the evident difficulties that have come to her way, but instead seeks opportunities to create a purposeful future for herself and her family through love and education. She realizes that the only way out of this terrible reality is that women get educated and fight for their rights, but unfortunately this has become an impossible mission even in 2024.",False

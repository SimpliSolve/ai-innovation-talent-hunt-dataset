1,10,Stunningly good.,jdhb-768-61234,n/a,17/08/2025,"Sensationally good review of the horrors of the Blitz in the early part of the Second World War. Lucy Worsley presents a picture of not just the fortitude and resilience of the population but also lays bare some of the frustrations and anger they felt. She tells us how, perhaps with hindsight, the government decisions were not always in the best interests of the people and also reveals some of the propaganda methods that were used to keep spirits up. Through the true stories of a disparate group of Londoners she brings those times to life quite brilliantly.This programme should be compulsory viewing for all those in today's younger generations who seem to feel so constantly oppressed and disadvantaged. Those who suffered the torment of the Blitz knew real disadvantage, not the imagined complaints and deprivations of today.",False
2,10,EXCELLENT LUCY AS ALWAYS,lopezpatricia-06139,n/a,17/08/2025,Hankies at the ready for this emotional documentary. Particularly the ending. She always manages to tell the story that hasn't been seen before. Two sides.,False
3,10,Heart-wrenching,embethjones-24464,n/a,17/08/2025,"Through actual citizen diaries and film, with reenactments and Lucy's archive visits, this documentary forces a close look at what the Blitz was really like. I cried.I never knew about the social program, intended to boost morale, that invited citizens to document their experiences. What a treasure.I was especially intrigued by Lucy's use of newspaper and newsreel reports to show not just reality but post-production editing for propaganda purposes.Enlightening does not begin to do this feature justice. As a retired teacher, I certainly hope this film is used in history classes, as students will also be surprised to see what we actually means.",False

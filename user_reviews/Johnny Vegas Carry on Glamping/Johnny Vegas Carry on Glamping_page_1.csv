1,10,A beautiful insight to one man's vision,longrunningjoke,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anything that can go wrong does go wrong and some more..Such a life affirming show.A 2 year journey from Johnny's mind going from a scratch on a page to a field....
I highly recommend this show to anyone.Even if your not a fan of Johnny I guarantee after watching all 4 episodes you will.ðŸšœ ðŸšŒ ðŸš’",False
2,1,Johnny Vegas: Carry on Glamping,studioAT,n/a,15/08/2025,"Johnny Vegas. Has he ever been funny? Ever?Someone still thinks so, because he's been given this show, which gives him the opportunity to prove that...he's not.Dire, dire entertainment, and the fact that someone here has given it 10 stars only highlights how subjective television can be.Whoever commissioned this (repeatedly I have to add) needs their logic testing, because this is a poor excuse for entertainment, and seems to only have been designed to be a cheap schedule filling exercise.Vegas peaked in terms of popularity a very very long time ago, and now must join Ben Elton, Frank Skinner and co in that unfunny figures of comedy category.",False

1,10,Desde el 11M todo es 11M,amangomendez,n/a,16/08/2025,"A bunch of beer drinking amateurs make the best documentary series in Spanish history.Music, edition, comentary and content worthy of professional production.There is no information that wasn't already publicly available but the sequence of events put in context make this one if the most eye opening and scary series I've ever seenClose down RTVE.",False
2,10,Days of march,fogue,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerYou'll find through the vast internet lots of documentaries chronicling the events that surrended the 2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid, the infamous 11M.Forget 'em all. This is the real deal.11M: El Principio del Fin (five chapters of an still ongoing series) jumps you right into the spanish political climate of 2003/4, with a moderate government (PP) sieged by the left party (PSOE) in the aftermath of Spain involvement in the Iraq invasion of 2003.And you should never forget that.The Terra Ignota lads surely never do. Neither that nor any other aspect of the bombings. Such is the high caliber research of the authors.From the attack itself (was ETA or wasn't) to the last days of the trial, a mesmerizing voice (kudos to him for the amazing job) inserts ourselves in a nearly cinematographic plot of hysterical police negligence (or not), the usual suspects being the real suspects (hope you got that reference), the incredible tale of a van, a car and a garbage bag (this being key to the whole judicial process and verdict) to the subsequent change of government.Cause, in case you don't know, there were elections in Spain only three days after 11M.PSOE won in a shocker and, as the authors, openly state, that was the beginning of the end. And it was all that mattered...?So, after all the doubts and unresolved questions that the official version has silenced for years, open your eyes and ears, and relieve what transpired in those days of march and changed the landscape of an entire country.",True
3,10,Attack on Spain from within!,Censurado,n/a,16/08/2025,"My country, my home, my life, my Spain, suffered a terrible attack on 11M 2004 and almost 18 years later, we still do not know the truth. This documentary simply exposes the facts (and that is something that no one had done before), with an unparalleled research work, without making any kind of apology and the result is as cruel as it is real. Spain has not been the same since that damned day and will not be the same as long as the real culprits are not judged by God, Our Lord.In memoriam of all the victims R. I. P. And of the injured may they know that they can count on us.",False
4,10,One for history,YaLeGustariaABoyero,n/a,16/08/2025,"A bunch of friends without means carried out the best possible compilation of facts and the events surrounding that infamous tragedy, with the main goal of honouring the victims by allowing everybody, and especially the younger generation, to have a fair portrayal of what happened and to achieve their own conclusions.",False
5,10,Couldn't be better,senorllevamepronto,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary made by a group of friends in a very professional way in terms of form, but also in terms of content. They list the facts without political bias, which is very much appreciated (Netflix and Amazon Prime documentaries do the opposite). Very good documentation work, perfect for those who want to know what really happened without feeling deceived. My congratulations to the whole Terra Ignota team: you are great, chavales.",False
6,10,Crash course to understand Spain,iceclick,n/a,16/08/2025,"Photography of Spanish reality and its corrupted actors through the factual presentation of the sordid details of the most harrowing event in the country's modern history.It is shocking to see how easily an amateur documentary confirms such a gross and criminal hoax that actually everyone knows but no one wants to be interested in, exactly since March 14, 2004 at 20:00.All backed up by simple witness testimony and evidence.Forget Netflix documentaries or other conventional platforms on this subject, because you will not understand anythingPay special attention (in my opinion) to chapters 3 and 4.",False
7,10,Makes the hair to stand in end,ocaravaca,n/a,16/08/2025,"The job that has been done thorugh this documentary from a group of friends is simply unbelieveable.With no resources, no money behind, no experience in audiovisuals but with the only intention to try to approach the spectator to what really happen without judgement is unconmesurable.All the themes tackled very well structured, no biased, with an opened mind make this a MUST SEE documentary by anyon barely interested on understanding 5% of what really might happened around the most obscure event that happened in Spain.",False
8,10,A documentary with naked facts that makes me getting to uncomfortable conclusions,adolfo-guadiana,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm Spanish. This documentary chronicles chronologically the facts if those days showing we, Spaniards, were deceived and nobody is interested in clarify the truth.At least we can get our own conclusions knowing what happened and the way it happened.Is chilling to watch how the mainstream lied to the people and how they were manipulated. I remember those days and it's true but nobody cared after a short time.On the trial, truth wasn't important and the main actors from that days were protected and promoted.I'm sure we'll never know the truth but, maybe , people will not be so easily manipulated once you see how it is done.",False

1,7,Kid-Friendly 'All or Nothing',deepfrieddodo,n/a,16/08/2025,"An opportunity to look into the world of academy football, but sticking to the basic overview rather than getting into the detail. With six 30-minute episodes there isn't much time to get into the depths of U23s, however it can at times feel like segments from breakfast TV.A good group of players showing their ambitions in a great academy setup, they probably don't have the energy an interviewer wants in an interviewee, but it is clear they have good character and commitment. That is probably the selling point of Academy Dreams, in that it is aimed at ages 7+, and whilst the fall-outs, language and wider world perceptions are cut out from the usual All or Nothing series, it provides an insight that a parent can enjoy with their parent.Jones is a good choice of narrator, the tumultuous season at Leeds United provides an interesting season to by on a fly-on-the-wall for, and many of these young players are in first team football now, giving background to the latest crop of stars.",False

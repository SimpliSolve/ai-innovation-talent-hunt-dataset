1,8,"Disturbing, yet relevant",Phillippa_me-me-me,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow, I expected stuff like this to happen in the near future. Turns out the near future has been here for a while! Gosh, what a dystopian society we're living in. The misogyny and sense of entitlement of these men is off the charts! It's truly scary! Fortunately documentaries like this are being done and hopefully they'll open people's eyes to the implications of so much technology all around us and prompt us to do something about it before it's too late. Is it too late already? Overall, good documentary, particularly in how they made use of the very technology they're talking about to present this issue.",False

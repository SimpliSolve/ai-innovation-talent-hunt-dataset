2,8,German History Y,ulala,n/a,16/08/2025,"A different look on German history, is what drove me to watch this. Turns out, I was right, it is. A very interessting one, too. It's also the insightful study of an artist, and two humans. Because Bushido's wife Anna-Maria, mother of, by now 8, children is what had me coming back every evening to another episode. She's got brains, and wit, and enviable moral integrity, plus she looks like a Barbiedoll, which is amazing to watch. Bushido himself is also eye-candy, so that was quite the feast. The production design is beautiful, the setup ok, with loads of years rolling by with type-writer speed and sound. The title Unzensiert, uncensored, is an illusion of course, but not more than that every gaze is determined by the person that does the gazing, does the cutting, the questioning. And tells the story in quite their own way, slightly counter chronological, setting up events by reflections of their consequences, and such artistry, sometime confusing, probably on purpose, always engaging. Never controversial, never challenging the statements of their protagonist. Still, every once in awhile, Bushido contradicts himself, over time. I'd say he evolves, others say he's lying, it's probably both, people are like that. The interviewer could have been more critical, but that would not have led to more truth, but rather to a closing up, I feel. Since I had never liked Gangster Rap, I finished the first season with a crash course on Bushido, and found his art over the years mirroring the man I came to ""know"" in the documentary. Except of course his ventures into dissing former colleagues for the same reason he is now being dissed for. Wich is truly funny to see, in hindsight.I hope there will be a second season.",False

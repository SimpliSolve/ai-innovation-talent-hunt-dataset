1,6,Interesting but dry,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.Interesting, yet it feels repetitive with the main subject it wants to explore. The topics about police corruption and abuse of power has been explored within the media for years and the documentary explores the subject with some pretty interesting insights and conversations to explain the issues and the topics. Lance Ford who created ""Strong Island"" was impactful and while his direction here is good, his sense of exploration and emotion feels lacking and not as strong as his previous movie.With the movie using many archival footage, interviews and presentations, the style ends up feeling dry as it ends up feeling like the typical and basic Netflix documentary with some really odd editing choices and repetitive tone. The subject is a very serious matter which I do agree with some of the main points but I wish the documentary didn't feel as repetitive as it is.Overall, it is a interesting story but it runs dry at the end of the day.",False
2,5,I see it both ways,Portaltech78,n/a,16/08/2025,"I see it as the film was mostly right about policing in a police brutality way, controling the lower class and minorities, but we do need to control violence/criminals.We all should know by now Police brutality happens daily, we all should know far too many police lie and cover up for each other.There has to be a balanced alternative.We need to be responsible for our own behavior, EVERYONE. I don't think this film was biased as some has said.I think we need to just keep trying to strive to do better.Most importantly we need to get rid of the politicians who are committing crimes all the time.",False
3,6,Raises Awareness But Offers Few Solutions,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Questions about unchecked police power have become one of today's hot button social issues, and the public is deeply divided about it, depending on who one speaks with. Writer-director Yance Ford's latest pours ample fuel onto this fire with a cinematic essay that clearly has an impassioned view on the subject, making a strong case that some will obviously agree with but that others are likely to decry as an agenda-driven leftist treatise. Through a series of interviews with academics who have studied the issue and criminal justice insiders, viewers are shown the dual-edged sword surrounding this subject. While the film acknowledges that there is a need for policing in light of the prevalence of violent crime, it also argues that the supposed deterrent to this problem - a greater police presence with wider, legally sanctioned latitude in carrying out its mission - is simultaneously contributing to its growth, circumstances that have long gone unrecognized and/or willfully ignored as a result of longstanding prejudicial societal conditions that have only furthered the proliferation of this issue. Those conditions, in turn, are dissected in terms of how and why they fell into place through the years as a means to curtail the freedoms of those who were seen as posing an inherent (if somewhat overblown and paranoic) threat to the social order imposed by an entitled power structure (namely, anyone whose demographic attributes didn't match those of the self-appointed elite). Archive footage thus explores the efforts of early police forces to contain the lives and activities of slaves, indigenous peoples, immigrants and labor organizers, all of whom were considered suspect simply by virtue of their own innate identities. And, from these dubiously sanctioned roots, the power of those in charge has only grown more formidable and pervasive in forcefully holding down those who are perceived as dangers to the status quo, such as student radicals, social and political opponents, and others outside ""the mainstream,"" thanks to the supply of increasingly alarming means more typical of paramilitary operations than the civilized maintenance of law and order necessary for the functioning of a supposedly mature democracy. Good cases are made in favor of these arguments, to be sure. And, in all fairness, the film incorporates the views of constituents within the system who are legitimately trying to reform it internally. Admittedly, though, ""Power"" has a tendency to become somewhat circular in making its point, redundantly repeating its genuinely valid contentions but without offering solutions to a scenario that only seems to growing worse without impactful efforts to contain it, a decidedly missed opportunity to meaningfully address the situation. Perhaps that's what is needed next, with this offering serving primarily to draw attention to and raise awareness of the issue, but I think the public at large is already sufficiently cognizant of the situation that this release could have gone farther in tackling its subject. Sustained recognition of the problem is certainly a noteworthy takeaway from this production, but it's unfortunate that it didn't seek to expand on that notion and offer us more in terms of providing answers - and hope for the future.",False
4,7,Not to the people,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - the documentary is trying to shine a light into the power police has (in the US) ... which may exceed enormously from what they were intended to have and be for the people. As a comic book hero said: with great power comes great responsibility. It is easy to paint a whole force as bad - what needs to happen is trying to root out the bad people and find a way to have people who are secure in their job and their attitude.Because let's keep it real: it is not an easy job. But that is why you need way better training for those who want to actually become and help the people ... with the power that they hold. The movie makes a few good points, but could go deeper on others. Also this is as I already stated confined to America ... but the world is so complex you could never have done all of the police ...",False
5,3,Predictably Trite in 2024,thegreenteaman,n/a,16/08/2025,"There are avenues left to explore when it comes to policing in America, but this documentary fails to find any of them.Instead of, as they say in the intro, encouraging the viewer to question policing, the documentary tries to tell you exactly what you should believe about policing, what policing is, and it's all the same points you hear parroted online (police are slave patrol descendants, policing is unfair so you shouldn't obey, etc.). It's a film that stokes racial adversity rather than offering the fair analysis of policing that it claims in the intro.If you've ever gone down a twitter thread about race and policing, then you've already seen everything this film has to offer.",False
6,10,A hit dog gonna holler lol,neulette-44691,n/a,16/08/2025,To some of us this information is unfortunately not new. Hate it or love it these are the facts and it's an ugly truth. More people should watch it and really drink it in. A good watch IMO. The negative reviews are very telling of the mind set that holds us all back in one way or another. It makes you think what is even the point of law enforcement especially knowing what we know now in this day and age. Makes you really wonder who are they really protecting? It's definitely not the poor. Regardless of ethnicity if you're not in the 1% you're pretty much screwed. The system is not broken it is designed purposely this way smh.,False
7,10,One of the most important documentaries to watch.,amgrehan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredibly moving, thought provoking and very saddening - this documentary is a much watch. It should be part of the national curriculum for all schools in the United States of America.The majority of the reviews for this documentary are unable to see past their author's entitled view of their own existences. The reviews often look to dismiss the context and content as a means to ignore the undeniable truths exposed in this documentary.Watch this with an open mind and a humble heart and you will learn a great deal about the unforgivable crimes the US police force has commited against the people for more than a century.",False
8,1,Review: Tokenism in Policing Documentary,thadtedxii,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIn dissecting the anatomy of 'Power,' it's as if we're stuck in a time loop where history echoes louder than the present, reminiscent of Maya Angelou's words: 'History, despite its wrenching pain, cannot be unlived, but if faced with courage, need not be lived again.' Yet, amidst this historical discourse, the film neglects the contemporary melody of the class divide, overshadowing the racial symphony of yesteryears. While acknowledging the persistent drumbeat of racism, the documentary leaves us stranded in a sea of change without a compass, as Martin Luther King Jr. Cautioned: 'Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability but comes through continuous struggle.' Thus, 'Power' falters in its stride toward enlightenment, leaving us yearning for a roadmap to reconstruct a fractured system.",True
9,1,"Very biased, lots of poorly correlated inferences",bjburke-72155,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is really constructed using and reinforcing biased social theories to try and lead viewers to a desired conclusion as most documentaries do. Unfortunately there are a lot of inferences and truthfully flawed correlations used in trying to paint ultimately what the documentary clearly wishes to portray, which is a Marxian portrayal of police conflict theory.There are sociologists with intimate knowledge on policing vs those who have a surface level solely academic comprehension on the topic which is unfortunately the source of choice used in the piece. I don't think those with intimate knowledge of policing who try and move the field forward would work very well within the constructs of this piece as it's more likely to contradict the desired outcome of what is ultimately a flawed portrayal on the policing entity. Which is likely the reason you didn't see many ""experts"" with those qualifications used in the film.A system designed and modified by those voted into power via a democratic system, implementing and changing laws via a democratic system, being interpreted by states attorneys and judges put in place by a democratic system, judged for their actions both socially and by those put in place by a democratic system, still somehow socially falls squarely on the shoulders of single entity that is also a reflection of the majority of society due to the democratic process (the very thing democracy is supposed to be) isn't especially logical. Conflict theory will find a problem in every situation at it's very foundation. The police could hand out candy all day and take no law enforcement action and conflict theory would still tell you how the police are the problem because someone would still benefit from what is the spear of a significant social tool and face of the justice system. It's systemic with conflict theory and will always exist.Policing isnt a rogue entity. It is a fluid reflection of society at all points through America's history. There are checks and balances. Politically, judicially, and ultimately by we the voters who hold the entire system accountable.",False
10,9,A Compelling Look at the History of Policing in America,aryafrancescajenkins,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Power,"" the 86-minute long documentary about the history of policing in America that was written, directed and produced by Yance Ford and is currently streaming on Netflix is a thought-provoking examination of our failed systems of justice and our longstanding prejudices that merits attention. The documentary shows how policing, which began with the corraling and erasure of the indigenous on the frontier, and proceeded, even with the first police force in NYC in 1844 that arose directly as a result of the problems of immigration, to evolve as a force that curtails the powers of the oppressed and minorities in service of the white elite.The documentary is not a ""hate-the-police"" show or plug, as it also features the words and efforts of caring, experienced police officers, rather, a call to think and care about the systematic oppression by authorities of the weak and underserved that has prevailed through centuries here in the name of ""law and order.""Of course we need police, but the standards by which police operate, the documentary makes clear, are largely determined by police themselves, and as long as the shadow force of policing continues to exert its power unchecked in this country, we are in danger of losing our freedom and democracy.",False
11,1,Don't waste your time,ynot-92870,n/a,16/08/2025,Was very very poorly put together. I was so excited to watch but it turned into a major disappointment. The film uses footage from other countries even though it's all about policing in the U. S. and for some reason while they are talking about the police they keep showing films of nuclear weapons testing lol??? Very odd movie and a huge shame that they couldn't have made this better about a very important topic in our country:/ hopefully someone better can come along and get this topic right in the future. Surprised Netflix let this air?? I would have thought they would have teams of reviewers making sure their products aren't complete nonsense. So many better things to watch!,False
12,10,its asphyxiating...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFor a world citizen living in a completely different society of policing of Norway, owing the fly on the wall insight on how bad policing in america has been and will be due to the 3 periods of oppresion, namely , slavery, unions and racial lines, that has evolved from private policing to state and national policing,and a multitude of segregated multidimentional branches of weaponized policing(fbi,dea irs) and there are no hopes for a change on that issue in forthcomming years.The police force of u.s.a. Has become to big a crowd to control, and when the force are outmanouvered, politicians send in the national guard as enforcements, just to avoid loss of votes at next elections. So who police the police themselves??? Theyre just mice compared ...i may say what i want, that isnt going to work, im just stunned to the marrow how violent it has become...and bless all of them police officers who are more humanly devoted on their worksite.they cannot have easy days at the job.Its a very subjectively made documentary made on the oppresed part of the masses, and why not... i think they manage to put their pointer on the issues with the power of a laser beam, in other words a perfectly made criticism of a system that doesnt work at all. The grumpy old man recommends a look, if i could i wouldve oscar nominated this feature documentary, cause it tells most of the truth as its on the ground.",True
13,1,Pushing an agenda,gregluge,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is flawed amd pushes an agenda that could have severly negative affects if came to realization. How has depositing worked in NYC lately? Policework can sometimes be messy, but typically only towards people who are hurting society.So back to my point. If you are going ro do a documentary on a subject, you should cover all aspects of a subject, not just one side. This documentary about the the ""unchecked power of law enforcement "" should look at the positive things that law enforcement does.The producers should also highlight the checks and balances in place that ifentify bad cops and remove them. The criminal justice system is very effective in prosecuting the few bad cops there. Are.This documentary is Very biased and one sided.Garbage.",False
14,1,Embracing Unity: Unveiling the Empowering Essence of True Power,jjmmjj-92225,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerStrength is found in unity true power doesn't seek control, it empowers. This counters the documentary's assertion that power concedes nothing without a demand. It advocates for collaborative empowerment over confrontational demands, urging a shift towards collective action and inclusivity. This sentiment resonates with the need for the documentary to foster unity and empowerment in addressing complex societal issues, offering a more cohesive and creative approach to its subject matter. This sentiment aligns with the imperative for the documentary to foster unity and empowerment in addressing complex societal issues. Embracing this approach could lead to a more impactful exploration of the subject matter, fostering deeper understanding and dialogue.",True
15,1,When your first statement is obviously false...,vincentgcross,n/a,16/08/2025,"You know that the people making the documentary have little regard for facts.FYI the first statement was that Boston had the first modern police force (London did and Boston was later modeled after it, see Goofs).I was expecting a thoughtful piece about the origins of modern policing and leading into the failures and problems today. Once I heard a very obvious falsehood in the first minute I knew everything I needed to about how this documentary was made and where it would go.If a documentary maker cannot get basic and well-known facts right, then how we trust them in anything else they present?",False
16,2,Power misses the opportunity to contribute positively,Someguyinparis,n/a,16/08/2025,"While ""Power"" by Yance Ford aims to delve into the complex subject of policing, the documentary unfortunately falls short in delivering a fresh perspective. It treads familiar ground, reiterating points made by numerous films and series before it. The documentary's portrayal of the police in a persistently negative light adds to an already contentious debate, potentially overshadowing the nuanced realities of law enforcement.A balanced approach is crucial when discussing social justice and the role of the police in society. Constructive dialogue is needed to foster understanding and reform. However, ""Power"" misses the opportunity to contribute positively to this conversation, instead choosing to reinforce a one-sided narrative that may hinder the progress towards a fair and effective justice system.",False

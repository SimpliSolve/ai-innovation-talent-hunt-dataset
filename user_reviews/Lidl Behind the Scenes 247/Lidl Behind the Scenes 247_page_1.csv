1,4,Feels more like a 43 minute ad,mtmb-03078,n/a,16/08/2025,"10 minutes felt like some good insights such as seeing the eggs sourcing behind the scenes, and a couple interesting aspects like larger barcodes for quicker scanning.But the rest felt more like an advertisement for when to best shop or what to look for, and the surveys on certain products felt less organic.Not really the insight documentary I was hoping for, but then again why would they actually give away their secrets to competitors.I would only recommend watching this if you really had nothing else to watch and want something brief in between other shows that's not too heavy. Otherwise, save your time.",False

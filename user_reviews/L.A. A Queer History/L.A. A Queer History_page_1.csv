1,10,Queer History Must Be Seen,jwzmqrjnrf,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Stonewall rebellion is internationally known as a seminal event in LGBT history but L. A. A Queer History posits that Los Angeles is equally important in the struggle for LGBT equality and recognition.The director Gregorio Davila and the producers have rewarded us with an entertaining and interesting survey of LA's LGBT history, a vital part of the history of Los Angeles. Hollywood and its stars are given a nod but this film is more about the grass roots people and their stories.Using interviews from the past interwoven with contemporary commentary from activists and community spokespersons, the film gives us a sense of the courage and creativity of those who make a difference. Well known figures Harry Hay, Ivy Bottini, Pat Rocco, Morris Kight, Jewel Thais-Williams, Troy Perry and many more are delved into. Harry Hay founded the Mattachine Society in 1950 which grew into chapters all over the US. Morris Kight and Don Kilhefner founded the Gay Community Services Center in 1971, now the world's largest LGBT center and now known as the Los Angeles LGBT Center. Troy Perry founded the Metropolitan Community Church in 1968 and is seen in this film at the first pride parade on Hollywood Blvd. In 1970. Stories of raids, entrapment, violence and discrimination are blended with those of joy, courage, determination, fun and victory. So many stories, incidents and people in this film deserve their own books and movies.The quality of the editing using found footage and talking heads keeps this film moving. Narration by Steve Buscemi sets just the right tone.I have seen clips from this movie in progress, the truncated version shown recently on PBS, and the final version in a theater. This film deserves to be seen in a theater. If you have only seen the PBS version, you owe in to yourself to search for a theater screening.This film shows us the importance of learning from the past in order to improve the future.This film is recommended and appropriate for all ages.",False
2,4,Horrible Rewrite of History in Second Episode Ruins Effort,jonc-54202,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone interested in Gay history and Los Angeles, I was looking forward to seeing this on PBS. The first episode was pleasant enough and there was some great footage especially of the protests at Barney's Beanery. The second episode ruined it for me - as a gay male living in Los Angeles in the nineties - the director was out to portray the Clinton Administration as being against gay and lesbian progress... Specifically bringing up Don't Ask Don't Tell - and not going over any of the major successes that helped turn the corner for the AIDS crisis and setting the 1990s as the seminal decade for gay rights. We were finally being recognized and protected BECAUSE of the administration. DADT was an attempt to overturn the gay ban in the military, while he couldn't accomplish that - DADT was a compromise that allowed gay people to serve without being pursued... It was one of the first accomplishments of the administration and the first time a US President had become an ally to gay people. The Clinton Administration sharply focused US resources on AIDS, established offices for AIDS research, enacted hate crime legislation, battled anti-gay state propositions, insurance discrimination, appointed hundreds of openly gay public servants, ended the ban on security clearances for gays and lesbians... The director is pushing a false agenda either because they didn't live through this era or didn't do enough research - thus damaging the work.",True

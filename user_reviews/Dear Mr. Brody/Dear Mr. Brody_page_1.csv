Greetings again from the darkness. Filmmaker Keith Maitland is responsible for one of the best made and most interesting documentaries of all-time. His TOWER (2016) was a favorite on the festival run, as well as its numerous TV showings. The body count on his latest is reduced, and it plays like psychoanalysis of a young man who captured the nation's attention for one brief moment in time.If the title doesn't ring a bell, you likely were either too young or not born when, in 1970, the heir to an Oleo Margarine fortune made headlines everywhere. Michael James Brody, Jr announced that he was going to give away his millions to anyone who asked. He even gave out his home address and phone number in Scarsdale, New York. The announcement even got him a spot on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" to sing a song ... which led to a recording contract.At the time, Brody was 21 years old and married to Renee, who was kind enough to sit for interviews with Mr. Maitland for the film. Her (reluctant) insight paints a picture of a man who believed in ""Peace"" over ""Money"", and started with the best intentions of helping people. Sadly, but not surprisingly, it didn't take long for the cracks to show in Brody's mission. His pronouncements of gift-giving had his wealth fluctuating from $25 million to $50 million, and even into the billions at times. His demeanor shifted drastically, sometimes within the same day.The letters flowed in. And kept coming. We hear from authors, friends of Brody, and researchers. Producer Melissa Robyn Glassman located 12 boxes of unopened letters that movie Producer Edward Pressman had in storage from a movie project that never materialized. We also hear from Brody's and Renee's son Jamey, who not only collects items from the family ""Good Luck"" Margarine brand, but also has 40-50 boxes of unopened letters addressed to his dad ... Dear Mr. Brody.It's those letters that provide the heart and soul of the story, the movie, and this moment in history. Maitland and Melissa track down some of the original letter writers, as well as some of the surviving family members. As they read the words from decades ago, emotions take over and instantly, we are observing an intimate memory. We may be intruding, but these are raw human emotions on display.Brody's mental state at the time is also discussed. Drugs clearly played a part in his behavior - specifically PCP, and this led to interest from the editor of ""High Times"" magazine. It also led to Brody being hospitalized for a time, and ultimately to tragedy. History is filled with odd characters, and Michael James Brody, Jr certainly had his Andy Warhol '15 minutes of Fame', but the real story here is that of those who wrote the letters of need/want more than 50 years ago.
**NOTE: it's not surprising that Brody's house at 31 Paddington Road in Scarsdale was long ago razed and replaced with a mansion more suitable to the area.",False
3,1,"The sad state of ""documentaries"" today",jake_fantom,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe question that today's streaming service documentarians never seem to ask themselves: Is this guy really worth a nearly two-hour documentary? In this case, the answer is a resounding NO. Brody, the subject of this turgid screed, is a combination of narcissist, moron, dope fiend, and BS artist - with not a single redeeming feature that I could detect. The storyline is that as the supposed heir to a fortune, he promised to give away his inheritance (variously proclaimed as 25 million dollars, 1 billion dollars, and 100 billion dollars) to the poor and needy. But the fact was, he was essentially broke, and lost what few brains he had inherited to his favorite smoke, PCP. None of this stopped gazillions of folks from sending this nincompoop letters begging for money. Those letters have sat in crates in storage units since the 1970s, and I guess some hustler had the bright idea of making a documentary where the letters are re-read, sometimes by mediocre actors, sometimes by the actual surviving letter writers or their descendants, in the vague hope of dragging some emotion out of what is essentially a monumentally boring subject, worth approximately a three-minute YouTube snoozer. In the end, Brody gets what he deserves, and if you choose to watch this prolonged waste of time, you will too.",True
4,1,Be A Fraud-Announce Handout-Con For Attention,helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerSo Brody was, at his core, a complete fraud. He wasn't worth millions upon millions; he had an allowance from a trust fund, but nowhere near what he claimed he had.He's also an attention seeker, as well as an habitual drug user and liar. As part of this, he decides to try and sell his 'music', and what many suspect he felt would lead to him eventually having enough money to give away.But what eventually happened was, hundreds of thousands of people clamored for a handout- after he loudly and obnoxiously advertised that he was a multimillionaire and wanted to give it all away. So when people started writing, calling, then showing up on his doorstep, pleading with him, he started feigning indignation and indifference. Claiming people were trying to kill him, yet no evidence ever became known to this. It's curious that he proclaimed to not want any money and was giving it all away, and when people began to take him up on his offer, he realized he couldn't keep up the facade. He was bouncing checks all over; creating more sadness and desperation than so many people had felt before his promise of assistance, and quite a few people were stuck holding the bag for his immaturity and insanity.People who were at the end of their rope, searching for help of any kind, and were sure he was the answer to his prayers, were ultimately turned away because he never intended to give away the money he did have in the first place. Or he'd write worthless checks and when people tried to pay their bills they'd find out what a fraud he was.He was a typical hippie baby-boomer that thought if he put this nonsense out into the world, he'd become famous, loved and wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. He rambled on countless times like the lunatic he was, pledging millions to stop the war, to legalize drugs, to do anything he felt irksome regarding, and ultimately tried to land on the White House lawn, and was nearly shot down in the process.His significant other/wife was as fringe as Brody, and still is. She wholeheartedly clings to the lie, that the insane Brody was a legitimate philanthropist (he never came close to that) and never helped anyone. Well, unless you count helping himself to far too many drugs and alcoholic beverages, along with hearing helpings of attention that ultimately became negative, and lent himself to infamy, rather than fame.The premise of this movie makes no sense- it shows some of the worst of people at tragic times in their lives, begging and pleading for help, and ultimately deeply betrayed by a complete and utter failure, and has people reading their letters for some reason. They're humiliated and embarrassed and quite some time later are reliving the horror of their past. All while Brody's wife and a few friends wax nostalgic about this guys supposed altruism that never came to fruition, then showcases his incredibly overweight son (an obvious characteristic of someone suffering with mental illness) who has an odd collection of his dad's neurotic endeavor, likely caused by his mother's ridiculous obsession.It's quite an horrific telling of this guys strange and pathetic story, one I studied in advanced psychology courses during my masters program. It feels like this guy and his disgusting ego will never die- even after he's been long gone.Skip this and find an honest philanthropic endeavor and make a real difference to someone else.",True

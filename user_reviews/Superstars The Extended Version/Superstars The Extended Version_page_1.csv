1,9,A NOSTALGIC RIDE INTO THE MAKING OF THIS WONDERFUL FILM,robert_seoane,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're a JCS fan, you will love this. Although it doesn't include songs from the film (you can play that anytime you want), it's a close-up look at the making of the film and what it meant to them. Most of all, it's great to see everyone together again. Ted Neeley, Yvonne Elliman, Bob Bingham, Larry Marshall, Kurt Yaghijian, Josh Mostel and the late great Barry Dennen. You can feel the love there is among these people, and Carl Anderson is with them in spirit as they have his picture during the Q&A prominent for all to remember him, and a segment honoring him towards the end. Most of all, the words from Norman Jewison and the cast telling us stories of the making of the movie caps this film with wonderful tales. No doubt Jewison is a genius. Yvonne Elliman graces us with a little of her beautiful voice, still strong and vibrant after all these years, and the talented Ted Neeley pulls it all together with just his presence and his unbounding love for all, and his appreciation for the film that defined his career. This is a must see for lovers of music and film.",False
2,7,More of a tribute than an actual 'making of' the film,apostolosannis,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have to say that the trailer is misleading for a complete different thing. Semi-amateur/professional documentation, mostly of memories and interviews - More of a tribute than a real actual 'making of' the film. Interesting to watch, very moving and heartfully insight from the people who are/were part of this. Since it's a worldwide streaming, (at least English) subtitles would be much appreciated. Still, precious it is.",False
3,10,Great background,FredrickVegas-28-300758,n/a,15/08/2025,"One of my favorite films of all time! Good to see all and hear what it was like as just young people creating something magical and decades later, still enjoying that magic! That is a incredible dream...",False
4,10,A MUST SEE FOR SUPERSTAR FANS,peaceri,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you are a mega fan of Jesus Christ Superstar, like myself, the extended version of ""Superstars"" is a must see! The interviews and reunion with the cast and director (then and now) give you insight into the making of the movie and also reveals how much the cast and director think of each other. The beautiful tributes at the end for the late Barry Dennen and Carl Anderson will warm your heart. A big thumbs up!",False
5,10,WATCHED OVER AND OVER,gp-78757,n/a,15/08/2025,"I usually watch Jesus Christ Superstar on repeat over Easter weekend, but this year it was Superstars: The Extended Version. The new photos, the reunion interviews, the behind-the-scenes insights--it's truly a treasure trove for JCS SuperFans! THANK YOU to the JCS team for this gift.",False
6,10,JCS Incredible,b-huber01,n/a,15/08/2025,I have loved JCS ever since it first came out. I am now 63. It's wonderful to see behind the scenes. To see how much love these people still have for each other & how much the movie impacted their lives. I know it impacted mine.,False
7,10,Wonderful Documentary,boydalot,n/a,15/08/2025,I so enjoyed watching this film and seeing everyone coming back together. It was so interesting. I have watched this film over and over and always at Easter. This is one of those films that will live on and on.,False
8,4,I Don't Know How to Love This,Far_Out,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was psyched to see this. I was sad once I did.It's well worth it to see and hear Norman Jewison. But, he was obviously declining and had to be prompted more than once by Ted, who acted as his guide. It was interesting to see for whom he had the most enthusiastic reaction upon being reunited with each cast member.I was put off by all the overhyping of some actors who had minor roles. Each one were treated as if they were crucial to the entire enterprise. If everyone is special, no one is special. I was also stunned by the choppy Directing of Munoz. I spent far too much time trying to figure out what the heck he was trying to do/convey.The film footage of 1973 Israel and some of the sets/scenes were great to see. It's the best part of this documentary.JCS is truly significant. I rewatch it several times each year. I find it brilliant and some of the insights I heard in ""Extended"" added to the depth and breadth of my regard for JCS.Yet, sadly, the tongue bathing and the overdone bonhomie were much too sappy and overwhelmed the effort.",False
9,10,Great updated version,ktngrandma,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have been a fan of the movie since it came to theatres in 1973. I saw the play live, have the original soundtrack. I have been to recent singalongs and have met, as have thousands of others, Ted Neeley and Yvonne Elliman.Getting to see the performers and hear their stories is a must for fans of the movie.If you are not yet a fan, maybe watching this you will become one! There was controversy when the movie came out and there was still a protester at one sing-along I attended. Anyone wondering why, should watch this documentary.If you have seen the prior documentary, as I have, you will still greatly enjoy this one with its updates.Nothing to look at. Thanks for the memories, folks, from a fan. Or groupie.",False
10,10,Wonderful insight to Superstar!,kelly-65936,n/a,15/08/2025,This was special to watch to see some wonderful insight into the cast and their special bond and to see the background elements during filming. My absolute favorite film of all time. It is always an emotional experience to watch.,False
11,10,A must see!,magracey-36261,n/a,15/08/2025,Amazing behind the scenes look at the original JCSS cast members and crew! Loved it!,False
12,10,A Beautiful Reunion,contact-39282,n/a,15/08/2025,Superstars is a beautiful reunion of all the talented actors from the original movie of Jesus Christ Superstar. Hearing the behind the scenes stories from the cast was awesome. If you loved Jesus Christ Superstar then seeing Superstars is a must!,False
13,10,Superstars: The Extended Version Documentary is a must for any Jesus Christ Superstar fan.,Michele701,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you're a fan of the movie Jesus Christ Superstar, you owe it to yourself to watch Superstars: The Extended Version Documentary. I loved it. I loved it so much that after seeing it for free, I had to buy it. I consider it a great addition to the movie itself.Superstars: The Extended Version Documentary begins with all the principal actors getting together for a reunion. And the love that is shared between this group of friends is heartwarming. You want to hang out with them because it looks like they're having so much fun. They are clearly a family, with so much affection for each other, so much appreciation, and laughter! I felt like I had been allowed entry into a private, intimate club with a group that had shared an extraordinary experience. And in fact, I was. It was spectacular, and, as a fan, I felt both humbled and honored to witness that.All the principal actors - Ted Neeley, Yvonne Elliman, Barry Dennen, Bob Bingham, Kurt Yaghjian, Larry Marshall, and Josh Mostel - were there to share their personal stories and mindset during the making of Jesus Christ Superstar. I found this fascinating: it's like they pulled back the curtain on a beloved movie and allowed us to catch a glimpse into the intimate details from the inside. It was wonderful to see these actors, back in 1973, speaking out of character. They were (are) such a humble, thoughtful, funny, and extraordinarily talented group. I also loved how Superstars: The Extended Version Documentary juxtaposes the past with the present with stories and interviews - from today back to 1973 in Israel. Norman Jewison had a reporter and photographer on set during filming, fortunately, so there's a lot of footage. And the pictures! So many behind-the-scenes amazing photos.There are also noteworthy interviews with Mr. Norman Jewison himself, the man responsible for the masterpiece. He graciously gives of his time, taking us further behind the scenes and sharing his thoughts and vision. He gives insight on what he had set out to achieve in making Jesus Christ Superstar (and did so in spades), and I found his words to be deeply inspiring.Sadly, the incredibly talented Carl Anderson passed away some years ago, so he could not join the reunion. But there is a heartwarming tribute to him and the brilliant Barry Dennen, who passed after the Superstars Documentary first came out as well. These two gifted performers could never be left out by their beloved cast mates, and the movie would never have been the same had any of these actors not been involved.And finally, there is an interview session with a cast reunion and Norman Jewison in New York. Here they share great, heartwarming stories (Barry's made me laugh, so different from Pontius Pilate) more film footage; there's even a football game where Ted takes all. Well, he is JC, right?In any case, Superstars: The Extended Documentary is a keepsake for anyone interested in knowing a little more about the movie Jesus Christ Superstar or who simply wants a little backstory into the art of moviemaking. This is one you don't want to be without.",False
14,10,A Wonderful Story From A Wonderful Cast!,joelramirez-91083,n/a,15/08/2025,"A wonderful touch of detail to a beautiful work of art and story telling. Showing the strong bonds of friendship that was made during filming, the outstanding memories they have made, and a huge impact it has brought to our lifetime. Jesus Christ Superstar will be remembered and it's songs will never be out of our heads. The look of our faces once we hear the opening overture, 10 seconds in, will always be smile. The cast brought so much to this film and documentary it's overwhelming. To think I was born in 2002 and that JCS would have such an impact is overtop amazing, so much so that I know the entire soundtrack by heart. It's an amazing story and musical for people of all ages for all generations! -MW.",False

18,10,Heartwarming cast reunion (including lots of happy HUGS) and enchanting stories,oceansandsunfun,n/a,15/08/2025,"Highly recommend this new extended version of ""Superstars""! The cast and crew aren't just performers who worked with one another on one of the most memorable rock operas of all time, but they built deep friendships that have endured for decades. Sadly, Carl and Barry have passed, but are warmly remembered in the tribute section. It's inspiring to see how many devoted fans there are after all of these years, and it's so nice to get to meet many of them at the live, local events. Excellent job, Ted & Frank!! Thank you for creating this for us.",False

20,10,Great Documentary!,writeon-66214,n/a,15/08/2025,"Love this doc. I watched Jesus Christ Superstar when I was a kid and several times over the years so I'm familiar with the characters. But the doc was like sitting at a family reunion, listening to some great stories. Yvonne is still beautiful, Josh Mostel is still funny, and Ted Neeley still has that humble, serene quality. Totally enjoyed this.",False
21,10,Amazing!,sebimessina,n/a,15/08/2025,"If we wanted to define JCS, we would say that it is, and continues to be, pure emotion. Even 50 years after its release.So, after having watched the movie dozens of times, having learned the lyrics by heart, having followed Ted Neeley's tours from a distance during all these years, for a sort of strange addiction, you still want to know more.And this is what makes watching ""Superstars: The Extended Version"" something special and unmissable.Finding the same cast, 50 years later, retracing that incredible adventure, remembering each other anecdotes and facts unknown to most of us is truly priceless.Moreover, it is a tribute of admiration and - I believe - sincere friendship towards the unforgettable Carl Anderson/Judas and Barry Dennen/Pilate.I would recommend it to anyone for viewing.Thank you Ted & co. For once again creating pure emotion.Sebi.",False

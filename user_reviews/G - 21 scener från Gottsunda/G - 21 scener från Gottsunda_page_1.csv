1,8,Back to the past,paulinakotulska,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's hard to describe how I felt during the movie and after watching it. I'm surely contented that I'm not living in such a place - where anytime I can get a phone call saying that my friend was murdered. Because that's how the district of Swedish city Uppsala, Gottsunda is - dangerous and devouring a man in full. Batti does not embellish this district - he records every possible moment to show the horrors that take place there.It's a district where even small children swear and show you the middle finger, where childhood friends of Batti deal drugs and go into the jail (not for the first time).But there is a word that fits these people - brotherhood. Once friends, always brothers.The scenes of interviews with certain people are very important. Here, two worlds collide - the memory of Gottsunda from childhood and the present. Nothing is the same anymore.This movie is a courageous return to the past from which Batti desperately wanted to escape. Brave and needed - especially for him.""Not everyone can be like Zlatan Ibrahimovic"" - even though he didn't grow up in Gottsunda, the similarity of his early life makes this thought a keynote for the Gottsunda's residents.",False
2,10,A deeper view,Just_a_,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMy review is coloured from my experience of living in this suburb. Inside a society no-one outside seems to understand but everyone have a opinion how to fix.I Really appreciate this move. It shows the raw side that most people know about but also the friendship and the feeling of belonging. It portraits the struggle with leaving but also the necessary in it.It shows how the everyday experiences change who you are and affect what you see as a normal day. You can hear how his tone change when he talks to his gf after a few month here. It get rougher and the mentality of ""no-one else understands"".It doesn't portrait the life in G as a walk on roses in any way, but it gives empathy to way people stay and make some of the decisions they do. It shows how friendship and loyalty becomes the groundstones and the vulnerability and fright people feel of being left outside.This is the part that all politicians and people outside don't understand when they talk about solutions. It's not about the money or the lack of things to do. It's about a mentality that been growing here for a long time. That it's unique and no-one else will understand you. You are unique. I see that this review used those words a lot, but it is like a disease. You don't know you have it until someone smash it in your face.I hope this documentary can change someone's life. Someone that can feel seen and realise what they need to do.For people that aren't in a place like this it might be harder to understand and I'm not sure if this movie will make anything clearer.",True
3,10,Poignant awards favourite,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis incredible and emotional documentary drama is, indeed, one of the better Swedish films of the year, and subquesiantly one of the better films of the year.It delves deep into some social issues, whilst keeping an eye for hope and conveying the right of change and examplifies the right of a normal life. Very powerful, very well cut and very real indeed. More relevant than most in today's landscape.The cinematography, cutting and editing is excellent, very beautifully put together and very fluid and well paced, all around a great film.Highly recommended for anyone, lover of film or anyone else really. Truly a poignant and powerful experience!",True

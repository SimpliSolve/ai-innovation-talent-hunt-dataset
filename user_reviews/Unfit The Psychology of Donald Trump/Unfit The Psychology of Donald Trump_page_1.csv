1,8,Insightful,fischer_patrick,n/a,16/08/2025,A very interesting and insightful look into the Former Guy. The psychological side was presented in an easy to understand and engaging way. The video evidence supporting the doctor's opinions was damning.,False
2,8,Enlightening.....,Katz5,n/a,16/08/2025,"For those interested in how the United States could produce a dictator on par with historical dictators of the past, from Mussolini up to Hussein, and current dictators such as Duterte and Putin.Those delusional viewers who didn't even watch the documentary (note the 1-star reviews below), keep on believing that August 13 (or September 18) is coming and the sociopath will be ""reinstated.""",False
3,9,Just try to be unbiased,bsverloop,n/a,16/08/2025,Don't watch this as a Trump lover or hater. Just try to be completely unbiased. Everything in this documentary makes perfect sense. It just does.,False
4,10,Really: Hits all the key points,rzajac,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not much to say: There are rafts of key points to be made about the ascent of Trump, and this flick pretty much hits them all.If you're a Trump supporter, and you *really* want to get a genuine perspective on the core reasons for Trump loathing, watch this flick attentively.Of course, if you meet both those criteria, you're a rare bird, indeed!Mostly, the flick will sing to the choir. Trump loathers generally aren't ""haters""; that is, we know and can fairly well articulate what it is that causes us to see Trump as a harbinger of doom to U. S. republicanism.But sometimes it's nice to see those views arrayed for delectation.",False
5,10,"Frightening, entertaining, important",howardm-41546,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very timely film revealing the most important untold aspect of the world's most dangerous man - his pathology. Well put together with articulate user-friendly mental health professionals and compelling pundits and experts. The film entertains and it scares the daylights out of you, and it's so rare for a film to do both. Loved the segment on the chimps explaining tribalism in America. Excellent beginning and ending. The best doc I have seen in years.",False
6,n/a,The uneducated are frightened and confused by liberal democracy,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is interesting to see all the 1/10 ratings versus the 8 to10/10 ratings. As explained in this tremendous documentary, there really are two groups of gorillas - and one of these groups has chosen a murderous, malignant narcissist to be their model, to speak for them, and to be their leader.",False
7,7,A non-American view.,zysis,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have no stake in the game, so to speak but a sick man is a sick man and when that sick man has so much power, the sickness is a scary thing. The warning signs are there, we can all say we saw them because we did. I just hope this film reaches who need to see it and that it's not too little, too late.",False
8,10,Clear and present danger,pguarin,n/a,16/08/2025,"A loser, 6x failed businessman conman of horrifying proportions and this' movie lays it out perfectly. ""a practical joke that's gotten out of hand"" sums it up.",False
9,7,A Well Made Documentary Whether You Agree or Not With Conclusion,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a very interesting look at the psychology of Donald Trump, through interviews with Psychologists and assorted people who know Trump personally. The general diagnosis is that Trump is a ""Malignant Narcisssist"". Whether you agree with this statement, and diagnosis, or not you can't help but find this documentary and its historical footage and photos interesting to watch. You get a look at his personality from public figure to Presidency. This is a well made documentary.",False
10,1,Trump Derangement Syndrome continues,jdthird,n/a,16/08/2025,Just more of the same ghost chasing and inane babble we've had to put up with for four years. Funny how this is supposed to be credible. Love all the bogus 10 star reviews.,False
11,10,Trump Supporters: Read This Review from the rest of the World,fredbusiness,n/a,16/08/2025,"There's a lot to be said about this movie, and it supports my view of the man in the first week of his announcement and the way truth is treated in the States. What I found most interesting were the comments from those polarised into left or right. Both sides, however, are trapped in America's definition of truth that fails to meet world standards, and I fear because of that, the arguments will chase their tails until the cows come home. Here's one piece of truth Americans love to bash.I'm not an American anymore. I'm writing this from Canada-a real free country. British N America beat the American invaders in their first war, the War of 1812. That war was so embarrassing for the Americans that they made the poem penned during the raid on Baltimore into a National Anthem. And, like America, it is misleading. It's FAKE. The raids on Washington and Baltimore, originating from Burmuda, were designed to pull American troops away from the Canadian border after an American raiding party put British civilians in harm's way from starvation and exposure to the cold. The governor-general of Canada advised the British Commander to implement the planned raiding attacks. It Worked.The raids were meant to put fear in the Americans and pull border troops to strengthen their port defences. Yet the anthem sounds like the British are the aggressors and were trying to invade and take Baltimore but failed. Raids aren't meant to do that, although a great meal was had in Washington. There's a reference in one of the stanzas about slavery and a reference to braveness and freedom. But wait, Canada fought back 11 invasion attempts to protect their way of life, liberty and freedom while Great Britain was fighting for their existence in the European Napoleonic wars. The pretext for British raiding parties on American ships, etc., justifying the invasion was a hoax, and Britain never rescinded those orders. You have got to love Madison and the American war hawks.Yet that anthem is sung at every hockey, baseball, basketball, or most any event hosting Americans and Canadians. Talk about insults. Still not one American understands the history and truth of that first war the Americans decided to get into... ""... a mere matter of marching...""American history is full of this propaganda, and it is an illusion that they invented freedom and liberty and are the freest. On that point, google Freedom House: List of Countries. Sort the list, and you'll see Canada in the top 3 positions and the States somewhere around the 60th position. Really.If Americans have a tradition for propaganda promoting American values, it is any wonder that when the country hits a rough patch, many Americans swallow, hook, line, and sinker lies they want to hear from their politicians. This is not a purely American phenomenon, but it does seem to find a steadfast home in American cultures... such as in Hollywood cinema.Critical thinking is essential in separating the wheat from the chaff in the news provided by the most reliable and usually unbiased organ for democracy, free journalism. If Americans continue to fail this critical process, is it any wonder that the likes of Trump can pull the wool over their eyes?For those who think for themselves, the documentary is an eye-opener/confirmation of the sorry state of affairs in America and the rest of the world. For those of us that don't, especially the far right, once you embrace Trumpism, you fail to see logic ever again.",False
12,7,TRUMP IS UNFIT!!,Bmore-Hero,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""Unfit: The Psychology of Donald Trump"" presents a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of the former president's psychological profile. The documentary dives deep into the minds of mental health professionals who analyze Trump's behavior, decision-making, and the potential dangers his personality traits may pose to democracy.The film's greatest strength lies in its thorough examination of Trump's character through the lens of psychology, offering insights that are both alarming and enlightening. The expert opinions provided are backed by decades of research and experience, making their assessments difficult to dismiss outright.However, the documentary sometimes veers into territory that feels more like an indictment than an objective analysis. The narrative occasionally lacks balance, leaving little room for counterarguments or differing perspectives. This can make the film feel somewhat one-sided, particularly for viewers seeking a more nuanced discussion of the subject.Additionally, while the psychological assessments are fascinating, the film occasionally repeats points, which can cause it to drag. A tighter edit might have made the documentary more impactful and easier to digest.Overall, ""Unfit: The Psychology of Donald Trump"" is a well-researched and engaging film that provides valuable insights into Trump's psyche, even if it leans heavily on one perspective. It's a must-watch for those interested in the intersection of psychology and politics, but it may not sway those who are looking for a balanced debate.",True
13,1,Biased Nonsense,earlybird_lv1,n/a,16/08/2025,Don't have to be a fan of the president to understand this is practically a partisan democrat fan film. Looking for a balanced perspective? Look elsewhere.,False
14,10,Trump is a global embarrassment,stormimurtie,n/a,16/08/2025,"Excellent documentary. Those who need to see it will not, but, deep down, they already know. What a chilling case study of powerful, dangerous, mentally ill men who pay their way to our most sacred leadership positions only to realize, they have no idea how to function. Terrifying.",False
15,10,great,ultor-04942,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just great. so true. so sad.
eye opening. excellent.",False
16,10,Excellent,dloffland,n/a,16/08/2025,I'd recommend this film to everyone. Supporters of trump will certainly be interested in learning more about their leader and themselves. Most people will be interested in learning why trump behaves the way he does.,False
17,n/a,On point.,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Everything you already know, but presented by people who have the credentials to say it... and they say it well!",False
18,6,"I love me some critiquing of Trump, but this was lacking in some areas",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think Trump is a dreadful human being and far from appropriate leader. That being said... I didn't think all the arguments here were consistently great.The golf stuff was funny but a bit petty, and I'm not sure it's really likely that we're heading into fascism the way Italy and Germany slid towards it in the 1920s and 30s.But many of the points were solid as hell, even if you've heard them before, and the presentation is slick and watchable (editing was a little tricky here and there though, but I don't take points off too much if that gets used a little).I guess they didn't need so many arguments to argue something that's admittedly pretty easy to argue- Trump is (or was nowadays!) unfit to be President, in certain regards.And with me, they were preaching to the choir, because as morbidly fascinating as I find Trump and those who support him, I have never and will never be convinced he's a good leader.It's more of a guilty pleasure documentary now that Trump is out of the position. It's no Totally Under Control (probably my favourite film of 2020) but it's kinda fun to watch post 2020 election, even if some of these problems do (and will) certainly persist...",False
19,10,Fascinating Psychology,julcaesar2000,n/a,16/08/2025,I was very impressed with the depth that this documentary goes into to explain Trump and his political career. A major reason for its depth is because of the credentials of the professionals that speak with authority on matters of psychology and politics.It's fascinating and scary.,False
20,6,This is unfocused,CubsandCulture,n/a,16/08/2025,"I voted for Biden and I am very glad to see Trump out of the White House. However, this isn't a very good documentary. I had expected a lot more of in-depth discussion of Trump from a clinical perspective and yet this documentary is pretty much just a primer on why Trump's character and disposition make him a dangerous person to give the power of the presidency too. The material about the possible personality disorder Trump suffers and the various ethical challenges around psychologists discussing Trump's mental health was compelling but it is was maybe a third of the movie. The rest was potboiler anti-Trump arguments.",False
21,9,There's no way to squirm out of this truth ....-,herrick416,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you love and follow Donald Trump for his lack of character or see him as a deadly worm invited into the 2016 presidential primary by a Republican Party so gullible in their ignorance of history to believe a threat is best handled from within. Contrary to the lessons that 1920's Italy 1930's Germany and the various democracies scattering litters of autocracies since that if learned that would have protected America from one as obvious as Donald Trump, he went on fooling the people from an old playbook he neither wrote not read but some people read him the lines and he memorized what could divide and conquer our country. All of us but for the true racist goons are the losers. If this chilling and thoroughly fact checked documentary teaches us anything it will be in spite of those members of the Republican Party who knew and still do just how low Trump can take Americans but cowardice or too drunk on power themselves stop them from serving to save a nation. Why have so many fled the Republican Party? Because it's clearly anti democracy and anti American as a result. Had Trump stayed a Democrat, he knew he hadn't a chance in hell of gaining the destructive power he craved so he switched to a party where pretend patriots and amoral moralizers wouldn't stop him even if it meant the people would pay. There's nothing original or maverick or spontaneous about Donald Trump. For all the reasons like that some use as reasoning in following him, he's none of it and none of them or their lives matter or ever will to the wreck of a human being who tried to destroy America. And he has no intention nor the integrity to stop. Ever. Until facts find the courage in those folks to see through his 'fake news' campaign of self preservation and they regain some dignity for a higher cause ... call it truly loving America.",False
22,6,"One important point, though",nakrugt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, the ""kids in cages"" policy was in fact from Obama administration, therefore, factually wrong. The implementation of that policy is something else, of course.
The rest is nothing new.",False
23,1,propaganda,maltastarz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Exactly what you expect. I wish someone would convince me with better information. Good luck finding anyone able to explain pass a negative adjective. And this movie does just that, a pool of adjectives. As one adjective supports the other and they continue down the line. See! He is accused of similar crimes so he must be guilty. I really wish someone somewhere would have something more to offer that over editing videos. It's like the people using fuzzy pictures of UFO's as evidence. I'm not convince Trump is a bad guy. How do people but a shorter review? I have 32 more characters to write, movie not worth it.",False
24,10,Accurate on all fronts,gekejo1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yup, it's all simply the truth and is important to understand the points being made. TRump supporters won't care and will bash this because they're too far gone and also tend to lack critical thinking skills. This is a must watch.",False
25,10,Worth watching,redcard-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of us know what's happening, but it's good to have multiple experts confirm and articulate the situation,
Unfortunately, 30% would prefer to ignore the science because Karen always knows better",False

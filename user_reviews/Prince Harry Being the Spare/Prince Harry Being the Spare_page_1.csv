1,1,There comes a time when being a Man requires you to admit your mistakes,HardLight,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerAs a British person who grew up around the same time as this man, I wish I could say that I have a level of empathy for him or sympathy for him as that would mean there were parts of his life that were truly horrific and deserving of the support he so craves now.Unfortunately for Henry Charles Albert David Windsor, the reality of his life played out for me as I - as a British person who grew up in the same time period as him - know the life he led and there's little in it that is a tragedy for himself. From speaking to the press about issues that should be something kept in-family to his incredibly bad behaviour that would have led to a severe beating to any boy his age that wasn't raised to be the Second in line to the Throne of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Harry's life has been one of the upmost nauseating levels of disconnection from reality as it is, due in part to how his Mother treated him and how those around him made excuses for what can be generously called LOUTISH behaviour that would have gotten me and any other young man our age a foot inserted down our throats for doing a 1/3rd of what he did as a young man.After this he had a service mans career that accelerated his job to astronomical proportions and was a launching platform from which he was re-branded from th lager lout to a respectable young man.And then he married a divorcee American socialite who was/is a Hollywood actress.Just as an aside, Harry's great Grand-Uncle was stripped of his titles as King for doing this and sent to live outside of the UK due to the shame of it.Harry's life as presented here in brief is a snapshot of the truth, of a life in the limelight where everything he did, everything he said, everything he was part of was scrutinised by the ever salacious British Tabloid Media.But he had the single best education, learning from private tutors and going to Eton College, one of the most premier establishments of education on the planet who have literal Tzars and Emirs taught there throughout history.He then had the life as a serviceman working for the military where he was promoted to the rank of Captain before turning 40 while seeing very little active combat, being shielded by his platoon and remaining within the barracks at most times.And with all due respect to his feelings that have only surfaced since an issue about where a certain person wanted to live arose and a matriarch explained clearly how that was inappropriate and to do your duty, he has never been nor ever will be a 'spare' that he so claims in this and his book.He was second in line for the Throne of Great Britain, second in line to be King of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Born due to the love...as it is explained is the correct idea and term to use as all accept the truth of the reality that is shown...of his parents Charles the 3rd King of England and Diana Spenser.This man is not to be pitied, not to be coddled, not to be treated as a victim.At best he is an embarrassment to the country he is supposed to be a representative of and has been most of his life
At worst he is another example of the shattered psyche of the male symbol the West has cultivated, controlled by the person around him who treats him as a tool to further that persons public exposure and image, which is ALSO an embarrassment to his country.Nothing good has come of these things made other than to expose the child-like thoughts behind the person who is trying to gain sympathy by saying 'I have an older brother and its not fair'.",True
2,1,The first time you have a problem,DonkeyKongOfficial,n/a,15/08/2025,The first one was the best I ever had in a while but it didn't really matter that I didn't want it anymore because it wasn't going to like that one time and then the next thing that came up I just had a really bad headache I think it's from my allergies so it's not that great and then it just got better worse so now I'm having to take the other two pills that are not good and I just got the worst of the second ones so I'm just a bit tired but I'm just tired so I'm just laying in the chair now I guess I'm going back in my room so I'm going back and then I will go back in the bed so I'm just a bit better now.,False
3,1,Enough!,colletteojeda,n/a,15/08/2025,"All I really have to say is, ENOUGH. We're really here again listening to a PRINCE whine about his privileged royal life and the fact that he's the 2nd son to the King of England??? Harry, you are absolutely ridiculous. Wake up. Grow up. And do yourself a favor...divorce that wretched woman you married who had literally ruined your entire life. Then and only then will you be a decent person again. Stop complaining about your life and realize what others have gone through and are STILL going through in this economy! But at least they all have amazing families by their side! Be a man. Shut up and move on!",False
4,1,Spoilt brat never stops complaining,robdrummond,n/a,15/08/2025,"How this spoilt brat can ""exit"" the family that brought him up in luxury and splendour - being flown around everywhere and anywhere as a child and then decide to trash his own family is beyond beliefTo moan that his brother got 3 sausages and he only got 2 is so pathetic never mind the fact he actually remembered it and put it on the book. Not even thinking about millions of kids who never had sausages at all - starving whilst he is literally living like a king.The private details of both his and his brothers private parts should never has been in this book (or spoken about at all).He and his wife don't want to be part of the Worlds most famous family - and yet they want to keep their titles and privileges! He is constantly suing the UL for private security paid by the tax payer - no mate! You have to work for that tax payer subsidy and you don't want toYour children should also not have any titles. Neither they nor you are Royal - your choice.Now go away and leave us all alone. We don't care about you any more.You made your bed now go and lye on it - as far away as possible.",False

1,6,Made specifically for the fans of Ranveer!,SoumikBanerjee1996,n/a,16/08/2025,"For those viewers, who are accustomed to such survival TV dramas; this would provide nothing fresh, nothing substantive to them. It is fabricated and staged (as most of us know), the stunts they do (like the tyrolean) are looked after by survival specialists, and the whole location is constantly being monitored by safety personnel; therefore, there's no real danger involved. Yes, the animals they work with could be erratic, but they are all under trained supervision.The only thing to take away is the inclusion of Ranveer Singh in such a fascinating scenario. He has this renowned temperament, so it's obvious, that a vast majority of the audience will tune in just to see how he's holding up in such challenging situations. And I believe, in that specific respect, not many would be unhappy. Oh! Yes, one more thing, I almost forgot the 'Interactive' aspect; well, those who are new to this format, would find it rather amusing I reckon.",False
2,n/a,Quick question?,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,Why can't Ranveer just take a helicopter to the so called 'indestructible ramoda' flower when KK can fly in and fly out at per his will? Looks too staged to be real TBH!,False
3,10,Ranveer tried something new,girishreddyt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watch it now as ranveer singh tried something new
Netflix one of very few interactive webseries adventures.Loved watching bear Grylls. His energy and passion towards wild life is very wild.",False
4,1,"Good lord guys, do you think people are as stupid as you?",emmetyak,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was quite interested by the premise, but as soon as I clicked the reviews to find 90% of reviews are from new accounts, and say - ""10/10 Is best program I ever saw in my life Ranveer is best actore please to praise him buy this film now""Do you know how damaging this kind of behaviour is to your company, and the industry as a whole?Disgusting behaviour, you should be ashamed, but you won't be.",False
5,10,Brilliant,ahujadevansh,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show is really very brilliant, very entertained Ranveer Singh . Got to know a lot and this journey has been amazing. I really loved it so much. Ranveer vs wild with bear Grylls dekh kar sach me maza aa gya.",False
6,1,BEYOND TERRIBLE!!!!!!,Grizzlepash,n/a,16/08/2025,"The choices are too inconsequential and too few and far in between. Cringe commentary and humour that drags harder than the dead pig they pulled from the river. Genuinely feel sorry for Bear in this one, it is clearly not HIS show.",False
7,10,Unexpected,aqua-54581,n/a,16/08/2025,Ranveer Singh is really one of the best actors of the Bollywood industry is really an amazing and talented actor and I really like his acting and comic but this time he did really and unexpected think which is so great.,False
8,1,Cringe fest,tabimura,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was generally awful, but the tame bear sniffing their asses scene was utter cr@p. Overacting from the brown gentleman made this cringe fest an absolute disaster. I can't understand why someone would like this kind of ...uhm, acting.Avoid.",False
9,10,good to see,sofikhan-91132,n/a,16/08/2025,I have heard a lot about him and I will definitely watch sometime both of them are my favorite and I would love to see them. Friends must see you too....,False
10,4,A lot boring than expected,mudumalathomson,n/a,16/08/2025,It's not that entertaining..neither is the adventure. Too much chat and gossip and less focus on the actual journey. Deepika is like talked about in this episode like a billion times. Not actually necessary.,False
11,10,Nice,vishu-49856,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerQuick facts about Bollywood...all these so called actors are druggies and criminals at best. What they can never do is act. This brown guy's wife was caught in a major drug scandal. The guy himself has had several affairs and is anything but faithful. Their movies are given a hard pass by a majority of the population in India. That being said, they rely on the global liberal ecosystem to prop up their sagging careers with shows like this. You could almost see Gryllis hoping for a real bear to eat him than to keep up with this idiot. Don't go by some of 10/10 ratings. They are put in place by their PR team.",True
12,1,Disappointed. Fake Show,avinesp,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show was entirely fake and scripted accept climbing scenes. The bear (animal) looked a pet one they used for the script or else how a cameraman managed to shoot in front of wild bear and with different angles. This show wasn't at the bear grylls format also not like shows with previous celebrities. It was more like bollywood masala, what can be expected from bollywood creative crew involved for this show.",False

14,1,Fully Faltu,revancorp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Couldn't watch the trailer for more than 2 seconds. First thing that hits u is overacting. Not sure how this guy has made it so far in Bollywood. Yes, some good movies but when he opens his mouth he is intolerable torture.",False
15,10,Amazing and thrilling stuffs,roma-40760,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an amazing episode thius was with Ranveer & Bear both nailkinmg it in style in the serbian waters , Thanks to netflix for providing supreme entertainment.",False
16,1,Ranveer's presence took out all the thrills,gajjosh,n/a,16/08/2025,This show is generally quite good. Realistic with thrills of a adventure but this one looked obviously scripted. Ranveer continued his overacting and over the top show off in a show like this as well.,False
17,10,Too Wild and Adventurous,Harry6386,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show was quite adventurous with Ranveer's comic which was cherry on top of the cake. Need more of it. Bear Grylls never fails to amaze us. Must watch it guys,",False
18,1,Overly dramatized,sulaimanlalani,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unnecessarily and overly dramatized. There was no feeling of any adrenaline rush. Nothing close to Man v Wild!Ranveer acted well but the issue was in script and the adventures itself!Also there are directional errors, for example, you can see where the flower is even before the journey starts.",False
19,10,Top notch stuff..,deyakku,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a lovely episode we all witnessed , Ranveer was totally amazing . The adventures and the waters are really mesmirizing. Kudos to netflix for this amazing stuff..",False
20,1,Disgusting!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!,nischalgprasad,n/a,16/08/2025,I am sure Bear Grylls would've seriously given it a thought about letting Ranveer fall off a cliff while shooting this episode. The over acting filled with Bollywood style cheap thrills and jokes was disgusting to watch. The worst part is this guy getting portrayed as the model lover which can't be farther from the truth. Terrible waste of time.,False
21,10,Nice üëç,kj-69551,n/a,16/08/2025,"Both are tremendous Ranveer , He and Bear Grylls indeed made it worth watching, Such an amazing stuff for the Indian Audiences..... outstanding performance üôÇüëç",False
22,5,Only for ranveer fans,nyatishubham,n/a,16/08/2025,"Non stop overacting from ranveer, unnecessary chats and unlaughable punches. Less of adventure and more of creating tense atmosphere.. watch it only if you are true ranveer fans.",False
23,10,Best Ever,hariprasadreddy-96375,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ranveer Vs Wild with bear Grylls one of the most adventurous one I have seen in recent days.His energy is always too high that makes me go crazy about him
This documentary is the best one so far I have seen.",False
24,1,Waste of time,doctorscalling,n/a,16/08/2025,Its over dramatised. Its because of people like this actor and the cheap drama that indian cinema has no respect world wide. Bear grills need to censor the episode himself before he gets the blame of making a boring episode.,False

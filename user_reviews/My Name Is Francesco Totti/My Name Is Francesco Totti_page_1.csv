1,10,Wonderful and Moving,alessandra-thiele,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredible well made documentary I really enjoyed watching. You don't have to understand or care about football to enjoy this film. It's an incredible portrait of a very unique human being, Francesco Totti, who also happens to be one of the greatest Italian football players of all times and the former captain of AS Roma.I laughed and cried and was completely captivated. I'm pretty sure it cannot be easy to write and direct a documentary about a football player that will nevertheless move and fascinatan audience who is not necessarily interested in the game. In this case the goal was masterfully achieved. I highly recommend watching this film. It will touch your soul.",False

Thanks to his talent, but also to his dreams.",False

5,1,Too drama,filippovernava,n/a,16/08/2025,"Il film è pieno di falsi storici....
Poi trovo imbarazzante le battute per fare un tocco di realismo, non è un documentario, è un monologo di Totti",False

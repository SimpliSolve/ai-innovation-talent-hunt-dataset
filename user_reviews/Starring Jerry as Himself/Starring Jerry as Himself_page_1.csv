1,10,Powerful piece of cinéma vérité,lighthousekeeeper,n/a,16/08/2025,"Starring Jerry as Himself is a powerful and thought-provoking documentary that captivates the audience from start to finish. Director Law Chen and co-writer Jerry have created a unique hybrid format that seamlessly blends reality with fiction to tell a compelling and emotional story.At the heart of the film is Jerry himself, an elderly Chinese immigrant who is unwittingly caught up in a criminal investigation. Through his own determination and the support of his family, he becomes an unlikely undercover agent for the Chinese police, risking everything to clear his name and protect his loved ones. The viewer is taken on a rollercoaster ride as Jerry's investigation takes him on unexpected twists and turns, with tension and emotion building until the powerful climax.What sets Starring Jerry as Himself apart from other documentaries is its use of the hybrid format. The decision to have Jerry and his family star as themselves adds a layer of authenticity and emotional depth that is rare in the genre. The actors who play the police and other characters are seamlessly integrated into the story, making it feel more like a cinematic experience than a traditional documentary.The film also raises important questions about the nature of truth and memory. What is a true story? Can we trust our own memories? These questions are woven into the narrative in a way that is both thought-provoking and respectful of Jerry's experience.Overall, Starring Jerry as Himself is a must-watch film that will leave a lasting impression on its audience. It's a powerful testament to the strength of the human spirit and the importance of family, and a shining example of the potential of the documentary genre.",False
2,10,Best film I have seen this year,SaunderC,n/a,16/08/2025,"You figure out what is happening pretty quickly, but that's not the point.This combination documentary with spy flick is funny, depressing, charming, hopeless, and intriguing all at once. And that is all without knowing the story behind it (look it up).You also get the classic immigrant family story, with first and second generation Americans, as it addresses many middle-aged people's concerns about their aging parents.If you are looking for a film that challenges your viewpoint on the world, takes and brings hope, and entertains you simultaneously. This is the film for you.PS - Check on your parents.",False
3,10,One of the most moving films I've ever seen,KevinC99,n/a,16/08/2025,"Saw this at IFC, you think you know what's happening and then it becomes something else entirely. It's part doc, part spy film, but at the end of the day such a moving portrait of an immigrant family.This is a true story in the most interesting sense, with the subject playing himself in creative recreations. I've never seen anything like it, and apparently neither had the audience at the theater, it was full of laughter, and tears, and genuine surprise at both the expected and unexpected things things that were unfolding.It's powerful, it's sad, it's funny, but most importantly full of heart. If you want something that is truly unique and changes your perspective go watch this. (I think it's on streaming now.)",False
4,5,An Experiment Gone Sideways,brentsbulletinboard,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm all one for experimental cinema, but, in the end, the experiment has to work. Unfortunately, however, that's where this debut feature from writer-director Law Chen (primarily the creator of film shorts and music videos) sorely misses the mark. Based on a true story whose very soundness is somewhat called into question (as demonstrably observed in the picture's opening credits), this ""fictionalized documentary"" about retiree Jerry Liu (portrayed here by his real-life counterpart, amateur actor-writer Jerry Hsu) tells the story of how this hard-working but naïve Chinese immigrant living in Orlando was scammed out of his life savings by conmen posing as police officers from Shanghai investigating a supposed international money laundering scheme. The twist here, though, is how this regrettable incident unexpectedly led Jerry to fulfill his long-held dream of becoming a screenwriter/filmmaker, an aspiration he tinkered with as an amateur in his younger days with his wife and three sons (who appear as themselves in this production). Hsu contends that he wanted to make this movie as a cautionary tale to warn other seniors how to protect themselves against scams like the one he fell for, primarily as a result of holding on too firmly to a belief in being overly trusting of others. It's also something of an homage to the concept of it never being too late in life to start over, particularly when it comes to living out and fulfilling a personal dream. Yet, while both of those intentions are certainly laudable, their execution here leaves much to be desired with its awkward mix of documentarian-style filmmaking and odd attempts at fictionalization (at times verging on the surreal and even hinting at the emerging cognizance issues that Jerry was experiencing at the time of this incident). The result is a picture that doesn't feel fully fleshed out (or thought out), a weird cross between home movies and an experimental arthouse project that ultimately comes across more like a film school assignment. It's also difficult to determine how seriously the film takes itself, with an undercurrent of humor that doesn't always feel appropriate given the troubling circumstances involved in this story. In the end, it's not entirely clear what ""Starring Jerry as Himself"" was attempting to achieve, but the finished product definitely doesn't feel like it attained its goal.",False

1,10,"WOW, First to do so",dcarroll74,n/a,16/08/2025,"It took a bit of time to get into this documentry however, it was worth it.Everyone thinks of the word ""stuntman"", very few think of the word ""stuntwoman"". Remember the movie The Last Stuntman from 1980?An eye opener to what these women did, to make the popular films and TV shows what they became yet, hardly got recognition. Bloody disgraceful.Thankfully, this documentary is a step in the right direction. Thank you ladies, for doing what you've done.",False

1,8,"pork, chicken, and beef come alive",ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greetings again from the darkness. We open on a pig in prone position with her head sticking through an opening in the barn. It takes a minute to realize the sow isn't sleeping, but rather giving birth. Slowly the newborn piglets begin tumbling out into the world. Cutting to a reverse camera angle, we see the 12-13 babies desperately trying to latch onto mom for their first meal. The runt of the litter struggles more than the others. Award-winning filmmaker Viktor Kosakovskiy runs this first segment just over 19 minutes. There is no dialogue. No human on screen. The soundtrack is all natural from nature: the snorts from mama sow, the squeals from piglets, and unseen birds chirping.Our second segment finds roosters in a crate. Clearly new to the surroundings, and likely never-before ""free"" to roam the land, these chickens cautiously explore as the camera focuses on their tentative initial steps from the cage and startled reactions to birds. A one-legged rooster captures our attention as it makes its way through the grass and over fallen logs. It's likely the longest amount of time a movie camera has been dedicated to following roosters around.We then head back to find the piglets have grown substantially. We don't know how much time has passed, but we watch along with their mother as the youngsters play in the field, fight with each other, and bully their youngest sibling. Gunda, the mother sow, watches over them just as any mother would watch over her kids. Our third group is introduced as the barn door opens and the cows are released. They romp into the fields like school kids at recess. Some of the cows stare directly into the camera as if to inform us they are ready for their close-up. It's fascinating to see how they use teamwork for an ingenious head-to-tail solution to the annoying flies that relentlessly pester them.The final segment returns us to the pigs as they display the same feeding frenzy as one might witness at the buffet on a Carnival cruise. An ending that will surely evoke emotions in viewers, though maybe not at the extreme of Gunda herself. Filmmaker Kosakovskiy leaves us wondering how a black and white film with no dialogue or human characters makes such an impression as it focuses on farm animals. Pork, chicken, and beef. Clearly it's no coincidence that he chose three staples of the American diet. There is no lecture on animal rights, and none of the brutality of other ""raised for food"" documentaries is shown. But the message is there. It was filmed on farms in Norway, Spain, and the U. K., but the locales matter little. Director Kosakovskiy previously brought us the excellent AQUARELA (2018), a documentary showcasing the nature of water and ice, and here he assisted Egil Haskjold Larsen with cinematography, and Ainara Vera with editing. It's an unusual film, and one meant to inspire reflection and thought ... and hopefully change.In theaters beginning April 16, 2021.",False
2,8,An impressive achievement,csm-78119,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a superb piece of filmmaking that gives the viewer a real insight in to the lives of pigs and cows on higher welfare farms and of free to roam hens. No one who watches this film could doubt the sentience of its subjects or their individuality. The incredibly devoted mother pig at the centre of this film and a one legged hen are exhibits A and B in this regard. Sound is used to particularly good effect, both in the capture of the farm and country noises and in the complete absence of any commentary. The black and white footage adds to the beauty of the piece but I can't help thinking that the complete absence of colour ultimately detracts a little from an otherwise wholly authentic film. The film may not turn you into a vegetarian or a vegan but for me it surely supports an argument that particularly in the rich developed world all animals should be raised to at least ""freedom food"" standards and that its an indictment of modern society that some of the richest countries have the poorest animal welfare standards.",False
3,8,The Natural Life,philipmagnier,n/a,16/08/2025,"A small film, a moving and beautiful film, a film that moves at the pace of farm animals.It is set in another universe that is open to us but that we don't visit.",False
4,7,Thoughtprovoking...,OneSentenceReview,n/a,16/08/2025,"...although more of the story of the chickens and cows life would have balanced it better.Many informative reviews here already, hence I wanted to add some facts I looked up afterwards, also as some here got it wrong, but I won't as I don't like spoilers. You find every question which (hopefully) pops up afterwards by doing a quick search.I'll only leave a good note I liked from AccidentalSmallHolder net ehich addresses something you'll (hopefully) also think about afterwards:""If pig keeping isn't for you, please do the next best thing and source your pork, bacon and sausages from ethically reared pigs. If it doesn't say the pigs are born and reared outdoors, they probably weren't so don't be fooled by misleading labelling. Even pigs that are reared outdoors may have been born to sows kept indoors, in crates, so do be aware of labelling - it's more about what it doesn't say, than what it does.""",False
5,10,A Miracle of a Film,dennis-11345,n/a,16/08/2025,"At first, we can't grasp what we are seeing, and it takes a while to sink in. Throughout the film, both beauty and reality will often rise up to temporarily disorient, take our breath away, and even overwhelm.This is not your cute animal film, though it has that too. It's more akin to those moments of serenity and joy that can arise when we are watching babies move or small children explore. We feel both intimacy and otherness, and perhaps even bewilderment.In my imagination it doesn't seem impossible that this film could be nominated for awards beyond Best Documentary. It would need its own version of Script Writing, Choreography, Directing, Editing, and Producing.But the Cinematography! Obviously it's often spontaneous and even seat-of-the-pants. Somehow there is an endless outpouring of breath-taking photographic moments in high-resolution black and white. Will there be a picture book?It's not that the shots are a miracle of technique; I'm sure they are. It's more how they touch such a wide range of feeling. A world is created and then ...Like the beginning, the ending takes a while to sink in. Hushed. Eye and heart, conscience and consciousness, awakened.",False
6,6,Confusing but necessary,ilpotaanila,n/a,16/08/2025,"Looks like this film sometimes can't decide what it wants itself to be. Overall, it uses a highly poetic language with desaturated picture and ""commercial"" outlook with long dolly shots, wide angles and slow motion. At the same time, it always tends to be on animals' eyes level, depicting some of the unpleasant and cruel aspects of their life. However, it seems that camera is sometimes shy about what it sees, notably putting pig's back out of focus in final scene - which inevitably drives us to a conclusion that it's the human look on the animal, even if there's not a single human in frame. Surprisingly, the most coherent and touching part of three isolated novels is the one about chicken - particularly because of non-intrusive and highly tactile camera work.Gunda stays somewhere between brutal realism of life and romantic pamphlet against cruelty to animals, mixing together two incompatible aesthetic approaches. However, a film like this had to be made, and I hope it will influence other filmmakers to experiment with storytelling from an animal point of view.",False
7,8,Gentle and beautiful,gbill-74877,n/a,16/08/2025,"For a subject not often given an artistic treatment, barnyard animals, Gunda is exquisitely shot. In a loving way, it shows that pigs, cows, and chickens have emotions, that they enjoy being alive, and that they have dignity. I loved it for that, and if just looking at animals go about their lives on a farm is appealing to you, this is probably your film, but otherwise, you might find its 93 minutes passing rather slowly.There is clearly an underlying message here, but I loved how restrained the film was in getting this across. It was filmed at humane farms and sanctuaries, without narration of any kind, and that includes holding back from the customary text at the end of documentaries which fill us in on various facts and details. The viewer is left to connect the dots from the images on the screen to what was on their dinner plate most recently, or the neat cuts of packaged meat in the grocery, seen as commodities instead of living creatures. The scene where the mother pig frantically searches for her babies towards the end is distressing, but a far more damning portrayal of the cruelty of the meat industry would have been at a factory farm, and/or a slaughterhouse. In other words, this is just the tip of an enormous, immoral iceberg - and yet if taking babies away from a mother doesn't hit you in the gut, I'm not sure what will.",False
8,7,Have You Seen the Little Piggies?,jadepietro,n/a,16/08/2025,"IN BRIEF: A well-made but slow moving pig's tale.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) A pig and her litter, a one-legged chicken, and some cows are the main cast in this fine documentary, Gunda, Viktor Kosakovskiy's understated cinematic plea for animal rights.Gunda is an enormous sow that has just given birth to a dozen small piglets. This is their story of life down on the farm. Call me a city boy, but the film depicts the daily mundane weeks in this pig's heaven (or hell) and I have chosen the right lifestyle for me. Still, it is a fascinating place to visit.There are no voiceovers, no sweeping musical score, no Disney sentimentalizing... just straight-forward filming of natural country events. There are many grunts, squeals, and moos to be heard and lots of mud and flies buzzing around too.This is a well-made documentary that tries to convey an animal's everyday existence. The wonderful sound design by Alexander Dudarev immerses the moviegoer into this rarely-seen animal kingdom. The masterful b&w photography by Egil Håskjold Larsen and the director is stunning with its low-level point of view and detailed close-ups of farm critters.However, the story seems non-existent and Mr. Kosakovskiy lets scenes go on for far too long, at a turtle's pace, although none of those creatures are in sight. The documentary does eventually build to its subtle message about the cruelty of our food chain, but any astute moviegoer knows the fate of our little dirty dozen from the start. (A side note: All of our violent deeds are strongly implied, but mercifully not shown.) I could say there is much food for thought in this documentary, but then I would be called insensitive or callous. Let's just say, this film deserves your attention. (GRADE: B-)",False
9,8,RUNT,js-66130,n/a,16/08/2025,"A stunning black and white silent (save the grunting) documentary that soft focuses on the life of a pig. Seems innocuous enough, but there is magic here. Shot at ground level, and sparing nothing from farm life, ""Gunda"" is not here to shock, or illicit clown tears, but to have a look, like a wide-eyed child might back in the day when summers were not filled with organized sports camps or school continuation. It captures that slow, languid, breezy feel of beautiful boredom.Opening with the birth of a litter, it follows the towering mother sow as she clumsily deals with the runt of her offspring. It is astonishing, inviting, and then shockingly cruel. What is happening is not exactly clear, and there is no deep voice over to mansplain nature. That is the beauty of this film: it evolves along with the undetermined storyline.A slow, dreamy bit of cinema, ""Gunda"" works well in transporting the audience to a world most are familiar with but few actually know or have experienced hands on. The sharp monochrome delivery turns a pigsty into a pleasant aesthetic. The absence of smell helps. Nothing revelatory here, and since this is a farm, well, let's just say that the animals are not in charge, and there is a sudden dramatic turn to remind everyone about life's cold harsh realities.""Gunda"" is an animal film that is really not an animal film. It is a brilliant exercise in moment capture, shot with an addictive lens, documenting some life lessons, without preaching or dwelling on anything in particular. Pigs in showbiz are usually funny, smart or exotic. Not here. ""Gunda"" is a mother, and that is that.hipCRANK.",False
10,7,There are no words to fully describe animal sentience,marcokaraki,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGunda does not humanize the animal's emotions, but simply shows them. And there is value in this, because there is nothing to argue about. Simply an unfiltered window into these animals lives, and you come to your own conclusions, rather than be told what you are looking at. And the film even manages to communicate some of the mundane elements of farm life while still capturing your attention.There is also a lot of creativity with the camera angles to keep it visually interesting, but still serious with the black and white, which helps you to focus on the actions, rather than the scenery.Some things I personally took away from this film:At the start of the film, you get a look at how easily the mother pigs will often hurt or cause serious injury and suffocation to some of their newborn piglets without even realizing it.Seeing the chickens hesitate to leave the cage, I realized that chickens are naturally afraid of the predators natural outside their shelter, and even the predators in the sky, so they naturally have an increased alertness/stress outside. If you look closely at the chickens outside, you can see how they stress over any little noise they hear in the distance.I found it sad when the piglets were playing with each other, and the mom, and even one of the piglets tried to comfort the one that had an injured leg, who couldn't play.Something that I never knew before was that cows will mutually scratch each others faces with their tails, and ask each other to wag tails by picking up their friend's tail with their horn.In the end, you see Gunda struggling as she looks for her babies, calling for them, pacing around quickly. You can simply see the distress. No narration needed, and narration would only lessen the impact of what you are seeing anyways.I only wish that they could have included a bit more happy/playful footage to contrast with the darkness in the majority of their lives, and break a little bit more from the mundane/repetitive parts of the footage, to create a more entertaining film that will keep the attention of non-vegans.My guess as to the entertainment and captivation value for a non-vegan is 5/10.As a vegan, my own enjoyment was a 6/10, but I rate this film 7.5/10 because of the unique way of communicating these animal's sentience that I think can be more attractive for some people over the other vegan films out there.",True
11,8,"""Gunda"" written by Gregory Mann",gregorymannpress-74762,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Gunda""Experiential cinema in it's purest form, ""Gunda"" chronicles the unfiltered lives of a mother pig, a flock of chickens, and a herd of cows with masterful intimacy. Using stark, transcendent black and white cinematography and the farm's ambient soundtrack, the film invites the audience to slow down and experience life as his subjects do, taking in their world with a magical patience and an other worldly perspective. ""Gunda"" asks us to meditate on the mystery of animal consciousness, and reckon with the role humanity plays in it.
In the film's opening sequence, the titular sow gives birth to a litter of squealing piglets, and over the next several segments, the film follows Gunda and her offspring as they begin to explore the world around them. Yet one is keenly aware that Gunda and her offspring are part of a man-made system of supply, and human intervention looms, unseen and mostly unheard, over the film like a specter. Gunda is the protagonist of this gentle black-and-white documentary triptych. She takes care of her little ones, accompanies them on a journey of discovery and then takes a break to recharge her batteries. She tentatively approaches the camera. Gunda is on the screen for over half of the runtime of the final film and is an extraordinarily powerful character; you do not need an interpreter to understand her emotions and experiences. Does she know what her fate is? What might she be thinking? What does she think of us? Gunda is one of several hundred million pigs that inhabit the planet, alongside a billion cattle, represented in the film by two gracefully mooing cows, and over 20 billion chickens, exemplified here by a one-legged chicken stumbling its way through the world. Whether rooting through the mud, swatting away flies or searching for worms, they all are heroes.
A mother sow, two ingenious cows, and a scene-stealing, one-legged chicken, remind us of the inherent value of life for all beings. By returning a pig's gaze, listening to a cow's gentle lowing, or observing a chicken find it's wings, ""Gunda"" voids any pretension that we're unique in our capacity for emotion, consciousness or will. Immersed in these animal's lives, lived to the full in joy and pain, it becomes inescapable that humankind must swiftly undertake the major changes necessary to end mass exploitation of our fellow creatures. Our indignation about the ignorance of humans in general and the degradation of these creatures in particular flows into his conceptually minimalist, but visually brilliant meditation. An intervention in the form of a modest gesture. A film that ascribes majestic greatness to the underdogs. And makes us think. In the very least, the vastness of the living world, we share our planet with billions of farm animals. However, in industrialized societies we're conditioned to ignore the sentience of these animals, often regarded as a passive resource. Audiences accustomed to the cuddly, anthropomorphic barnyard animals in films like ""Babe"" and ""Charlotte's Web"" may be startled to see pigs in a fresh light. The up-close, fine-grained detail of the film's black and white images proves these creatures to be as complex and fascinating as their wild counterparts. The documentary forces us to reconsider our relationship to the humble yet majestic creatures that we think of as food.
For a few hundred years, it's important to establish respect for the value of human life. It took centuries to even acknowledge that all human beings deserve the same rights. Perhaps now we can take the next step and admit that every living creature has similar rights. Pigs, butterflies, elephants , all of them have the same rights to live on this planet. We shouldn't always put ourselves in the center. We can do better than that. We're not totally awful. We did eventually come to the conclusion that slavery was unjust, we've started to respect the rights of women, of people of different genders, and to me that's a sign that we're increasing our understanding of the world. The film focuses on the conflict between human activity and it's environment. There absolutely is a common thread. Historically there's an overall acceptance by humanity that we've dominion over non-humans, that their lives are inherently less valuable than ours. History is written by the victors. We won the history of the earth for now, but who knows what happens next.
The idea is very simple; we as humans are ready to change our attitudes to our fellow beings. That might be a very optimistic perspective, but at least there are some hints as to why it might be possible. Our entire treatment of animals is based on misconception. In some countries there are laws statin outright that animals don't suffer, it's written into the very fabric of the law. This is absurd. Everyone who's in regular contact with animals knows that they feel, they've emotions, they're conscious. We know this is the truth but have tacitly agreed to disregard our empirical knowledge. Instead we deny them their natural lives. If people believe that humans have souls, they should agree that animals have souls too.
Documentary cinema is a great tool to show the realities of the world, to show things that we do not see by ourselves, that we do not want to see, or that we've collectively agreed that we do not see, and so we allow ourselves not to think about. ""Gunda"" is a mesmerizing perspective on sentience within animal species, normally, and perhaps purposely, hidden from our view. Displays of pride and reverence, amusement and bliss at a pig's inquisitive young; her panic, despair and utter defeat in the face of cruel trickery, are validations of just how similarly all species react and cope with events in our respective lives. The film crafts a visceral meditation on existence that transcends the normal barriers that separate species. It's a deeply attempt to renew our vision of life and meditate on the mystery of all animal consciousness, including our own. ""Gunda"" is a film without patronizing or humanizing them, without any sentimentality, and without vegan propaganda. We cannot stop people from doing what they do, but perhaps we can at least make them look more closely at what it's they're denying or destroying. Films cannot change this world, but still we feel we've to do something.written by Gregory Mann",False
12,6,Beautiful Chickenmatography...,tccandler,n/a,16/08/2025,"A gorgeously shot black and white documentary, on a farm, following the daily routines of new-born piglets, a one-legged chicken, and a herd of cows. The film only features the animals and the ambient sounds... no music, no people... simply observation. It is beautiful, and it certainly hints at the changes we should consider when it comes to farming. However, it drags a little and only just gets a positive review.",False
13,4,"Beautiful, but incredibly boring",music-maja,n/a,16/08/2025,"I loved the film at first. It has a distinct aesthetic with an impressive cinematography, and a nice calm. The piglets with their mother is charming to watch. But after ten minutes I felt that I had seen enough.It tries to give us a feeling of what it is like to be a pig, but although I like the concept, I never really feel that I become anything else than an observer. And it feels extremely slow and repetitive.Despite the interesting concept I felt bored for 90 minutes. I think a lot of people would enjoy it, if they're more patient than I am, but I just stopped paying attention for most of the movie.",False
14,8,Beauty is perishable,Horst_In_Translation,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""Gunda"" is a relatively new film, even if it premiered already back in 2020 actually in my city here in Berlin, but took until August/September 2021 now for a wide release, but I am glad it got it because it is not really a creative movie, but also an important one. Let's start with the basics: This is a co-production between Norway, the United Kingdom and United States and I feel that this will be seen by more people here in Europe than over there in America. It is really a mix of many countries because the director is Viktor Kosakovskiy, who was born in the Soviet Union back in the day and just turned 60 actually. A really experienced filmmaker who started working in the industry back in the early 1990s already and maybe with this movie he gave himself the biggest present as this could very well become his most known work. Despite the simplicity that surrounds it, but I will get to that later on. His co-writer and also editor here is Ainara Vera, more multicultural aspects, and it is not the first time the two have worked together on a film. If you have no heard from these two so far, don't worry. One you surely have heard of is executiive producer Joaquin Phoenix and his name also makes it a bit obvious which direction this film is heading. I also found it interesting that Danny Glover was mentioned in the credits and received a special thanks inclusion. This one runs for slightly over 1.5 hours and it is in black-and-white from beginning to end. I like this creative choice, but I am not unbiased because I am generally a bit of a sucker for black-and-white projects. It made sense though. We don't need to see the beautiful color of the chickens for example to appreciate the greatness of nature. There are more than enough other reasons to do so. They really kept it basic and essential overall. There is also no narration, which is really not a given for documentary movies. But hearing the noises from these animals is even more at the center of it all this way, most of all the happy squealing, but also other noises I will talk about a little later. You don't need to find out how long it takes for piglets until they stop drinking their mother's milk. It's not really a film to learn something. It's about appreciating the beauty of nature. And mourning its loss eventually.Gunda is of course the pig at the center of the story, mother to (if I counted correctly) a massive amount of ten piglets in total. The film starts basically when they are born and really small and we see how they come one-by-one out of the barn (this is shown once again later on, with their mother coming out first that time and they follow her), which is not just super cute, but also brings a certain amount of pleasant anticipation to the viewers as we know there will be more coming out every second. Unfortunately, this is in the end also one of the most depressing things about this movie. In the end, Gunda vanishes back into the barn, into the black, all on her own again, and the exact place where this film started so pleasantly and joyfully is now pretty much only connected to loss. This was a really creative framework that emphasizes the film's message in a way that could not have been done any better. Before I go on with Gunda and her kids, a few words on the other animals: We have of course the chickens here. Imperfection that does not take away from beauty is also a key aspect here. The one we see most of the time has only one leg, but it can still walk, just looks a bit clumsy, and is nonetheless and amazing creation of nature. And then the cows. There I have a little more to say because those were part of two of my favorite moments from this film. The first would be when we see all those cows run out towards the meadow which is so nice to see and a statement as powerful as it can be to support the idea that cows do not belong in tiny stables where they can barely move. They enjoy the sun outside this much, enjoy the fresh air and all the space and room they have. It was a joy to see them running like that. The other scene would be when we see how smart the cows really are. They are constantly annoyed by flies, especially next to their heads, so two cows stand next to each other in a way and position where they can at least to some extent chase away the flies from the other cow's head with the help of their tails. What a really, really smart cooperation that was. I wonder if many other people paid attention to this moment.Now back to Gunda and her kids. I mean I always thought piglets were really cute, so no surprise for me here from this perspective. It is impossible though to not care for those piglets in all these situations and it's really heartwarming to see that they all survived apparently (initially) and grew bigger than. I felt a bit sorry for Gunda though in the later stages that they were still going for her tits with how ""heavy"" they already were at this point. The ""(initially)"" referes to the ending and reminds us that destruction by humans (we don#t see people in here, but their vehicle stands metaphorically for destruction) is inevitable when it comes no nature and beauty associated with nature. The piglets are driven away and Gunda is there all on her own and maybe some think this sequence was to long, this very final sequence, but I think it had to be this long because it really showed us how animals can be in pain, how they suffer, not physically, but mentally if you want to call it like that. Imagine a mother who has ten kids and they are all taken away to be killed. To be eaten. What a horror scenario. Well, that is what happens here and it is heartbreaking to see Gunda suffer from her loss with how she has no idea what is going on after all the love and dedication and taps and milk she gave them. Everybody in the audience can feel her pain and I was tempted to say ""even if she is only an animal"", but the better wording would be ""because she is an animal"". This is also where it feels fitting that Phoenix, with his environmental background, is a part of this film. Maybe you have heard of his movie ""Earthlings"", a completely different approach to livestock farming, but the message is actually somehow the same in the very end. I thought that here it was especially heartbreaking when we saw Gunda look right into the camera. And her sounds as well. The ending was really sobering anyway because it takes us ruthlessly back to reality where sadly those piglets cannot stay with their mom for the rest of their lives. Or her life. But I still have a bit of hope that it was just reenacted somehow because this seemed to be a place where they cared about the animals and treated them nicely, but not sure if this nicely for a porky family reunion.In any case, it is these beautiful images that are a key reason to watch this film. The innocence coming with them in a world that does not require humans whatsoever, but also the drastic and inevitable loss of said innocence. This is pretty much all then. I don't really want to tell you what to take from this movie or similar movies. It's up to everybody on their own if they want to become a vegetarian (which is what I am), a vegan, or stay a carnivore and maybe just think a little more about what they buy and from whom. If everybody thinks a bit more about their nutrition (and consequently not only about the animals, but about one's own health), it is an important step forward. I am sure this film contributed a lot to that and as of now, this is my favorite film from 2020, even if there is still really a lot to see. But I am still optimistic that it will stay in my top5, probably even top3, maybe even number one. The images were just beautiful and the message could not have been any more memorable despite the simplicity surrounding this project. Some real talent involved here. Big thumbs-up to everybody who was involved with this project and I truly hope it will be seen a lot in the future, no matter if at the movie theater or at home when it airs on television. It surely will, unless shady lobbyists get in the way. Anyway, what I actually want to say is that you should not miss out here. Highly recommended.",True

16,10,A rare pearl of human emotions,maximusynin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was long waiting to see this movie: the black and white charm of the trailer, together with sounds of grunting, squeaking and clucking, familiar to anybody, made a refreshing impression of something different from what is usually shown in the wide release. The movie had no words or moralising, yet, when it ends one can hardly hold the tears. The plot is simple, telling a story of a sow with a litter of piglets and a few hens and cows living at a free-range farm. The camera catches their different emotions, daily joys and tragedies, which one can no longer observe once these animals reach the meat section in a grocery store. In that sense, the movie tells a story of deprived and miserable, farm animals who have no names, no voice and no right to exist in our consciousness. Their emotions are surprisingly human: curiosity of the piglets, tiredness of their mother, the will to life of the one-legged chicken, compassion of calves towards each other in defending from flies, the heartbreaking despair of the sow. The inherent unfairness of their lives vis-à-vis the lives of humans leaves a bitter feeling and a lump in the throat. It is a rare movie, which requires immersion in the dark atmosphere of a cinema, but rewards with empathy towards other beings and a warm feeling of unity with them.",False

Ditto, if you care about animal life and welfare. The film is beautifully shot in a way that makes it hard to look away from even the slowest of slow scenes. It is funny, we laughed out loud throughout, despite there being no jokes or intents at humor by those on the screen. But be prepared to feel devastated, too. The depth of experience hidden in the simplicity of animal life is astounding and the director Viktor Kossakovsky, together with his team of Norwegian producers, have done us a great service in putting it to film.",False
21,8,Story of a single pig mom,thomasrtygesen,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a simple portrait of the life of some pigs. No voice-over, no colours, no fancy stuff. Just pigs. Well, some cows also. And a one-legged bird, but nothing fancy.Gunda is a pig, who raises 12-13 piglets on her own. Daddy seems to be out of the picture. Piglets are some hungry and needy little things, it seems. So she kills one of them. But it does seems to be a fragile little swine, so I guess it's all right - I honestly don't know the piggy-procedures. One of the other piglets has a limb. She pushes it around a bit. Does she kill it? Real suspense right there.Well, I did fall asleep just shortly during this movie - it is kinda slow. But when I woke up, the piglets were kinda big, and suddenly some kind of tractor comes and kidnaps all the piglets. Gunda is left alone, stressed out with her big tits hanging out and all. Yeah, it's brutal.I'm not a vegetarian. But this movie made me think about pigs having emotions and stuff like that. Maybe I'll think about that next time I buy pork. Hell, maybe I won't even buy the pork because of this film.",True
22,9,Solace - moments of,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you see animals just as food, not worthy your time or empathy, you might as well skip the movie. Also there is no narration or any other form of description that will guide you through the movie. But it also is not necessary. There are movies who could have done with someone talking, telling us things. I have even critisized one ""movie"" that was only showing us houses (from an architect) - because I mean we could as well have just seen those houses in a book. We didn't need a film without narration for that - we have a completely different case (and ""beast"") here.Actually it is more than one beast, if you even want to call the Pig in the main poster that. It is also about the offspring(s), chicken and cows. But our main priority and our main focus lies on the pig. And there are so many beautiful moments here. There is so much tranquility and solace and peace ... nature in its purest form one might say. And in black and white. As someone who could watch a bunny for hours just being a bunny, I appreaciate the movie/documentary a lot. No sarcasm or irony or whatever here. I really dug it and my rating is displaying that too. If you are aware of what you are about to watch, you can have that experience too, if you are open to and for it. And to be clear, just because there is no narration and no added music, the movie is not silent. You'll hear a lot of noises. Mostly and mainly from the animals of course.",False
23,n/a,pretentious art house nature doc,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Done far better by any of the many nature series one can see on cable. Slooooow static real time photography in black and white does nothing to enhance the visuals or storytelling, what little there is of it. All leading to sentimental payoff that could have been reached in a half hour. Typical example of NYFF inert anti cinema.",False
24,2,Horrific,brookesthirtyone,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI thought this film would be showing animals in the production line of a farm...that's how it starts off with caged chickens etc. Then I presumed it would show you how well they are living free. But this film doesn't. It shows how beautiful they are if living free and then they get taken to a slaughter house. Total opposite. Not a nice film to watch for a vegetarian. And this would not change the thoughts of a meat eater. It's filmed the wrong way round.,True
25,10,Incredibly beautiful portrait of life,martinpersson97,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAs someone who is not a vegetarian, but loves animals, and is always open to great filmmaking, this acclaimed and unique documentary was very much an anticipated watch.And safe to say, it more than lives up to its hype. Granted, it is probably a rather acquired taste in terms of what you might prefer. The film features no dialogue, little in terms of cutting and editing (but does so in still ever interesting and impressive ways), and conveys more of a portrait of life.And if that's what you are into, this experimental piece should definitely be looked into.I found it a very interesting, eye-opening and thourough experience, highly recommended documentary!",True

1,8,Sven,Sinhealer23,n/a,16/08/2025,"A great documentary about Svens life.From his early starts in management in Sweden to the England job via Italy, where it's fair to say it took the English a while to accept him but a certain game changed that.As a Scotsman I still can't believe he took an England side to Germany and won 5-1!Also his personal life which was well documented over the years.He certainly had his adventures and enjoyed life.There is one thing we all have in common,
No-one leaves this life alive.A life well lived and I'm sure he smiled a lot at night when he thought back on his life and what he achieved.R. I. P Sven.",False
2,7,Not Just a Tribute,GB65,n/a,16/08/2025,"As someone has mentioned, the early part of his career was a little rushed through so they could get to the England job and the scandals and sadly I feel they concentrated too much on the latter. Of course it needs to be covered, but in some ways the documentary then lowers itself to the standards of the rancid News of the World journalist being interviewed. He spent many successful years in Italy and all they showed was a few words from Roberto Mancini. However, overall it's a very watchable film with some touching tributes from ex-players, journalists and best of all, his family. The scenes with his family throughout are beautifully shot and it's amazing to see how he came to terms with his mortality. I just wish the makers if this had concentrated less on the scandals.",False
3,10,Very heartwarming football documentary,wedfan-52803,n/a,16/08/2025,I watched Sven documentary on Amazon prime last week I found the interview with Sven goran Erickson very heartwarming and cryptic about his life has football coach and it had a excellent interview with Wayne Rooney and David Beckham in the documentary I enjoyed the clips where England lost on penalties to Portugal in the 2006 World Cup and very brilliant insight into to his cancer treatment that was heartbreaking to see a clever football coach Sven have to go in through the big c and I enjoyed the scenes in the documentary were sven has his affairs with other women and that i enjoyed the documentary.,False
4,5,What about the football?,moelgaard-92,n/a,16/08/2025,It's a fine documentary which starts really well but after 40 mins or so it drops.Feels like this documentary is rushing through the man's early life so we can get to the England job and more importantly; the scandals.If anything this shows how desperate and unsophisticated the media is in England and the rest of the world.Still I wished they would focus on the football.. I wanna know about his early life and career. What happened in Portugal and Italy in terms of football? We spend no time there to explore his achievements in Rome.Lastly I did like how they depicted him with his family and how they coped with the illness.,False

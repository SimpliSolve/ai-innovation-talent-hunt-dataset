1,8,Smokes and Beers make you fit..,stebai66,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you cycle halfway across the world, I should add.Really rather enjoyed this odyssey in the company of two very ordinary blokes doing an extraordinary thing. Before the guys set off, and looking at them and a hand drawn map, you can't help but doubt their chances. Sure enough as the story develops, so do the challenges and hardship the guys face.I will also note the footage from the camera's they used is surprisingly good, considering most of the movie must have been shot on phones or GoPro type equipment.Oh and if you wanted confirmation of just how draconian rural China is, look no further.",False
2,8,I miss traveling,ttc008,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is more of a travelogue, but who doesn't love a travelogue when we are still stuck in this pandemic? Makes me miss backpacking and meeting people in completely strange countries. There are definitely a few laugh out loud moments in there.",False

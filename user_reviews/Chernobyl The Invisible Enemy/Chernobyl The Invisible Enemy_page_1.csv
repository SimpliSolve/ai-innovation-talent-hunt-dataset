1,2,It's bad,vkalashnikoff,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing about reasons, nothing about chronology, nothing about guilty. Just ""omg, this is huge disaster"" during 1h...",False
2,3,Just wasted space,roguegrafix,n/a,16/08/2025,"You see some good footage but the dialogue is about 1 sentence per minute. Nothing about the shutdown simulations which led to the disaster--just ""a routine safety check went wrong."" No, it wasn't routine. They were trying to blow the place up and they succeeded. As I said the footage is good but the sound track is terrible.",False
3,3,3 star is for footage only.,wellyforpm,n/a,16/08/2025,Some alright footage but loads of misinformation in this mockumentary. Put it on mute and sing the Russian national anthem in your head and you'll be better off.,False
4,9,An Example for the Future,arthurbcruz,n/a,16/08/2025,"An in-depth, concise and comprehensive account when lies inhibit the true nature of disasters. The narrator takes you on a full scale ride of the destruction of a nuclear disaster in Ukraine. It is of no small concern that, like in Japan, this must prompt governments of the world to take precaution and ameliorate pre-existing facilities and improve our renewable energies. As tenants of this Earth, strive for the endless supply of renewable energy: solar, geothermal, wind, water, nuclear. And search for other kinetic energies that may ease the burden of climate change. This is an excellent documentary that provides a miniscule portrait of what unchecked power in the wrong hands may accomplish. ""Safety"" strongly needs observance if we intend to reach another ten years. This excellent reporting could be a great teaching tool for executives in government, corporate and private sectors, in that it provides the few lessons learned and not the correct actions taken.",False
5,3,What is the direction?,chuckkcash,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some excellent footage here as another poster noted, however, none of it is in any kind of order and is often repeated. I was expecting some kind of in depth Docu but from the start it's really hard to understand where they are going with it. It's almost like they found the footage but didn't bother to put to organise it at all; it just seems random. Add to this a script that sounds like a school boy wrote it (dramatic framing, single sentences, no actual information), has no bearing on what is happening on screen and its just painful to watch.",False
6,1,Written by a 6th grader??,joinusnov,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""documentary"" is an arduous look at random and unidentifiable footage that is often repeated throughout. Russian voice over are not translated, nor are any writings that are shown - but are included for... drama? The slow, and deliberate narration sounds like a report written by a sixth grader. There are many drone shots and satellite shots of the site and surrounding area that do not include any labels or orientation details. Documentary fail, 100%!! Expect a little more from your audience, and give us something we can actually learn.",False
7,1,Waste of time,drlykos,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie includes serious inconsistencies such as: 1) the accident was during a routine check (no, it was a planned test), 2) Hundreds of helicopters were sent at place to throw concrete but were not effective because they were melting(!) (it was radiation that dropped one helicopter). A lot of footage is used over and over, more than 10 times in the first 10 minutes.",False
8,8,A Relevant Reminder,JoshuaMercott,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPacking all the hallmarks of a documentary, this detailed and educational one truly has what it takes to remind us of the perils of fiddling with nuclear energy.Having seen the 2019 ""Chernobyl"" mini series, I was eager to watch this latest documentary on a topic that has been done to death - no pun intended. In less than an hour, ""Chernobyl The Invisible Enemy"" proffered pertinent facts and relevant proofs. It was disheartening at times, and unnerving at others.'Anxiety inspiring' is one phrase that best suits the content of this documentary. Given the ongoing fight against another invisible enemy, namely the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic, this docu held interesting parallels to what might have happened at the source of a major emergency.Speaking of emergencies, the also-ongoing Climate Crisis is added proof that what we do to the world around us can and will come back to bite us down the line.As documentaries go, ""Chernobyl The Invisible Enemy"" is a riveting reminder of how small Humans are in the face of Earth's contained chaotic energies - in this case, nuclear.Similar to the Wuhan lab leak, the situation at Chernobyl - in the former Soviet Union of 1986 (April 26) - can be chalked up as a 'man-made catastrophe'. It goes to show that everyday people are first to suffer the results of governments' and scientists' decisions - or rather, indecisions. Adding fuel to the radioactive aftermath of the events at Chernobyl were blatant government cover-ups and state-ordained media blackouts.There's a flawed saying in the English language: What you don't know won't hurt you. But in the last few years, and especially during the covid-19 pandemic, that saying has become something of a joke. Because clearly (no pun intended) what we do not know, let alone what we cannot see, has the capacity to ruin lives, livelihoods, trust, and dreams.This documentary was quite evocative, and more than a tad provocative. They used captivating remastered footage (from internal cameras and other sources) that practically took me back to the dark moment in more ways than one.The narration was eerily spot on to what's happening today. Though the docu exclusively spoke on Chernobyl matters, it still felt related to the origin and unfolding of the coronavirus crisis.This next line is my own opinion, and has nothing to do with the documentary...
In a strange twist of imagination, one might say the Wuhan-sourced covid-19 pandemic is our generation's Chernobyl, and that the Communist Party of China could very well be the new Soviet Union.",True

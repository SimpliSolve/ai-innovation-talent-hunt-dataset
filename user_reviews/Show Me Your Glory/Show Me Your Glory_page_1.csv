1,10,Wow!,kevingn,n/a,16/08/2025,What a fantastic documentary! I was fortunate to be able to see it in theatres. It had a 3 day theatrical release thru Fathom Events. I was so inspired by the facts presented in each of the cases. The first half of the movie is very dark since it depicts all the negative events. The second half is very uplifting since it shows all the miracles! My favorite story was about a girl in a tattoo parlor and a harrowing experience she went through. My second favorite was about a high school student who engaged in witchcraft but was led down a different path. The pacing of this movie is excellent. It keeps you interested from beginning to end.,False

14,10,Why Do Bad Things Happen To Good People,imdbfan-674917,n/a,16/08/2025,By far the best Christian movie I've ever seen. I think it would do great good for people who are just beginning in their faith or to convert others. It is incredibly powerful and uses facts to support the stories. Praise everyone who worked to make this film. Everyone always asks why do bad things happen to good people? I think this movie does explain just that and that Jesus is still very much alive and creating miracles. I personally have struggled with a lot of experiences in life and if I had this mentality towards it I think I would've handled it a lot different. Praise God For He Is The Way.,False

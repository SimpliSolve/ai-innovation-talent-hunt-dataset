1,1,Terrible,chad-61313,n/a,16/08/2025,"Maybe because I live in NY and lived through 911, I feel I wasted 55m of my life. This is nothing more than amateur footage of people watching what happened away from ground zero. Prepare to get dizzy from the spinning camera.",False
2,1,Found footage barf style,blue_wolverine,n/a,16/08/2025,New Yorkers are clueless. You see something horrendous and you just stand there smoking a cigarette? Go find safety or your family!,False
3,8,Witness this movie.,hubbard-51836,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think it may be because people are used to seeing the actual footage of the planes going into the building, and the buildings smoking and people jumping out of windows to escape the blazing heat, as the reason why this film isn't better rated. I thought it was a chilling psychological study of what people were going through on the day and at the time that this was all happening. The curious silence as people tried to take in what they were seeing when the planes first went into the building, all the way through to the end when people were reacting and didn't exactly know who to be mad at, is indescribable. For me, the most powerful moment was right at the end when a man was walking and on top of everything else he said, he added ""I hope we don't go to war over this.""",True
4,8,More document than documentary.,Dark_Forces,n/a,16/08/2025,Shot through the hand held technology of the day we see how the horrific events of 9/11 played out - not through the spectacle but through the raw reactions of eye witnesses. This account will stand the test of time way past the conspiracies and politics are over. It just asks 'where were you? how did you feel at the moment the world changed forever.'Never under estimate the power of witnessing people witnessing history defining events.,False
5,8,reminiscense worthy,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Its 19 years ago, but i can still taste the feeling of despair of this incident. i live in norway , far away from ground zero, and was cleaning my car frontwindow, when my neighbour opened his window shouting ''theyre bombing new york'' or in dialect norwegian ''hei dei bomba nyyork, dra deg inn å sjå på tv'' at the top of his lungs.so that terminated my cleaning session, and set my 7 days to come either on the internet or in front of the tv,watching the norwegian state tv's breaking news for all it was worth.im still baffled every time i view the twin towers falling, and this historical document makes you able to do the fly on the wall participation listening to the shock and awe at the height of the heresay stock market, as the catastrophe rolls on 10 blocks away in the background.so if you want to remind yourself this incidental day anbd where you where and what you did, then its a great document. so let all say a silent grace in the memory of all those who passed away this day. its a vast recommend",False
6,9,"I don't think people understand this is a ""oral history"", not a documentary.",rchosen-193-5535,n/a,16/08/2025,"Seen many reviews online complaining about this was boring and amature footage of nothing. They don't understand this is an oral history; ""the collection and study of historical information using sound recordings of interviews with people having personal knowledge of past events.""Nothing more, nothing less. No interviews. No random stuff. No commentator. No recreations. No biased opinions or cut stuff. Just raw footage from that day from one guy filming meant to record history.I very much enjoyed this, well enjoy is probably not the right word. It really brings back the feelings of that day when no matter who you were, no matter where you were... you were all one group of people frozen in history not sure what to do or what to think.For anyone worried about seeing 9/11 footage up close, you do not see the towers get hit. You briefly see one fall, but the guy is from a far distance. So if it really upsets you, you are safe from seeing the footage again.",False
7,10,Exceptional piece of history,ramair350,n/a,16/08/2025,"This an excellent perspective of 9/11 as viewed from people on the streets of NYC. It is a snapshot, not a documentary. If you are not old enough to remember 9/11, skip this one and save your one star reviews for the latest superhero movie. This is a moving and emotional part of history fir lots if us, and I appreciate this film. Never forget.",False

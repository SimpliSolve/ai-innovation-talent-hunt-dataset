1,5,The 'reality challenged' hate this idea,rossmcdee1,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerMost folk have been conditioned into a conceited conformity about many topics beyond simple verification.We have all watched so much propaganda over the years that complex topics may seem simple or even obvious, yet are in fact erroneous or misleading.This shoddily made documentary tries to address some of those issues, unsuccessfully, but with some good points made within it.Comprehension of basic concepts is really hard for most folk it seems, when convolutions, leaps of faith and dogmatic beliefs will suffice. To dismiss these ideas and label the proponents of them as idiotic or somehow sub-human is a tactic born from fear, and usually turns out to be hypocritical or more deserving of the accuser!Most FE proponents are far better informed about the Planet and science involved in explaining its state & position than the Globe fanatics, who ironically can't keep up with the spheroid & pear shaped superseding of that old, out of date model no serious scientist uses anymore.",True
2,1,One star is too high for this,holeefook,n/a,15/08/2025,This production is like something Johnny Depp might find in his bed. Nasty and it stinks. A selection of flat earth idiots talking to camera is not entertaining or educational. Only useful for scaring kids into working harder at school and staying off drugs.,False
3,1,Delusional Welfare Bums,colinoccupants-69583,n/a,15/08/2025,More of the same nonsense from a gang of social misfits who proclaim the flat earth doctrine to add glamour to their sad existence. If you prefer orange juice over urine for your breakfast drink then you will not enjoy this collection of soundbites from some of the loopiest dropouts you could ever wish to meet.,False
4,2,Slightly better than the first,wilsonkkw,n/a,15/08/2025,"Still the same insane BS from the last one, but at least now they chose a different host instead of Dubay, so it's minutely, ever so slightly better than the first one.Oh, and Jason still doesn't matter.",False
5,10,They are originals in stupidity.,wqualls-74512,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sorry but I must say this. The Hood know, the Ghetto know, the Pheens know, the Sellers know, and it is all possible through the lens of the simple act of poverty.",False
6,1,Modern Freak Show,rileyzachunt,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rollup, roll up. Come see the funny flerfs. Point and laugh at the simpletons who say the earth is flat. Soe of them really believe it... lots of them are just lying. Youtube is not the place to go for scientific knowledge. Unemployable bums do not know better than pilots, geologists and astronomers. The Next Level is just an extended memefest of flerf stupidity.",False
7,10,AMAZING TRUTH AWAKENING MOVIE,realtruthseekers,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thanks for all the Good work from all the team, amazing content , really a good researchers , one of the best truth movies , I ever see! Congrats üëè üëè
Much love for all the good Real Truth Seekers ,that keep fighting to spread the truth and to wake up our future generation! Truth deserves to be shared.",False
8,1,"Sadly, this is not meant as the joke it is.",david-919,n/a,15/08/2025,"For a sample of the amazing -level- of delusion presented in this ""documentary"", read any of the 10 star reviews.If it has any worth at all it would be to serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen if you don't pay attention in school.",False
9,9,Paradigm challenging.,jackdunphyfo,n/a,15/08/2025,"This isn't a movie for the philosophically bissed materialist or Atheist or NASA fan boy, it will very likely induce cognative dissonance in many.Let God be true & every man a liar.",False
10,7,Some good content some not so good,perreo,n/a,15/08/2025,"First off the constant ""important"" music is too much. Second of all, there's unfortunate speculation rife that can't be proved. And many ""big"" names are missing. Otherwise, here's another landmark contribution in the burgeoning revelation of the actual nature of our world and cosmology. Thank you all involved, here's to many more.",False
11,1,One star is too much,andagain-01484,n/a,15/08/2025,"Stir up a lot of old flerf videos, film a few nutters talking to camera and this is the result. Nothing interesting or new. The conspiracy nuts will love it.",False
12,1,Utter garbage,rfidmusic,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerLies, disinformation, and lack of scientific understanding all combine to create a ""film"" that's not even entertaining. I'm sure it's just a money grab for the opposite making it.",True
13,1,Beware of the nutjobs,dprogress,n/a,15/08/2025,Several flat earth proponents talking to camera does not make pleasant viewing. This collection of lunacy is a waste of time and effort. Nothing new here... it's like a lot of Youtube garbage edited together.,False
14,1,Nope,additionalconcerts,n/a,15/08/2025,Martin Liedtke a movie star? Never in a million years! Just say no to drugs and don't end up like the loonies in this production. Flat earth is a scam - don't fall for it.,False
15,n/a,More garbage from the conspiracy nuts,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,Scraping the barrel with some of the most idiotic inmates of the flat earth asylum. People who like to start the day with an orange juice will not be impressed by the parade of science deniers who populate this waste of effort.,False
16,10,Flat as a pancake,rasikky,n/a,15/08/2025,Please watch this with a open mind. And do you're own research! Everything in the world is upside down. You have been lied to all you're life.When you first go flat there's no way back.,False
17,1,What happened?,axisremote,n/a,15/08/2025,Where did all the lunatics who thought they were Napoleon go? The internet has turned them into flat earthers. Village idiots from all over the globe get together to shout their 'truth' to anyone unfortunate enough to be within range.,False
18,10,Great doc,dionmetsemakers,n/a,15/08/2025,There are a lot of problems with the heliocentric worldview. You touch on them in a digestable way for new comers to this topic. I also learned some new things.,False
19,1,Just a bunch of talk with nothing to back it up.,untitledrtf,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is essentially interviews with 5 or 6 flat earthers cut up and rearranged by topic. Like the first Level, it focuses much more on trying to show that globe earthers misspeak sometimes than it does even talking about flat earth. It straight up lies about 6 or 7 experiments, prominently features a vile, hateful person, and generally doesn't bring anything new to the table. They seem to think that you can prove the Earth is flat just by listening to people speak -- why did they not show anything real being done, any measurements being made? Because they know perfectly well that you can't believe the earth is flat if you look at any objective metrics. They know what they have to do to deceive you, and the emotional manipulation in this is off the charts.Sometimes the editing is funny, showing video proof on screen that the talking head is lying about what he's saying, but the rare laugh isn't worth the runtime.",False
20,10,nice 1‚≠ê reviews lol,xeiidamoka,n/a,15/08/2025,"You know all those 1‚≠ê reviews are not real when they're all 1‚≠ê
there's nothing between 2‚≠ê and 6‚≠ê
I bet they didn't even saw the movie , paying 4$ and leave a reviews attacking the people who made it instead of explaining the information they pretend is wrong ü§£",False
21,6,It wasn't horrible...,beelzabubba-99136,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've believed in the stationary earth for a while and don't need a new ""level"" video to change that belief. I think part II would have been a better part I and just the only one. There does seem to be a lot of repetition, which gets annoying at times, but overall it's good information. One thing I'm a little tired of hearing is how brainwashed the globe believers are, yet I've seen other videos put out by this channel and others that are in the movie, and feel at times they just push their own belief structure onto others whether good or bad, true or otherwise. One video about eating meat comes to mind, but there are more. Overall not too bad. I know it's time consuming and takes a lot of work, so thanks for that.",False
22,1,"Same script, same story, same old nonesense",paulheath-94780,n/a,15/08/2025,"The sequel to 'Level', which, ironically, means 'to conform to the shape of the liquid parts of the earth', the producers are so na√Øve about the content, they dont even realise that the title exposes their lack of understanding.Overall, this is great to watch if you want a giggle. If you are looking for science, its probably best to stick to people who understand it.A solid watch if you have absolutely nothing to do and need cheering up, otherwise, it's nothing more than watching people thinking they know more about science than ACTUAL scientists.",False
23,1,Deserves a zero star rating.,doublezap,n/a,15/08/2025,Delusional bunch of clowns who preach flat earth nonsense instead of being useful members of society. From mildly eccentric to raving lunatic... take your pick from the parade of idiots 'starring' in this catalogue of idiocy.,False
24,1,Someone left a gate open at the stupid farm,simonpinter,n/a,15/08/2025,"Silly soundbites from a selection of the dumbest people on earth. Calling this production a documentary is a mistake. It's a global clown show. Welfare parasites who think they know more than scientists, pilots and engineers... yeah, that sounds legit!",False
25,1,Zero rating should be an option,tangerinetrumpets,n/a,15/08/2025,More flat earth garbage from a gang of unemployable freaks who think they know better than scientists. Sorry guys... drinking your beer more than one time does not make you smarter than the average person. Take a shower and go look for a job instead of stealing oxygen and spending my taxes.,False

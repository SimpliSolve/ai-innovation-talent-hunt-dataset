1,8,Great,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,I disagree with some of the other reviews about this documentary I thought was really well done. A lot of people said there was too much context about the music and it made the documentary feel stuffy well I actually felt that the context was appropriately put together and flowed very well. I really enjoyed watching some of this footage that I've never seen before.,False
2,8,Excellent.....but,ngram-19405,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really loved this series, but they left out so many ground breaking albums. 1971 was the year Led zeppelin released IV with Stairway to Heaven, Pink Floyd released Meddle, The Allman Brother live at the Fillmore East, Janis Joplin released Pearl, Yes released Fragile, Van Morrison released Tupelo Honey, Jethro Tull's Aqualung, and Rod Stewart's Every picture tells a story. There were dozens of other albums that came out that year but these are just a few that helped shape my life. I was ten years old and had just got my first record player. The first 3 albums I bought were Aqualung, Zeppelin IV and the Allman Brothers live at the Filmore East. It was a great year for music.",False
3,9,One of Best Yet at Capturing That Time,caramia2002,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was 18 in 1971 and the good music just kept coming. But it had been for many years already, yet there was a change in 1971, typified by The Osmonds and other bubblegum creeping in, as this docuseries well shows. But it was an amazing year, coming off several amazing years for music. As a teen, I was drinking it all in and it was just a stunning time to be alive (and also very tragic). I really hope these filmmakers will do other years or decades.It's always hard to quantify the 60s and 70s without musical bias, so this was a monumental task. Usually, it's talking heads, so one person's opinion, or the same celebs over and over. Or they only hit the Top 40 bands and give the ""establishment"" or record label view of the situation. But this series only uses interviews of artists, producers, DJs, journalists, politicians (but very few) and other snippets from that year over the appropriate footage, so a kind of audio cinema verite, if you will. There's no narrator. It reminds me of the style of films like Woodstock, which let the event (or time, in this case) speak for itself. The choice of artists and music was generally good (compared to what else is out there). It could have been better, but I'll take it. You can't cover everyone, even in 8 episodes. At least, like with their brilliant ""Amy"", they go beyond the tabloidy or even nightly news, into what we, as young people, were actually experiencing.I'm so happy they included Soul and funk music and the issues surrounding civil rights at that time and the awakening of Black consciousness. That's an important story, of course, but also really a story for everyone, as it also meshed into the other movements of the time and white kids and Black kids had many areas in which they crossed over. And they widely supported each other, which was very new for that time, as most white kids had never been around Black kids (busing was still blocked by the courts in my school in 1971). Vietnam and music were important bridges for that, as well as for the first time, white kids were treated somewhat like Black people had been for decades (well, centuries), with disdain, violence, discrimination, and police brutality. So a great empathy came out of that time for what Black people were going through, which has sadly been forgotten now by many who subscribed to it then.While a lot of the footage has been shown in other music and cultural docs, there's a lot of obscure or rarely seen clips, so new ground is definitely covered, which is a huge thing as that era has been done to death, at least culturally, but this series melds music, the counterculture, Vietnam, civil rights, drugs, and the overlap between them all better than any I have seen. The clips of Black musicians and leaders makes me sad for today, how we need them now instead of the fashion brand gangsta rap celebs more interested in bling and riches than much needed civil rights, their voice diluted by the same. In those years, you had people who were well read and educated in human rights and activism, now just pop stars with quick money. On all sides. The establishment definitely won.Living through that time and also being in the music business, I feel like I have a good take on music then, but I learned a few things. The clips of Bill Withers just being a singer/songwriter are revelatory. His big hit was mired in strings and popish, so he didn't stand out to me then, but definitely more there than I knew. I thought the great Staple Singers were singing ""going to the races"" instead of ""lying to the races""! That was a brave thing to sing then, although I imagine many mis-heard it like I did.I think they missed a few really important bands, like Jethro Tull (Aqualung was released in 1971, following the brilliant Benefit), Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, Yes (although they showed Yes for 2.5seconds) both early synthesizer adopters of the new prog rock, although they mentioned the snobbery of that genre yet never uttered the words ""prog"", Derek and the Dominoes (Eric Clapton before he preached racism) Layla was released in late 1970 but the the unknown name meant there was a delay in people hearing/buying it, The Allman Brothers (Live at Fillmore East), The Eagles were debuting (they opened for Jethro Tull, and they were great, but they were heralding in the new, less socially conscious regime that was to take over), Led Zeppelin released Untitled (Led Zep IV) which was monumental, Hendrix died in fall 1970, but was still a huge force and had been the main artist who transformed rock into hard rock. Motown was still huge, Wilson Picket, and War. And many others. Spirit was a timely and important band and had just released their seminal album, Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus. Or that Graham Parsons greatly influenced the writing of The Stone's Exile on Main St, as he was Keith's buddy in the south of France.They stick a bit to the Rolling Stone party line of the time, which was everything Rolling Stones, Bowie, and a few others. That was frustrating then, as there was so much more (which their reviewers were constantly panning, unless their ""pets"", like Springsteen later). But the filmmakers don't get too mired in RS nor were they mainly influential here. Nor was any one label, as far as I can tell (but they are all one, now, it seems).The same pop pablum of The Osmonds (mentioned here as a sad harbinger of things to come) and The Jackson 5 was definitely happening with bubblegum pop and other mindless bands and artists (Monkees, Grassroots, Carpenters (but you can't deny Karen Carpenter), etc. The counterculture that crept into Top 40 pop earlier was pretty much gone by 1971. No more flowers, beads, or born to being wild.",False
4,9,Captures a year that Baby Boomers and Generation Xers lived through,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything is a beautiful docuseries capturing the reality of a year that Baby Boomers and members of Generation X lived through. In this series, the blooming of unique soundtracks in a turbulent time is captured gracefully, using archival footage and interviews plus voiceovers from influential and iconic figures of the '70s.The eight-part docuseries focuses on the musicians and soundtracks that shaped the culture and politics of 1971; featured artists include The Rolling Stones, Aretha Franklin, Bob Marley, Marvin Gaye, The Who, Joni Mitchell, Lou Reed... and even Ravi Shankar. 1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything goes to great depth (each episode lasts from 40 to 60 minutes) to illustrate how these musical icons were influenced by the changing tides of history, including the Vietnam War, and how they used their work to inspire hope and change in their not-always-beautiful world. From politically-tinted songs to dreams of unity, the show runs the gamut of songs and emotions. It's truly a beautifully-executed series, though it tends to drag about three quarters of the way into each episode.The series comes from a filmmaking team that includes figures from documentaries like the Academy Award-winning 'Amy,' and so you know it's going to be an awesome piece of work. Asif Kapadia is the show's series director and serves as executive producer along with James Gay-Rees, David Joseph, and Universal Music Group's Adam Barker. And this undertaking truly is a team effort; the production team has meticulously picked snippets of interviews, radio broadcasts, film from the recording booth and performances, and more, all from 1971, and pieced them together to tell a beautiful, intricate story. As you watch more and more of the show, you begin to get sucked into the world that is being portrayed on screen, a surefire sign that the minds behind 1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything did lots of things right! Despite the show dragging a bit here and there, your eyes will surely be glued to the screen whenever you watch the series.1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything is about resilience and inspiration, or rather inspiration through resilience. As these incredible musicians weathered the tempest that was the titular year, they funneled their energy toward releasing uplifting and rousing music that would echo with the general populace; they truly seized the opportunity. And I feel that it's a great parallel to 2020 and now 2021; certainly, music has played a major part in getting us through the pandemic, and who knows? Maybe 40 years down the road, we'll see a film about 2020: The Year That Music Changed Everything... Again.I give 1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything 4.5 out of 5 stars, and recommend it for ages 14 to 18, plus adults. 1971: The Year That Music Changed Everything releases May 21, 2021, on Apple TV+!Reviewed by Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",False
5,10,Everything you needed to know & more...,karlmartin2211,n/a,16/08/2025,"For the past 17 years I've specialised in music performance but more specifically lecturing on the social & historical development of music. I don't want to sound my own trumpet, but when it comes to this particular subject I can more than hold my own & similar projects always seem to tread the same ground. However, even I have learned some new info & seen & heard things that I hadn't before watching this. Upon reflection, I think it's greatest achievement was how it didn't keep cutting to a talking heads scenario, where the contributors talk about their reflections, as it solely used voice overs whilst still using the original footage of the time. It's an absolutely phenomenal piece of documentation & feel so glad that David Hepworth has been recognised as being the instigator of the project, who I've followed & listen to weekly in his podcast.",False
6,6,Really enjoyed the things they got right,jdfree-52729,n/a,16/08/2025,"BUT how can you not talk about Led Zeppelin,Yes, EL&P, or Jethro Tull. Yea yea yea I get that the Stones are the greatest band every and David Bowie is the coolest rock god but do we need to spend most of the episodes focused on them. At least when they looked at black groups the spread it around. It's well worth watching and reliving my high school years but like so many things in the 70s it was way too superficial.",False
7,n/a,Mixed feelings,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Overall, an interesting docuseries. My biggest frustration was the opening narration and the lack of introspection of the narrators in general.The opening scene is narrated by Chrissie Hynde of ""The Pretenders"". She states how she and her fellow anti-Vietnam War students set fire to the ROTC buildings at Kent State University, because "",The ROTC was a military presence on our university... The military presence had to go."" Kent State University is a state-run (and therefore government-run/funded) university. The ROTC cadets were her fellow students, most participating in ROTC solely for scholarship purposes to be able to afford a college education, and were not government employees / had NOTHING to do with the Vietnam War. The burning of the ROTC buildings at Kent State is what DIRECTLY led to the National Guard presence on campus, which caused the Kent State shootings. At NO POINT does she take responsibility for or show remorse or regret for her and her fellow protestors' actions. Had the ROTC buildings not been set on fire, the National Guard would not have been called in, and students would not have died.I think we can all acknowledge that the Vietnam War was something the US should not have been involved in, but the hateful and purposeful destruction of property and abuse of ROTC cadets and US soldiers at that time was (and still is) deplorable. Hate and violence do not make other hate and violence okay! ""Make love, not war"" isn't just something to preach but to practice as well. Self-righteous hippies gave birth to self-righteous millennials.",False
8,10,Amazing year.,lionelperalta-72339,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI remember that year (1971) absolutely amazing music, classic albums like Tapestry (Carole King) and What's going on (Marvin Gaye) and lots more.A well crafted documentary, the best part for me was Georgia Jackson's statements, she nailed it!It's just a shame that we still do not have real equity in this country.",True
9,6,Interesting but lacking direction,epdfilm-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm always interested in music documentaries, and there have been some good ones over the years. This was lacking. It didn't know what it wanted to be: a documentary about how culture influenced the music or how the music influenced the culture. And if it tried to make a case that the relationship was symbiotic, it fell short. Their was no real ""through line."" There were interesting sections or stories but in the end, it just felt forced.",False
10,9,Got it half right,douglas_harr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Others have pointed out that there is so much politics here that it fails to cover a broader spectrum of the music on 1971. Way too much time on Bowie and The Rolling Stones. Those groups along with the soul/funk scene and influential artists like Carol King and Joni Mitchell, hew closer to the story about music changing politics than the bands left out. However there was certainly time to note the musical impact of Yes (The Yes Album (1971)), Jethro Tull (Aqualung - 1971), Led Zeppelin (IV), ELP, Genesis, et al. With these albums and their ""progressive"" counterparts lie deeply meaningful lyrics about social ills and personal affirmation, just as the artists who got lord of airtime. Stones can mainly be included for drugs really.Not a show stopper for me but I do get tired of documentaries that get it wrong in terms of the breadth of music that mattered. Very conventional to make that mistake.",False

12,10,Phenomenal,roninperry,n/a,16/08/2025,"What are the other reviewers watching? This was a sensational run through 1971 and how the music was central to the culture & influencing society in ways that 50 years later it doesn't do at all. It's a brilliant documentary showing exactly how different the music influence was at the time versus what we have now.From Neil Young and Ohio to Marvin Gaye, Alice Cooper, Elton John, Bowie etc. It hits all the transformational voices that changed the world and delivered some of the best music ever written. Some reviewers have said it lacks direction, I couldn't disagree more - it's chaotic just as 1971 was chaotic - war, protests, cultural upheavals and great artists...",False
13,7,Super conflicted - wanted to love it,bpb99,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off - this documentary is right up my alley. I love the music from the 1970s and know quite a lot of the history as well. I was expecting this show to be a 10/10 hans down but it just wasn't there.First off it's great that they included history of the surrounding environment and how the world was at the time.. But all the views they shared are limited - and not always the full story. I think the time would have been better served focusing on the music - in such a short series. If they had the ability to make it longer they should have included more about the history and more about the music.The actual musicians they chose to feature - while I can't complain about them - it's just such a small part of what was going on. It's almost impossible to make everyone happy it's just I would have selected differently if I were them. I do hope the series is able to continue for many many more and able to include many more musicians from that time period. I really wish this show was more like the 'hip hop evolution' show where it is much much more in depth.When featuring George Harrisons concert for Bangladesh, the camera rolls by Leon Russell and he only gets the caption with his name under it.. I think he could deserve his own half an episode - much like some of the other people performing that night.In other words it's like they left out more than they included. Even in what they did discuss it wasn't 100% the facts or the whole story..Like for example with the Jim Morrison thing - the quote they included would have been much funnier if they included what was really happening at the time. Jim was being accused of pulling his pants down on stage - they cut his rant off short before he got to that part. Whether he did it or not is contested but that is what actually caused the major issues with the police - not for 'causing a riot'. It makes his words at the end saying 'I think there should be complete freedom for the artist and performer' even funnier. However who knows if that was even directed at this scenario.I don't want to be too critical or rate this show too badly because more than anything I want it to come back bigger and better than before.",True
14,5,"Some good here, but flawed",greg-beaulieu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoyed much of what I saw in this series. The archival footage let me see things like Bowie's appearance at Glastonbury that I had never encountered before. I had seen footage of the Stones in the south of France in '71 but this offered some new clips and new background, which was interesting. The same holds true for the emergence of Elton John in the US that year.The biggest flaw for me is that this often seems to take on the binary sort of thinking that has afflicted our political discourse of late and applied that to 1971 issues. It seems you were either for Nixon or a supporter of the extreme left. Obviously that isn't the case, but that is how it seems to be presented here. The same holds true for the episode dealing with the Black Panthers, Angela Davis and the Weather Underground subversives. It does a poor job of laying out the whole spectrum of positions with the various subtleties and instead goes for the simple political bad/good in presenting the characters. It seems to not understand that you could be opposed to Nixon and his policies without being a communist or far-left supporter. The same holds true for the segments about the UK underground press, which seemed to devote a lot of time to a group that was mostly appealing to an extremist fringe and did not make much impact on the greater society in the UK.I was slightly baffled by the amount of time given to An American Family, the PBS series featuring Pat and Bill Loud and their children. While it was certainly a groundbreaking piece of work that helped illustrate the social changes in society at the time, I thought this series was about music, and so it struck me odd to find so much footage of it here. At least the producers do not sidestep the point that drug use was the cause of the downfall of many of the artists who had emerged around this time, showing that in all the years since, some things really never change in the music and entertainment business.With all that said, the series is still fairly entertaining to watch, and really is mostly suffering from a misleading title. While some music certainly did lead to societal change, the series does not focus on that exclusively and takes the viewer to other areas where they probably should not have gone.",False
15,8,Quite entertaining and very informative,tarmar-125-253393,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was 16 in a 1971. This really took me back. Fun to binge on. Plus, it's as good a soundtrack as you'll hear anywhere.",False
16,8,Great music and interesting examination of the changing times,grantss,n/a,16/08/2025,"A documentary series that looks at the year 1971, the music and artists of the year and events of the time. Moreover we see the links between the music, artists and events, from artists championing social causes to artists who were pioneers and paved the way for others.A very interesting music documentary, filled with great, seminal music and talented, influential artists. Some great depth on the making of some the music and the evolution of the artists and their music. There's also a look into the emerging scourge that was excessive drug use and how it killed or limited some artists.The linking to social upheaval was relevant though sometimes felt a bit forced, one-sided and preachy.One disappointment is that while 1971 gave us the greatest album in music history, this does not get a single mention. There's nothing on Led Zeppelin IV, or Led Zeppelin in general, and any documentary on the music of the 70s, especially 1971, is incredibly remiss to omit it and them. I guess the band and album didn't fit the narrative of the series but, seriously, not a single mention?",False
17,7,The Year That Changed Nothing,markus_nylund,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really liked the first episode and was expecting more. There is no cohesive narrative structure to this mess of a series. I gave up after 4 episodes.Never got into Bowie, Bolan, Carole King, glamrock... Weak, over-calculated wannabe poets with no heart or talent. I just dont like the sound of their recordings nor their melodies/lyrics. Maybe its a fidelity thing. Some songs are okay at best.Lennon is a genius. Imagine is a masterpiece album. Marvin Gaye is an incredible singer. Whats going on is another masterpiece.Harrison was a hack with some good moments.I am a big floyd and zep fan.Just dont waste your time with this political garbage. Musicians dont understand anything about that stuff.We just wanna have a good time.Stop killing each other.Edit: ok was in a bad mood when wrote the above. Decided to plod on with it. Finished the second half and actually enjoyed it. Bumped up rating from one to seven. But still no zeppelin mentioned in the whole series?

I was expecting a documentary, but the show has a point of view, and it doesn't focus only on the music, though music is always part of the story.Still, there are so many watchable video clips (that show events behind the scenes, and seldom-viewed events, and great musical moments) that this series is definitely worth watching. Its Anglo-centric POV is also a distraction, but again it compensates with quality clips. Plus I learned a few things about the era from a Brit's perspective.Some might criticize for the chaotic way the narrative moves through the information, but it was a chaotic time, with many overlapping stories---in and out of the music scene. Sadly, the era includes many portents of today's problems for those who will see them.",False
21,6,Problematic: Stanford prison experiment and interview with Zimbardo,cuvtixo-13,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is going to be unfair, because it's going to only be about the sixth episode, 12 minutes in, and less than five minutes long. They have an interview with Prof. Philip G. Zimbardo and his infamous ""Stanford Prison Experiment"". This experiment has been debunked. Prof Zimbardo encourage the ""guards"" to be rude and rough, then called the experiment off because ""it was getting out of control"". The fact that it was filmed meant participants were playing up to the camera. Not only were students playing guards encouraged to be ""abusive"", many of them were fully aware of Prof Zimbardo's political views; his opposition to the Vietnam war, support for Civil Rights, and more importantly the treatment of protesters by law enforcement, and imprisonment of those protesters. He planned for this experiment to get ""out of control"", and the students were basically in on it. I think it shows in the student interviewed here, who articulates exactly the point the professor wanted to make.. I actually have no trouble with the politics itself, and it could have been covered as hugely influential at the time. But it was bad science, and was presented for decades as being valid and above-board. At the very least, there should have been a challenge to this experiment and the conclusions. This also follows a commentary by a very young Geraldo Rivera on the deaths of Hendrix, Joplin and Morrison. I wonder if he was paid by the filmmakers for that.",True
22,4,Way too uneven,Graf_Z,n/a,16/08/2025,"The concept is interesting, the music is great, but it feels like the creators had to deliver a certain number of episodes, so it became a free-for-all. They just can't seem to pick a lane. Let's do a documentary on Rolling Stones, let's do some historical context, let's do some social commentary, let's do one about black people. There's no natural flow or consistency there. It's not a coherent body of work consisting of 8 episodes, it's a collection of 8 episodes loosely held together by the fact that it's 1971. Some of them are great, some miss the mark so widely it's painful to watch.Admirable effort, mediocre result. Definitely better than nothing, but so much wasted potential.",False
23,7,Pretty good music documentary that teaches as good as it entertains.,KinoBuff2021,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a pretty solid music documentary series. It pretty detailed and always brings in context from people of that era. It can seem like a lot of information even when it is appropriately stretched to 8 episodes, but it never fails to lose your interest. The social, political, and technological context really convinces why 1971 was perhaps the most important year in modern music history.The Post-Beatles world had a gap in it they left every artist the opportunity to become the greatest band in the world. This series focuses on the new-counterculture after the death of the hippie movement. This new culture is so widespread though that it really isn't a counterculture but rather birth of many subcultures each getting their voice heard.This series really focuses on artists the Rolling Stones, Sly Stone, and most importantly David Bowie. With socio-cultural focuses on Black Empowerment, Vietnam War protests, and birth of the singer-songwriter artist doing their best to reject the pre-Beatles stale music industry.My only gripes was that there was little focus for other cultures like the Latin empowerment, American Indian movement, and American working-class. I feel that this leaves some gaps in music as they only touched on the more tame pop music at the time like the Ray Conniff Singers and the Osmond Family. I wish there was more focus on country music and cultures outside the U. S. and U. K.Overall a pretty good series that is worth checking out.",False
24,2,Huh?,bryanlawrence,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have a book called, ""Never A Dull Moment-1971 The Year Rock Exploded"", by David Hepworth. It's a very good book about all the GREAT music that came out in that year. I was 15 years old then and was just beginning my album buying adventures, exploring and enjoying a lot of that great music. So I was excited when I saw this series was available. Well...one of the very first things I noticed was in the opening credits, and I quote: ""Based on the book, 1971 - Never A Dull Moment: Rock's Golden Year, by David Hepworth."" Huh? So I thought, maybe I missed the other book with a different, but similar, title by Mr. Hepworth. Strangely, I have not been able to find that he wrote a book called ""1971 - Never A Dull Moment: Rock's Golden Year."" So from the beginning, the producers of this have committed either an error, or a deliberate deception, that is a little ridiculous. I mean, how do you get that wrong? Especially when Mr. Hepworth himself is listed as a ""consultant"" for this series! And then they change the title of their production to the grandiose and tepid ""The Year That Music Changed Everything"". Huh? Honestly, that claim could be made about a lot of years that came before 1971. Mr. Hepworth's book is more about the music than the zeitgeist of the times he was writing about. He does mention some of the current events that were going on (he gives two lines in the book to the Kent State shootings, whereas this series devotes a segment of the opening episode to the tragic event, telling us how important it was in the grand scheme of things musically. There's also a long segment on Hunter S. Thompson, who is not even mentioned in Hepworth's book), but his emphasis in the book is on the musicians and their creative output in 1971. Some of it was of course reflecting the times, but a lot of it was just being music for music's sake. I mean, I didn't buy ""Aqualung"" or ""Led Zeppelin IV"" or ""The Allman Brothers Band At Fillmore East"" because I thought they were making some grand political commentary. I just liked the music. This series picks and chooses the music of the year that fits its contention that ""Music Changed Everything"" in 1971, (umm, not really) and ignores a lot of the other great music that came out that year.",True
25,5,Beware Not A True Music Documentary,rehconcepts,n/a,16/08/2025,"There is a lot to unpack here but upfront this is more of a social documentary than a music documentary, its very easy to see the no so subtle slants when Bill Ayers audio is being used to illustrate reasoning, Under the correct heading of ""Social Documentary""at its best this series is very good at showing what was going with the youth in the US and England during these times and illustrates this very well. At its worst it tries to justify that radical left thinking is a morally higher ground and the right thing, all voices and sides should be heard and understood in a ""Documentary"" to allow the viewer to feel and think with their own mind. As a music documentary it has some good cut footage and at times lightly explores the subjects but veers off just as it starts to get going as a deeper dive into music.",False

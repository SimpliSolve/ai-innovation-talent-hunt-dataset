1,7,Ventures Documentary - a little disappointed,aezinn-22377,n/a,16/08/2025,"Terrific history of the Ventures with lots of famous musicians contributing commentary. Enjoyed it overall, but was disappointed that there was so little actual footage of the band actually performing! Not one complete song! I realize that the footage is available elsewhere, but I was really expecting to see some of it here.Great to hear Don Wilson reminisce along with all the others - just wished they played a bit!",False
2,10,I could watch this 20 times and never get bored!,dhalterm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was very lucky to have been given a preview of this documentary. I say lucky because it is packed anecdotes from the band members along with samples of music by those fabulous Ventures. Just as entertaining are the testimonials by dozens of top performers who have, through nearly six decades, been influenced by the official ""World's No. 1"" Instrumental Group"" and their phenomenal output of recorded music.
The number of these famous guitarists and bands influenced by The Ventures is surprising and staggering to say the least, and thrilling to hear what they say about the days when they were just getting started in their own musical careers. I can't wait to see Stars On Guitars again when it will no-doubt be shown on the PBS networks, and maybe even on a major network such as ABC.",False
3,9,This has everything I'd want in a biopic like this.,planktonrules,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of the rock group, The Ventures, is extremely well told in this documentary, even though it's a relatively low-budget production. This is because it manages to have the stuff most viewers want in a flick like this. First, it has actual interviews with nearly all the members of the band. A few of these interviews were done long before the film debuted....and someone fortunately thought to record all this for posterity. Second, it features lots of inteviews with folks in the music industy and who knew the rock group...not folks waxing philosphical about folks they simply never knew (an annoying problem I have seen in some similar films). Third, it manages to infuse the film with an excitement and appreciation for the group. So, if you aren't a fan, you'll likely be checking Spotify or Amazon Music or some other service to hear more of their music. Fourth, it helps you draw connections to other groups and genres to show you how The Ventures and their music affected so many in the industry. Overall, extremely well made and never dull...this is the sort of documentary I wish they made for all rock 'n roll legends.",False
4,10,The Ventures - A Sound To Last The Ages...,shelljw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Don is exactly as I always imagined him to be. Witty, easy going, chatty and just so likeable.It is obvious that The Ventures have had so much influence over so many different genres of music throughout the decades.Listening to, and watching the expressions on people's faces while being interviewed, it is plain to see how much they thoroughly enjoy the music, the skill, the dedication put in by the band members and how well they've mastered their art-form. It's clearly not a 'craft' and most definitely an 'art' with the different ways they got the sounds out of their guitars.They remain huge in Japan, which is fantastic, with many cities having Ventures tribute bands.You'd have to have been living under a rock or on another planet to not know one of The Ventures classics or at the very least a few bars of some of them.The band had quite a few line-up changes through the years, with the exception, until recently, of founding member, Don Wilson, yet managed to retain that well known sound.This film is one I could and will watch a few times and still pick up little details here and there that I missed the first time through. It is beautifully put together and just a joy to watch.With Don now having retired from the touring, he, amongst others, are hoping the sound, the name and the band will live on for years to come.Shell Williams

5,9,The Ventures: Stars On Guitars,cougmama,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a local Seattle -Tacoma music blogger, I felt this documentary gave a fantastic insight into part of our music history. I love the more intimate insights given from people who knew them well, and loved their music. I am SO blessed to have watched a preview of this movie with one of Don Wilson's daughters. An absolute honor to be able to hear firsthand stories.",False
6,9,Run Dont Walk to see this film.,curt-lambert,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to know how it all started with the Ventures and what the guitar driven wave of their career was like, this wonderful film by Staci Layne Wilson immerses you in the men, the woman, and the music that took the world by storm. Chock full of delicious guitar licks and fabulous interviews and recollections, Stars On Guitars takes you there and you're glad you went.",False
7,n/a,"Excellent, fun documentary",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Ventures: Stars on Guitars is a fascinating, fun rock doc filled with great interviews and anecdotes. It's bound to please not only Surf Music fans, but wide audiences at large. It includes explanations and demonstrations of how the Ventures produced their brilliantly innovative sounds, and takes the viewer on a great journey through the 60s music scene. This is an exciting, energetic film without a dull moment. Highly recommended!",False
8,3,Needed more guitar play,pietclausen,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fan of The Ventures I looked forward to watch this doccie, but alas this was far below what was expected. Too much detailed history with endless talking and no action on guitars to speak of.",False
9,10,"A stellar, upbeat tribute",philipcruz75,n/a,16/08/2025,"Stellar documentary honoring one of the most influential rock bands the world over, The Ventures.

10,10,I was VENTURIZED!!!,ipaintthemovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"You will be too! The Ventures are a band you may not know of, but don't know that you already know. Ya know? Well, Stars on Guitars gives you all the insight of them and more. And, it's a fun film! Very entertaining, funny, and heartfelt. The band that has such a history and outsold the Beatles -something I never knew! I have watched this documentary several times and what I love about it is that I discovered something new every time that I had missed in my prior viewings. That's what makes this film entertaining, you learn so much from it. All the way down to guitar playing techniques and details of making certain sounds. Don Wilson's daughter -the stylish Staci Layne Wilson- shows all the sides of the bands. The highs and lows, tribulations and triumphs in a respectful and nostalgic fashion. The animation also adds a fun flow and the film is not a sugarcoated documentary. Their story is a ride of ups, downs, and sideways, but The Ventures: Stars on Guitars leaves you with a smile -yours!",False
11,n/a,Great music doc!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well-done musical documentary, very entertaining as well as educational. Loved Billy Bob Thornton's take on things as well as many notable rock stars. You don't have to particularly be a Ventures fan to enjoy this film--although you might be surprised how many of your favorites where actually done by them. Highly recommended!",False

15,1,How do you have a Ventures Movie without any Nokie,LiquorList,n/a,16/08/2025,I don't get it. No old Nokie interviews? Why isn't he listed in the credits?,False
16,10,Great documentary of an important band,jimvandemoter-50236,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started guitar in 1961 when I was nine years old. After a couple years I started to learn Ventures songs. Wipe Out, Walk Don't Run and other songs were some of the first real songs I learned that weren't in the Mel Bay books. I also taught guitar over twenty seven years and I taught my students those songs. This show has a tremendous meaning for me. What a great documentary. Thank you. Ps. I'm seventy years now now and I still play. I even remember how to play those songs.",False

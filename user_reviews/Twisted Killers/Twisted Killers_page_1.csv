1,6,i do watch...,ops-52535,n/a,15/08/2025,"Loads of true crime tv series and docus, some a very good, some could be burried in the marsh, the oxygene ''twisted killers'' lands just at the average floor, and follows all the generic truecrime cookbook rules. It lacks live film material, like interviewing culprits, and bases its investigation on static photos( some really horrifying) and interviews with law enforcement officers and loads of blurry dramatized segments, another drawback is the use of an expertpanel of psychs and nologists, the knowhowers of tet a tet or toc toc crimes, they occupy at least 10 minutes of each episode and they are quite boring to listen to, saying merely the same in each episode.Ive seen 3 e'sodes trying to decide to catch up on the rest, nice on ffwd speed, even at 2x normal. So if your a nerd its made for you anyway, there are better stuff out there if you search.",False
2,6,The first few episodes were good,jshstvnsn,n/a,15/08/2025,"The First few episodes were pretty good. THEY ACTUALY SHOW CRIME SCENE PHOTOS! Idk why it's soo rare to see those.... the later episodes haven't been showing any CSP at all... and like one reviewer already said, the 3 women who just recap what we already know are incredibly annoying and a complete waste of time.. I was hooked at first but now that they have
stopped showing photos of the victims it's turning into every other boring true crime show.",False
3,8,Compelling and well-made series,dvg757,n/a,15/08/2025,"Surprised the other reviews here so far are critical, I watch a lot of these type of true crime shows and this is one of the better ones I've seen. The interviews with the police, prosecutors and victims' families tell the story, rather than a narrator. Also there are three experts who give their impressions about each case which adds insightful understanding of the motives and thought processes of the perpetrators. Some of the murders are very disturbing and it isn't easy to watch, but it is very respectful towards the victims and their families. Also you can really see how much the police and prosecutors are affected by the cases and care about catching the bad guys and getting justice for the victims, which I wish some of those who are detractors of the authorities would watch.",False
4,1,please listen if you truly want better ratings,michel1234,n/a,15/08/2025,"Seriously get rid of beth and kate and u got urself a decent show cuz finally nothing annoying. Imagine us watchers all having to deal with these type of people which u can recognize even in their eyes in combination with looks and demeanor. I wont explain in more detail. But im so done with the paula zahns and the kate snows etc etc. Please give us anything except these people especially if theyr not involved in the case, psychologists, journalists or podcasters are often annoying, really. Ugh.",False
5,4,Next to the worse true crime show on Oxygen Network,cdeanroane,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show does have some of the actual people who were involved in the case. However like Chaos in Court you have a peanut gallery who were not involved in the case giving their view, but they have never interviewed the person charged in the crime, Why oxygen thinks these people are needed is unknown and never really said. These people are distracting and they are just offering their own opinions since they have never interviewed the person charge with the crime. Only saying grace is the commutators are not way over the top like ones on Chaos in Court., but they are just as distracting! I much prefer the true crime shows where you only hear from people involved in the case and not people who has nothing to so with the case. As someone else said this show is low on the middle side of the scale of true crime shows.",False
6,5,Its ok,natbro96,n/a,15/08/2025,It's ok for a true crime documentary. I have seen most of the victims stories previously on other true crime shows and this brought nothing new except maybe some of the crime scene photos were more graphic which to me felt disrespectful to the victims and their loved ones especially their families.,False
7,n/a,Aren't all killers twisted?,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Have watched a couple of these episodes and compared with other true crime shows it's just a boring money grab. The cases covered are pretty straight forward so there's no guessing about ""whodunit"". They can't all be winners!",False

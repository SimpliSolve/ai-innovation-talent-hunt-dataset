1,1,Why?,davidlohr,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm genuinely confused as to why anyone thought it was necessary to make this? It comes off as an attempt to garner sympathy for the woman who was convicted in the case. While I acknowledge this was probably a difficult time in her child's life, the mom got a slap on the wrist. It's not like she was locked up for years and years, which she should've been. That and this all happened more than 30 years ago. To now suggest the mom was somehow setup is laughable. To continue to dwell on it certainly isn't healthy for the daughter. All that said, I found this ""documentary"" biased and a complete waste of time.",True
2,1,The mom was the victim??,czcjjvya,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is one of the worst docs I've ever seen. Somehow the woman who planned and paid to have someone else killed was framed as the victim who just loved her kid. And her daughter sees nothing wrong with it even though there's recorded evidence of all of this. The contributors act as is the fact that she's a woman relieves her of all guilt. She was found guilty - twice! There is zero accountability by the mom or daughter in this case. Zero empathy for her friend whose life and mom's life were put in real danger. They never once interview the actual victims of this case. Don't waste your time, this is pure trash.",True
3,1,Daughter justifies mom's actions,roobeedoo,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's sickening that the now middle aged daughter defends her mom's actions because mommy grew up in a time when kids/teens had to follow rules. What? She complains that she didn't make the cheer squad, team whatever, because of the other girl (riiight), but in the same breath says she hated cheerleading and wanted to quit. She breaks the rules during some sort of campaign and waaa boo is disqualified. Mom and daughter claim they're bullied by the other mom, and the school board. Oh boy. A grown woman and mother cries about being bullied. What a wonderful role model.The daughter's support of mommy is just as disgusting as her mother's behaviour, Which isn't all that surprising after seeing interviews with the daughter.If this happened in the last 15 years this woman would have gotten life.",False
4,1,Wrote 600 Chacter review to STAY AWAY!!!,Bruindude2,n/a,17/08/2025,"The Texas Cheerleader Murder Plot is an unbearable mess, wasting your time on an unapologetic, poorly acted story. The daughter's smug attitude, coupled with the mom's delusional justifications, make for an infuriating watch. There's no accountability, remorse, or real depth-just a shallow portrayal of self-victimization. The film drags with repetitive dialogue and lacks any redeeming qualities. Instead of delving into the complexity of such a crime, it feels like a melodramatic excuse-fest. Both characters should just disappear from the screen and let viewers reclaim their time. Avoid this disaster at all costs!",False
5,1,Sorry I don't feel bad for you,jasondamore,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a documentary starring the daughter of Wanda Holloway defending her mother for being convicted for trying to hire a hit man to kill the mother of her daughter's cheerleading rival so to help her daughter get a spot on the squad.Her defense is that her uncle and father set her mother up in order to gain custody. The problem here is that you can hear Wanda on the recordings made for the police, and Wanna is absolutely giddy with the thought of killing this woman and joking that perhaps the daughter would be so distraught that she wouldn't be able to cheer anymore.It also mentions that her mother pushed her to cheer when she didn't even want to anymore. This woman is clearly guilty. Why this documentary tries to pull on our heart strings with the daughter talking about how she's suffered because of this and defends her mother. Her mother is the reason. She's guilty and should've gotten life in prison.",True
6,1,This doc is awful.,ttbnzdjy,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerNot only does the delusional daughter of a woman who attempted to have someone murdered believe she is the victim, she's now in a documentary trying to make you believe she's the victim here. Lady, your mom tried to have someone murdered. There is documented proof, she was found guilty in a court of law. You and your mother are not victims. Get over yourself and move on.I'm not sure who decided this needs to be a documentary, but they were wrong. I would much rather have watched a story of what happened vs these delusional people and their victim mentality. There's no story here, it's boring, it's poorly edited and produced. Just awful all around.",True
7,1,Terrible,jjjingsmith,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is advertised as some sort of revelations exposing documentary, when it's actually just a narcissist daughter trying to get some more attention for herself and her awful mother. It became clear to me very early that the daughter is unhealthily attached to her mother and vice versa. There is nothing new revealed except that the daughter lied about knowing her mom had talked about eliminating her rivals. The lawyer for the accused also comes across as a liar, which added to the reasons why I don't believe a word the mother or daughter said. It's a pretty boring and self serving narrative that definitely didn't need or deserve two hours of my time.",True

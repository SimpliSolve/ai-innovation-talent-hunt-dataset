1,8,Fond memories that's some sure!!!,future-renaissance,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great insight into One Nation and Drum & Bas in general, for people that never had the opportunity to experience it back then.
Fond memories that's some sure!!!Shame that there was not one mention of the late, great Mc. Stevie Hyper D, by anybody. He was mister One Nation. Shame That!",False

8,1,No DnB?,kevin c,n/a,16/08/2025,"Given the title you'd hope you were going to get a chronicle through three decades of Jungle and DnB?Instead it's the self-produced story in a Bentley. Rave culture cliches abound, and you learn little about the DnB pioneers. Just lots of old men, saying what a mad night that was.",False
9,10,"Great documentary, must see for any rave fan.",reganjones-12740,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary about the legendary One Nation raves and the drum and bass scene in the 90s and 00s. We are taken away from focus on the music sometimes and instead focus on Terry Stone's personal life. To focus on his success, his married life and rise from flyerer to powerful promoter. A must watch for any rave fan.",False
10,3,Not what I expected or hoped for.,dps-rocha,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhen this popped up on my Netflix recommended list I couldn't wait to give it a watch. ""3 Decades of Drum and Bass"" had me thinking this would be THE definitive history of a music genre that most people would have expected to have faded out a long time ago but is still going strong. What we got instead was a bit of a Terry Turbo love in and self promotion device.While some of the stories were nostalgic the narrative did not flesh out much of anything about the actual music: its evolution from acid house and rave, breakbeats, pirate radio, hardcore, the split with happy hardcore, reggae / ragga samples, sub bass, further shifts into jump up and intelligent sub genres, modern innovators etc. Many of the clubbing stories felt like 'you had to be there' to really appreciate and not be bored by them after the nth one.And I guess if you were there, raving at the events depicted I'm sure you would love this film but if you were not and watched this to learn about the genre you would I you will not have gained much knowledge other than the impression that Terry Turbo was the one and only, Don King of the club and rave scene. So many huge legends in the scene spoke on the film yet it didn't depict their talent and why they were legends. A good documentary should enlighten and engage strangers to the subject not only cater to all the old heads who were there at the time.",True
11,10,Do you remember the time?,infoaaamusicproductions,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film made me feel old. I'm not bemoaning neither my age or this important film nonetheless, i realise how old i feel. The DnB movement was an important one in the UK. which provided the revolution all generations need to move on, push past what came before, if your parents disapprove, then its done its job - welcome to the revolution.
This isn't a story of how one man set out to become a millionaire. This is a story about how a fan used his passion and gave it to the masses. He created no less a movement, enjoyed by thousands.
If you were around at that time it'll make you remember all your good times whilst listening to all the behind the scenes times.
If you're young, its a shining example of what you can do if you put your mind to it.",False
12,10,We live as one family,mrlinkwitz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wicked watch,United Nation three decades of drum and bass documentary gives you a full insight what happens to keep the love restored on the dance floor for the ravers to enjoy and the artist to roll out what they do best. After going to One nation nights myself at the Bournemouth o2 academy And having a corker! it's nice to know the story of what goes on for these party's to remain as good as they are!! Big up Terry Turbo Original Promoter",False
13,10,Rave nostalgia at its finest,theonlyscott-62625,n/a,16/08/2025,"This took me back to my wild days. I found out things about the scene I never knew, I can't go back and live it all again, but this brought back the memories. Great stories, great people.",False
14,10,Wicked film,sben-09644,n/a,16/08/2025,"Terry has absolutely smashed this, fully tells the story of a scene which without him wouldn't be going strong today. Laughs from start to finish too.",False
15,1,Totally inaccurate.,paul-92777,n/a,16/08/2025,Terrible docu- film. Way off the mark. Misses the era completely. Waste of money downloading it only to feel ripped off and cheated by its obvious claims to be the be all and end all of a musical culture that included so much more at the time. Makes out to be the 'god' of the genre but appears false and lacking substance. Badly put together and appears to be a commercial vehicle to promote Terry Stone rather than tell the story of the musical movement. Watched it and wished I hadn't. Avoid it.,False
16,10,Nostalgic Musical Pleasure,jonandjill,n/a,16/08/2025,Absolutely brilliant. Really took me back to my raving years which were some fantastic memories. A great debut from Mr Terry Stone himself. A must watch for any dance music lovers. Will recommend 10/10,False

18,10,One Nation,danieljmarriner,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fantastic documentary. You hear from all the main people heavily involved in building the jungle/dnb scene. We are still going on strong now. Please Terry we all want ONENATION to make a comeback
Turbo Terry is the legend",False
19,10,This was my life !,grimersaw,n/a,16/08/2025,Great trip down memory lane this was my life from the late 90s to the late 00s One Nation was my first ever rave back in the old Stratford rex days until it moved over to Brixton academy . Terry has done a great job of showing how the old raving days were and what went on it's a shame he didn't show the raves which had prince Charles attend and Ali G but it was good seeing the one he had the queen attend as I was at that one as well haha . Over it the documentary is a great watch and I loved it from start to finish!,False

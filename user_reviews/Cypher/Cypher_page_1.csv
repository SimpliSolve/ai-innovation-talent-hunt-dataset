1,7,"Wait, what did I just watch?",docnrse,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerKept expecting LaKeith Stanfield to wake up in a sensory deprivation tank.This film is about conspiracy theories and secretive masonic plots involving controlling the visible arts, things that can be viewed through Lenses.Tierra Whack is here as Herself, being warned by an odd fan against becoming the next pawn of a mysterious group of people (old guys who meet up clandestinely in remote caves to plan which talented young people to turn into their next packaged products ).Presented as a documentary, complete with re-created historical-type footage of Whack as a young girl, it follows her on tour, and less exciting things such as vacuuming her car. There are also lots of shots of emails & found footage that helps explain pretty much everything. The exact ending moment is definitely a surprise and I loved it!If you're a fan of Tierra Whack, it's a definite watch. It's a creative movie and fits her style of being unpredictable. Also good if you're into conspiracy theories.",True

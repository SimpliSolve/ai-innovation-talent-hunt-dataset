1,10,Compelling Story Backed by Breathtaking Cinematography,bendavidwol,n/a,16/08/2025,"Taylor is an amazing character, and he and John capture the true nature of PTSD in American veterans in a powerful way. The shots from Patagonia were absolutely breathtaking, and the overall beauty captured throughout the voyage conveyed the restorative effects of the journey.",False
2,10,An edge of the sea(t) adventure to understand the challenges for Veterans transitioning back,senor_cos,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is why you turn on a documentary.... Compelling story and characters, beautiful frames, a great narrative arc full of twists and turns you don't see coming that can only occur in real life... And to learn much more about the human condition..
This is a beautiful portrayal of a person leading the way and reconciling their pain and confusion, to transition back to the civilian community after serving in the Navy, and grappling with PTSD and sense of purpose. There's so much that is gently informed to you as the viewer, as you ride along with this amazing open seas adventureThis is a great exploration for anyone and could be suitable even as a family night around the TV. Highly recommend and hope this film inspires so many people to consider how to support the military to civilian transition.",False
3,10,Heart felt story in an engrossing documentary,etcbeatty,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a great story. A story to bring awareness to military suicides and the difficulties veterans encounter adjusting to a civilian lifestyle. My company sponsored a Zoom call with Taylor and Stephen... which happened to be the day after Taylor's child was born. One of the questioned asked of him was why PTSD was so prevalent in non-combat personnel. Once he described the pace of operations that he faced as a rescue swimmer and the low success rates of missions I understood how that stress is not left with the Navy when you go home. And as a 20 year Navy guy myself, I found it crazy that the military is not doing more for those leaving the service. If nothing else, all military members need to see this movie.",False
4,3,Too much of an American tale,gorian_90,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's about an important and very real problem, and I don't mean in any way dimish that, but the documentary itself is just so incredibly American. For my taste, it's just to dramatized - to the point of becoming kind of tacky. The obvious ""twists"", the cello playing in the background, the ""love for 'murica and my bro's serving in our beloved armed forces"", the raising of the American flag in honor of ""their extended family"", the attempt to portrait it as a heros' journey (complete with reference to The Odyssey)... I'm sorry, but it just makes me not taking it seriously.Also the fact that the opening obviously is designed to make you think the main guy died during the trip, later revealing he in fact not only lives (""surprise""), but made the whole thing into a business venture... it's just not for me.",True
5,10,POWERFUL Documentary,bagley-95623,n/a,16/08/2025,"Hell or High Seas is a moving documentary about veteran Taylor, his experience with PTSD, and his (and his crew's) journey sailing around Cape Horn. It is a moving film, one that obviously took a lot of time, energy, and courage to make! I am also in awe of Taylor and the crew and their ability to figure it all out (engine maintenance, the sailing logistics, etc.). And the best part of this film is the message it sends to others struggling with PTSD - you are not alone, and there is hope! Thank you, Taylor and crew, for sharing this story so that others do not have to suffer in silence.",False
6,10,Terrific film,vlgregg,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is the best documentary I've seen in years. It'll give you a whole new level of respect and awe for our brothers and sisters in the military. The adventure keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the footage is absolutely spectacular. This isn't a typical documentary film.",False
7,10,Must Watch! Compelling story with needed info for all!,barbieFisch,n/a,16/08/2025,"Adventure, action, heart and soul! This documentary has it all! You'll enjoy the action of the sailing but be moved by the story of Taylor and other Vets as they talk about the struggle of returning to civilian life! I cannot say enough! Edge of your seat moment, tears and laughs! It has it all! Excellent cinematography as well! Watch it now!",False
8,10,Real and dramatic story,rmnventures,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is truly an amazing story about the struggle our veterans face everyday and the adventure one man endured in order to create awareness of veteran suicide.The is exciting, funny and the strength of Taylor's character sets an example for each of use.This may be the best film regarding adventure sailing, The trials that Taylor and the crew endure are real and a strong warning that this type of adventure is not for the faint of heart.It is amazing that this film has reached the hearts of so many veterans in need. It should be shared with all who served and all who care about the men and women of our military.Thank you Taylor.",False
9,10,"""Hell or High Seas"" is a must-watch for veterans, military personnel, and law enforcement officers",Jaykul79,n/a,16/08/2025,"In response to the rising suicide rates among veterans, this documentary emerges as a crucial resource. It helps veterans comprehend their trauma and transform their experiences into avenues for positive growth.Taylor's inspirational story offers hope to veterans and their families, showing that there is a meaningful life after military service and a path to fulfillment through post-traumatic growth.The film emphasizes that healing doesn't have to be a solitary journey. Taylor shows us what it means for veterans to support veterans. This documentary not only allowed me to understand my trauma but also helped my wife better understand my experiences. As Taylor courageously shares his story, he demonstrates, ""The bravest thing you can do is live and create a life worth living.""",False
10,10,Amazing True Story of Grit and Determination,atesanovich,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing voyage through the real world struggles with PTSD and a unique and personal insight into overcoming obstacles. Well shot and edited. Love the Patagonia shots.On a personal note.... As a family member of Veterans who have faced the difficulties of civilian life reintegration and friend of those who have taken their own life, all I can say is THANK YOU for highlighting your journey. Furthermore, I love how you have continued the voyage and what your organization Skeleton Crew Adventures is actively doing to help veterans and first responders on a daily basis. Keep up the amazing work, fair winds and calm seas.",False
11,9,Amazing story and determination,tmtieman,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was amazed how well they were able to document the action in such extreme conditions. The challenges at sea are endless and they were faced with everything. Many people hear about PTSD but haven't explored what it looks like for an individual to deal with it. Taylors experience lead him down a path of not only having the adventure of a lifetime but drove him to create a non-profit to help others fight the deadly effects of PTSD. The concept of ""adventure therapy"" explored in this documentary is now positively impacting countless veterans and first responders via Skeleton Crew Adventures. This is a great documentary and great mission to support!",False
12,10,Hell or High Seas: A Riveting Journey of Courage and Resilience,samanthaneer-71260,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Hell or High Seas"" is an inspiring and heart-wrenching documentary that chronicles the daring voyage of two veterans as they sail around Cape Horn to raise awareness for PTSD. The film combines breathtaking cinematography with an emotionally powerful narrative, offering a raw and authentic look at the challenges and triumphs faced by those who serve. The story is a testament to the strength of the human spirit, showcasing the importance of support and understanding for veterans. This documentary is a must-watch for anyone seeking a story of resilience, hope, and the unwavering bond of brotherhood. It's not just a film; it's a powerful call to action and awareness.",False
13,10,A Must Sea!,kconly,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's easy to explain how this documentary pulls you into the story and the majestic visuals from beginning to end. But you may not believe me, and I would rather you experience it for yourself. Watch and listen how a small boat with a small crew travels across the equator with the power of the wind, and a purpose that comes from deep within. I was fortunate enough to see a showing in Philadelphia with the story tellers themselves. Needless to say, the film is truly spectacular but hearing them speak afterwards made the evening even more powerful. I can't wait to see it again! And as someone that volunteers with Veterans, I want to especially recommend this to anyone going through tough times, or making the transition back to civilian life. Here is a story you must SEA to believe!!",False
14,10,Heartwarming and important,edharelik,n/a,16/08/2025,"An amazing film- a must see. Crisp, beautifully filmed and skillfully edited. There are no flaws in the story or the presentation. These guys are amazing.",False
15,10,You don't know what you don't know,erichorn-59162,n/a,16/08/2025,What an inspirational film! I did not serve for our country. Watching this documentary gives so much respect to those that did. Our top officials need to watch this and learn how to better serve the men and women who served for us.,False
16,10,Everyone needs to see! The message of this film needs to be grasped by all Americans!,plmcneely-208-230553,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sitting back after this movie makes me mad that the US does not deprogram soldiers after they have programmed their brain to be killing machines when they need to be.Watching this documentary makes one see how easy it would be to have an end of service time. There should be heavy investigation into the multitude of service personnel that could be saved by helping to reprogram brains from the needed service life.Post traumatic stress disorder is a real thing and ""We the people"". Need to help the personnel that are sent out to protect ""our interest"" in the line of duty.I thank all those that participated in this documentary!",False
17,10,Beautiful story of survival,rasgoodwyn,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a beautiful story about friendship, our military veterans, mental health, perseverance, and ultimately survival. If it wasn't a true story, it would almost seem too scripted to be real. It has heart-pounding danger, laughter, and tears. It was also beautiful to follow up and see how Taylor has used the film to spread his message and serve veterans with further adventures after the film with Skeleton Crew Adventures. Looks like he's about to embark on another epic expedition taking a team of veterans on an around the world race. This film for me was a fascinating introduction to the origin story of what looks like an amazing organization committed to helping vets struggling with PTSD. Bravo, Capt. Greiger.",False
18,10,AMERICAN PRIDE,barob-51973,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am so very proud to be an American because of men like Taylor Grieger, Stephen O'Shea and John (couldn't remember his last name ... very sorry for that). These brave men served our country and laid their lives on the line to preserve our freedom. Men and women who serve their country are the true heroes. None of the stars on the big screen who play Iron Man and Spider man will testify themselves they only play heroes. My father served 30 years in the Army. He was a Ranger in Vietnam, and as a Colonel in the Special Forces during Desert Storm. Unfortunately I was born with a medical condition that prevented me from serving, although I tried on two different occasions to do join. I wanted so desperately to follow in my father's footsteps, but it was not meant to be. I thank God for my dad and the brave men and women like Taylor, Stephen and John for what they did during their service, and just as importantly after they got out. PTSD is no joke. I highly, highly implore you to take the time to watch this documentary because we owe our service members (and civilian service members like the police, fire department and EMS) our most sincere and heartfelt gratitude for the risk and time sacrificed in the name of democracy and the American way of life. Thank you.",False
19,10,Incredible and inspiring,joegoodwin-73334,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a fellow Navy vet (and sailor), I found HOHS incredibly moving an inspiring. The cinematography is awesome too! More people need to see this film and hear Taylor's story. I attended a screening in Charleston, SC, and veterans from various wars (i.e. Vietnam, Gulf 1) were there to watch. I saw them nearly in tears, thanking Taylor for articulating their pain, so well. They though they were alone. The impact of the film transcends the military community. Anyone, struggling with any sort of PTS should watch. Just simply tremendous!! Makes me want to do more to help our veteran community and everyone who is suffering in silence.",False
20,10,Real Life struggle with the worst Seas on earth!,brinerrudyp,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an excellent technical effort by a participant no less! The producer risked his life in the documentation of this effort to publicize our military returnees difficulties returning to civilian life. Stephen O'Shea, beside this production, was pivotal in assuring that the almost suicidal mission was successful, reaching Cape Horn without loss of life or vessel. In addition, Stephen is the voice! He has the best voice since Walter Cronkite, or better . I am waiting for his next project. I think he has not reached his highest and best use; I am waiting for some major network to discover him as a face and voice of???",False
21,10,A modern-day epic for those open to see life's challenges as a way to inspire!,moviewriter-46645,n/a,16/08/2025,"This incredible story made me think of the positive effect every person could have if they just followed their passion and talent and remember that showing that their story can have a lasting effect on others!Taylor, (unfortunately for him at the time, but fortunate for everyone who saw it in this doc) had to endure a crucible that eventually revealed itself as a personal accomplishment (and triumph) that most of us will never achieve.But this real-life drama also doubles as a positive incentive to live life fearlessly and be a beacon of strength to all those who need a reminder that all of us can do incredible things if we just focus on the ""why"" and not the ""how"". We can all be an example of fortitude in a storm for those in peril, but we must all ""Hold Fast"" and continue to beat to windward to prove it (every day, on land and sea). Great doc!",False
22,10,Inspiring documentary and adventure shines a light on struggles veterans face after service,valhatla,n/a,16/08/2025,"Highly recommend this amazing story of brotherhood and therapy through adventure as we see Taylor work to navigate the challenges of assimilating back into civilian life after service. Through the compelling storytelling and characters presented in this heartbreaking yet breathtaking and inspiring journey, Stephen and Taylor shine a light on an epidemic that is not spoken of enough. The cinematography and narration leave you wanting to learn more and follow along on more adventures of healing, and that is exactly what we need more of. Couldn't recommend this documentary more and hope this film moves and inspires so many more people to help support veterans after service.",False

1,5,Conflicted messages,jackbowmanlmft,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIs it positive,negative. Both. Delirious, religious? Positives about Trump? Kennedy assassination, connected to E. Howard Hunt- probably, but why is it here? Only thread seems anti government- no mention of COVID, The government is giving free vaccines saving lives every day. I'm confused with what the message is- some great information, but some conflictual info as well.",True
2,7,FREE on TUBI now. 9/5/22,six2561,n/a,15/08/2025,"There are many movies/shows out like this one over the recent years. Many are horrible and ridiculous. Some are good, and some are better, leaving one to think logically, explore and learn more if they choose to. I put The Observers in this category. I won't say much except if these folks are nothing more than actors following a memorized script, then there needs to be a new category at the Oscars for ""Actors in UAP/Alien documentary type films"". If acting, many deserve to win an award. If not actors, then go back to my previous statement and at least study for yourself what truths we are shielded from in this crazy world we live on.I think it's the second to the last segment Richard Dolan has is very powerful.... Words to chew on, think about, consider, whether you follow this stuff or not.",False
3,1,Why?,nufc_geordie,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can't believe I actually paid for this nonsense. A selection of so-called experts spouting thier own hypothesis on a variety of unexplained phenomenon, and how it all comes back to non human entities and the intelligence community in the USA. About 5% of the content is credible, the rest is pure fantasy. The dramatic muzak playing in the background for the entire film is so annoying it was a relief when it finally stopped but worse than that is some of the bizarre visual effects that are simply unnecessary.",False
4,1,I just cant,AwakenSatan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love UFO/UAP stuff but there's a line to the bs I'm willing to spend my time on. 10 minutes in and we have moved on from UFOs to the JFK assassination? Really? Just stop. I had to turn it off because first, that's just too far down the rabbit conspiracy hole for me and second, I'm not trying to turn into that crazy and unbearable uncle who rails on and on at thanksgiving about stuff that doesn't matter and didn't happen. How do you bill a movie about UFOs then let Jesse Ventura go off about the all powerful CIA didn't see his election coming but then killed Kennedy? It doesn't even matter the other topics they might cover, you'll see conspiracy everywhere if you watch this.",False
5,1,Credible but ruined by unnecessary audio track,ymcfbhp,n/a,15/08/2025,"A decent documentary completely spoiled by an unnecessary audio track that at times competes with the narrative that guests are giving, once you hear it, then it's impossible to filter out and becomes a noise that takes away from what should have been a decent documentary. I cannot understand why this trend in docu making happens - the spoken word does not need a permanent ""on"" musical soundtrack, turned it off after about thirty mins as couldn't stop hearing the music and it interfering with the narrative.The guests are good, the tone of the discussion and each interview meaningful, it doesn't provide anything new but it packages up well in he discussion about black budgets, classified programmes and exotic technology plus all the usual things you'd expect but oh my, try listening to those being interviewed against the unrelenting musical soundtrack and it just gets silly and annoying.",False
6,8,endless distracting camera angles,garceauphotography,n/a,15/08/2025,"Poor director, and DP. Talk about distraction after distraction. Camera shake , zoom out shots with boom, shots with crew. I mean come on. Not cool at all. Have some class. I love of all Linda's works. This was the first let down.",False
7,1,An eye-opening review,britt_williams,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerYou've heard the same story over and over: no demographic is immune to ""alien abduction,"" right?Rich, poor, educated, uneducated, professional, nonprofessional, etc, etc, etc.NO ONE is immune to alien abductions, right?Well, it turns out that ONE demographic is COMPLETELY IMMUNE to alien abduction. Oh, and btw: you're going to be SORELY disappointed when you know the Truth!What demographic am I referring to? Briefly: No Christian has ever been abducted by ""aliens."" Done.Yes, people who CLAIM to be ""Christian"" are abducted by aliens all the time! But careful research will reveal that NONE of them claim Jesus as their Savior!YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!See ya at the Final Judgement!",True
8,9,Ok fairly average but very relivent content,balearicit,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anyone at this point who still thinks the UFO's are from earth are either trolls, CIA stooges or very out of touch with reality. We have been lied to for decades and no one seems to bat an eye lid. Content like this is all over the internet for free. People who payed to watch this must have more money than common sense. Which is why we are still having these conversations in 2022. So many people are still in the dark through their own lack or research on this subject matter. It makes you wonder how many other lies have been told. We need more tangible evidence so we can finally stop making these kinds of documentaries. We now want to know where they come from what they are here for and what can we learn from them. That's the kind of content I want to see in the future.",False

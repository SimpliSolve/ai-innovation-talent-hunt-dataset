1,10,Tiptop piece,fritziross,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very moving David-&-Goliath story of love, courage, & perseverance, with deep losses along the way.Young Mayor Brandon Scott stepped up to end city violence systemically by changing the nature of city policing & community organizing.For the 1st year of that effort, violent stats continued to worsen. GOP Gov. Hogan wouldn't meet with Scott & kept insisting publicly that Baltimore needed more arrests & that typical liberal weakness was failing the city, Scott stuck to his convictions.When Hogan finally met with him, Scott was able to impress him: a very neat trick I'd've liked to witness.This doc covered an amazing amount of ground in a very short time. I recommend it without reservation.",False

1,8,Great insight,allanmichael30,n/a,15/08/2025,This was a good insight in to the man behind that famous car and showed how close it was to being a success.,False
2,7,Excellent documentary,samnaji-15383,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an excellent insight into the rise and fall of Delorean.The forward and backward jumps in timeline of John Delorean's life to explain his motivations and decision making was a clever nod to Back To The Future without once mentioning the film (which is a shame because, lets be honest, if it was not for that iconic car in that film, the collapse of the DMC would have been less memorable).The documentary did make me want to find out more and did leave some unanswered questions, such as why the car experienced design faults (was that to do with the factory or the parts or the blueprints?), what happened to all the embezzled money in Switzerland and why did the FBI set up Delorean (was he an easy target, did Delorean come in half way through the drug deal, how did John come to know these people?).In a way that is a sign of a good documentary, it left me wanting to know more but still satisfied that I learned a lot.",False

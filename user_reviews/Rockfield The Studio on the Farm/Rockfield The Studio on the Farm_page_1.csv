1,8,Carry on ... Music studio?,stevelomas-69401,n/a,16/08/2025,Everyone is up for a laugh with a bucket load of cheeky chaps just wanting to have fun making music. This is one of those 'you wouldn't believe it if it was fiction' documentaries. Less faithful to the warts and all music industry and more a 'carry on' romp through history.,False
2,6,Still I didn't win...,RosanaBotafogo,n/a,16/08/2025,"The themes portrayed do not please me, not at all, documentary, rock, recording, but accelerating, reducing it to a 40-minute documentary, interesting to know the Rock farm, although the subject is totally uninteresting to me, still I didn't win...",False
3,9,A Rocking great documentary,Stevieboy666,n/a,16/08/2025,"I live a short drive from Rockfield, I have known its name and reputation ever since I was a young lad. Over the years I have heard local stories about famous rock stars getting up to mischief in Monmouth, such as The Stone Roses and Oasis.
Fascinating and incredibly well made documentary that tells the history of the studios (and of the farm). There are superb interviews throughout with the two brothers who started it all and their families, plus many of the huge artists that recorded there. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Robert Plant, Noel Gallagher, Chris Martin, etc. Fantastic, I found myself laughing many times as they recalled their escapades. The importance of Rockfield in the history of music, rock in particular, is huge. It is a place that brought out creativity in artists, where songs such as Bohemian Rhapsody, Wonderwall and Yellow were inspired and recorded. A hugely enjoyable and excellently made rockumentary, essential viewing for fans of rock music. Us local people will find it interesting too!",False
4,10,This place was sacred ground,allanmichael30,n/a,16/08/2025,"If someone told me that all these groups recorded these hit records on a farm, i would not have believed them but it's true and somehow not listed a cultural heritage. This documentary was really great and somehow they created a place where creativity could happen and history become legend. If you like this doc then you should like ""beware of mr baker"" another fantastic documentary on music history legend.",False
5,10,Brilliant!,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fantastic documentary for music fans. Even better, it actually included interviews with artists who were there. Admittedly I would have liked to have seen more of Ozzy and Tony! They only seemed to get 2 mins of time. I hope this studio lives forever!",False

1,1,Unwatchably bad,embmw,n/a,15/08/2025,"Even as a true crime junkie,. I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes of this tripe. It is NOT a re-examining of the Melendez case-- it's a bunch of millennial internet trolls with zero life experience trying to re-imagine the facts of the case, absent any facts to support them.From what I saw, no new evidence was presented. The brothers claim they're not responsible because they were abused. True? Maybe, but there's no evidence to support that, hence the guilty verdict at the time. An affirmative defense requires evidence, which simply isn't there.If this presentation only revisited the case it would have been so-so, but that wasn't the focus. Instead, a few tik-tok ""experts"" (who apparently never left their mother's basement) were used to propel this sorry mess forward. These people thought they ""deserved"" to be heard... in spite of offering NOTHING new.Even if you've never heard of this case, this is an absolutely awful introduction. There are more opinions than fact here, so don't waste your time. How this ever got made is a bigger mystery than the Melendez case.",False
2,1,Very very wrong message,ciliscirke,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerEveryone who has been familier with this case befote it blew up on TikTok (which is hardly the most trustworthy site) knows that the Menendez brothers are guilty. I would rather believe in the police, than underage teenage girls. Not everyone who is handsome innocet. This is what happens when actual police and psychological work gets mixed up with social media. The brothers are guilty, because of the long premedetation and the shopping sphree they went on right after the deed. Noone ever suspected any abuse and it only came up at the end of the trials because they did not have any more ideas. If they go free because of this the system is done for.",True
3,1,Eric & Lyle Should Give Up!,skeetesylvan,n/a,15/08/2025,These brothers need to give up though. Two spoiled rich brats with a made up story just aint cutting it for me. Why tarnish your father's name only after the murder? I have no sympathy for anyone with made up allegations about rape/molestation. Yall killed your parents for the inheritance. Point Blank!. Were anal exams ever done on these 2 brothers? Was a lie detector ever used when these two were questioned? Saying your dad raped you over a hundred times is insane. Any lawyer can see you two are full of s****. In any of the 35+ years in jail was any of the two actually raped? The lawyers that represented you should be disbarred for representing you two and that bulls*** story.,False

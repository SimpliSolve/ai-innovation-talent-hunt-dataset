1,6,I think it is well done but exploitive.,tupaknam,n/a,16/08/2025,"Leena was the only kid who seems really trans and to have a choice. The rest seemed to be highly influenced by their parents. Maybe Jay but I think has major mom influence. Bro, ditch the cubic zirconia earrings. Avery's parents are clearly pushing to be on a magazine and write a book and being in this documentary. Shame on you. Phoenix, was a sheltered boy trying to be like his sister. I see mostly idiot mothers trying to gain attention. Let your kids have a childhood and be free. There are real people that have these problems and you getting on the victim train is not helping the cause. Overall this doc left me sick to my stomach though it does a great job of exposing the attention seeking nurturing. Good luck to all the kids involved.",False
2,6,I don't get why the hate,RocksIMDB,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI really understand the kids
SPOILER ALERT
Avery's mom became an activist to make the world a better place for her daughter
Phoenix's family was just being supportive, so he saw himself as a girl for a time, nothing to be ashamed of, the church scene is a bit cringy but her dad is in the right here.
Jay's mom, ok where do I start being a single mom is hard enough, she wants to protect his sun and loves him so much, the feelings of ""I'm sorry I can't pay to help you"" chills people.
And finally the gorgeous Leena, it must have hurt to be cut from that modeling cast and being duped by that liar bf but with that supportive family and endearing friend no wonder girl bounce back",True
3,5,After five years so much was missing,cbisbee-73995,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is not an in-depth documentary examination of what it is to be trans, but it is a good start. If you are ill-informed about transgenderism, this is a good starting point to learn more. Being filmed in Kansas City and the conservative Bible-Belt was gave some edginess to it, but not that much as I was expecting. I would have liked to have heard more of the struggles and maybe from families not so accepting of their child's gender decisions than just parents who were very accommodating. Being trans is nothing easy.and that part was missing from here for the most part, but a good watch none the less.",False
4,7,Expand your reality,PaaviDyyd,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWe need more documentaries like this. That discuss a fierce topic. Everybody should whatcha this and make up their personal opinion on the matter, based on personal values.And no matter, what we think about the subject, we have to remember, that trans people, and all queer people are people. Everybody should be treated with respect. When the situation is healthy, that when the person themselves want to go through this process, it's up to them. But with little kids, like 5 year old trans kids, we need more patience. If puberty is the one they have to look out, when you're 5, there is so many years left. There is no need to rush any thing, so that there is little to no regret afterwards.",True
5,8,Left Me Feeling Gutted,damianphelps,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just goes to show reading some of the other reviews how horrible some people can be. These kids and their families go through so much just trying to be themselves, they don't need judgemental fools telling them they are going to hell.Its a well put together documentary that makes no judgements, it just presents the stories exactly as they are.. The families were very brave to participate in the film.Watching their pain as they were rejected by family and friends was tough.I wish them all a safe and happy future.If you need to hate these people take a good look in the mirror at just a second rate human being you are.",False
6,9,Informative and important; please watch with an open mind,jamiedaycox,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think this is a well-made documentary showing different trans youth and their families, and the ups and downs of their experiences. I know that people might have some concerns from multiple different political perspectives, but overall I see the documentary as honest, and I commend those young trans people and their families who were willing to share their lives with us in this way.",False
7,8,We're all human beings,fms-3,n/a,16/08/2025,"A touching film, told without narration, following the sometimes difficult journeys of four families as they rise to the challenges of supporting trans children.The high proportion of 1 out of 10 ratings seems to be a coordinated effort by transphobes to share their hate.",False
8,10,Worth a watch,j-mendoza2106,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really loved seeing parents support their children. It was beautiful to see how, even though they may have struggled at times, they did their best to make their kids feel comfortable with who they are.It still baffles me how some people can be so ignorant and think being who you are is wrong. The relatives and so-called friends who turned their backs on these families should be ashamed of their actions. No one gets to decide for you, it sucks some people will never understand that.These kids and their families deserve to be as happy as they can be.""Be who you are. Those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.""",False

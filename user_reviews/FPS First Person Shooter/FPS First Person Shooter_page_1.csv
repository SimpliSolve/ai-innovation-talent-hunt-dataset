1,7,"Great, but far from ""definitive"".",Kdosda_Hegen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Me having a huge knowledge and interest in FPS games made me the target audience for this film. In fact, this was one of my most anticipated film releases of all time. I backed this project and waited eagerly for its release. Was it disappointing? No. But I certainly expected it to be better in some aspects, but to compensate the film surprised me that it shines in other aspects I did not expect it to shine.For one, the film is massive. It runs for 4h35min, and it is the 3rd longest film (that is in a single part) that I have seen in my life. And the longest film that I watched in a single sitting. But I'm happy to say that even with some parts overstaying their welcome a bit, I don't think it should be cut. In fact, I wouldn't have minded it being even longer and covering even more games, or expanding on some of the covered ones that were only talked about briefly.The film featured a lot of video games and of all the games mentioned or shown in the film I only haven't heard of two of them. And both of them are almost twice as old as me, so I wasn't surprised that I did not know them.It would have been really great if the film talked about some obscure games I haven't heard of, but considering it is about the whole history of the FPS genre, there were already tons of important major stuff to cover. And this is where the film shines and fails a bit. It shines, cause it somehow covers a few, while not completely obscure, but for sure not as well-known games such as Prey (2006) or SiN Episodes: Emergence (2006) and some others which was unexpected and so awesome to see being covered. On the other hand, the documentary somehow does not cover some very important games like Bioshock, Far Cry, Far Cry 3, Crysis, DOOM 3 and maybe Killzone. Yes, you do get 3-second clips showing Far Cry, Killzone and Bioshock, but they are so important to FPS history that they really deserved full coverage. I'm sure there are many important ones that I didn't mention that they missed.What is quite odd is the pacing. The first half of the film, is almost chronological history, then it jumps to focus on multiplayer games and from that one it jumps back and forth to random directions. It's a real mess of an order. They should have either gone fully chronological or made their sections less scattered. That is also the reason why some parts began to drag. They covered all 3 Halo games in a row, it took so long and I was a bit tired of it. This wouldn't have been a problem if they talked about other games in between Halo games.What is the biggest shock of all is that there is absolutely no coverage for VR games. None. They covered many categories of lesser importance which I really appreciate, but no word on VR games is almost a sin. Also, only one on-rails shooter was mentioned.I also have some serious complaints about the subtitles too. These are the official subtitles of the film that came together with the film. While great for the most part, I noticed a few grammar mistakes and spelling mistakes, but there was one which is just awful. In one moment ""COD"" is mentioned which stands for 'Call of Duty' and it wasn't even the first time the acronym was said in the film. But the subtitler misheard the word and wrote ""Kai"" instead... I suspect that the subtitles were done either by someone who doesn't play video games or barely plays them or just didn't care enough about this at all. Cause under the context it was clear that it should have been ""COD"", even people who never played games could've figured this out as the term was mentioned before already and when it was said there, the footage of one Call of Duty game was shown... Epic fail.I also realised how much important information this film doesn't tell like when did regenerating health trend began, which game invented the weapon position being on the right instead of the middle, the history of NPC A. I. evolution as well as technical settings customization, many important visual graphical and technical innovations showcase and plenty of other important things were all either not discussed at all or barely touched.Still, all the flaws aside, this is a great work. It has a huge pile of information in it. While I knew a lot of what it showed already, I also heard a lot that I didn't know before, so I'm glad I watched it. This documentary serves quite well to people who barely know anything and would want to learn the history of FPS and it probably isn't useless to most of the huge nerds and experts either.",False
2,7,Fun ride through the history of first person shooters,imseeg,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary clocks at 4 and a half hours, of which the first 2 hours are about the absolute birth of computer shooter games (Wolfenstein, DOOM and Quake) and the second 2 hours are about the more recently released widely popular games like Halo etc.I was confronted with Wolfenstein in the early eighties and I had a fun blast. But a few years later I underwent ""DOOM"" and that really blew my mind! And I still think DOOM is one of the best shooter games ever made! It's simplicity, combined with ultimate shock effects, still freak me out some 30 years later. What a thrill ride!Especially the really early development of 3D visuals on the computer (back in the late seventies) is fun to watch. The guys who invented all these wonderful programs are being interviewed and what achievements they have made for the world of computer gaming.Nice watch, although quite long, but one can choose what to watch. Interesting insights into this massive virtual world which is the biggest grossing part of the entertainment industry nowadays. Lots of reviews by the makers themselves of all the most popular shooter games. What's not to like?",False
3,6,Great first half and then it loses focus,Nuclear-Atom,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was pretty excited to learn that CreatorVC, the people behind the In Search of Darkness series, were going to a documentary on First-Person Shooter games. I've been a fan of the genre all the way back when Wolfenstein 3D and Blake Stone were released.Clocking little over 4 hours & 30 minutes, the documentary starts off great. Covering the origins such as Maze War, Battlezone, and Catacombs 3D, before getting to Wolfenstein 3D and Doom. The coverage for id Software games were insightful and a lot of fun to hear stories from legends like John Carmack and John Romero. A lot of people from id Software were interviewed as well as folks from Apogee and 3D Realms.Once the documentary gets to the era of Quake 2 and Unreal, it kinda of loses focus. The documentary seems to rush and trying to cover everything up to 2016's Doom. In doing so, they miss other important FPS games like Soldier of Fortune, Red Faction, the Far Cry series, Crysis, and the list goes on. The documentary skims through Call of Duty and Battlefield 1942. Medal of Honor Allied Assault gets the spotlight and totally forgets about the first Medal of Honor game. Goldeneye for the N64 gets attention, while Perfect Dark is mentioned but not well covered as Goldeneye.Both Half-Life and Half-Life 2 gets solid coverage, as well as Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2. Portal is mentioned as well but no one behind the game were interviewed. In fact, only the creators of Team Fortress were interviewed. No one else from Valve Software, past or present, are in this documentary. Randy Pitchford is the only person from Gearbox Software to be interviewed for the Half-Life add-on Opposing Force (as well as other Gearbox-related games such as Borderlands)Mods were mentioned for Doom/Doom 2 but skimped on when we get to the Quake 2 and Half-Life era. Both origins for Team Fortress and Counter-Strike were either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.Like I said, this documentary tries to cover everything but misses the, big and small, important stuff. The creators of this documentary should've stick to the timeline and maybe stopped at Half-Life, saving the other games for another documentary. If they put the same amount of time, energy & money from the first half onto the last half of the documentary, I would've given it a 10 out of 10.If you're a fan of id Software's games like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake, you're in for a treat. Even the coverage for Duke Nukem 3D and Unreal were fantastic. After that, the documentary loses focus and rushes through the titles, missing other important games in the process.I give it a 6 out of 10.",False

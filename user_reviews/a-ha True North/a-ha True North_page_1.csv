1,9,"A masterpiece, but hopefully not their last",SoundrelDays,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNever has just over an hour gone so quickly for me. From the opening chords of 'i'm in' , there's little time wasted in pumping out all the tracks from a superb album which showcases the talent we know aha has. This is them at their melancholic finest, with a background short displaying mother earth in a fittingly cold yet beautiful panoramic way.Magne comments that he hopes the film helps the songs to reach their audience in the way that they were written to. The lady crying next me during the final classic 'you have what it takes' should answer those hopes. An album rich with classic tunes, YHWIT deserves some solid promotion, doubtless that won't happen and once again it'll be the fans only who just get to enjoy it.",True
2,10,Wonderful combination of music and visuals,MNorge,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wonderful combination of music and visuals from A-ha. Set in the North of Norway, close to the arctic and with added. Arctic Philharmonic orchestra.A-ha keeps the artistic and creative flame alive, combining great music, thoughtful lyrics and wonderful visuals.A band that started out in the 80's and that has continued to this day, celebrating 40 years in the business, leaves us with a wonderful celebration of the dramatic nature, people and homeland.The band members who are now in their early 60's leaves us once again, wanting for more.Hopefully this will not be the last we hear and see from A-HA.",False
3,10,I'm in !!!,craigunderwood-85600,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sad to see the couple of negative reviews thus far. Having been an Aha fan for 40 years now, I was very quick to book a ticket to the one night only movie. I loved the tone and mood set, some very good songs, and a few that may take a few listens to get into....not surprising for any album. That they are still together and making quality music is fantastic. I can't wait to see this movie on my home cinema, as the picture quality on the movie screen was lacking in brightness and clarity to be honest. The "" green "" message may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's poignant none the less, and we all need to do something here.",False
4,10,Stunning album + film,goodnight3,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have been a fan for countless years at this point, but will admit not every album is perfect. Of course there are always stunning pieces, but there have been tracks I skip as well. True North is a different experience altogether, from start to finish, and the film's overall takeaway of music and images is breathtaking. It's just a beautiful blend of sight and sound. We have only seen the film once, but by now we've listened to the tracks multiple times, and I can't wait to purchase or rent and watch again knowing the music better. All these songs are steady growers - and they have reached an infectious state in this house. Easily their best album in decades.",False
5,3,Distracting And Sinister,mmmagnificentmary,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film is trying to hard to do and say nothing. It's an over hyped marketing scheme to advertise an over hyped and luckluster album. Not to mention the disturbing imagery. Pyromania and weird burial scenes. It's dark literally and figuratively and actually does not have much to say about the environment. The director is a-ha's official photographer and his attempt at filmmaking is as bad as his creepy photographs of the band. A-ha look and act like reluctant guests in someone's high school film project. This film manages to pull a hat trick of doing a disservice to beautiful Norway, to music as a whole and to a-ha as a band. Scary and pretentious is how I label this one.",True
6,3,Untrue north,Olov-Baudin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a lifelong fan, A-ha has been with me all my life. But this movie actually made me cancel my preorder of the album. Why? The music is ok, but the movie just put me off. It's pretentious rock stars thoughts about climate, living in Norway and some bits about being in A-ha. There's no real structure, just bits and pieces thrown together with pictures of mountains and the sea. I really think there should be either a live concert or a movie with some script or storyline. Somewhere along the production someone should have said ""stop"". It just doesn't add up.There is also shots that just rings untrue for me, as I am living up north in Scandinavia too. Riding in the open area of a van, while driving along the coastline? That's a very American thing to do, not a Scandinavian. And the ""old shots"", how are those a part of our culture up here? While the nature is accurate, there are a lot of things that's just not what life is like up here.I was disappointed, but I am still a big fan.",True

1,8,An Amazing International Concert Film - delivered by IVE,natesarenathans,n/a,17/08/2025,"IVE's concert film is an exciting concert film; from the opening moments it's clear how much thought went into every detail.The stage design is stunning, the choreography is sharp and it is a showcase of IVE's artistry and the powerful presence they've built as a group.One of the film's biggest strengths is how it balances grand spectacle with personal moments. The BTS footage gives a glimpse into the hard work and passion that fuel their performances making them connected to their fans.The pacing is not perfect. Some parts of the concert feel a bit stretched out and while devoted fans will love every second casual viewers might find themselves checking the time.",False

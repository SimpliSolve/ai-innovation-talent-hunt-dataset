1,9,Fascinating,wallifico,n/a,16/08/2025,"Top notch video, very informative. One of the best I've seen. I'd love to see one for technical ecstasy or never say die era of Sabbath. Alot of overlooked music and I'm sure the stories were wild.",False
2,9,Very Good Documentary,michaelrthomasfofc,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is exceptional. The sourcing and research is more in-depth than many other professional rock docs, especially considering the short runtime. The editing and commentary are well accomplished while the content is interesting and informative. It's good to see a documentary on Black Sabbath that does not perpetuate old rumors or delve too deep into the drug and alcohol issues which are overdone in many other productions. It is important to know the behind the scenes information about scumbag management that plagued Sabbath in their prime. That knowledge is key to understanding the lyrics on Sabotage. Great job by the producer of this video, Alan Berry. Hopefully we'll see more documentary production from him soon!",False
3,10,Intelligent and informative documentary,mallan-49581,n/a,16/08/2025,"You'll learn a lot from this well-researched and well-edited film, you'll get a new (or renewed) appreciation of Black Sabbath and, if you pay attention, you'll get a few laughs too.",False
4,10,Phenomenal Documentary,petercaindogtraining,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you are a sabbath fan and like deep dives/breakdowns of albums, watch this documentary. It shows the band in a different light, and brings light to a more underrated and unique sabbath album. There are some really cool sabbath historical facts too. 🤘🦇",False
5,10,Amazing!,jakecattoi,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well-made and informative documentary on Black Sabbath's last great album and tour! Includes rare photos, video and audio of the band circa 1975. I look forward to watching the next documentary in this series.",False
6,10,10/10,ozzy-87204,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't believe that I actually found a good and accurate Sabbath documentary. You can tell that this was made by a fan, not just a writer. The editing was great as well too. Thanks Alan Berry!",False

9,10,Great effort and amazing detail,joeysabbath,n/a,16/08/2025,Fantastic Documentary for Sabbath fans.Sabotage was a hectic era In Sabbaths history and this does a very good job of expressing that. Highly recommended!,False
10,10,Not a Sabbath Nut but this more than satisfied my music industry itch,canine-91812,n/a,16/08/2025,"I confess. I love Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man,"" but not from listening to the album Paranoid. I was first introduced to this song during the end credits of the first Iron Man movie. So it's fair to say I'm not a massive Sabbath fan... or I didn't know I was one until I watched this video.If you're a music nut, like the kind that reads all the lyrics, stares at a cover for hours trying to figure out what it means, and maybe goes beyond all that and wants to know how an album came together from the first chords of an idea to the finished recorded track (and in some cases, how the songs got their titles), then this video is for you.First off, there's so much great imagery in here, period footage that really takes you back to the '70s, shots of the band (Ozzy looks so young! I only know him from his reality shows - and for the record, Ozzy, don't dye your hair anymore, all right? You look way better with that natural gray!), incredible extras like a piece of Sabotage paperwork, a manager contract, and concert posters.Oh, and you find out how appropriate the album title, Sabotage, is! Plus, this video has a Hulk!The filmmakers prove a lot of rumors false and tell you what really happened. And yes, truth still matters. Also I learned a couple things. Like this Godfather of Rock guy who managed Black Sabbath at one point is also the dad of Sharon Osbourne. And I know what a mellotron is now.Overall, Sabbath seems like a bunch of regular guys. Not the devil worshippers people back then made them out to be. But the story this video tells shows you exactly who the real devils were.I'll be honest: Mostly, this is stuff my dad listens to. I like a lot of the heavier songs he's played for me, but I never really thought much about the band and how there was nothing like them before. It's a little hard to imagine with all the heavy jam available today, but this video shows you how Black Sabbath were heavy pioneers of absolute jam.",False
11,10,Sabbath fan must watch,roblongarini,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've been a Sabbath fan for over 30 years and I know everything and seen everything Sabbath but even I found this documentary entertaining and informative!!! Great job and all ""Hail Sabbath""🤘🤘🤘",False
12,9,Made extremely well,matthewmcgourty,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is extremely well made, with lots of information I didn't even know. The editing is top notch and tells the untold story of an unfairly overlooked Sabbath record, truly the last great record of the original line up. My only quibble is that the audio is pretty low fi, even for Youtube's standards. If this is addressed then this would be a 10/10 film.",False
13,10,Best Sabbath Documentary.,abdulrahman_sh-64183,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a die hard Sabbath fan and Sabotage is my favorite album, I thought I knew everything about Sabotage and all the conflicts and drama etc.. but this documentary taught me so many things I never knew about, I watched this at least 4 times and I cannot wait for the next upload.Iommi is god.",False
14,10,Extraordinary,cducoingr,n/a,16/08/2025,A professional and extremely well produced video on the best band of the World. The author/producer has done a quite dedicated effort to show the creation of this epic Album.,False
15,10,Perfection!,murderinmakeup,n/a,16/08/2025,"Amazing documentary, the record companies, band members etc have never made in depth docs like this one! Would love to see one created for each album of the ozzy era of sabbath! Couldn't rate any higher!",False

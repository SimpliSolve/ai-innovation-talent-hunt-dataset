1,n/a,THIS IS ART,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Since its inception, the film industry for all intents and purposes has been exactly that: an industry!It has always been about making money, it has always been about profit. It has always pandered to the mainstream.The goal has always been quantity of butts in seats over quality of the product. And I'm here to tell you this: people, we have been cheated!There is so much that film can offer us. It is not just about mindless entertainment, it is a true art form!I present to you the digital age. Welcome, at long last! No longer are there countless barriers and red tape to film making. No longer is the medium so expensive that one must recoup his or her high costs.All the Happy People proves that in spades by giving us a totally fresh take on what cinema can truly accomplish! It creates a whole new genre that feels more akin to a painting in a museum than to films of the past.If Quentin Tarantino wants to keep shooting on film, that's his prerogative, but the digital age has allowed creative film makers to make their art more cheaply than ever, and I can't wait to see what else it has to offer!",False

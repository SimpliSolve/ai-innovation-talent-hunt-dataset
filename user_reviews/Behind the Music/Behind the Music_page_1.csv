1,8,"I Enjoyed watching a revamp of this series, especially the Duran Duran episode. ;D",midnitepantera,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was really great and weird to see Duran Duran on a new episode of Behind the Music. I always liked them, they weren't my favorite band in the 80's and 90's, but I did luv a lot of their songs, but especially loved them in the 90's when they made The Wedding Album, especially their hit Ordinary World, which is still their most Favorite song for me. And I also loved Power Station back in the day.It was nice to see them all sit down, and really speak totally BLUNTLY and Brutally Honestly about all the ups and downs, and rifts between members, and bad habits, and coping with crazy fans (or in 1 case, not being able to cope with crazy fans). They are a group of 5 very talented men, who will leave a lot of great music for the new generations to enjoy and be inspired by as well.Don't listen to that other reviewer who obviously has no appreciation or nostalgia for what all these great old and new musicians go thru and how they literally leave pieces of themselves in their music for the rest of us. And I also loved that Duran Duran members made a collective and create with so many new singers and producers who bring their own style and flavor and making some beautiful music with this 80's Iconic band.If you love learning about musicians, their roads thru life, the good, the bad and the ugly splayed out on the table, so you can maybe understand them and realize that fame is not always what it's cracked up to be, then watch this show. :D.",False
2,10,Love this revamp!,marriedabrit-815-734189,n/a,16/08/2025,So awesome that they have started to make these again! I loved watching the original on vh1 back in the day. I can't wait to watch more! The episode with Duran Duran was absolutely brilliant!,False
3,5,Old Musical Express,southdavid,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just a quick note on this one as I didn't watch all of these, but as they were the next thing on my alphabetical run through the Paramount Plus App, so I watched them until I couldn't be bothered any more, which was only seven episodes. (I don't know who Fat Joe is and I wasn't prepared to learn).This update to the classic VH1 series revisits some of the performers who have been featured on the series previously. They rewatch aspects of their old shows and recontextualise things that they said then and provide an update about what has happened to them since.The problem for me wasn't so much the format of the show, which actually works quite well, but more the subjects of it, who aren't particularly bands or musicians that I'm interested in. I get that they want to appeal to the widest demographic possible and I have heard of (nearly) all of these performers, but I am just not interested in them. If you are, then this is decent enough.",False
4,2,"Same Episodes, A Few Minutes Of New Info",helenahandbasket-93734,n/a,16/08/2025,"All the streaming services seem to have this idea that, 'revamping' old favorites will somehow garner them big success, but as this series attests, you can't just slap a shiny new opening and a few new establishing shots and expect to sell it as something 'new'.If you've never seen this series previously, you may enjoy it, but the acts they're using are old and mostly 'has-beens' that haven't had a new single in a decade or better. I certainly enjoy Huey Lewis, Ricky Martin, etc., but I've seen these before. With the possible exception of the HL episode, and what I can only guess is Jimmy Kimmel reading an incredibly scripted description that makes one yearn for episodes of 'This Old House' and watching paint dry as a more exciting alternative. (How this guy is a comedian, much less a host of anything is nothing short of miraculous- it gives one pause to consider the goods he must have on a few people to be able to be where he is in life.)Not entertaining in the least to anyone who watched the series as it was initially rolled out on VH1- because you've seen it all before, except now it fits on your tv screen without the distraction of black bars on either side.It's always been a somewhat entertaining series, but is in definite need of NEW episodes, with current/different artists.As a point of contention, I'd add that if you decide to do more ORIGINAL content, PULEEZEEEEE stop glamorizing the sex/drugs/rock trope- most of these artists definitely have the battle scars to showcase the gross effects of this lifestyle without ever uttering a word; having them relive some supposed glory because they were living and performing high as a kite and damn near died innumerable separate times with some ridiculous nostalgic gleam in their eyes is disgusting. All the while completely ignoring their countless issues that led them to this outcome of abuse and neglect but 'hey I'm famous so yeah!' isn't exactly inspiring to anyone other than themselves/their family/close friends (I'm looking at you Nikki Sixx) so spare us the supposed come to Jesus nonsense.People like to be able to relate to those they listen to/watch/etc., but unless there's a point to telling the tales of woe/conclusions one could draw, leave the garbage out.",False

1,9,Portrait of a New Woman,imdbfan-568817,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a remarkably honest and absorbing documentary. At the surface level, it seems to be an observation of birth of a polyamorous relationship, but in the end it's a portrait of a woman in deep transformation. This is why it spoke so strongly to me: a larger societal issue is discussed through a perspective of a single individual. It makes it somehow easier to understand choices of people we may not agree with if we see them as very human. This is also the movie's strongest side: the director follows Alicja with massive sensitivity and nuance, as she battles with feelings of jealousy, anxiety, anger, fear is of abandonment... I love how it remains free on judgment on a topic that causes so much upheaval. Can heartily recommend!",False

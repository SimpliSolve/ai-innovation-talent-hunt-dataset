1,6,Black pyramid,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPeabody Award winner Linda Moulton Howe, Monuments of Mars author Richard C. Hoagland, the History Channel's David Hatcher Childress and other renowned international experts are here for Cybela Clare's latest film which goes in deep to explain the colossal stone pyramids encircling our planet and the ones under Alaska, where someone whose father served there drops massive science on what his dad did under the ice.If you've watched enough Discovery Channel, you probably know all about the black pyramid in Alaska and how they transform animals into bloodthirsty killing machines. This all started in the 90s, when Chinese nuclear test shockwaves revealed a pyramid-shaped spot of interference below the ground.According to this article on Medium, on May 27, 2020, 41-year-old Nathan Campbell chartered a plane and flew out to Denali National Park and spend four months in Alaska with the hopes of finding the pyramid. He disappeared and was declared dead by October of that year.Supposedly, this pyramid is bigger than the one in Giza. There's not much out there online about this, which makes me think that is a real thing. Howe has been one of the people talking about it since she used to be on Coast to Coast, discussing how 18,000 people have gone missing an Alaskan version of the warmer triangle in Bermuda. Remember that thing?She also shared an interview with Doug Mutschler, a retired US Army counterintelligence agent, who revealed how the U. S. military was trying to use the pyramid. He also claimed that a local channel aired a report about the discovery of the pyramid. When he called and asked for a videotape, he was told the show never aired.If you want to know more, this movie has enough facts about this pyramid that you'll be filled with ideas and wonder just why it exists and why we don't know more about it.",True
2,2,OMG what a bunch of bs,noblebowl,n/a,16/08/2025,"The ""Alaska Pyramid"" section was really bad. The rest was OK, but is tired info rehashed from decades past.Supposedly, they spent half a $mill on this doc, but couldn't get any evidence of this pyramid's existence? Not a map to show the supposed location (just a google pin of the nearby mountain)? Mashed potato pyramid likeness? Drone footage? Alaskan Eskimo anecdotes? Electrical disruptions? Dead birds falling from the skies? Freaking pictures of someone hiking in the general area, showing a surreptitiously hidden military base?The whole doc is littered with 'stock' photos. Watch it if you need a refresher on purported electrical control of the, LOL, Solar System wide pyramid collection. Otherwise, give it a pass...",False
3,1,Unscientific conspiracy wackos.,parbjorkman-92443,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie has the same content as the scientology theorys. It starts out a bit vague and just a bit odd, but then at half point it turns on the full out of this world wierdness and conspiracy nutcase pontential.There is just as little scientific value in this movie as in any episode of X-files or the 60s series of Star Trek.If you are into this for pure laughs, there is much to laugh about I can assure you. Without giving away too much spoiler, you can look forward to hearing about how we all could have totally free energy, just by building some 4 sided pyramid at the center of each major city of the world. =D.",False
4,1,Utter rubbish,Dormarth112,n/a,16/08/2025,"Feels like a Tim and Eric sketch but with no self awareness. You are bombarded with so much misinformation that you start getting a headache and get confused about what this is even meant to be about.There are so many bogus claims in this, there is no ""black pyramid"" hidden beneath Alaska that can communicate with aliens. The ""Pyramid in Bosnia"" were claims that have been largely debunked as a way to promote the area as a tourist attraction. The Bosnian pyramids are a ruse by Semir Osmanagic, who hoped to bring tourists to Bosnia, and to sell books and get rich. No serious archeologist is interested in what are obviously natural geological formations.Had a laugh watching this and should only be viewed as a joke.",False
5,10,Incredibly interesting,smilkny,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love the Ancient Astronaut theory and can't get enough of it. If you feel the same, definitely give this one a watch. It was kind of nice that there was some topics discussed here that I found new and interesting.I'd never heard of the possibility of a pyramid in Alaska before, and I find LMH really credible. I'd love to see a follow up after some more investigating is done on the situation in Alaska specifically. Otherwise I enjoyed the rest, definitely plan on looking up more Mars stuff. I think there's still so much we don't know.I think this documentary was really well done, I recognized a handful of the experts and enjoyed getting to see some new ones. Fun watch! I'm going to be checking out more from this series.",False
6,9,Food For Thought,matthewdiketrust,n/a,16/08/2025,"I found this film to be very insightful. The producers methodically drive home the point of the possibility that it could be more than a coincidence that the evolution of the Earth and the species that inhabit it may have had some assistance from unknown sources. In Alaska particularly, the recent discovery of underwater fish trap that have been estimated at 10,000 years old can lead one to believe that our ancestors were smarter than we have given them credit or...maybe they receive some help? This film clearly lays out that possibility. Take a look for yourself and see if you agree. It certainly gets you thinking.",False
7,10,A power house of unique information with brilliant imaging,hlgould60,n/a,16/08/2025,The exhausting review of the available phenomena of extraterrestrial activity accompanied by the resourceful accumulation of photographic documentation was riveting and held me spellbound. The authoritative voices were convincingly presented as genuine pioneers in this strange new science. As a former USAF flight surgeon a few years ago I was subject to many reports of mystifying Ariel observations. The graphics and images were outstanding. I was amazed that there was a governmental involvement that was a serious part of the management of this subject. This film represents a major contribution to our understanding of some of the mystery of the cosmos.,False
8,9,Logical and Without Bigotry And Conspiracy Prejudice,rsirucek,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great. Documentary that explores a logical and usually denied explanation of the pyramids. As another review mentioned actual evidence of the Alaska Pyramid is pretty weak, narrated letters, but non the less it opens an interesting option that few know about and points out monuments from around the world that are rather unknown.Massive intelligent civilization hidden from current narratives, yes, built by hand tools by bonking stones together, not a chance. Glad to see this being openly described along a much broader reasoning for anomalies in the ocean, stone henge and even on Mars. Worth a Watch.",False
9,10,"Release your mind from the dark ages and follow the breadcrumbs that have existed for decades,If you dare!!!",Loccseraphin,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching now , this film is thoroughly though provoking and really a wonderful investigative journey. For an observer not be able to follow the very clear connectivity to the Pyramid's shape and orientation on the planet's energy fields is not at all smart. Ancient civilizations does not mean less advanced civilizations by any means. In fact we as a current advanced civilization are only just now rediscovering the massive energies available around us
locally and throughout the known universe. Hint: with indecipherable, buildings, technologies, pyramids and huge city structures buried miles deep and submerged in the oceans now re-emerging how can we be so arrogant and naive as to think we are the first to create any tech or constructs we conceive and call modern. Further food for thought. We must first open our minds and not limit the past based only on what we've accomplished in any aspect to date. To do so would attest to our inferiority and perhaps our repetitious and fated self destruction. The popular frame of mind that has doubtless caused us to rise repeatedly from our own demise and to once again claim that we are the first to discover, Fire, Electricity, Physics, Dimensions,Mathematics, Lasers, Language,Music, Space Travel, Magnetism, Gravity , The Wheel ( For Heaven's Sake) really!? Etc . Look deeply into the gift of this film and stretch your mind across a Cosmos of possibilities because that alone would speak to mankind being an intelligent.species.With Love

10,10,Incredible Film About One of the Great Mysteries - The Secret Pyramid,peter-b-miller,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an incredible film - one of Cybela Clare's best in my opinion - about the Alaskan secret pyramid, its origin and purpose. She provides the history of pyramids around the world and how they were used to generate and transmit power. Who built them? That is another part of the great mystery. She interviews experts who validate and elaborate on the purpose and functioning of the pyramids. The pyramids of Egypt and Mexico (and other locations) have fascinated people for thousands of years. Even though they were supposedly thoroughly explored and written about, it is possible that up until today no one has really understood exactly why they were built and what they were used for. If you have any interest in how these amazing constructions came about and what they were for, you can't miss this film. Brava Cybela!",False
11,10,Eye-Opening Experience!,nsuzuki-85566,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching ET Among Us has certainly been an eye-opening experience for many, as it allows me to explore the unknown and uncover the mysteries of life. I was amazed to discover that even in Alaska there is evidence of an ancient civilization. It always encourages me to understand why I exist and what my purpose is in this vast universe. By getting a glimpse into other phenomena that surround us, we can gain new insight into humanity's place on Earth and draw conclusions about life itself, also the inner depth of my life.This experience has led me to further explore the great mysteries of life, both past and present, which helps us uncover deeper meanings about life as we know it.",False

1,6,Decent Crime Show - Narrators Voice is Irritating!,tadted,n/a,16/08/2025,Very watchable series on solved crimes. The narrator is an actor but his over-the-top style does become irritating.,False
2,4,Ruined by awful narration,BBogus,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could be great if the horrendous narrator, sounds like a football hooligan, is replaced by a proper professional narrator and cheap, typical American, gimmicks are left out.",False
3,6,Watchable but not as captivating as other true crime shows,EPMD57,n/a,16/08/2025,"The reenactments are brief. This show instead focuses on interviews with the actual investigators, perhaps too much so. What I really don't like is that this 30 minute show covers two cases per episode, so there isn't a lot of chance to dig into a typical case. Keeping everything brief limits the likelihood of boring the audience, but it's only a moment after learning the details of the crime that they name the suspect and then solve it just as quickly. I think this really prevents the show from impacting its audience.",False
4,7,Worth watching with mixed results,catnapbc,n/a,16/08/2025,"The format of this crime series is what sets it apart from many others of the same genre. You get to see and hear the investigators and others involved in these crimes and realize that it takes determination, experience and often pure luck to solve of them. It's also apparent that not all police/investigators or criminals are possessed of high intelligence. Some of the criminals shown really need to look at other career choices and some of the police need grammar lessons, but at least they have good intentions. A different look at how many crimes are committed on a daily basis in the UK (mainly), and how many resources go into dealing with these. Mostly quite interesting, informative and yet very sad, given how many innocent lives are also affected.",False
5,1,Find a new narrator - PLEASE !!!,deashaw,n/a,16/08/2025,"The series looks interesting but I am afraid that I couldn't get past the first 5 minutes of any of them because of the narrator's EXTREMELY irritating offering.I could do much better at probaly a fraction of the cost!Until you get rid of him, the series will not be a success.",False
6,3,Interesting but very bad narration,koellis-32845,n/a,16/08/2025,"We find it very difficult to watch as the narrator has such a poor voice, it is so flat. Shame because it potentially is an interesting series. Please find someone who can actually narrate.",False
7,8,Loving this show üòç,johnwwwatson,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't care what cancel whiners are saying, this is a good show, good stories, good real detective re-enactments.My only complaint is to see criminals in the UK getting short sentences. Even if you get 10, 25 to life, they will not serve it all unless crim ate a baby and gets 75 yrs to life.",False
8,1,Who hired the narrator?,kateculshaw,n/a,16/08/2025,"Couldn't tell you if the show is good or not, as the narrator is so poor, I couldn't continue watching. The upward inflection at the end of every sentence is excrutiating. Forcing people to listen to his narration could be used as a torture technique. Worse than fingernails on a blackboard. The show's producers really need to replace him or risk losing lots of viewers.",False
9,8,Interesting Programme regarding crime,echoecho-12988,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Narrator is just not the right person to do this job, he tries to make it exciting but fails, he is good on scammers but this sort of stuff is just not right for him. Rav wilding would be better or Jamie Theakston. Please if there is another series change him to one of the 2 above. Trying to make it interesting you need a specific voice narrating to find the right audience, this just makes people laugh and switch off. It's one of those things where he is doing too many things at the moment and pops up everywhere on tele to the point you think ""not again"" a good show apart from the narrators.",False
10,2,Ruined by narrator!!,gillkarran,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really enjoyed this program but have stopped watching because of the ridiculous way the narrator speaks, trying to sound mysterious/dramatic. Please change him, or ask him to speak normally.",False
11,3,Excellent British crimes series undermined by trashy narration and slovenly presentation,stusby,n/a,16/08/2025,A poorly presented programme complete with tabloid clich√©s regurgitated by some actor and not even the date of the crimes. The police interviews are appropriately professional and compassionate which highlights even more the infantile narrator's script.Having the female police Detectives giving accounts of their investigations instead of their managers is a big bonus.Just having a retired detective (not a journalist) narrating a grown-up script would elevate this show from exploitative to informative.,False
12,1,Couldn't stand the narrator,dvg757,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gave it five minutes, the narrator is terrible and makes it unwatchable. Shame as the stories are no doubt interesting but without the proper telling, it falls flat on its face.",False
13,8,Pretty good British crime doc.,firballblaze-69689,n/a,16/08/2025,And the female investigator is SMOKING HOT WOW!!! Her lips just made me feel all fuzzy inside mmmm and she has a tongue ring on top of having very sexy lips. =D,False
14,3,Terrible narration on what could be z great series to watch.,DeniseT-51,n/a,16/08/2025,"I totally agree with other comments here. The narration is awful, completely an over the top attempt to add ""drama"". The style of speaking really is painful to listen to, grating and really annoying.Whoever decided this narrator was a good choice needs to recieve their marching orders.The plots are excellent,giving an indepth view of behind the scenes crime solving. Shows the dedication and tenacity of the police and other areas of crime detection
Could be an excellent series, and hopefully it will be continued- but with no awful narration.The narration ruins what could be a great series. Shame for the other contributors.",False
15,1,Terrible narrator. His voice style is so annoying,jaslally-68633,n/a,16/08/2025,"The whole series is lost by the terrible voice style of the narrator who is jarring to say the least. If I could watch it without sound, I would!The entire series is ruined by Chuku Modu narrating in a style which grates and irritates throughout the programme. If one person who ruin an entire series, he does it. How did nobody at the BBC realise the mistake they made. Otherwise, it would have been an enjoyable series of events based on how forces were solving crimes and taking the perpetrators to justice.its a shame they didn't arrest Chuku Modu at the end of the series for impersonating a narrator!",False
16,3,Weirdly Over Narrated,arfajob,n/a,16/08/2025,The content and the stories are very good but FFS stop the over narrating. It sounds so strange and almost makes a serious subject comical. It's like he's swallowed an 'Over Dramatic' pill. The Over. Long. Pauses. Between. Words. Is. Also. Very Off. PuttingI can't imagine what the casting lot were thinking but they can't have listening.Why do IMBD insist on so many characters?Why do IMBD insist on so many characters?Why do IMBD insist on so many characters?Why do IMBD insist on so many characters?The End. The End The End The End the end of the story and it was really good and I think.,False
17,1,Worst narration,jjane-56242,n/a,16/08/2025,"The programme itself is fine,but Chuku Modu 's narrative is the absolute worst ever. He seems to adopt a ridiculous intonation, stressing the wrong words in the wrong places. I am surprised the programme producers haven't identified this as an issue. Modu is irritating, over the top, immature and appears to try and copy his American counterparts, who do the job much better than he does. Its a shame he doesn't seem able to speak properly, he ruins the enjoyment of what could have been a decent show. Shall not be watching this any more, unless of course the narrator is changed. Don't jeopardise the whole programme for the sake of bad narration.",False
18,1,Can't stand the narration,pjranderson,n/a,16/08/2025,"The investigation process is interesting but I can't watch it because of the narration, it's terrible and just spoils the whole story. Sorry but that needs to be changed, doesn't seem like I'm alone either!",False
19,3,Over use of our-of-focus camera work,jereth-284-123075,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not the narrator that makes this programme aggravating - it's the blurred out images he talks over. Obviously blurring images to protect identities or even locations is crucial for a crime show. But... just about every library shot image and almost all reconstructions, are blurred. That means about half of the programme is blurred. Things like a close-up of a hedge, random rooftops, gloved hands, etc. It's pointless and really aggravating; making you strain your eyes to work out what the image is. I know the current trend is to blur images but this one goes too far. If that stopped, I think it's a well put together programme and some of the ire directed at the narrator would stop.",False

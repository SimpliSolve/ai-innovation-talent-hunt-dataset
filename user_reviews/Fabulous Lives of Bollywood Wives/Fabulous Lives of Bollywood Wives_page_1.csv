1,5,Two words......Potty mouth ðŸš½,jagsembi,n/a,15/08/2025,"If this is number 9 on Netflix, I'm going back to Prime video.",False
2,3,The fabulous life of Bollywood's *broke* wives,vincinnum,n/a,15/08/2025,"One question- who are these people? Most of them are neither rich nor famous. I would love to watch fabulous lives of people WHO MATTER, but I'm sure they won't let Netflix peek into their private lives for a few bucks.
Karan Johar probably made this series to help these poor people earn some money for the first time in a long time.",False
3,3,"Disgusting, Crap, Pathetic",VeekeyBharti,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is outright disgusting to the core. Who are these people? This is all sham, show-off and buffoonery. They can't even point out on map where is Paris, and what's with all fake accents. Padhe likhe ganwaars. Bollywood is not about such fake creeps, these @$$hol*s should rightfully be banned from everywhere",False
4,1,Wo bhai ...kya dekh liya mein..maro mujhe maro..maro ...,bipinbdk,n/a,15/08/2025,Pathetic ..don't even want to write any review for this.. disgusting...brainless karan johar..why Netflix is publishing his content ..oh God..horrible...better avoid..sadak 2 is better than this...,False
5,1,disgusting.,santaclaus-18476,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTRASH (yes thats the spoiler, its trash) This is horrendous. The fact that KJO attempted to justify nepotism and ""prove"" that their lives can also be ""difficult"" is just shameful. How privileged do you have to be, to have the audacity to complain about your stacks of money. Especially after EVERYTHING that went down in Bollywood. Its the ignorance for me. This show goes to prove that Bollywood is NEVER changing and will forever continue to function in its disorderly manner. So shameful and not to mention how annoying their voices get after 10 minutes of watching the horrendous thing.",True
6,2,Not a Karan Johar Hater but...,avneet-15775,n/a,15/08/2025,"I'm not sorry to say that this show is so rubbish. The women are trying to act like western Teenagers. I have only seen the first episode and I can truly say how very disappointing it was. You may have wealth but the reflection of these women are far from that. They are acting like Wannabees for no reason from the hideous ""designer"" outfits to trying to be like the Kardashians. When will India come up with something original? Show us wives that love Indian food, love dressing in Indian attire, proudly show off the Indian culture ... Just expected something different.",False
7,1,Worse than the worse Botox job,abanfelavia,n/a,15/08/2025,TBH they actually revealed their totally lack lustre lives. And No amount of injections or attempts at cobbing fake accents can take away how miserable they are . Obvious disconnect with Kids and failed marriages .money soaked in under handed dealsWhy doesn't NETFLIX use their professional jurisdiction and Sift out this useless OTT content,False
8,1,All fake,reemarathee,n/a,15/08/2025,Super IRRITATING....All super fake. Karan Johar has no content so just try to glorify Bollywood. There should be an option of negative rating which hands down goes to this show,False
9,n/a,Horrible,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,I thought there were brown people in India. As a brown girl with indian heritage...where are the BROWN people of India??????,False
10,9,Totally unexpected,dsgiselle,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was expecting awful fights, drama and the usual gossip that comes with the ""wives of"" series and other reality shows. This one pleasantly depicts long lasting friendships and make you envious of their inner circle! Love their dynamic, and I think it's what made me come back to the episodes (not so much the fashion or anything else). Also love little glimpses into rest of their families.Karan perhaps tries a little too hard with the QA sessions vs something a little more free flowing but the ladies are top notch - Maheep, Bhavana, and Seema that is.Neelam- is she really like that? God what a bore. Such a sheltered grown ass baby. The woman version of a ""man child"". She really comes off like she has done no personal development since she was 15 and started in the industry. Very vanilla and stuck in the 80s. She's only got her looks going for her. Thank goodness she addressed her accent early on, cause even that was cringe.Can't wait for season 3!",False
11,1,OMG why?,roshanahluwalia-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"Please stay away. Cringefest, fake accents, why Karan johar why?",False
12,10,Must watch,patelanindita,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wonderful web series, finished it fastest. So glamorous and stylish. Everyone was awesome. Besides Maheep, Seema, Neelam and Bhavana, I loved Ananya, Shanaya and Gauri Khan too. Can't get over it. Looking forward for Season 2.",False
13,7,Unwarranted hate.,sanjaynair1995,n/a,15/08/2025,"I can feel why the show would feel pretentious and the mannerisms lethargic, but it's because we the middle class have not walked in their shoes and the way they talk can be attributed to the people they interact with on a daily basis , we all live in our own bubble and our social interactions are a reflection of that . I felt like the people in the show at their core were normal people who have their own insecurities and struggles , happy and sad days , have their own set of goals and aspirations , just because it don't match the way we look at life doesn't warrant the hate we are sprewing ,guys wealth alone can't make a person happy,abt the whole nepotism debate a parent who is successful at his/her profession be it at any field will only encourage their children to get into it the same right, agreed this will mean the real talented and hardworking people will lose their place in such a flawed system , but we do know bollywood is just another money making business and very few have the magnanimity to recognise talents and take risks on them , our institutions are never know to promote talent , coming back to the show this is definitely not the greatest out there and certainly not the worst , I skipped through most of it as it as a lot of it was not relatable to me , but the general gist of it didn't make me want to throw up or troll them as I came here expecting to see rich people showboating but I was surprised to see much more in it .",False
14,2,Fake,rehmankhilji,n/a,15/08/2025,"As movies are fake, this show / series show how fake the people are and their families. Its a show about some Bollywood celebrities spouses with fake life style to fake accents to fake living.
All the main lead spouses never had good screen presences and not very successful with their movies. This show, backed by Karan Johar which i have no idea what was he trying to achieve is a ridiculous attempt copying other reality shows. All four claims to be best of friends for many years and in the show contradicting their own statements by being surprised to everything that happens, showing in reality they are meeting for the very first time.
A complete waste of time and nothing more.",False
15,1,Pathetic,nidhijoshi-64702,n/a,15/08/2025,Honestly couldnot watch after 15 mins. It's horrendous n the fake accents. Please kjo stay away from Netflix hi,False
16,1,Worthless parasites,siddharth311,n/a,15/08/2025,"Here comes stories of more worthless wanna bees of that dump called Bollywood. Makers of this show should be asked to clean toilets for years. These had been ugly souled women sold
Their souls to the lowest bidder, can see in their faces.",False
17,1,Middle aged mothers think swearing is so cool,hdegun,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was appalled when I watched this show with the family and could not believe what I was hearing. Wannabe celebrities thinking that four letter swear words are cool and a mark of well to do people - well I'm sorry to say it is not!!
And these are mothers !!!",False
18,1,low budget copy of Kardashians,pankajairbnb,n/a,15/08/2025,"If show is being targetted for Indian audience, it should have been in hindi instead of fake English accent.
If show is targetted for NRIs, I think NRIs have much better content to watch on Netflix.
Its a low budget copy of Kardashians show.",False
19,1,Torture and so much cringe,vluckylkv,n/a,15/08/2025,I am going to sue Netflix for the mental harassment caused by this show.No wonder starkids turns out to be arrogant and stupid when they are raised by parents like these..Save yourselves from this pandemic,False
20,n/a,Crappiest thing i have seen in my life,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"No Indian can ever relate with the irritating lifestyle shown in this series
They are just capitalising our hate so that they can make money from it also
DISGUSTING ........ðŸ™…ðŸ™… I want to request everyone to rate this series 1 ðŸŒŸ",False
21,10,"Classy, But The General Public Won't Appreciate",arjun-57079,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's beautifully directed, a really out of the box idea and extremely professionally executed. Class written all over it.Well educated, fab English speaking Bollywood families, raising their kids in the perfect manner.There's tonnes to learn from this and appreciate. I want to congratulate the whole team for creating a ""worth every minute"" kind of programme.We live in the UK and we enjoyed it very much.Unfortunately, in the same breath I can understand how the masses may not appreciate it. It needs a certain class to appreciate it.Thanks again guys, and good luck for the future ones.",False
22,1,Total Bakwaas,pbhattest,n/a,15/08/2025,"The name should should not be 'Fabulous Lives oF Bollywood' to 'Fake lives of Bunch of unsuccessful people'They are not even close to Bollywood. Who are these ppl. Public don't even know these ladies ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜‚Anyways and sorry to add Neelam was never and good actress and she did not have any career on Bollywood and acting ðŸ˜œ.
This is all about promoting there Brands as ppl don't know them.
The total Bakwaas it was.",False
23,10,review,rinaadhikari,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched the series and honestly felt the need to write about it. I have seen some reality shows of the US. The housewives of Beverly Hills etc. They try to show friendship but its always cold. This show somehow gives you warmth. If you compare it to Hollywood based reality shows, this is way better. As a mother who is working I felt good that these women being a mother and wives are also having fun",False
24,6,A binge watch with already tasted masala,potdararpit,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you have three-four hours of no work and outside world seems boring, you can choose to see this. It is a Indian Masala Sex & the city. There is nothing so fabulous about their live that you will want to watch, but this series may feel like a guilty pleasure for many. I have no complaints wasting my time to this. You can also finish some boring office work watching this, you can easily divert your attention without losing any bit of this series (it isn't that tough to catch up).",False
25,1,Karan Johar and GANG is just full of cheaters and nepo products..they can't think good because u need good heart for good thought,sonikaprashant,n/a,15/08/2025,When I see karan JOHAR ..I couldn't bear his face..

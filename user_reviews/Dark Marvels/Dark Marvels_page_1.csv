1,10,Dark Marvelous!,smishyb,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is such an epic show. I binged it in one sitting. It showcases the sadistic genius of humanity, detailing who, when, how and why some of the darkest inventions were thought up and brought to life. Not for the faint of heart, but full of history and even some legend, weapons, torture devices, rockets etc all had an origin and a purpose. This series is truly captivating, while detailing history, the brilliance of even the earliest weapons, the reverse engineering that furthered the advanced weaponry we see today and in some ways, shows how far we have come from the dark ages, which were filled with torture devices, used for the slightest misstep. I highly recommend taking the time to watch this!",False

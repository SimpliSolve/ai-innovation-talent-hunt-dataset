1,n/a,"Thoughtful, informative, provocative and tender",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film opened up London in new ways - pavements, spaces, estates, guarding became inflected with a poignancy of perspectives into unseen lives and longings, of parallel needs for freedom, justice and understanding. Full of compassion and a desire to expand and extend awareness into how power and prejudice continue to operate and be missed and misunderstand by main stream narratives. Through closeness with characters I found myself moved - prized open, the films fullness (shots, music, editing, overall construction) bringing light and insight to the layers and complexities of lived lives , sore hearts and human connection . Thank you .",False
2,10,"A compelling, beautiful film about a community under threat",matthewthomasbutcher,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a beautiful film in many ways - weaving a compelling story about a community of bikers whose rides are under threat from overpolicing, and set in the context of a public realm under sustained and brutal attack from the government. There's serious political purpose to the film but the story doesn't feel obvious or overdone. Instead we meet characters who we quickly love - and come away reminded of how communities in this country have been abandoned, and how they have resourced themselves to fightback. If you do get a chance to watch this film, grab it, or else wait until it's on the BBC in the Autumn, when it's sure to create a lot of noise.",False
3,10,A wonderful insight into a community being marginalised.,icgrantpeterkin,n/a,15/08/2025,"From the beautiful cityscapes to the arousing scenes of amazing bike stunts this docu film has it all. A tale of David and Goliath (bikestormz and police/ public opinion) with a great insight into the urgent need for safe space for youth to express themselves and enjoy some freedom from the oppression of life situations. A great soundtrack and very personal moments seeing into the life and struggle and joyous breakthroughs of Mac, Mylo and others. As London builds shopping centre after shopping centre and gated community encroach on open spaces ever more where is the space for anyone who just wants to explore and express themselves.Definitely worth a watch and discuss after.",False
4,10,Amazing Documentary,hughgp-59109,n/a,15/08/2025,"Inspiring, moving, beautiful and important. This is one evey Londoner should watch but also for anyone interested in bikestormz, city spaces and young people. It is not an action movie but ... it has heroes: people fighting so hard to stay on the side of goodness, righteousness and kindness. It is not an action movie but... it has some amazing stunts, hair-raising at times, heart in your mouth craziness. But, at its core it is a film about how and whether we can live together, reaching out across divides, sharing spaces and understanding. Also, don't forget the epic soundtrack and amazing moves!",False

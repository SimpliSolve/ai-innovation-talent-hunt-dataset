1,10,Incredible and unbelievable story and hero law enforcement. I am in awe!,kfboyde,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI watch lots of crime stories but this is the most amazing one I've ever seen. I cried and had to throw up but I had to finish it because of those dedicated law enforcement people who did what so few of us could ever do and probably at such personal cost to find justice for this family. They are the true heroes. And to know that evil often spawns evil. So sad that the parents were still alive to discover the truth of what really happened. So, so sad.",True

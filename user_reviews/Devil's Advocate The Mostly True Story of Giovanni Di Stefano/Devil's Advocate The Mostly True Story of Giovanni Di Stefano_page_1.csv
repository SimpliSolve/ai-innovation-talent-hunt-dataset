1,7,A interesting life story told well.,speedracerisdaman,n/a,16/08/2025,"Giovanni Di Stefano was one of the most publicity hungry fraudsters that the world has had opportunity to be entertained and shocked to find out that he was a money hungry fraudster who ripped off many regular people who needed his help.I can't but help admire in strange way those who take the concept of 'fake it until you make it' to the next level to live absolutely wild lives.Giovanni directed his intellect and narcissism towards being a fake lawyer. He turned out to be a really good one that defended the likes of Manuel Noriega, Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosevic and more than once self proclaiming himself as the lawyer of few high profile cases simply to gain notoriety and media attention.Why he needed to steal and cheat people even though he could earn a great living as a lawyer, shows how deeply greedy and without conscious people of his disposition are.The film production was high quality, the creative approach of having the story told from Giovanni's perspective (using an actor) made you feel at least like you were getting a taste of his personality and reflection on his own life.The great detective work done to bring Giovanni down, basically by a sole UK detective was just as interesting and keeps you invested to find out how he is finally caught and faced justice.",False
2,1,The actor's voice ðŸ™„,garylarkey,n/a,16/08/2025,"The actor's voice is wrong from the start. Get him on children's telly. What we're the casting people and director thinking? I found it irritating, switched off after two minutes. Internet Movie Data Base want at least one hundred and fifty characters for this opinion so I'm still spouting over here.",False

1,8,Proud day in American history,keithdailey-48525,n/a,17/08/2025,A little slow with so much detail in the beginning. By the second half of the film I was on the edge of my seat.,False
2,7,About the killing itself with not too much background info,JurijFedorov,n/a,17/08/2025,"It's one of those flashy modern documentaries. After 6 minutes we already have the Afghanistan war underway. A minute later we are already in the bin Laden hunt. CIA gathering intelligence, the military paying for any info so they get a ton of people just handing them random info. Later a bin Laden courier is followed, via camera, into a compound. The compound doesn't even have children and women leaving the house. The car drives into an area, then the gate closes and another gate inside the compound opens. So that no one can look in at any point. It overall is extremely secure and owned by 2 poor brothers who cannot afford it. It's quite clear it's where bin Laden lives. It could only have been him.Especially the operation itself is really cool. I recommend everyone to watch it. We get details about the planning. 25 senior special forces train for 3 weeks. They build a replica compound so that they can train in it. In the mission itself a helicopter crashes because the pilots expected a lower temperature and didn't quite care to measure the actual temperature in the region of look up actual Pakistan data. They just guessed, and lo and behold their guess was very wrong. The operation itself is full of 3D recreations and the people who did the various stuff often talk about what they did. Of course some of the people there weren't interviewed. Like, we don't learn who actually shot bin Laden or why. He was just dead on the floor. This great miss illustrates just how many holes this doc still has. It should have been a series lasting 4-5 hours at least. Going over each little detail. What we get here is a rushed doc not even telling us who shot bin Laden or why while all the other shootings are clearly explained and shown in 3D. We also don't understand why they are just shooting people who are not shooting at them or brandishing weapons. They don't shoot women and kids, but any man in the compound is killed. Why? Because they are seen as terrorists and therefore bad guys? It's not explained.The 3D graphics are what you need to watch it for. It's just super cool to see the outside and inside of the compound and even a few shootings and then the helicopter landings. Don't miss it!Overall it's a fast to the point doc with maps, 3D graphics, illustrations of everything, interviews with the people involved even Obama. But of course we are left with many more questions. What happened to bin Laden's wives they found in the compound? What did they do with his DNA? How sure are they it was bin Laden? 100% sure? How many special forces soldiers later revealed their identity? Why was bin Laden shot and not captured alive? How did Pakistan respond? Who got mad about it? How did the Muslim community react? What did they find in the compound? With so many questions remaining, that you can easily look up online, I think this doc is a weak overall affair info wise. But it's a fun watch. I now am curious about what actually happened.",False
3,6,Little new information,outpix,n/a,17/08/2025,Lots of retread video & story that has been seen before.,False
4,9,Interesting.,zippocs,n/a,17/08/2025,A good reprecentation of what occured in the finding of OBL. Found the documentary informative and entertaining. I leave the politics to others.,False
5,10,Gutsy Move by the Obama Administration,leftbanker-1,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is an excellent, step-by-step account of how the United States intelligence services first tracked down, and then eliminated Osama Bin Laden. Was it worth the money and effort? I would say that it wasn't, but it certainly showed the effectiveness of our intelligence agencies and their military extensions.One aspect of the hunt for OBL that always troubled me was the debacle at FOB Chapman. How did the CIA allow that to happen? How could they have screwed up so desperately? Seven dead and many more injured. Why wasn't the guy searched first? The whole crew just standing around waiting for him. It just seems like a screw up of titanic proportions.With the security people behind a blast wall, they could've asked the guy to get out of the vehicle and show what was under his robes. The absolutely should have known better at that point in the game.",False
6,n/a,Completely at odds with facts from Obama era officials and ignores the constant hesitation by Obama,n/a,n/a,17/08/2025,"Amazing mendacious and certainly not a ""documentary."" The fact is senior Intelligence officials from the era were amazed at how the Obama administration slow walked this and lost several earlier opportunities to take out Bin Laden.",False
7,2,Delusional 'truth',ajk-75755,n/a,17/08/2025,Besides the interesting hunt. There is no truth here. The motives and true orchestrators of 9/11 certainly arent looked at.,False
8,1,Big part is fiction,rolfhu,n/a,17/08/2025,"The US government, FBI and others still don't release all documents. What they HIDE?",False

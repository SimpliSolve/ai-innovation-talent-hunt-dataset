1,8,Well Worth Seeing!,paulwetor,n/a,16/08/2025,"I knew who May Pang was and what the Lost Weekend was, so I wondered what filler they could throw together to make an entire documentary. Boy was I wrong! This is a top-notch story that is engrossing from start to finish. It has archival footage and interviews that flesh out the time period of May's Yoko-ordered time with John.Her photos may be mere Polaroids but they document a personal side of their time together. Julian Lennon gets to participate as well. May seemed to have been a beneficial part of rejoining him with John. There's a 1974 photo shown of Julian and his crush Jodie Foster. I've never seen such a happy smile like the one he's wearing.There are also details of May Pang's upbringing, which was not easy. Though this film is aimed at John Lennon fans, I also like it as a time capsule of the 1970s. Not only does it show George Harrison on the Dick Cavett Show, it even shows May sitting in the audience.We think of the Beatles living in England after the breakup, yet they crossed paths in the United States quite often. This film is a vital piece of Beatles history.",False
2,10,A Must See for any Beatle/John Lennon fan. You'll walk away with new found respect for May Pang!,jeripalumbo-48331,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Lost Weekend: A Love Story
(Author, @Jeri Palumbo /Music Connection)Vortex. Love. Icon. These terms came to mind as I was glued to every detail of The Lost Weekend: A Love Story. This is not your ordinary documentary. Nor is it a reinvention of the same story.Vortex: ""A whirling mass....that sucks everything near it toward its center....drawing in... all that surrounds it.."". There's no question that in the nearly 60 years since the onset of The Beatles, that anything and everything related has fascinated the masses to a seriously refined degree. Musicians. Historians. Producers. Engineers. Critics. You name it. Stories get told and retold over and over. The Beatle vortex is alive and well to this day. But imagine, if you can, what it might be like to be THEM. Or THEIR families. Or THEIR love interests, dead center in that vortex???As I watched May Pang tell HER story (and it's finally HER story, not years of retold heresay and diatribes), what struck me was this young, strong ""anchor"" thrown into the middle of chaos. Into the biggest vortex there is. As her childhood backstory is told, it becomes clear why she was so strong and resilient. Clear eyed at such a young age, she stitched Lennon's personal life together in a beautiful patchwork from the frayed pieces he inadvertently created (reunited with his son Julian, ex wife Cynthia, and McCartney). He was incredibly prolific and creative during this time, called ""The Lost Weekend"" (#9 Dream, Mind Games, Whatever Gets You Through the Night). Surprisingly, May's association with the Lennons goes WAY back further into the history of the Beatles than you might know, which is highlighted in this doc (like during the Imagine sessions). Even more complex was the situation in which May was thrown. Working for two bosses who, along with their own growing personal conflicts, eventually are giving conflicting orders to May. Micro vortex in the middle of a GIANT vortex.Enter the towering figure and fascinating presence of Lennon. No matter where you are in the world, you know who he is. Whatever he did, good or bad, the vortex followed. And sometimes the story told, and retold, isn't always correct. This is a refreshingly, new look at Lennon's life from the eyes and direct experience of May Pang. In HER words from HER lens on iconic moments in music history (including his time w Harry Nilsson, the Phil Spector sessions and more), May had a front seat in this vortex and the stories she tells are fascinating. In a twist of fate, she also became the centerpiece of Lennon's love and admiration. The telling of this love story was as compelling and beautiful as it was complicated, and at times what I might imagine to be, devastating with no closure or answers.While it might be easy to judge, in the end, these were real people trying to navigate life with the craziest deck of cards, dealt in the middle of a vortex not of their choosing. People are complex. Childoods are complex. Relationships are complex. Life is complex. Every decision affects everything else. And so forth.Age does not always equate to maturity (as is evident by the alcohol infused antics at the Troubadour. Then again, there was alcohol). May was the voice of reason in the middle of chaos with the most iconic legend of our time while simultaneously maintaining a love relationship with that legend. I can't imagine anyone else walking through that vortex of fire unscathed. Yet here she is. While we will always have the ""what ifs"" with Lennon, (what if he had lived?), this was a refreshingly new ""piece of fabric"" sown by May into the Beatle's historical tapestry. ""And in the end"" of the documentary, was a beautiful way to tie it all together. A new layer of that (Glass) Onion.....if you will. (Puns, very intended)A must see for any Beatle fan or historian.Jeri Palumbo

3,10,The Lost Weekend: A Love Story,mstarmm,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was a young busy ""breaking my way into the world"" girl during this era and didn't follow John Lennon at all. This beautifully done documentary brought me TOTALLY in to the life of John, his breakup with Yoko, his relationship with Julian, and his life saving love story with May Pang. She was vibrant and a bright light. I found myself shaking my head at times, laughing out loud and wiping tears...I really enjoyed the film. May Pang and Julian... you're wonderful! RIP John.My husbands review:
""It was a well done documentary that gave good insight into the relationships of John Lennon.""",False
4,10,This documentary will pull at your heartstrings. A must see!,rocknreelproductions,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky to see a viewing of : The Lost Weekend: A Love Story. It's a beautiful documentary following the young May Pang who started as an assistant at Apple Records, moving into a personal assistant position for John Lennon and Yoko Ono. It is a very compelling, raw, sincere story of a young woman who was lightyears beyond her young age of 22. May Pang was instrumental in helping John to have a relationship with his son Julian. May had a special bond with John that I feel helped him immensely. It is extremely well done. I credit May Pang and her producers/directors Eve Brandstein, Richard Kaufman and Stuart Samuels for creating a masterpiece.I highly recommend it!",False
5,10,"An Intimate, Revelatory Look at a Legendary Romance",mcohen-02207,n/a,16/08/2025,"At a pivotal point in John Lennon's post-Beatles life, May Pang was at his side, and the story of their relationship has been the subject of much gossip and speculation. In The Lost Weekend: A Love Story, May takes an affectionate and unsparing look back at this period. Whatever you think you know about Lennon in the early '70s, his music, his escapades, his circle of friends and colleagues, The Lost Weekend goes much deeper. A fascinating and emotional document.",False
6,10,The Lost Weekend: A Love Story Is a Must See!,gaylellnyc,n/a,16/08/2025,The Lost Weekend: A Love Story is an amazing film and May Pang is an amazing woman. As a huge Beatles / John Lennon fan I thought I knew the story. I did not! The Lost Weekend: A Love Story is compelling and beautiful and sincere - as is May Pang herself. And the archival materials!!! Don't even get me started. I highly recommend The Lost Weekend: A Love Story.,False
7,5,The Lost Weekend: The Mai Ping biography,expressaf,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis doc had been pushed back so many times I almost gave up searching for a release date. Finally here it is!It took me 3 attempts to watch this without falling asleep. The Lost Weekend: a scrapbook story. Is set to countless b roll and montages to describe the scene with Mai's dreadful voiceover.Most of the footage and inside information are common knowledge and old knews to any Beatles fan.However, some information I wasn't aware of were Mai's contributions to John's solo career. The entire doc aims to single out just that. Singling out each achievement she accomplished while sleeping with her employer.You don't see present day Mai until the final Few moments of the doc.I was befuddled a bit by her explanation of their breakup and remember her briefly mentioning how Yoko may have used hypnosis on John when he was trying to quit smoking...
There's quite a bit of Yoko bashing so I can see why the production took as long as it did.In conclusion, it's a tough doc to watch with not much pay off for your time.",True
8,10,The not-so-'Lost Weekend' is a nostalgic joy!,dachshundia,n/a,16/08/2025,"The 97-minutes fly by as May Pang (with a little help from her friends) shares her memories of not only her 18-month relationship with John Lennon, but the actual 10-year relationship they had. Lennon actually hints at things to come when, on the Dick Cavett Show in 1971, he (twice) name-checked Pang (one of two people who were brought on stage covered in full-length bags) as 'looking lovely.' I was amazed by the amount of never-before-seen footage and interviews. It's a stunning documentary that is so personal it almost seems like a home movie. A must see.",False
9,10,If You Love Music You'll Love This Love Story!,rickthomasmediarich,n/a,16/08/2025,"And I learned a lot from Lost Weekend as well!As a music lover of all genres Lost Weekend hits it out of the ballpark. And if you're a Beatles fan and a music fan you will enjoy the behind the scenes look at the group. But of most importance the incredible relationship between John Lennon and May Pang. Watching the old school footage and images that May presents makes the movie so much more real and enjoyable.It's as if you're really there!Every element of the story has excitement and passion. And you learn a lot of new things about how the music was made, where the music was played, who worked within and around this legend and legendary band called The Beatles. But from May Pang's perspective.All you want to get out of a movie like this is something new. And you get it from The Lost Weekend: A Love Story. Definitely a 10!",False
10,10,May Pang Tells Her Story,joanlevyhepburn,n/a,16/08/2025,"In a world of exploitative gossip it is a challenge to reveal a personal life story, especially when it involves the lives of the iconically famous. There is also an expectation of privacy among members of the inner circle. May Pang was put into the spotlight of scrutiny and speculation by circumstance, and her public personna was skewed by hearsay in the media. This gave May the right to tell her own story as history.In her documentary she shares personal information about her background, setting the psychological and situational landscape that led her to an unexpected life experience. Despite her youth - her innate intelligence, compassion, and decency navigated her through the complicated demands of her position. The documentary is a heartfelt and quite personal truth that opens a view through the veil of secrecy - just enough to tastefully share her story.",False
11,10,"Wow, I never knew. What an amazing documentary",Lolarobot,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm still in shock. Yoko told a narrative of John cheating. Now the truth is that it was arranged and 2 beautiful souls fell in love. A couple meant to be together as is illustrated by May. Everything was so craftily produced. The collaborations. The vacations, the love, the music. The deep and raw emotions of May and John. Oh how different his life would have been without the overbearing and dictatorial nature of Yoko. I despise her all over again. I remember the day John died. I wish he had the strength and fortitude to have finally rid of Yoko. Thank you May for sharing this beautiful and poignant story.",True
12,10,May and John were total soulmates,lovintouch,n/a,16/08/2025,"The wild life in the early 70's in New York City must of been such an amazing place to be with the magic of May being in the right place at the right time.May had a life full of open doors as if all the stars were aligned just waiting for her to shine.An incredible and very interesting story of her life that left me feeling sad that May and John didn't stay together forever since she truly was his passion and soulmate.May brought out the very best in John. A wonderful piece of rock and roll history told by the who were right there.Thank you May for sharing surrounded by rock and roll royalty, you must of had one one heck a time!!",False
13,10,Wonderfully done!!! Watch and you will be amazed!,angelasartarea,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a wonderful documentary! Thanks for sharing it! I must admit that it opened my eyes to a lot of issues that I oddly enough already questioned. Although the story was wonderful, I tend to think that emotions for those you see everyday form relationships. The question is what sort of relationship it will turn out to be. What is meant to be, is meant to be. 😊 There is of course sex just for sex but making love is a whole different ball game. Making love takes having the ability to feel and to use your body as a tool. To be able to make love, you need the bond that is needed to create it. Otherwise, it is simply meaningless sex. I never thought of John Lennon that way, so this was very interesting. Those are moments that I'm sure May will never forget though. I have absolutely no doubt that John wouldn't want her to either. They spent those years together and that's something nobody can ever take away. This made me think even more of Julian Lennon. I must admit, he must be a strong individual. It made me want to give him a hug. All in all, this was wonderfully done. I highly recommend it!",False
14,10,"This film is a ""Must have"" for any John Lennon/Beatles fan!",rikbloom-115-127800,n/a,16/08/2025,"""The Lost weekend: A Love Story"" is worth viewing/owning; because despite what you've already heard/read; it is a very honest, down to earth account of John Lennon's life with May Pang. The film quality is excellent as well as the sound.(DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1) I can see why this relationship worked, and I have my own ideas about why it might have failed as well. For me personally the most interesting parts, in the film are about May Pang's early years growing up in New York City, up to the start of her relationship with John Lennon. Her total sincerity towards the end of the film is quite touching. A lot of fantastic music was created that otherwise might not have been, if it wasn't for May Pang's relationship with John. Oddly enough, put out by a company that still pays me a monthly pension ""Universal Pictures Home Entertainment"" For the twenty plus years I put in with them. (Thank You for that!) This film is a ""Must have"" for any John Lennon/Beatles fan!",False
15,10,May Pang a healing force,hooliganjr-01410,n/a,16/08/2025,"A beautifully made film that gets to the heart of May's contribution to John's productivity & humanity. The degree to which she helped mend fences among John, Cynthia & Julian has been spoken about through the years, but Julian's presence in the film brings legitimacy to that long-held claim. The film is a Beatles/Lennon must for sure, but the warm human interest elements were most important for me. Essential to understanding the Yoko legacy. Fabulous production values, truly fab there is so much video and photography to draw from. Will be watching it again soon! And I really loved hearing about the jam session that included John and Paul and Stevie Wonder!",False

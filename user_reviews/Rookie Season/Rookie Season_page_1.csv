1,9,Captivating; Exhilarating,cmbathena,n/a,16/08/2025,"A captivating and exhilarating view into the world of car racing. Had me gripping the edge of my seat during the racing sequences. Great portrayal of the inner workings of a racecar team, and all that goes into preparing for a motorsport race, and getting to the finish line.",False
2,8,A different kind of documentary,speedysm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Caught this film in theaters, and again on amazon recently, and man did it deliver both times. As a sports fan who's not too big into cars I wasn't sure quite what to expect. But I was blown away by all the action from start to finish. While I didn't understand everything racing related, I didn't ever feel lost. Overall it felt a lot more like watching a narrative film to me than a documentary, which I really liked. Watching people sit in chairs talking to the camera has always been a pet peeve of mine, but there was none of that here. They used voices only to narrate it, and it was kind of a fly on the wall style of filming that made you feel like you were right there with the team. Overall I highly recommend this to anyone into sports and competition or if you're looking for an alternatively filmed and edited documentary!",False
3,10,Exhilarating. Unique. Fast-paced. So much fun!,henry-32967,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a race fan, so this film was already at 5 stars before even walking into the theater. From the moment it started, I felt like I was IN the race car- but the most incredible part of the whole film was the feeling that I was involved in each decision the driver made! Every turn. Every gear shift. Every high-speed straightaway. This experience made Rookie Season fly by. I recommend seeing this film on iTunes and other streaming platforms.",False
4,10,"Incredible sound, pacing and action",riverjournal,n/a,16/08/2025,I've been drawn to motorsports since childhood. I've had the opportunity to work professionally photographing both racecar and motorcycle racing here in the US and in Europe as well.Watching Rookie Season transports one into the race car itself and as a co-driver you get a sense of speed and daring that still photography cannot approach. Not only are the sounds of a throaty V8 Camaro captured over an entire season you get to know and appreciate the crew and drivers that make or break a season.Rookie Season is great storytelling and the Rebel Rock Racing Team's efforts are vividly portrayed across the screen. It's a spot-on film for race fans and those who would like to see what racing is about. Hats off to the filmmaker.,False
5,10,OPENED MY EYES,turbocarzfun,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not necessarily a huge racing person (was brought by my friend), but boy was I exhilarated the entire time watching this wonderful movie. Storytelling is great, and the decisions by the filmmaker in *how* to tell these stories and TAKE US INSIDE THE CARS during some serious nail-biting race sequences really opened my eyes to this amazing sport.If you like the F1 docs on Netflix, or you have even the slightest interest in fun, fast-paced documentary, this movie is a GREAT use of 90ish minutes.MUCH APPROVE. THANK YOU V MUCH!",False
6,1,Boredom is the best word to describe this,colewaters,n/a,16/08/2025,"I haven't walked out of a theater in a very long time, until tonight. I love nascar so I was hoping to enjoy this, but instead I absolutely hated it. There was nothing interesting about this documentary, unless you think hearing a guy talk for 72 minutes is entertaining. I love documentaries if they are interesting and this was far from that.I don't recommend this documentary unless you want to be put to sleep and tired the rest of your night, because I was fully awake before the movie, but 15 minutes in I was tired. So don't waste your time watching Rookie Season. If I was able to give it 0 stars I would.Score 1/10.",False
7,10,The realest race story,dannycarioca,n/a,16/08/2025,"Rookie Season gives you the speed, grit and thrill of being inside Rebel Rock's beast of a Chevrolet Camaro GT4 during IMSA's Sports Car Championship. It also gives us a rare inside look at the driving force of motor sports, the humans behind a race team operation. We get to experience driver Rob Lidell's struggles and triumphs, the fight and frustration, the sheer cojones it takes to hang in the race world. We also get to witness the totally unique ""gentleman driver"" experience with owner/driver Frank Depew! It's a wild season man, roller coaster. You really feel that in every straightaway, every turn, every pit stop, everything is on the line. Aside from the awesome jet-engine-like sound of the car, badass overtakes and sweet behind the scenes moments, in the voice overs by Lidell the documentary gives us a human experience too. Heart-pumping and heart-felt. Highly recommend it!",False
8,10,Great Series,theteaparty-78351,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really enjoyed this one! It shines a light on one of America's best racing series that a lot of people might not be familiar with. The behind the scenes footage, in the pits, the in car video, all awesome. The race at Road America in the rain was epic! Well done! I need to order a Rebel Rock racing hat now haha. Really hope we get a follow up to this series. And after watching this you will want to go to the track and watch an IMSA race, at least that's how I feel. I've always wanted to go to one, I'm not that far from Watkins Glen and always wanted to go to their 6hr race. I think you'll enjoy this one if your a motor sports fan in general.",False
9,10,What a fun ride!,aimeediane,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a unique documentary in the way it is told and the footage that is provided. It is a fun ride and really takes us into the world of racing, providing relatable characters and a exciting element of drama.",False

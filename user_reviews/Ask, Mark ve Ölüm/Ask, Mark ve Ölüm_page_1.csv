1,8,Good documentation about the development of Turkish music in Germany combined with the general situation of (German-)Turkish people over the decades in Germany,hannesskibba,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary follows the development of Turkish music brought by immigrants from the 50s until 2010, covering multiple music styles from traditional Turkish music, over wedding music, disco-folk up to Hip-Hop and RnB. At same time it shows also how extremely difficult the situation was (and probably still is) over the different decades and what challenges the Turkish community (later also there kids who are born in Germany) face including racism.A lot of musicians famous for the decades and music styles are interviewed and explain what influenced them connecting the different parts.All in all well made documentary which spots a light on a music which even though sold big times plays until the modern time a niche role in Germany.Note this movie has a short after credit.",True
2,7,Thoughtful and Uplifting Drama,kutkank,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ask, Mark ve Olum is a deeply moving and beautifully executed documentary that brings long-overdue attention to the voices of Turkish immigrants in Germany. Through powerful archival footage, poetic narration, and unforgettable music, the film paints a rich and emotional portrait of identity, resilience, and belonging. It not only documents a cultural history that was nearly lost, but also connects it to universal themes of migration, love, and struggle. Every frame feels personal yet political, making it both intimate and socially significant. A must-watch for anyone interested in music, diaspora, and human stories that transcend borders.",False
3,10,powerful social critique,gospodinBezkrai,n/a,16/08/2025,"Incredibly well-made documentary about the everyday history of Turkish gastarbeiters (guest workers) in Germany which is told through the community's music and by the words of the musicians - both by interviews with many (as I understand) once household names, but most of all, by the songs and the lyrics themselves! Very powerful social critique in four or five generations (since the 1960s) of pure poetry!Also very original design and editing, lots of stunning archival footage. An incredible variety of musical genres.Finally, it really lets you get a sense of the hardship, hope and disillusionment of the people who undertook that ""invited"" migration: the separation with their families and homeland, German society's hostility, the exploitation and precariousness, etc. Etc. - all told in authentic poetic terms.Here is one of the songs to set you on the journey (in my humble 2nd hand translation):They gave me a contract on the Istanbul train station
Your new workplace is in Germany, they said
Here is a ticket, one packet is allowed
Come on, off you go - they sent us on a journey
Ghermany, Ghermany - having got up to here, there is no way back.The film was a favourite in the 2024 Bulgarian MENAR film festival and they are showing it again this year by popular demand.",False

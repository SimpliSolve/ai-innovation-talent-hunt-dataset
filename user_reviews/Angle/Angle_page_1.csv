2,10,Emotional & Personal - Must Watch,abhi-01417,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAngle is an inspirational documentary about the legend of Kurt Angle. The documentary reveals some of the deeply personal moments and choices in the life of Angle in his pursuit of excellence. While the story of how he won a gold medal with a broken neck is well known, the documentary dives deeper to talk about how Kurt approached his freestyle wrestling years and took down opponents bigger and stronger than him. The narration of the documentary does not seem forced and the transition makes sense as the story unfolds. When we get to the later years of his career and learn about his addiction to painkillers, the documentary does a great job in putting the focus around his family's and friends' perspective on what he was going through. Without being overly dramatic, this documentary touches a chord with the average viewer as we learn that Kurt turned his life around with the help of his wife, and he strived to be a better dad by putting his family ahead of him. The story of Kurt Angle is about vulnerability as much as it is about resilience. This documentary never gets ahead of itself and tries to use his WWE career to sell itself. But rather through this story, we get to know who Kurt Angle is, and that story makes for a compelling watch. It's true, it's damn true.",True

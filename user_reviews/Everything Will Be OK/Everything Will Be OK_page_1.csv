1,6,"Deep, viceral and unique. Yet challengingly ambitious",mariusarmangue,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just saw everything will be ok at Sitges Film Festival 2022 and it's a tough watch. The film does everything it sets out to do in a brilliant manner and the film is both visually, audibly and ideally impressive, which makes it so devastating that the medical is frustratingly challenging.Everything Will be ok is a movie that very few people likely Will see, and it really shouldn't be. The film is an highly original piece of protesting art, and I cannot give whoever made the visuals enough credit. It's masterfully done and riveting to look at. But it's also 98 minutes of still pictures and disturbing real videos from the flaws of mankind. Regardless of innovation and importance, the film is sadly hard to sit through for the average film enthusiast. I for one enjoyed it, but it was my impression that I was part of the minority, and understandably so.It truly as a remarkable achievement that I wish everyone would have the patience to sit through without getting bored. Unfortunately, even I -with all my praise - checked the clock at some point in the film. I hate to say it and it might be the only time I'll ever say it in my life, but the film simply is to ambitious for its own good. It goes through 8 different provokes with human behaviour and society in a philosophical, psychological and scientific analysis which is combined with a metaphor, that is the description on the film. All this in a feature length film which is best depicted as a fantasy blended documentary using claymation-esque sculpting and brutal archive footage.It's a 6.0/10 for me.",False

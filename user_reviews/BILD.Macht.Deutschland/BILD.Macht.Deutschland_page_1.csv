1,6,Julian Reichelt aka the Til Schweiger of the yellow press,alexandermangoldt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI think this documentary is unintentionally revealing. I watched all 7 episodes like I would watch a car accident. It was gruesome but I still couldn't avert my eyes. However, sometimes I wanted to shut my ears because the music was suggesting drama and tension where often there was none.And there is Julian Reichelt who really reminded me of Til Schweiger in some scenes: not overly sophisticated, not very articulate or well-spoken, a little chauvinist and an ostentatiously tough guy. Even his looks are similar to those of Til.Then there are the reporters, who are in general more educated than their readership, but relenetlessly try to find arguments why it's good to work for a tabloid newspaper. The best argument comes from a reporter who says that he considers his move from the FAZ (quality press) to the BILD Zeitung a promotion, because at the FAZ he could or had to use elaborate language but now he is challenged to transform or condense very difficult topics into one catchy headline. But rather than condensing difficult topics they actually oversimplify matters so that their readers can feel the shock, outrage or indignation that really is the currency of the BILD. Reporters probably have to be in such denial in order to look at their reflection in the mirror every morning.One typical example is given: According to the BILD, China is responsible for the Corona virus, hasn't produced anything but viruses in the last 60 years and therefore must foot the multi-billion dollar bill. Yeah, right, that really is condensation and has got nothing to do with xenophobic simplification. Thank you, BILD. By the way, according to this logic, we would also be in our rights to blame Africa for Aids and make them pay. Oh, I forgot, we're already making Africa pay.There are worthy causes, too, like the cover story about the King of Thailand who thrives and prospers in his hotel in the south of Germany while his people are being oppressed. But again, the BILD just wants their readers to be appalled about this. The real investigative research is done by papers such as the SZ oder TV-channels like WDR who were able to prove that the King of Thailand is governing his country illegally from Germany.Another revealing moment ist when a famous ex-soccerplayer (Mehmet Scholl) says that the BILD has so much information on pretty much everyone that you had better work with them or else they will destroy you. And that's exactly how they roll: give us information or we'll publish sensitive information about you. I don't know about you, but to me there is only one word for it: extortion.I wonder if the filmmakers actually understood that Julian Reichelt was manipulating them and pushing his own agenda which is to promote the BILD TV channel. Nobody I know has heard about the TV Channel and it's pretty irrelevant in the German media landscape. The documentary is however portraying it as the next big thing. It's also hilarious to see the hubris of both Julian Reichelt and his vice Paul Ronzheimer who appear on their own TV-channel and discuss topical issues as if their opinion would influence politics somehow.So, if you want to learn how deluded the journalists at the BILD Zeitung are, then this is the right documentary for you.",True
2,4,Ansered my only question: Do they know?,PaxtonMalloy,n/a,16/08/2025,"This a doc about the anti-democratic, racist, hate generating magazin (no not a real newspaper) BILD.Nevertheless this could have been an interesting look into that medium and actually for the first three episodes it is. Because you see what you would expect. You see cocky, mysoginist argumentative Julian Reichelt and his peers creating stories basically because they can or because they don't like what either a politician or scientist has to say.It answered my only question: Do they know? They don't! They actually believe that they do a job that would be considered good journalism. They really don't see the harm they do for individuals as much as for society.After 3 or 4 episodes it becomes pure propaganda. In the first 3 episodes you had at least politicians criticizing aspects of what BILD does and at times there were even internal voices not in line with Reichelts regime. But then you get heroic music while BILD is patting themself on the back for several topics that you never actually see in the medium with the big letters. An interesting question would have been why politicians still tolerate this medium.",False
3,7,Good view,sereddy,n/a,16/08/2025,Behind the scene. I really dont want to be a journalist and search everyday for a new story,False
4,1,"Does not deserve the tag ""documentary""",imdb-19751-99970,n/a,16/08/2025,"This ""documentary"" does not deserve its name. In fact, BILD is given a platform for self-portrayal. The opinion-making that creates and secures BILDs power goes one step further: with this series, the opinion about BILD itself is polished up. In order to convey a ""balanced"" point of view, the editorial team's weaknesses are also shown, which are just as honest weaknesses as those that you give when holding job interviews.
In the end, we're all just human and the editor-in-chief maybe a bit tough but fair? Please don't fall for that! A planned and created narrative is induced as an anchor for sympathy and identification.
As long as the factual loyalty is less important than maintaining power and sales, BILD has not earned its status and should not be supported.
It's a shame that this series does just that!",False
5,1,This is,janaefe,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not a docu a pure promotion for BILD.
More propaganda for germans lie magazin number 1.",False
6,8,Reviews should refer to the documentation and not to the BILD,oliver-loew,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many of the reviewers apparently confuse the fact that this should be about the quality of the documentary and not about the BILD. I find the documentary very interesting, exciting and really well produced. I also don't see it as an advertisement for BILD.",False
7,2,"Well done, but not neutral.",schlamm-93054,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is well done and produced. But it lacks of necessary criticism. On the other hand it might not have been possible to film there / publish the series if the ""journalists"" of BILD would have been shown in a more critical way. The most important example for this dilemma: it gets pointed out, that BILD fights against Antisemitism (what is true), but on the other hand it isnt clearly told that BILD also creates hate against other minorities by generalising their behaviour or serving cliches. This is paradox.",False
8,3,No classification,johannes-950-315377,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is more of a behind the scenes. I'm missing some form of moderation, what the film wants me to think about this kind of jornalism. How are other newspapers effected, let's look at some stories and how the story changed because of Bild.",False
9,1,No need for such a documentary,Flow3200,n/a,16/08/2025,Great 2020. This year even got worst. Now we have a documentary about how to create hate and racism... Absolut unbelieveable how someone could give this newspaper. A platform....,False

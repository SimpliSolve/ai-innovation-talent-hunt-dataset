2,10,Mary Beard At Her Very Best,martimusross,n/a,16/08/2025,"Without doubt when Mary Beard sticks to her expertise she is unsurpassed in her communication of history and making it all come to life in funny and anecdotal asides. It is TV gold when she translates graffiti and makes the dead live.This programme brings to life her wonderful book of the same name.Mary has done other things outside of ancient history that quite frankly I did not enjoy and I can only conclude that experts need to stay in their lane. I had the pleasure of seeing Mary in conversation at the Barbican and she is a total star.My advice to the BBC is to commission Mary for lots of future projects as she is an incredible talent and the BBC at its best. Could we send Mary to review the latest finds at Pompeii in April 2024, this would be brilliant!10/10.",False

1,7,Way more interesting for those who know little about the case! [+65%],arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're familiar with Asiaville's 2020 Spotify podcast Death, Lies & Cyanide, or if you're from Kerala (or lived there in the past few years at least), you'd already know the entire chronology of events in this case. Of course, the most striking element here is that a woman allegedly committed these heinous crimes. The podcast I mentioned has a subtle horror undertone to it (backed by a superb score and a terrific narration), whereas Christo Tomy's Netflix documentary plays out more like a mystery thriller.The reenactments are neatly done, and the interviews give us added insight from the family's perspective, especially from an emotional angle. The editing pattern is reminiscent of what we've seen in several Netflix productions (of this kind) in recent times, replete with jumpcuts, family-tree diagrams, and a non-linear style of presentation. It would've been interesting (although not practical) to hear from Jolly herself, but since the trials are ongoing and will probably take years to conclude, I understand why Netflix went the route it did.",False
2,7,"Interesting, disturbing but maybe a bit imbalanced?",souplahoopla,n/a,16/08/2025,"I want to preface this review that I absolutely believe she's done it. Given the evidence and timeline there is almost no doubt that she's guilty.And it's a really nicely made true crime film. The timeline is well worked out. Her life and motives are clearly known, and the family members clearly want the full story told. And it's frequently awful to watch. Just normal ignorance, lack of oversight and questional methods by coroners allowed her to continue.Again I think she did it. But I felt a little uncomfortable that the only 'other side of the story', was some hack lawyer? Perhaps everyone who knows her turned on her. Fair enough. But the counter argument could have been narrated or at least laid out for balance. She hasn't been convicted yet, and even tho she seems completely guilty, it's til proven innocent, so it seems a bit of a hit piece. It kind of takes away from it's integrity.",False
3,8,A wolf in sheep's clothing?,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"A community is rocked to learn that six murders were carried out by the family's matriarch, Jolly Joseph.Jolly Joseph, she sounds like a children's entertainer, someone to bring joy and happiness into people's lives, not in this case, the name behind one of India's most shocking cases, six murders over a ten year period.It's a well made documentary, both interesting and revealing.The acts are terrible, but the one that stands out, the murder of the two year old child, whoever could do that, the only word is evil.It doesn't perhaps give us all of the answers, but perhaps that's because not all of the points of this case have come to light. The investigation continues.Amazing to see how Jolly's kids have all grown up and matured, turning out to be some very impressive, reasoned, intelligent people, food luck to them all.8/10.",False
4,7,Soulless monster,Shiryu05,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt is vastly disturbing that not only was she getting the cyanide on the pretense of poisoning a poor stray dog (what type of monster harms an innocent animal?????!!!!!), but that she killed a 2-year-old child.We have seen documentaries on serial killers and similar before - this is nothing new. Her motives not only shone a light on the apathetic monster she was but the meticulous way she constructed the ""reality"" around her to work in her favor.My heart breaks when I hear news of animal and/or child abusers/killers. They are the most vulnerable in our society and we are not doing enough to protect either.",True
5,7,A pre-sensory documentary with so-so plot of direction,sidharthnair-73342,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPersonally i liked the content of documentary for its cosmopolitan mindset by director as he tried his best level for making viewer to sit on edge of seat, but as a viewer for such traumatic incident i always wants to check from culprits perspective.As here in CYANIDE AND CURRY we are constantly going through clips of victims perspective (i totally agree thats what happen in documentary) but some where i expect mindset of culprit.Now the point it went wrong is we expect no loopholes and suspense to be there till end but here it was least.So many scenes we believe its very much unquestioned, like working in NIT and no one asking about monthly look after of expense as they are sharing livelihood under 1 roof and her husband is doubtless.Police seem very naive as after jolly's father-in-law's demise, everything seems pointless.While Jolly's husband death no one thought of murder attempt or struggling to death as he fainted in bathroom but not in table where he had supper, where police just consider the whole statement for suicide from JOLLY these points are very pinching as it seems screenplay had took from any bookSo many things more
But for now these much rest in nextHoping for movie from JOLLY's perspective to be done for mass and better reach.",True
6,7,Bone-chilling doc,eggheader,n/a,16/08/2025,"Curry & Cyanide is an absolutely gripping and disturbing documentary about the Koodathayi Cyanide killing case and includes viewpoints from many individuals involved with the events. Kudos to the sister who pursued the case relentlessly to ""speak for the dead"" even under intense public scorn. The creators of the series meticulously compiled the data and and superbly articulated the gruesome story related to this case. This is a psychopath story that may make you lose faith in humanity at times and will definitely leave you feeling unwell in the end. Netflix does a good job releasing these true crime documentaries.",False
7,6,A darkness behind ordinary face,Pranali_Patil,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case"" is the chilling story of a woman accused of murdering six people over a span of 14 years. The documentary presents a detailed account of the case, including interviews with her brother-in-law and sister-in-law, providing valuable insights.The documentary meticulously outlines how Jolly Joseph executed each murder, leaving no stone unturned. However, there's a sense of something lacking in the documentary. The narrative could have been more concise and transparent, providing a clearer understanding of the events.While the documentary sheds light on the gruesome details of the crimes, it leaves viewers craving a deeper exploration of the motive and psychology behind Jolly Joseph's actions. Nonetheless, it serves as a haunting reminder of the darkness that can lurk beneath seemingly ordinary facades.",False
8,6,Shocking Turn of events,abhilashaa,n/a,16/08/2025,"Spoiler""Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case"" is a Netflix true-crime documentary that unravels the chilling story of Jolly Joseph, a woman from Koodathayi, Kerala, accused of systematically murdering six members of her own family over 14 years using cyanide. The case shocked India when it came to light in 2019, revealing a complex web of lies, deception, and calculated killings.Introduction to the CaseThe documentary begins by painting a picture of Jolly Joseph as an ideal daughter-in-law, wife, and mother. She was respected in her community and considered kind and loving. However, behind this seemingly perfect life lay a dark secret-six mysterious deaths in her family, all of which had gone unnoticed for over a decade.The Murders (2002-2016)Jolly's crimes spanned from 2002 to 2016, with each death appearing natural at the time but later suspected to be premeditated murders.1. Annamma Thomas (2002) - Jolly's mother-in-law was the first victim. She suddenly collapsed after eating mutton curry and died. At the time, her death was attributed to a heart attack.2. Tom Thomas (2008) - Six years later, Jolly's father-in-law died in a similar manner, also believed to be due to natural causes.3. Roy Thomas (2011) - Jolly's husband became the third victim. He died suddenly, and an autopsy revealed cyanide poisoning. However, the police ruled it as suicide, and no further investigation took place.4. Mathew Manjadiyil (2014) - Jolly's husband's uncle, who had begun questioning her financial dealings, also died mysteriously.5. Sili Mathew (2016) - Jolly's cousin-in-law, who was married to her late husband's cousin, died suddenly. She had reportedly questioned Jolly's behavior, making her a threat.6. Alphine (2016) - The youngest victim was a two-year-old child, Sili's daughter, who died in Jolly's care.Jolly's Motive and Web of LiesThe documentary delves into Jolly's possible motives. It is suggested that she wanted complete control over the family's wealth and properties. She had also built a fake identity, lying to her family for years about being a college professor at the National Institute of Technology (NIT) in Kozhikode when she had no such qualification or job.She used charm, manipulation, and deception to maintain her position in the family. She even fabricated suicide stories, faking notes from her husband to deflect suspicion.The Investigation and Arrest (2019)The case was reopened when Roy Thomas' brother, Rojo, grew suspicious and demanded an inquiry into their deaths. The police exhumed the bodies of the deceased family members and conducted forensic tests, which confirmed the presence of cyanide. Jolly was arrested in October 2019, and during interrogation, she allegedly confessed to the murders.Trial and Legal ProceedingsThe documentary explores how the case progressed legally, highlighting the lack of initial police scrutiny and how Jolly managed to escape suspicion for years. Experts, journalists, and law enforcement officials discuss how societal norms and blind trust contributed to the delayed justice.Psychological InsightsPsychologists and criminologists weigh in on Jolly's personality, analyzing whether she was a cold-blooded killer or someone driven by deep insecurities and an insatiable desire for power and control.ConclusionThe film closes with reflections on the shocking nature of the case and its impact on Kerala and India at large. It serves as a chilling reminder of how deception can thrive in plain sight and how blind faith in family members can sometimes lead to devastating consequences.Final Thoughts""Curry & Cyanide"" is not just a crime documentary but also an exploration of human psychology, trust, and the dark side of ambition. It leaves viewers questioning how well they truly know the people around them.",True
9,9,Curry & Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case (2023) - A Chilling Revelation,toashiqmajeed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Having known about the unsettling case of Jolly Joseph's cunning serial killings,
Cyanide: The Jolly Joseph Case' (2023) managed to present the story in a raw and gripping manner. The unique storytelling approach made the narrative truly stand out. It's important to note that this case is ongoing and still in the trial process, which sets limitations on a complete personal postmortem from Jolly's perspective. Nonetheless, this documentary provided a satisfying and spine-chilling storytelling experience. The director and the team deserve applause for crafting a haunting yet captivating portrayal of this ongoing and impactful story.",False

11,10,Amazing!,zubairilhan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just watch it! Go ahead and watch it instead of looking at the rating! Its probably 6/10 cuz not many people would have watched it yet! You will not feel bored for even a second is what I can absolutely surely tell you! Such an amazing direction and the background music to top it off! I initially thought cuz it's a documentary will I feel bored but nah! The story telling from the original family members and with the recreated scenes all of them were really sad and creepy to watch!!!👌🏻👌🏻I love how before each person died or before explaining the way they died,it first shows the picture of the person about to die and shows the birth and death year marked in red first and then shows that the said person is gonna die which leaves us in a tensed situation!One thing to absolutely mention is the opening of this film🍿 They successfully captures the attention of the viewer from how well they did the opening! It would be a shame to stop this review without acknowledging the bgm!!That bgm is something man! When you watch the documentary and then the bgm plays it really puts you in a spot! This is my first time writing a review cuz i absolutely loved this piece! Kinda gave me dhrishyam flashbacks at certain points!",False
12,5,Should have been more well researched,Jithindurden,n/a,16/08/2025,"An engrossing documentary that moves so fast that it forgets that it's a documentary. Usually, when I watch a documentary, even when it's based on a well-known event, there would be a lot more research that goes into it which shows a lot more information than what the media would've told till then. Here, that is not the case. There's little to nothing in the way of new information that I wasn't aware of before. Moreover, good documentaries would delve into more faults from the side of the police or those which happened at different points of investigation which seemed to have happened a lot in this case but is not focused. The whole focus was on telling the story from a fixed perspective in a thrilling manner. Even though, Aloor is shown as someone who speaks for Jolly, it is not nearly as convincing as it is designed to be. Which itself is not an issue, but when there's so much more that happened around it that is conveniently skipped, which feels almost like it is because it was never covered by the mainstream media. There are so many questions I'm left with at the end, that the overuse of some cinematic techniques makes me feel this wasn't as good as I felt when I watched it.The way Jolly has given some of her statements, and the way her own son talks about her, it is pretty clear she is the culprit even without more solid evidence. But the lack of more solid evidence and the lack of focus on different angles on why that happened is very apparent here.Overall as a documentary, this feels like an average affair because it is a cinematic retelling of a known story without any research into new information.",False
13,9,First Indian true crime documentary I've seen,felix-50190,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe crimes described in this documentary are horrible and despicable. I am very sorry for the sons who have lost so many loved ones, and, in a way, have also lost their mother.It was very interesting to watch for me because I've never seen a true crime documentary from India. As a European, I think you can learn quite a bit through this docu beyond the actual topic. For example, I didn't know there are so many Christians in Kerala and I found it interesting to learn about the dominant gender roles that kind of protected Jolly from suspicion for so long. That made this docu much more interesting than watching yet another true crime docu about an american or European case.Also: Great respect to the aunt who pushed for a police investigation. She seems to be a truly just person.",True
14,8,Gripping Documentary,appusnikhil,n/a,16/08/2025,"I remember hearing lots of news reports and self-made theories related to this case from media houses a few years back. I never knew all the details of this case, and we tend to forget all the elements, including the chronology of events, after a few years. This documentary does well in collating all the details and I did enjoy this doc from Netflix.I won't say this is a bad documentary but still, there were questions left unanswered and I think the creators could have included all this and could have made it a comprehensive one. I am not going into spoilers. Just give the documentary a watch and you will get it.",False
15,2,Poorly made,kaamsrai,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very much half baked documentary,many links are missing here, about shizu's involment for killing his wife and daughter,how did jolly make college card access to the college, her college library access for cyanide study is completely missing,her physical relationship with that cpim worker who made her fake I card and everything,that angle is completely missing, jolly's previous life as a thief was missing,Mathew's involvement as a whole is missing as he knew about the murders and helped jolly through out for that matter, that angle was not clear in the documentary.

16,9,Nicely executed Indian crime documentary,akshatmahajan,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have watched alot of Netflix documentaries based on Indian criminals and they all were just fine but his one was nicely executed and nicely directed.The case is so well presented and the details are presented in a proper way making it easily understandable for everyone. Also, the well crafted screenplay, direction and editing made this entire documentary full of thrill and drama, even you can feel the tension. You don't get to know when it starts and ends, as it keeps you engaged till the very end.Overall, it was a nicely crafted documentary by Netflix and I hope they bring more documentaries in this style.",False
17,8,Dangerous....,sanghani,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let me thank Netflix first as I came across this beautiful, gripping and capturing scenes so vividly. Though there has been several adaptations in the form podcasts and TV serials but I found this documentary superbly made.The narration, correct sequences and chronology of events were well adapted. The flow of the documentary was well placed where it gave sufficient time to audience to understand what was happening. The interviews of the family did make me feel the pain they were going through and how they were coping in last 20yrs.The sound and music I felt was appropriate and well moderated, it further made the documentary more gripping. The direction and the script was very good and made me eager and glued to my seat to follow the chronology so that I don't miss any critical situations.It is stumbling to see that people in the world has criminal mind and are able to hide it, but one fine day such heinous crimes are revealed.",False
18,1,How a documentary should not be made,rahulreddydi,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all I certainly don't know the truth. This is the first time I heard about the case. But thanks to this dumb documentary, i somehow feel pity for Jolly.This documentary establishes that Jolly killed 6 people by red boxing their birth and death years, when on ground almost four cases lack forensic evidence that they have died of cyanide and Jolly too pleads not guilty. 90% of narration happens from Jolly's sister in law perspective who absolutely hates Jolly and finds Jolly odd in every scenario you put her. Her narration is very narration-like. The reasons she gave mostly for Jolly's motives are very unconvincing.That cyanide search in her house is a publicity stunt, is that how evidence was gathered seriously by taking the accused to show where she hid it. Can't the police themselves find out cyanide from 20-30 boxes in the kitchen?Well you may ask what about.when Jolly admitted to her son.. there are lopsides here. Firstly her son seemed totally detached with her. Next he questioned her in a very aggressive and very biased tone when she is already strictly in panic. Third is that whatever he said that she admitted is what he said. There's scope for belief and disbelief. Finally, is admission a conclusive proof?I can go on but I wish the viewer to judge. This felt more like a documentary-trial.",False
19,10,A very well directed documentary!,UmeshAditya,n/a,16/08/2025,"A very disturbing documentary based on a true incident! Unbelievable to know anything like this can happen in any family. Story revolves around a daughter-in-law of a prestigious family based in Kerala who turned a serial killer n killed all family members one by one through cyanide n couldn't let any even get doubt for almost close to 2 decades. Very captivating well done documentary. Keeps the thrilling element throughout. But very hard to digest the entire incident. If you are weak minded, avoid watching it. But definitely very well directed. My ratings for the content presentation is 10/10!",False
20,8,Gets us emotionally attached to the family,chittiyathaiswarya,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerThe fogs have been cleared in the society. Jolly shows brutal one can act for their needs. This documentry shows a complete clearcut idea about the things that had happened in that family. And the one thing is there are always good people out there who wants you to be happy and live a good life. A great span of 17 years is what this story makes interesting. Still doubting where was Jolly working all these years. It was very emotional watching this. I felt like my mother when Renji warned Remo 'don't drink anything from that house '. Feeling mad respect for Renji. It shows that these are not only in movies but we can see in real life too. The greates thing is that they realised that Jolly was behind all of these murders. Even though the case has not still over it feels nice after this movie. It feels good that all the children were in safe hands afterwards. The film has such music which goes with the flow. The part were they shows every deaths year is so frustrating to watch. It feels like you don't want to watch another year of death. But towards the last it becomes fast since the gap between murders are getting less. Hope that family gets more love and support.,True
21,2,Examining the Biased Narrative of 'Jolly's Version,hemanth-53368,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Jolly's Version"" unfolds a narrative around Rojo Thomas's quest for justice after his family's tragic deaths. However, the film's presentation lacks substantial evidence, leaning heavily on bias and one-sided storytelling. It portrays Rojo as a victim seeking truth, yet the underlying motives seem driven by financial gain and control over property. The film attempts to cast doubts on Jolly, implicating her in the family's turmoil without concrete proof. This biased portrayal raises skepticism about the movie's credibility. It fails to objectively explore alternative perspectives, choosing sensationalism over balanced storytelling. The lack of a robust, evidence-based narrative leaves viewers grappling with uncertainty. While the film attempts to uncover hidden truths, it falls short in delivering a compelling and credible storyline. The audience is left questioning the integrity of the presented events, seeking a more transparent and unbiased depiction of the case. Ultimately, ""Jolly's Version"" misses the mark, leaving the truth buried beneath a veil of subjective storytelling and inconclusive arguments.",False

23,10,A great true crime documentary,deann-88324,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Curry & Cyanide"" on Netflix is an absolute masterpiece, earning a solid 10/10 in my book. The documentary skillfully weaves a compelling narrative that captivates from start to finish.

24,3,She did not do it.,phillipsmarie-24062,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's plain to see this lady did not commit these crimes. The family has basically accused her of killing anyone who died of natural deaths in their family over the course of 20 years. It's ridiculous. The family obviously wants to cut her out of the will. The sister is driving this vendetta and it's difficult to watch. There is no evidence of a crime being done much less by Jolly.How anyone can believe this drivel is beyond me. She killed a remote cousins kid at a family party, in front of everyone because a friend of a friend said she wanted to marry the kids dad?!

25,8,An extremely dangerous woman,sulemansaeeed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Curry and Cyanide - The Jolly Joseph CaseA woman who was married in Kerala, first killed her mother in law in 2002, then her father in law in 2008, and then after some time, she killed her husband, all with the poison cyanide.This movie is about that, a real story. Jolly's sister in law files a case against her and she exhumes the bodies of her parents and her brother for forensics and cyanide presence in their bodies. Although at the end of the movie, it says that only two of the bodies were detected to have cyanide, but i believe she actually is the one who is responsible for all the deaths.It's a question, why, why a human drops to this level of brutality. Just why, such heinous things don't suit a human being. But evil is evil, and evil is gonna stay forever.Jolly is still under trial in a jail in Kerala. And her children live with their aunt now. None of the family members or neighbours or their relatives had any kind of suspicion on her, because she insisted on not to go for postmortem and all that, she would be caught if postmortem had been done when she did this for the first time by killing her mother in law in 2002.Lesson is that, keep your eyes everywhere. Anything can happen anywhere. And do postmortem, even if you don't feel like you should do it.",False

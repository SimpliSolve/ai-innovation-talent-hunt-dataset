1,8,A lot about SpaceX that I didn't know,Erik_Stone,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's a well balanced documentary. I didn't know all the history, so for me, it was really informative an entertaining.There is excitement, risk, history, great visual footage, and interviews with major players.Fun to watch.",False
2,8,Brilliant documentary. A must watch.,PaulMMXX,n/a,15/08/2025,Great insight on Space X.Outstanding docu and great storytelling.This documentary shows you the timeline of Space X and it's failures and success.Elon is relentless and has changed the space industry with Space X.Space X creates hope and overcomes challenges in this documentary about space travel.A definite must watch if you enjoy space exploration.,False
3,8,I Want To Go To Space!,BlueStar47,n/a,15/08/2025,"If there's one message this documentary tells us, it's that they want the future of space exploration to continue with the coming generations - and I believe this is both a great documentary and era for the youth to delve deeper into it!The nerve-racking, high-pulse and even tearful moments I felt through the series made me really connect with the emotions of the individuals involved in the development of these projects. I really wish I was part of the first rocket launches, or even had interest in them when they launched - memories for life I know I missed. However, this documentary captured the moments with brilliance! (Since I felt all of this!)
For the next NASA/SpaceX launches I will make sure I witness them digitally or...in real life!!",False
4,n/a,"Deeplay moved, yet at the same time, greatly encouraged",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is one of the BEST documentary movies that I've ever viewed so far. There were moments I suddenly realized I was holding my breath during those critical launching, docking, and then back to the earth, the blackout period, those processes were just so daunting and nervous breaking. What a journey of our space endeavor. I finally had the opportunity to share those moments with Elon Musk and those who worked together with him. What a great viewing experience, so unforgetable. Thanks to the production team who made this documentary seamlessly made, allowing us to energetically rekindle hopes during this darkest pandemic era as well as the atrocity that Russian's Putin has caused.",False
5,7,"Next Stop, Moon and Mars",Slarkshark,n/a,15/08/2025,"I find the idea of going back to the moon and establishing colonies, then to Mars incredibly exciting for mankind. Honestly, it's about time. I'm just really glad we have someone like Musk who genuinely wants mankind to progress, and has the ambition and of course funds to do it. We have to keep moving. To remain static is death.It was interesting to learn about SpaceX and it's history, but I was really hoping to learn more about their plans for the Moon and Mars. The documentary itself was nothing special and would probably be quite boring for someone who only has a slight interest in space.Very excited for the things to come from Musk and his team at SpaceX.",False
6,9,Highly informative and interesting,rbeckv,n/a,15/08/2025,I'm not a huge fan of documentaries but I actually watched this from beginning to end and it held my attention throughout. Somebody already said it - I knew part of the story but this really filled in a lot of the pieces about the space industry as a whole.The film also gives decent insight into the character of Musk and his intentions regarding space travel. He shows genuine care about the mission and the people involved.Highly recommend even if you hate Musk - still provides a great view of the mission of space travel over the past couple of decades.,False
7,6,"Too long, but shows the thrill and agony of space exploration",jonasleaparis,n/a,15/08/2025,Title says it all. Could've been 30 min shorter but interesting insight into modern space exploration / rocket launches and the personalities that undergo these missions.,False
8,9,Uplifting during difficult times,pduckboyn,n/a,15/08/2025,Refreshing to see such dedication and progress in a world with its share of problems. Encouraging as as reminder of what private industry can and will do. Enlightening to get a little view of the larger than life Elon Musk. Thoroughly enjoyed it.,False
9,6,"Interesting, but not engaging",camwasi,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good documentary and I learnt a lot on the inner workings. But as someone who has read Elons book and follow some of the space news, there was nothing particularly surprising. Still entertaining to watch.",False
10,9,Masterpiece,leusdonati,n/a,15/08/2025,"As Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai got us used to, here we have another great documentary that takes us through highs and lows of american space history, taking a deep look into the main characters themselves. Great edit, stunning shots and wrapping music. Must-watch for documentaries lovers.",False
11,7,"Interesting yet baggy in the second hour, would still recommend",F1-Phil,n/a,15/08/2025,"What starts out as a compelling documentary about the USA re-acquiring the capability to send astronauts to the ISS with SpaceX seems to lose focus about halfway in and I found myself watching footage that had nothing at all to do with the subject at hand. That said I really enjoyed most of this program, but you could lose 30 minutes and the result would be an improvement.",False
12,10,Excellent documentary. Hands down!,rva-raghav,n/a,15/08/2025,"Mindblown by the visuals, the screenplay and the way it was narrated. It was engaging throughout that I never felt bored for a minute. Well worth the time spent.",False
13,1,Just an uncritical advertisement for SpaceX,samsamuelstein,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is just an uncritical advertisement for SpaceX. There's no investigative journalism, or a critical look at the industry. The producers just regurgitate the company's PR talking points. You could ""learn"" more by reading a SpaceX press kit.",False
14,10,Thank you.,justin-devilliers,n/a,15/08/2025,This highlights the best of humanity through what have been some very difficult years. I watch EVERY single launch and it inspires and amazes me EVERY single time.,False
15,10,Astounding,connor-55107,n/a,15/08/2025,"Amazing documentary that highlights the truth about spaceX's revolution of the space industry. Incredible description of how relentless Elon Musk is in the face of critics and naysayers.The only entities to build, design and supply rockets to successfully send people to the ISSRussia
US
China
SpaceXWow.",False
16,10,Breathtaking!,ashchan1111,n/a,15/08/2025,"Awestruck ! Its next to impossible to grow from 0 to something extraordinary when the idols you worshiped publicly sabotage you.Elon Musk is revolutionizing humanity. If we cant support him, at least we should refrain from creating hurdles.",False
17,10,"Hard-Work can't be expressed, you will have to step in feel it.",budheswartrailblazer,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just watched the trailer now, and yeah its gonna be a hell lot of hard-work and dedication of ELON MUSK which will being showed in this movie. I am gonna watch this movie right now after commenting here. And for sure Elon Musk is an Alien! He is from the future. Believe That!",False
18,3,Just propaganda for Elon Musk,LucyKempers,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is merely propaganda for Elon Musk and shareholders for SPCE.Not interesting whatsoever. Good to watch if you are in the aero industry, otherwise don't waste your time.",False
19,n/a,Go For Launch,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,This was an amazing documentary of the US/ Russia working together on the ISS. Very well put together. Informative and educational. I grew up watching the Apollo Missions and they were amazing. The astronauts putting everything on the line to going into space going to the moon- hopefully back to the moon and on to Mars. The earth looks so huge from space. It's a documentary definitely worth your while to watch.,False
20,10,Make life multiplanetary,hejsej-36296,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great documentary with insights into what we as humanity has been lacking on, to explore and perhaps one day that impossibility of living on an another planet might become the opposite.",False
21,9,Great for space,aharmtti,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFound some great information about space x and NASA. Liked how it showed they had to work together to put people back in space,Was very disappointed in Armstrong and the other astronaut that decided that private companies would be the death of space and would be a killing field of people.Also found it a bit odd that several politicians thought the same death as Neil would follow private space companies. Glad Space X proved government puppets wrong on several ideas.",True
22,8,Musk off,kosmasp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Of course it is not just about Elon Musk and his pet project (if one can call it that), but also about NASA including the SpaceX program. Now I am still not entirely sure about Musk, but as you can see here, he is a human being too. He may have certain ideas and principles we may not agree with, but he also seems to have a desire and dream to get people off ... the face of the earth.Interesting and intriguing documentary, that shines a light and more on things that happened the last few decades concerning mens (and womens and non binary and whatever else I may be forgetting or not being aware of yet) dream to go to space. Dream big - there's more things to come.",False
23,10,Return to Space is Great,avakay-98287,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have watched Return to Space twice. It is fascinating! Elon put his money toward this dream and has succeeded. Many geniuses work at Spacex to make this come true. This almost seemed like a futuristic space movie at times, but it is a real accomplishment. Thanks to Elon Musk and all Spacex employees! Well done!",False
24,3,PR FOR SPACEX!!,sriramthestranger,n/a,15/08/2025,May be Netflix and SPACEX had a multi year arrangement to air best footages. There is nothing concrete in this 2hr documentary rather than rants about test missions and launches. Not recommended!!,False
25,9,Great movie!!,macbimeller,n/a,15/08/2025,"I mean wow,
Amazing to find out how much space x did. The way they talked about the whole program the created in so simplicity to the common people is great. So many emotions from all of the people. The way you see ""behind the scenes"" is awesome.I really recommend to see this movie.",False

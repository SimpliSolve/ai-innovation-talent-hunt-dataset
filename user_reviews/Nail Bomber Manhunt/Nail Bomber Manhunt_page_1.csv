1,6,Good. But not Manhunt Unabomber.,bhttacharjee-saurav,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story is gripping and the plot was a golden opportunity for the show-makers. What was needed, was to exploit the reason for racial wars, go deep into their activities in Britain, to explain how they convince members to hate, and what was the modus operandi of a spy who infiltrated the BNP. But what we got was a half baked cause and effect POV from the spy and some other characters. Better sequencing, storytelling and character buildup would've made Manhunt: Nail Bomber as good as the Manhunt series. But this was bland and at times boring, with very few moments that pull you in. Disappointing.",False
2,6,"Compelling, but left wanting to know more.",SpacemanBob,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story is interesting, but the film does not expound enough on the racial environment at the time; nor the white supremacist movement, either then or now. There's plenty of film footage, primarily old news clips, but very little in depth analysis. For instance, not much in the way of the immediate aftermath, or the long term effects of these events.It's not a very long film; but with that, it felt like further details were needed for some context. A more diverse range of credible interviewees would've helped. It's still worth watching, it's not terrible by any means.",False
3,5,Agree with other reviews,metuchenpremier,n/a,16/08/2025,Spoiler1.) This seems more like an opportune time to make this documentary since these bombings occurred in 1999.2.) The documentary format seems to copycat off of so many documentaries that pop up on Netflix.3.) I'm surprised that they didn't try to drag this into a multi episode documentary and I'm glad that they didn't.4.) As another review points out they didn't really delve into the far right mindset and activities. INSTEAD the filmmakers post multiple photos or videos if this conveys anything meaningful or informative. It comes off as imagery instead of trying to give us knowledge.,True
4,7,A solid documentary about a series of crimes from just over 20 years ago.,roondogbb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Netflix can been quite hit or miss with It's documentaries and the stylistic presentation can quite often make or break a netflix documentary. As can how long it runs for. Be it 1 episode or 4 episodes.The Nailbomber did a very good job at telling the story of a lone wolf bomber who let off multiple bombs in attacks that were racially motivated in London in a single solid episode.My number one desire from a documentary is to get across as much interesting and relavent information as possible and The Nail Bomber certainly did that. I was only 9 or 10 at the time of the attacks and although I'm from the UK, I don't really recall the attacks. Also being from Northern Ireland, terrorism based around The Northern Irish troubles was far more prevalent in my mind and still is when I think back to the 90s. So it was very interesting (and saddening) to learn about other problems occurring in the same decade. The show had interesting interviews with victims and played insightful tape recordings of the perpetrator being interviewed. Unlike other Netflix documentaries (Son of sam). It doesn't mix and match the style of voice over vs interviews. Nor is the the documentary stretched out over many episodes. Someone could have tried that if they had the motivation or had been given the go ahead. Due to it being a multi bomb and court case story. Luckily they stayed with an hour and a bit single episode and it worked.It's definitely a crime documentary to watch if this genre is your thing and it's better than other recent attempts by Netflix. A good solid 7/10. So give it a go.",False
5,6,Could of been better.,Movie-Guy-65,n/a,16/08/2025,There's certainly an interesting doco in here but it's very poorly produced.None of the participants in doco are identified and producers try to be way too cute in how it's all presented.Subject is interesting but program presentation lets it all down.,False
6,7,Not an isolated incident,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Unfortunately - but this does concentrate on this one incident. And the motivations behind it. Killing people can never be considered anything that is to be hailed and applauded at - in this case some might argue this is even worse.So targetting minorities here - you may have heard of what happened. So certain aspects may be known to you, but this dives a bit deeper. It is not the best true crime (or incidents or whatever you want to call it) documentary, but it is well researched. Just be aware of what this touches upon ...",False
7,6,Interesting,zoupelle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Had no idea that this happened in England. So it was informative. More background on Copeland would have made it even more interesting.Now, let's have a pro neo-nazi documentary, please.",False
8,6,Feels superficial,little-lou1984,n/a,16/08/2025,"As other reviewers have said it felt short.When I started watching this I was thinking ""how do I not know about this?"". To be fair I was 15 at the time and in a not very nice home situation so had other things on my mind but my home town is one of the London satellite towns so I can't believe I didn't have this imprinted in my consciousness. When I got to the end I realised I did remember this... The bombing at the gay bar and thought it was something to do with the IRA. Is my lack of memory about the bombs in the black and Bangladeshi neighbourhoods a reflection of my ignorance or the way it was reported at the time? I hate to admit it but I was raised with right wing family members, and although I've always had my own mind and learned to be more open minded as I've got older it isn't unreasonable that some of the poison I heard when I was growing up was still in my mind.I feel that this doc would have benefitted from more focus on the long reaching effects of the bombings on the Brixton and Brick Lane areas. The focus seemed to be on survivors of the Soho bomb. Yes, they suffered deaths there but physical and mental injuries are also horrific. I can't be the only one who wanted to know what the outcome was for the baby who had a nail stuck in their head. We don't need to infringe on this person's privacy but it would be nice to know if they recovered.Lastly, some update on how human rights and equality has progressed, or not, in the years following would be nice. Some insight into the animal's background and upbringing. What made him so full of hate? What were his parents like? I think we all have a need to understand what makes someone hate so much.",False
9,4,Boring,Movi3DO,n/a,16/08/2025,"BOOM!A documentary about a series of bombings in London in 1999, aiming at minority groups.This was a boring one. There honestly wasn't really much to the story in the first play. Most parts in the documentary were seen before. There was a person who was a spy within an far-right group. He was potentially interesting, but then there wasn't much revealed from his aspect.The biggest problems here are that the themes felt underwhelming and I didn't learn much about the event. Except for the spy guy, the other interviewees were all not interesting. Many times in this documentary I was bored and looked at phone instead. For only an hour and 12 minutes, it still felt long.Overall, it's better to just watch some YouTube videos or go to Wiki to learn about the event. 4/10.",False
10,8,Good,mikeiskorn,n/a,16/08/2025,A well put together documentary that tells the story of Dave Copeland and what he did. If anything I wish this was slightly longer but that's just a personal preference.,False
11,5,A little too convenient...,kyle_mcateer,n/a,16/08/2025,"What these people did, and their ilk, deserved nothing less than the death sentence. Despicable excuse for human beings.But once has to ask. Why now? With tensions in the world reaching critical mass, why now choose to bring this story to the globe. Just something to think about.",False
12,5,Boring,sepit91,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just boring, not important scenes. No USA forced drama but the harsh facts just don't seem interesting.Could have been a lot better.",False
13,8,True crime one-off,Leofwine_draca,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerAnother decent Netflix crime documentary. Not a huge amount of material here so it's just a one-off following a short-lived bombing campaign in London in 1999. The political backdrop and interviews with key personnel add to the intrigue and it does well in following the same format as the provider's other true crime offerings.,True
14,5,"Short doc, worth a watch.",TreeFiddy53,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some parts of the doc will make you think the clips were from pre-World War II but no, surprisingly from 1999, which in the grand scheme of things, isn't too long ago. Makes you wonder how much hatred exists in this world, and how openly so.It's only 70ish mins, so I feel like this was an opportunity missed to tell the story about the larger picture in Britain but they chose to give a brief summary of the entire set of events, so it didn't really feel like a 'hunt'. There are so many movies, tv shows and docs about the events that happen in the US, but a sizeable audience hardly knows what's going on in the UK.Could have been a 4 part doc, but sure. A short one is fine too.",False
15,1,Nail Bomber: Manhunt has no Manhunt,guestgulkan,n/a,16/08/2025,"You are probably expecting ""Nail Bomber: Manhunt"" will have detectives following clues, interviewing suspects, tracking down leads.""Nail Bomber: Manhunt"" has none of these things.It's all about the targeted communities, and is frankly very boring.There is an entire story-line about this activist spy in the far-right, however he has nothing to do with catching Copeland. One of Copeland's co-workers recognized him from cctv footage released on TV. The ""spy"" achieved nothing and I'm not even sure why he's on the show. But he has a good publicist, since he keeps taking the credit somehow for not accomplishing anything.Summary: no Manhunt and boring.",False
16,8,Important message,shanayneigh,n/a,16/08/2025,"Refreshing with a true crime documentary on Netflix that isn't 8-10 episodes long. This documentary was a tight 70 minutes, it's actually one of those rare instances where I wouldn't have minded if it spent a little more time on the political climate.Britain, Germany, Norway, Sweden. The list goes on. All of them countries where the police and other authorities downplay or ignore the threat posed by far right terrorists, with death and destruction in their wake.",False

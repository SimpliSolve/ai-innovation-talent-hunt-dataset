1,9,Clear articulation of this Medicine,kablenkin,n/a,15/08/2025,"A thorough film that depicts the beauty, healing ability and power of this wonderful medicine. I really appreciated how it went through many aspects of the Shipibo Ayahuasca tradition, and not just focus on Mama Aya, while also making sure that people know which tradition they are speaking about, as there are multiple traditions that include Ayahuasca. It very well presented the master plants, the icaros, the ceremony and integration aspects of working with her. I also liked that it didn't just focus on how amazing it is, but spoke of certain cautions that are realistic when entering this world. It was really easy to follow with a clear story line.",False
2,10,a piece of art,larajamar,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thank you for your beautiful work and for shedding some light on the world of Ayahuasca, plant medicine and the shipibos.I only recently initiated the conversation with my family about my journey with plant medicines and am happy to have this documentary as a support to further inform them. It doesn't diminish the thing to reassure, it doesn't exaggerate either to scare and freak people out, it is humble, honest and to the point.The film in itself is a piece of art! The music, the visuals, the way images were shot and edited. It's super pure and poetic.Thank you so much.",False

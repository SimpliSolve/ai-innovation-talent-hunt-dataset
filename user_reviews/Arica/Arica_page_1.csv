1,8,Horrifying facts laid out the way they are,muratmihcioglu,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is a follow-up to Toxic Playground, which I understand was the first exposure of how a Swedish mining company turned life into hell in a Chilean town from the 80s to today.The Swedish director has learned of the widespread cancer in that area solely by chance as he was studying film there in Chile. Generations of people getting exposed to toxic waste just because some people in Europe wanted to profit over their natural resources. Tough stories to stomach galore. The narration is cold, kind of stiff, probably because no addition is needed to what is obvious exploitation, and even mass murder.Much as I understand the deadpan style, I'm not so sure there wasn't an even more powerful way of communicating this. However, the ""documentation"" itself is top notch.Much as I don't like to go PC/SJW on such stuff, this particular story smells of colonialism. And a very recent, in-your-face kind of ""neo-colonialism"". It's pretty obvious that, at least for some directors of that Swedish company, the health of distant Chilean people meant NOTHING. Pretty sure no legit company could have gotten away with such catastrophe in case they operated in Europe.The Arica case needs to attract more attention, and find its way also into popular fiction. Because not many people watch documentaries.",False

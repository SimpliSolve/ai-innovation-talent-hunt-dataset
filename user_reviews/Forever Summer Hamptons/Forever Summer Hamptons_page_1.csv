1,3,Vapidity,louispeter-23057,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you're a fan of big Brother, The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, you might like this lesson in vapidity. A bunch of 17 to 23 year old boys and girls doing their thing in the Hamptons. Mostly wealthy, spoiled brats always on their cell phones, fixing their hair and worried about being cooler than the next guy or girl.I do like their attitude about sexual diversity; that is a plus.I remember visiting the Hamptons about 40 years ago; my how things have changed. So goes the world.But watching the kids and their antics can be addictive, for me from a sociological standpoint.The better looking people were recruited for this documentary. It' all about optics people. Danger is that other impressionable kids might wat to emulate this charade.",False
2,3,Nope,kellyandpeanut,n/a,16/08/2025,"I accidentally clicked on this thinking it was something else. I'm 40 and I can't deal with this generations shallow immature talk, abbreviations and limited vocabulary. It is mind numbing torture. How can any of these kids let alone most of their parents afford to live here or in the city?",False
3,5,If The Hills Millennial Style,chilled-ghee-f,n/a,16/08/2025,"A 'The Hills' flanker...A group of slightly annoying Millennials trod a path well worn... Could be an interesting series but the producers would have to cull 3/4 of the cast.The 'lead' characters... the male one is called Ilan, the female one's name escapes me... aren't interesting enough (even when they use any excuse throw a 'party' ie the opening of an envelope) with the female character (yes they feel like bad actors rather than real people) doing a voice over about 'her feelings' you really don't care... it sounds scripted and insincere.The only character who's 'The Hills' style interesting is Frankie... a surfer dude.Several of the gay characters are interesting as are the Heidi & Spencer clones (again names elude me).Doubt this will have a second series... unless as I say they introduce a stronger female lead and more dynamic second leads.Everyone in their own way is 'nice' as real life persons... but rewatch 'The Hills' and see what a pale imitation of that show this is.",False
4,1,Nothing Short of Awful. Makes me want to gouge my own eyes out.,RockyVitarelli,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where do I begin? This show is many things, entertaining is not one of them. The sin this television show is most guilty of is the lack of television. Where is the sandblasting hookers? Where is the heavy narcotic use? Where is the insane fight moments where a man drives his own head into a wall after a coke enthralled night? I'll tell you where, NOWHERE. There is absolutely nothing to watch in this show unless you like to watch privileged pratty twenty somethings have the romantic lives of a middle schooler and then ""work"" at a used job that a middle schooler should have also as they mostly do nothing but gossip and whine about what melodrama just happened the previous night. It's so boring that it became work to merely finish it, work that was probably more grueling and laboring than any of the cast's ""job"" at dockers. Nothing quite like watching a bunch of out of touch college kids piss and moan over some lobster sandwiches and rose amirite? If I was to truly review the show cast member by cast member I would need my own column in the New York Times. I wish I could implement a ""like counter"" to truly have scientific evidence of the casts lack of grasp on the English language. I have talked to carrots with more of a personality than the characters on this show. They think what they do is in anyway ""trendy"" or ""cool"" but they honestly couldn't be more wrong. These people wouldn't know the real world if it sat on their face and here they are telling you how ""hard"" they work. Maybe if these people spent a day in the real world they would realize how devoid of a story their reality show has. It is impossible to really give any spoilers for this show because there is quite literally NO STORY. If I ever serve my country and I have a war prisoner the first thing I would do to torture him is make him watch this entire show from start to finish. I found it truly impressive just how vapid a hole group of humans can be. From top to bottom an absolute abomination I have zero positives to give you. I think it is maybe the worst show to ever get green lit and that is really saying something. But hey! If your friends with any masochists be sure to recommend this one to them.",False
5,2,Not Surprisingly Annoying,stl-52021,n/a,16/08/2025,"I imagine dozens of young people watching this, right after Big Brother. And hey, the writing had to be really simple; just insert the word ""like"" into the script at every fifth word. Like, I was like the eye candy is great but otherwise the show is beyond dumb.",False
6,2,Among The Worst Things on Television,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Jersey Shore for the Hamptons. I watched this reality show mostly because I lived in Southampton and worked in Sag Harbor for several years and I wanted to see how much has changed and what has stayed the same. This is the worst of reality TV in the sense that ii is so clear everyone is playing ONLY to the cameras. There is no sense of lack of awareness of the cameras, which is the essence of good reality TV. The characters are vapid. The filing and landscapes are the best part.",False
7,7,Easy Summer binge,Farfallina78,n/a,16/08/2025,"For anyone who loved Laguna Beach back in the day, this is the GenZ version. Yet not that annoying lol. You really have to like this type of throwaway ""reality"" type of show, but there's nothing awful about it. A bunch of early 20-somethings living their non-guido summer lives. Some drama never changes from generation to generation. Nice shots of the Hamptons, the homes and perfect to mindlessly watch with a cold cocktail. Ilan is a good looking guy and his father even moreso.",False
8,1,Seriously,katieknapek,n/a,16/08/2025,"With so much falseness happening here between plastic surgeries,and people acting like they are 20 years younger than they are still living off of mommy and daddy's money. Could only stomach 5 minutes before had to turn it off!! Horrible wannabes!!!!!",False
9,7,Not too bad,tobimmeyer,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you liked The Hills or Siesta Key, you will enjoy this show. It's very similar with college aged people making their way in life. I love reality TV and will watch next season if it gets a second season.",False
10,2,Toxic!,seattlemft,n/a,16/08/2025,"Am I the only one seeing the HUGE domestic violence red flags with Hunter?! Run girl, run. Between Hunter and Reid, the toxicity here is so bad. I hope that production realizes all the DV markers showing here and intervenes when they need to.",False
11,9,Surprisingly down to earth,LAgirl94,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI expected the bratty out of touch rich kids. But they are down to earth. Normal reality TV drama. Their clearly not poor but they aren't flaunting money, cars, and homes. Hunter is scary and toxic. Incredibly immature. Emelye is his puppy. Both boring as heck and take the fun out of the show with the violent threats and just being together ALL the time. Reid is an awful person. The rest of the cast is fun. They are young people starting life. I'm sure in 10 yrs they will look back and cringe and their kids will make fun of them.",True
12,7,Mindless tv (in a good way),sweetcandie008,n/a,16/08/2025,Interesting to see they extreme rating swings. I think it's getting under rated considering what the genre is. It's exactly what you'd expect. A reality show about rich teenagers in the hamtpons. Is there drama? Hooooohhhhh yeah. Is there storyline? Not really. I do like how realistic everyone looks though.And poor Ilan Hahahha he gives off major tool vibes but he does seem like a generally good person who just keeps getting hate from very over dramatic insecure guys and that makes for pretty good tv.Give it a one episode view. I don't think the 1/2 star ratings are very fair. It's like they expected to be watching an Oscar nominated movie. Its not that and shouldn't be rated in comparison.,False
13,3,Get rid of Reid and Hunter,medmalpara,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI get reality TV needs drama but show would be better if you got rid of two face Reid and loser wannabe Hunter.Hunter is trying too hard to try to stand out in hopes of standing out in reality TV. He's just a bully and a loser boyfriend.Reid seems like he's study reality TV and thinks being a lazy, two face, backstabbing loser (misery loves company) will bring him a real life.It's a little funny how Hunter is so self-centered yet intimidated by Ilan. He's so intimidated by Ilan that his response is to act like an a-hole and comment on every word Ilan makes. If he didn't care like he claims, he would he up on his a** interested on everything he does or says.Add better people and maybe show will have more success.",True
14,1,"Good location, bad casting",Roddingham,n/a,16/08/2025,You don't watch a show with Hamptons in the name to see 18 yr olds work counter service and food truck jobs. Even my 17yr old daughter yawned at it. Not sure who this show was made for but if you like Summer House this will bore you.,False
15,4,A not very interesting show about not very interesting people,japrufrog,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can only assume that a member of the cast is closely related to one of its producers. This same content has been mined many times before by other, better shows.Some may feel that watching this show is like hanging out with friends; those people should find more interesting friends.",False
16,9,Poor Ilan,tazzyd-90073,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love car crash tv, this was a quick binge watch.If you are looking for something deep and thought provoking, you are in the wrong place.Good fun, summer drama of locals of the Hamptons. Sunday, hangover, binge tv.Enjoy.",False
17,10,The Perfect Summer Show,leahvoiceover,n/a,16/08/2025,"Every summer I look for a binge-worthy show that gives me perfect summer-vibes - be it reality, or drama. Unfortunately, we are already almost in August and I had no such luck until... ALAS!...a new title appeared on my Prime Home Screen. ""Forever Summer"" it said, *Gasp* I thought.... this sounds intriguing - ""5 Minutes!"" I told myself ""I'll give it 5 min to get me, if not I'll turn it off"". Long story short, 48 Hours later and I've finished the szn - lol. So yah, that's that. Please renew for a 2nd szn - this show is serving perfect summer nostalgia and in this world of pure nonsense we just need some positivity! :)",False
18,10,I loved it,wallerjames,n/a,16/08/2025,"Very simple and entertaining. Drama spiced things up and I honestly enjoyed it. I thought they could have added another episode or two, because it wrapped up quick. Overall, I highly recommend it. Extremely addicting, entertaining, and interesting. Would recommend.",False
19,10,So fun,leinadhl,n/a,16/08/2025,"Usually not super into reality. Surprisingly well made, kept my attention the whole time!!! Ilan was hilarious. Drama was well handled. Season 2 please.",False
20,10,Please make a season 2!!,moriahrking,n/a,16/08/2025,Only watched it at first because I follow Emelye on tik tok but I got hooked! My boyfriend was annoyed when he saw I was watching a reality tv show but I noticed he low key got hooked when he was trying to get deets on the parts he missed out! I love the characters and I love how there's drama but at the end of the day they just want to have good vibes! Please please approve a season 2!!,False
21,10,sm fun! :)),tayoadeniyi-72573,n/a,16/08/2025,"Came across on amazon prime and caught my eye, great summer binge to keep you pumped throughout summer 💗. Hope to see more of them & defo deserves more series!",False
22,10,Your new guilty pleasure,cichlidfenderk,n/a,16/08/2025,Brought all sorts of Laguna Beach vibes with an east coast twist. The drama left you wanting more. And I'll be highly disappointed if I don't get to see them for 10 more seasons as they grow up and continue to lead messy lives that bring me all sorts of entertainment.,False
23,9,"Pretty decent, I would watch a 2nd season",areyhoncollick,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIt started off very slow and the drama was very pointless, but you do start to become attached to certain characters and their relationships towards the end. The only drama that was interesting was Ilan and Lottie's beef. The only interesting and real drama on the show. Seems kind of scripted at some points so I hope season 2 feels more ""real"" and natural. I think we need to see the cast do more things ( I'm sure Covid is why everything seemed limited to the same locations so I understand) in the area. It doesn't give off Hampton vibes, it seems like it could be set in any beach touristy area. We need to see what sets the show apart from others just like southern charm has a very distinct vibe. Avery, Ilan, and Frankie really stand out, but I also really see potential with Milo and Lottie becoming stars of the show too. I hope if the show gets a season 2, they focus a bit on the divide in the group and how it appears to be two different friend groups coming together.",True
24,10,Perfect nostalgia!,jblight-37041,n/a,16/08/2025,Wow have I missed shows like this. Laguna beach meets the summer I turned pretty. Easy binge. It has the perfect mix of drama and relatability. The kids are sweet. It's refreshing.,False
25,10,Love it!,reidrubio,n/a,16/08/2025,Super entertaining I loved the chemistry between the cast. Definitely would recommend. The drama was good but not over the top and everyone did an amazing job.,False

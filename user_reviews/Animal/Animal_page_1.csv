1,8,"Eat Healthy, Get Healthy",FRANK_DUTRO,n/a,17/08/2025,"Great introduction for the human appropriate diet. With all the sickness we have today, this documentary will show you a way to good health. It is good to have a long health span. It is ok (and doable) to die young as late as possible. As I do tell my veggie only friends, my diet too is also 100% plant based. The animals eat the plants, then I eat the animals! I have no interest in joint replacements, cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardio issues, etc. All of it can be avoided. I have no interest in seeing doctors and going to hospitals. The best way to treat cancer is not get it in the first place. Documentaries like this can help show you a way to live well your whole life. It is ok to be well educated with regards to health and wellness so that you can live the best possible life here on planet Earth. The professionals in this documentary are real doctors and nutritionists. Highly educated. They treat thousands of people a year. They know what they are talking about. Hope you enjoy this documentary and share it with all your friends and family (at least the ones who you want to have a long, healthy life!).",False
2,10,"""The Carnivore Slam Dunk""",TonyL-198,n/a,17/08/2025,"Spoiler"" The carnivore slam dunk?""To be straight up on my liking of the major characters of the documentary, it was Dr Anthony Chaffee that led me to the #carnivore #carnivorediet way of life when he appeared on 60 minutes Australia. I've shared his YouTube ""Plants are trying to kill you"" countless times, and I'm often the butt of jokes, when colleagues munch on almonds (How's the cyanide in the tone of the Kerrigan Family) or a bowl of a Pizza Hut decorative material turned superfood I. E Kale""I'm now two years into this WOL with stunning results.""I've borrowed Judy Cho's book ""Carnivore Cure"" twice and use her information to post on a regular basis. We've gone hard on pork belly in this house, and I can dazzle and simultaneously bore anyone on the nasties in plants. I devoured Shawn Baker's book ""The Carnivore Diet"" and lap up his content.I purchased the same ice cream maker that Dr Kiltz uses and in summer we'll be churning out his famous ice cream recipe. His YouTube videos are hilarious at times and are worth watching.Dr Ken Berry just oozes commonsense and is one of my favourites on social media. Just a great no BS approach and his story is inspiring.Confirmation bias anyone? Hell no, I'm living it and get the compliments on a regular basis . Those who I haven't seen since I adopted this WOL, are stunned at my transformation.The information in the movie is just scientific enough to maintain the entertaining flow, the breakfast cereal piss take I found hilarious as I often tell the story, when the crunch is on. The cholesterol myth delves just enough into a topic that could span another documentary of it's own.""Animal. Knows what it wants to be and maintains it throughout"".It's informative, riveting, entertaining, provocative, forthright and most importantly it will accelerate momentum towards a healthier and less costlier life style and ultimately the proper human diet..""It's for mine the carnivore slam dunk""10/10.",True
3,4,I'm actual pro carnivore...,thomas-582,n/a,17/08/2025,"... based on my personal experience with a diet, due to health issues.This documentation, however, is too superficial in my opinion. Instead of being fact-driven, it seems to aim for being polarizing.I get that doing so can bring the necessary attention to a topic, but in the end, I would've rather wished for a documentation that I could give to all my loved ones, to bring a different perspective of what food is into their lives and rethink what we've been taught - since a lot of what is being taught in the carnival diet does make sense, once you get over what you've been told for your whole life.",False

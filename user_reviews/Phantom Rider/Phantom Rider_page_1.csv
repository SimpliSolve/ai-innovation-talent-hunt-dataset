1,7,Real or Fake?,praisngod82,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't figure out if it's completely real (I've seen some of the ufo footage on mainstream tv) or partially real/partially fake or mostly fake? I'm going to have investigate.........oh,oh!",False
2,8,Tip of the Spear,klisenby1,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciate the subject matter and content of this film. The film definitely left me intrigued and wanting more. I would recommend watching this movie despite some of the negative reviews so that you can decide for yourself if it is a piece of Fiction or Non Fiction. Either way, it was entertaining.",False
3,6,Annoying editing,tknappedu,n/a,16/08/2025,"Lots of news clips to try to prove the point of Skyfall, but what the heck is the point of playing a clip/narrator three and four times in a row? Seriously, do they think we struggle understanding English with only one take?",False
4,1,Paranoid Disillusionment,rahn_enterprises,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis sequel to Sir No Face and Two Face The Grey is another totally fake documentary. I honestly do not know why I waste my time watching his ""films"". They're iPhone recorded videos. With some news clips thrown in. This is supposed to prove that aliens exist and that there are secret government agents looking to kill him for releasing all this ""proof"". It does nothing to prove anything. Who honestly records every conversation with their spouse? Who always has their phone recording every second away from home?Another major annoyance is his need to have clips repeat itself a dozen times, a dozen times, a dozen times, a dozen time! A 5 minute fake documentary stretched to over an an hour.Don't waste your time! Tons of real proof out there, but not in this.",True
5,3,Entertaining but has major flaws,ForgottenGrunt,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerWhile I enjoyed the last doc, Two Face: The Grey, I feel like this one was unnecessary. Phantom Rider was somewhat entertaining but I feel as though they were reaching just to put out another movie.Spoiler alert!!!!My main problem with this doc is the end. So this Skyfall guy has since ""evidence"" proving the existence of aliens and now wants to meet you in person and you say you aren't sure. That screams red flags to me because you've made two documentaries about the subject and now all of a sudden just say no I'm good. Before the ""well people are following them"" arguments start I want to say that if they are being followed and threatened that means they are on to something. I feel like they are just milking this subject for all they can.Again entertaining but has major flaws.",True
6,10,Could It Be An Eye Opening Truth?,azboy-94677,n/a,16/08/2025,Being a fan of the mysteries of the universe this film might be a valuable wake up call for the people watching. The things that are described in the show could easily happen and knowing our governing bodies I wouldn't put it past them. Nice work Chad and I can't wait until the next one. Stay Safe!,False
7,1,Wow,justinwegner1,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie is the biggest crock. I watched the entire ""trilogy"" in one day. The first one by itself seemed believable until you start to think about it more. And than you watch the second one and this one and with each installment it ruins any credibility. The stuff in this one and the previous film have been so debunked it's laughable.And if any of this was real and that urgent why would you end your third film on a cliffhanger? If this was that deadly why even put it out there? And once you put it out there whybwould you stop?So clearly fake.",False
8,3,It tries....,becausejamie,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerIm sure this documentary style resonates with his fans, but overall the editing and vfx interfere with determining the truth. Their lack of story telling, videography, and tech beings me to the conclusion their podcasters wanting to a buck.",True

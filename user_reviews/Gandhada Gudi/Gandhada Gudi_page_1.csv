1,8,Appu Lives On!,chand-suhas,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gandhada Gudi is less a documentary, more of a personal travel vlog featuring Puneeth Rajkumar and it felt all too special for this very reason. Having to be part of his journey through those must visit places in Karnataka, the way he eagerly enjoys each one of these places was a sight to behold. Every time it started feeling like a documentary, the travel vlog narrative takes over and all the places visited are edited seamlessly to ensure there is a proper flow throughout.This was a very special film so it will be tough to review without revealing anything and it is because, it is more important to experience it on the big screen rather than listing out the places they visit here itself. The songs have been inserted well. Once again, getting to know Appu closely, to see him be ""him"" on screen as enjoyed everything like an innocent child, all I can is thanks to the makers for giving us audience an opportunity to witness it and be part of the journey.I wish there was no interval. A film like this didn't need one. But again this is not a film to talk to critique based on first half and second half. The fans at the premiere show were loud initially but even they understood, the best way to enjoy every frame, every shot of the film is without making that noise. They couldn't contain their excitement at times yet they were thoughtful about enjoying every frame Appu is on and the importance to be able to listen to every word he utters. It is that important a film and I will definitely want to thank the fans for being that understanding in a sold out show.",False
2,10,Loved it !!,uday-veeranala,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved the documentary, I was bit skeptical to watch documentary as I don't understand the language much, but a very well composed and portrayed film. I would say must watch for everyone who loves nature and who are not much into nature too, this documentary probes one to appreciate the nature and how lucky we are to live in this wonderful world. I'm sure Puneeth fans love it more to see through his eyes. Amogh has documented and narrated experiences very well, great photography and outstanding music by Anjaneesh throughout. Overall a great experience of 96 minutes makes one to enjoy the beautiful visuals, appreciate nature and hopefully do something to to preserve it.",False

Good background score by ajaneesh and prateek sheety work is superb. Eventough it docu drama it connectes to you and is very engaging and Puneeth sir's humour is something we definitely miss in the future. Puneeth sir is among us with our beautiful nature around us and it is our duty to protect it and conserve it. Lastly hatsoff to the direction department and director amogh varsha for capturing our raw nature and showing Puneeth sir as himself.",False

5,10,Loved the movie,prakashjogad,n/a,16/08/2025,"With very good social message to conserve forest and nature, this movie is the best bet for Oscar from India.Movie is not a regular masala movie but much more than that, it doesnt bore you like documentary movies, last 30 minutes you will involve yourself deep to appreciate nature around you and think of giving back to nature.This is best tribute from Punith for himself, no superstar would dare to go such a documentary, with so much humility he has explored our nature,culture..hats off.Its not a must watch, but you will miss a very good movie or not appreciating the very good efforts from the team.",False
6,9,Experience the Karnataka you don't know.,vinaykumarkg-64954,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's not a movie or a documentary, it's a feeling it's pure raw joy you get from truly enjoying the journey. And this film has not been acted but lived. It truly is an experience watching the film. It begins and ends with the nature. The cinematography is fantastic and the locations chosen for the shoot are some of the unseen treasures that should and must be left as it is.Then again it finds a special place in my heart for various reasons. The movie is also some of the final memories that will be preserved and cherished for generations to come. And Sir we thank you for all your contribution.",False
7,10,Absolutely wonderful movie.,praveennandi-08176,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely wonderful movie.... which shows the karnataka wildlife n western Ghats beautifully üòç... Dr. Puneet Rajkumar we miss you..
Kannada Film Industry is in its peak time...
It's not a movie to rate or review !! A PURE SOUL that can be adored and experiencedThe first 15 minutes of the movie give you the impression that Appu is still here and that he hasn't left, which generates a WOW fan moment. You'll soon begin to understand that nature has freely provided everything to you and that we haven't returned anything to it. Appu has lived his dream through this movie which has great storytelling and teaches us about forest conservation. Towards the end of the film, especially the final five minutes, you start to feel...
Please take your entire family to watch it on big screen and pay
tribute to our APPU. We love you, APPUSee you until we meet again!",False

9,10,Appu to the power of infinity,manjuachar-99252,n/a,16/08/2025,"Puneeth Rajkumar who we fondly call as Appu has made such a great attempt to show Karnataka's wide diversity and rich forest, never done before. This is a great journey we can witness through Puneeth's eyes. Great collaboration from Amoghavarsha, Prateekh Shetty, Ajaneesh and the entire team. This is not the documentary, it is an experience to cherish the whole life, Ver well scripted, cinematographed and indulges you as if you are sitting next to Puneeth and become part of the journey. Congrats to Ashwini for completing and bringing to the audience. This is going to be an everlasting gift for us.",False

11,5,"There is nothing exciting, other than wathing PK",praveenkkr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched it in theatre with full family, including 2 small kids.Was expecting ""Wild Karnataka"" kind of experience, but it just fell flat. Especially, kids were utterly dissapointed.There is nothing exciting, other than watching PK.Few scenes are really heart wrenching, especially the scene where Appu says ""vapas manege hogbeku, movie ardha agirodu complete maadbeku"". Such a loss to KFI, Karnataka and humanity.Seems like the movie was only partially shot and somehow they managed to drag it for 90 minutes and released it in theatres.Not even a single close-up shot of any animal. There is no clarity for scenes, there is no sequence of events. Narration jumps from one place to another in a random manner. The underwater scene is just 5-10 mins!Even the cameras used seems to be not upto the mark. Music is underwhelming.10/10 to Appu.0/10 to the Director and technical team.",False
12,10,It's not just a movie it's a emotion Karnataka one state many worlds,Malohaarg,n/a,16/08/2025,It's a grand spectacle to watch it shows the rich heritage of Karnataka forest our own gandadagudi appu no words just witnessed a grand visuals on big screen Karnataka one state many worlds best visuals to watch with family and children it's beyond star and all loved the movie appu played his own role with no make up it is his dream project after his father and brother he carried his family legacy Kannada Kannada Kannada all our world from now sandalwood going to be a next level in up coming days it's just a begging wait a watch sandalwood going to rule world cinema finally gandadagudi is emotion to watch with family and friends.,False
13,10,A Rare Gem of a Movie !,findsanmic,n/a,16/08/2025,"(Befitting last journey of a Super Star and the philosophical backdrop is freakish, but very touching, indeed)A moving story of self revelation.An extraordinary journey to the life and back.An inevitable exploration to the truth of the nature, or rather, nature of the truth.A humble act of submission to the beliefs and traditions.A beautiful amalgamation of the bliss and the blessing.A one time opportunity to uncover the Universal Human within you.A grand celebration of being you.An intense devotion to the times and the depths of the unknown.Profound gratitude to this little pause called LIFE !Gandhada Gudi has more to offer.Go discover !",False
14,10,A hero is like water ! Its eternal,navendu_krishnan,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gandhada Gudi is the first documentary which I watched in theatres, and I feel perfectly happy.Directed by Amoghavarsha a wildlife photographer, GG is a journey through all terrains of Karnataka, from dry forests through rain forests and parallelly with the coastal areas ending in Decan landscapes.Visuals and Music is stunning, Amoghavarsha captured the best shots and sceneries of unseen Karnataka wildlife
Yes ! It is the last movie which we can see with Puneeth, since its not a movie, but his real footage, we can get to know him as a human for the first and last time.GG with puneeth is fascinating, his experience, stories and his personality will prove he is not just a hero but an eternal hero.I am amazed that house Amoghavarsha can take a documentary more entertaining than a movie itself. Its like a Indian David Attenberough movie.More over , Huge respect to the GG team that they didnt put Puneeth's demise as a promoting factor for this movie, the movie ends without a farewell note , which is exactly the world needed.Its informative for all ages , because it explains the nature, diversity of animals in the karnataka forests. It also promotes forest conservation, plastic ban and mainly to respect the nature.Choosing puneeth as a co-companion for Amoghavarsha's journey was the best choice, the puneeth which we see in GG is just a normal human without the title of Powerstar.The scripting is invoking, there are many short poems which deeply touches the heart.Today is the first death anniversary of Puneeth
As the quote in GG by Amoghavarsha ""Now i got to know why Puneeth is true Hero, because A hero is like the water, its eternal""
A perfect 10 out of 10, and happy to watch this in theatres.To all, dont miss this in theatre.",False
15,9,A beautiful experience,ashikdelamp,n/a,16/08/2025,"This docu-drama can be mistaken for a wildlife documentary from the trailer, but is truely a cinema which celebrates Karnataka's diverse natural heritage and an unforgettable experience through the eyes of our beloved ""Appu"". It's a total visual grandeur that make us Kannadiga's proud of our land, coupled with very beautifully composed bgm. There are - candid conversations which makes us smile unknowingly; small tales which makes us curious while listening; social messages which is not forced but need us to understand; song bites which celebrates the culture depicted; moments which connects to Appu sir and make us teary eyed. His respect and concern towards the nature and cultural heritage make us feel pride in saying he will always be our role model. This movie also felt like one last conversation personally with our Rajaratna. Just can't thank enough for this project to Amoghavarsha. Thank You for this beautiful experience.",False
16,10,Appu forever,rjnk-93782,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gandha Gudi, the docudrama directed by Amoghavarsha, holds a special place in the fans hearts. However, apart from the emotional pull, the docudrama itself was inspirational, with over 50 paid premiere venues sold out. Several celebrities attended the screening, and the reviews on social media for the shows standalone merit are positive. Some said that Puneeth sharing his joys and fears on the camera was priceless, while some pointed out that watching Rajkumar in a new way was delightful. Film critic Anup Bhandari wrote on Twitter that watching Gandhada Gudi was an experience beyond reviews and ratings. He said that for those close to the actor, the docudrama was as if he was picking up their last conversation. He further said the show was a peek into the actor's life which portrays the true self of the much loved actor. Actress Ramya noted that Appus sense of humour taught empathy and the inward journey. She said the movie was thought provoking and beautiful, calling Puneeth a universal human and a true hero. Love u appu boss appu forever.",False
17,10,A GREAT CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE,rkashyap621,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kudos to Amoghavarsha to bring this cinema in a documentary style. The visuals makes you immerse yourself in the locale. The music too keeps gives us an ambience to seep in to the journey of Appu and Amogh.As we go through the journey we will get to see many wonderful locales spreadout in our Karnataka which are breathtakingly amazing. Also we get a peep into the mind and spirit of Appu, which is heartwarming and emotional.As an animal lover myself can evidently say, it was a treat to watch them onscreen.This is one of a special cinema no should miss out. It will be an experience you will cherish and come out of the hall with happiness and calmness and a special emotion will be filled in your mind and heart.",False
18,10,Puneeth proves why the whole state loves his family,parikshithmj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watch it if you want to know how beautiful Karnataka is. I don't think most are aware of how people around forests are an important part of the ecology and how well they are connected to it. Most documentaries we come across does good job at displaying the wildlife, but this docudrama goes one step ahead and shows how humans interaction has a major role in maintaining it without getting preachy. It merely looks like a casual conversation but in turn has so much depth if one can understand it.Puneeth has played his career best role in this - the reason is simple. He is himself, and is there a bigger real life star than him in whole of India ? Answer is probably no. No big star would dare to work on such an idea and this movie is his farewell gift to us, which would be remembered for decades and will continue to educate young minds about the responsibility which everyone has. Watch it and I am sure you will walk away with pride and joy of being close to Puneet.",False
19,10,A dream world of Punith and A dream to Everyone,ganepall,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is more than a documentary, A dream world of Dr. Punith Rajkumar who shares his experience with Amoghvarsha. A well made movie with great Picturisation and scenes. Amoghvarsha shown the beauty of Gandadagudi. Karnataka. Punith has done everything within the short period of time. May be God had planned his life. A few people can dream like Punith, He Says in every frame Nature is our future, Protect it. Save it for future generations. Being a Nature Enthusiasist, A nature lover I can say a big thanks to Amoghvarsha who takes us to the dream world of PunithA well executed movie. Everyone should watch this masterpiece. Punith is a role model to everyone, He was a great human being, His visions were amazing to future generations. Just watch this on big screen experience the world of nature.",False
20,10,let your life be our dream,sainasrikm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Universal man;

21,10,"End of an era, beginning of a legend.",sujanfaster,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was overwhelmed with a mixture of emotions as I walked off the movie hall after watching Gandhadha Gudi. We were all pretty much aware of what we were going to witness by the promotions that we had seen so far and also the whole vibe around this film. Amoghavarsha has directed Wild Karnataka before and worked with the biggest wild documentary players like BBC and National Geographic. In this film, he brings all of his experience and enhances that with a beautiful narration paired with the humble aura of Dr Puneeth Rajkumar.This movie falls somewhere in between a docu-drama and a documentary. There are few directed shots and added humour but it is not melodramatic like most of the documentaries that we generally see on Netflix these days. The movie has top notch cinematography (which shouldn't be a surprise) and the background score along with the songs add to a complete experience. This is a representation of Karnataka wildlife which has everything to reach the masses. Dr Puneeth Rajkumar with his curiosity and innocence is a representation of all of us who are watching the movie. It is so heartening and disheartening at the same time to see his eagerness to learn new things and experience this life to the fullest. Along with showcasing the beauty of things, the movie also adds elements of awareness about conservation.Gandhadha Gudi is an experience tailored for everyone and if you are from Karnataka, you will watch this with your head held high and a slightly teary eye. Although James was Puneeth Rajkumar's last commercial movie that he has 'acted' in, Gandhadha Gudi is a movie where has 'lived' in. This may be his last appearance on a big screen, but this experience is first of its kind and I hope we get to see more of the unseen.",False
22,10,"Marvelous, Magnificent and Magical",vigan-78776,n/a,16/08/2025,"What an entertainer!!!! Yes I use the word entertainer for a docu drama which is considered as a bit boring concept that too from a superstar. But this movie once again shows that it is not cheap songs, provocative dance movements, dirty jokes, illogic tear jerkers and over-the-mill action sequences which has been long defined as entertainment. This movie shows how without all of the above a movie can not just entertain but also immerse you into it. Hats off to the director and the entire crew who have made this masterpiece. It is not just a journey into the woods but a spiritual journey that shows that Man-Nature-God are interconnected and that you are nothing but a part of nature and you gotta realize it soon and respect it. The movie makes you laugh, leaves you in awe and also teary eyed. Right from the word go, the director(who is also a wildlife explorer) takes you into his world. The title sequence takes you to a high and there is no looking back. The exceptional cinematography and music keeps you hooked to the screen. The movie just flows like a river uninterrupted. The last sequence where Puneeth fades away followed by the heart touching song to the end card- VishwaManava leaves you seated speechless and teary eyed. Words are short to write or speak about Puneeth Rajkumar. He just chose a perfect adieu to himself.",False
23,10,Incredible Karnataka is shown devinely,krishnaholla,n/a,16/08/2025,"Oh man, I'm not writing this because I'm from Karnataka or as a Puneeth Rajkumars fan... This has to be one of the best documentaries, this so well planned....
Just watch this documentary in a perspective where puneeth is literally you who has very less knowledge about a nature or a particular place or you are just a kid who is excited to explore and Amoghavarsha has a tons of knowledge and experiences ...he shares his beautiful memories and knowledge throughout the movie... It's a treat especially if you are the one who loves nature, and you have a special love or concern for the wildlife...
Different bits of Karnataka is so beautifully captured...As a kannadiga I'm proud of this documentary and it feels sad and happy as its the last movie where we'll get to see puneeth ...I think at times you feel or certain scenes make you feel , maybe this was god's plan to make this movie his last... There is nothing negative about this documentary atleast for me.",False
24,10,Universal Human - Vishwa Manava,nirmalmaddy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just speechless.. words cannot express the feeling after watching this...This movie is going to be very close to Kannadigas and who are close to nature.Puneeth Rajkumar will live forever in memories and for his offerings as Universal Human i.e. Vishwa Manava in kannada.Spectacular photography, no commercialisation , marvelous experiance, excellent background music.Great to see and understand the efforts of forest officials and gaurds gaurding the forests and the impact it could have if afforestation is not maintained.And thank you so much for showing us different landscapes in Karnataka which we were not aware about.Thanks for the complete crew who worked on this project.",False
25,10,Heavens that Karnataka is...,rajivkuin,n/a,16/08/2025,"First, let me tell a small story. In my town in Punjab, a very handsome, healthy young man suddenly started to meet people he did not meet for a long time. He even went on to make amends with the people he had some friction with. All of sudden he was no more. Talk of the town was that his soul knew he was going and it wanted him to be remembered nicely by the people.Now, a reason to mention this here is that Puneeth Rajkumar had absolutely no reason to make this documentary. I did not know him at all but after watching this, I googled about him, and turns out he was a megastar and was so busy with his movies that a documentary that would not only consume a lot of time but can be of great risk to his life and health, do not fit into his schedule. There is no way such a person would walk on his feet all over the deep forests to make this documentary.However, as evident from the documentary he loved Karnataka so much and wanted to present it in the best possible way to the world. I believe his soul knew he was going, so he had to stop shooting for 3 movies and took this project on priority.This documentary is the best of the best ever made. I have watched 100s of documentaries on all kinds of subjects and a maximum of them being shot in the wild but I can not remember anything matching the class of this documentary.It presents a side of Karnataka that can only be compared with the Pandora of Avatar movie.The unbelievable hidden beauty of the state is on display here, however, this is not a documentary about wildlife and the nature of Karnataka but he very carefully made it about the character of Karnataka.He goes on to visit the smallest of the villages in the forest area and meets the poorest of the people and you get to know that those small villages are heaven and those poor people are so amazing people.This is must watch the movie for everyone to understand how to present your State/Country to the world.Must watch and this will make you fall in love with Karnataka.",False

1,5,Title Is Misleading,cyifly-2,n/a,16/08/2025,"The title makes it sound like there is going to be some insight to managing money. But the whole show centers around people who already make a lot of money and telling them not to spend it to pay off debt or save. Not a novel concept. They should have concentrated more on the average, middle-class person and how they can budget better. Only 1 couple like that.. There should have been a whole series of people with their income and how to help them to straighten out their finances. The host is a nice, media-friendly guy, but the people on the show are not even likable. Nobody cares about people with so much money that they don't even know where it goes. The one nice, middle-class couple were the only realistic ones in the show by the time I turned it off in episode 4.",False
2,6,"A great idea, poorly structured and executed",bensmithson-97085,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a great idea for a show. Come into peoples homes and lives to help them sort out their finances. I always enjoyed Suze Ormon's tough love in this area 20 years ago. There are some bits of great advice here, like how much money you should pay financial advisers, and how your financial situation should look if you are wanting to buy a home.However there are a lot of very frustrating problems with this series that should have been caught by producers before it went to air.Firstly, new people with money problems are added, multiple times per episode. There are so many different people being 'helped' at once its impossible to remember who was doing what. There isn't time to get to know someone before yet another new person is introduced. Instead, each episode should be one person/pair helped from start to finish. The host keeps introducing new people as we forget about those who are mid-help. What happened to the woman who wanted to open a restaurant? Was there a conclusion beyond ""maybe I'll do it next year""? People just seem to fade away without anything having changed. Where is the follow-up? Did the gymnast sell her condo?Secondly, the title is misleading. This should have been called 'How to live your rich life"". Most of the people being helped are already wealthy, they just overspend so have money problems. There's little advice about how to get rich, only advice about how to stop wasting money which is very obvious advice.Third, there's far too much time wasted on flattering the host. The endless slow motion walks of him down a street are completely unnecessary and add nothing. Do people really stop him on the street to ask for photos? He's not Beyonce. Viewers want his advice, not his image.If these three problems could be fixed this would be a great show.",True
3,6,Some contestants are so irritating,srvivrsu1999,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am on the first show and I was very interested until you brought on the lame over indulged woman who gets $25,000 for CHILD support and not only throws it away on herself but then whines she can't pay her child's tuition. Inconceivable to those potential viewers who are actually struggling to stick with a budget and learn to direct small investments for their future. She is an absurd caricature. Also, the couple with the stay at home Dad. Respect a dad who looks after his children but probably needs to work outside the house on singular contracts and get daycare. Perhaps the wife could split work from home and office . Gosh, comprises!Cry me a river.",False
4,6,I learned nothing!,apooos,n/a,16/08/2025,"I started watching the show in hope I'll learn a few tricks/tips about investment with the money I have saved, not learn elementary class mathematics. If you're spending more than you're making, well, surprise surprise! You'll be in debt. To pay off your debt quicker, what do you do? More surprises! Cut off expenses and pay off more every month for the debt.If you pay 1000 instead of 700 you'll get rid off your debt in 13 years instead of 18, mind-blown? Yeah, not really.The only thing I liked about the show is that these people do need help and glad someone decided to do so. And probably that I have better financial intelligence in my mid 20s than people in their 40s.",False
5,7,Some Financial Lessons By A Level-Headed Presenter,t-d-t-m82,n/a,16/08/2025,I was surprised by the lack of knowledge of basic money structures and financial awareness by contestants on this show.The presenter is very articulate and clear-spoken and doesn't use jargon so that was a highlight. However the people chosen are very frustrating.I don't understand how you can go to college; hold up x amount of incomes and then not be able to sustain a living despite being in an extremely fortunate position.The other gripe is so many contestants are also mainly on insane income structures which most of us would not aspire to so yes it's very possible for them to 'Get Rich' if they realised how to budget.The concept is a bit tired with so many self-help guidelines out there but I really liked the presenter. He's America's Martin Lewis.It's clearly done for TV. The blonde women with an expensive sports' car and a nice house not understanding basic money was a real worry. Her daughter is a total star for recommending her to go onto this show but her ignorance with absolutely astounding.These people have obscene addictions and need financial help. Ramit Sethi saves otherwise mediocrity and ignorance and makes it an interesting and watchable show. It's a harsh reality show and there's far too many reality shows and it's nice to see a fresh concept.It's too long though. It drains on. Special kudos to Nicole for being the parent when her mother clearly as no boundaries or financial arcanum. Multiple times Ramit becomes a therapy councillor without realising it as people haven't adjusted to reality.They should teach basic finance and credit card management in schools and at colleges. I don't know why people are so unaware of the very basics yet spend so care-free.Ramit deserves great credit for helping people with their finances yet the actual programme is a hard watch. If he wasn't so likeable it'll be a 5. It's a worry that people aren't able to budget their cashflow. The people are very frustrating and childlike to watch. I would like him to help properly poor people and get them off the ladder. People unemployed.,False
6,6,Good practical advice,green-marlin,n/a,16/08/2025,"The show offers some practical tips on how to live within your means. He kind of presents himself as a Suze Orman solving the spending habits of everyday people. Basically it comes down to spending less in a year than you make and keeping the process habitual, which, initially, can be a huge shock to a lot of people and really make you re-evaluate everything from how many friends you keep to what you keep in the fridge, but if money management were taught in grade school people would be in much better financial positions overall.The problem I have with the show is that his definition of rich is different from mine. From the title, I thought that I'd be introduced to different revenue streams or investment concepts that could build passive income in a short period of time with the goal to live off these investments if I had to.",False
7,4,More a fashion show then advice how to get rich,kinga-benedek,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you want to see how to walk and dress if you want to get rich this show is for you :) just watch Ramit :) I always tell myself that I'm never ever watching a netflix documentary again and the I just hit play and I'm again disappointed. The advices were basic, good for people who have no clue what to do but nothing groundbreaking. I liked his approach to MLM. I hated the advice that if you want to feel comfortable and equal in a relationship you have to earn more money. Or if you want to live better get multiple jobs but I think maybe this is just the American way of living. The street interviews, what were those? Just filling I feel.",False
8,10,love the focus on money psychology,mtrask-57327,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think reviewer fearsrob completely misunderstood the premise. First of all, you're still not living your rich life if you're spending all $24k that you make each month. Second, the show is about a holistic approach to financial responsibility to build a life that is meaningful to you. AKA you could have millions of dollars but still have such a guilt centered money psychology that you would be crippled by anxiety over pennies spent on groceries. I really enjoy the show and Ramit's podcast too. It's really interesting to hear about different people's lives and how they deal with their money. I think it's really valuable to have these conversations on display.",False
9,1,Misleading name of the show,dishadeepa,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerDo not take unnecessary loans without a plan to pay off! Get the damn job if you are unemployed and healthy to work! Finished watching the series just now and all I saw was bunch of people that are financially illiterate and I learnt nothing new. This show did not teach 'How to get rich' in any of the episodes it is more of 'How to manage your finances' or 'How to pay off your debts' the answer to which is stop spending silly and save! If they called the show ""Financial literacy for you"" or something like that then I may not have watched or given it a better rating. All bad vibes of broke people. No one is getting rich here in the show. Netflix really need to stop spamming us with misleading documentaries.",True
10,10,Great Show,drvidhya,n/a,16/08/2025,"This show has so much to learn from. I don't understand these negative reviews. There are a lot of great concepts that help you think about investing smart, meaningful spending, enjoying your life, and saving for retirement. We all know these things but hardly ever consider how to balance it all. Quite literally, how he says- design your rich life. I got the book, too, to help with my finances. I am definitely hooked for life.I definitely hope they come up with more seasons and episodes. So much to learn. Brilliant advice about using a financial advisor by the hour vs % charges. Great ideas by the characters, too. Love it all.",False
11,3,Is focused more on the host than the finances.,SWDesertLady,n/a,16/08/2025,"It could have been OK and worth the time, had it actually really focused on showing what they were going to need to work on (each person) and what they did to change things. They did not do that. 80% (if not more) of the focus was on the host. I have to say most of his advice (what little they did actually say on the show) is very basic. Nothing new. Were I going to pay for any financial advice, I would not be paying him. If you want to watch a show that is more about the ego of the host, then this is the show for you. He is happy to keep showing himself and talking to the camera. Now if you want actual financial advice, information that can help you with your own life, look elsewhere. Seriously!",False
12,2,Ridiculous,smashingd,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a show about people that already have lots of money but they are stupid with it. Honestly it's a joke and a slap in the face to working class Americans. It's incredible to me how stupid people are with their money. Spend spend spend. Just a stupid show for stupid people. The most irritating was Frank. Seriously man pay your student loans. What an entitled arrogant annoying man.This is a show about people that already have lots of money but they are stupid with it.

13,8,Better than I expected,dsmwest95,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have seen countless series about personal finance including Dave Ramsey, Caleb Hammer, now this series from Ramit. It was quite refreshing and different, he plays a great listener and is not pushy (after all he has no actual vested interest in anyone's outcome). The series (I am currently on episode 5) has covered a wide variety of people from varying backgrounds and income levels, there are a lot of common threads. Nobody likes to talk about money!I have never heard anyone recommend an hourly advisor vs yearly fee before and it makes sense once you reach the seven figure range. It's basic math.Ramit doesn't shame anyone for renting either which was not expected.",False
14,1,Absurd,ovidiu-25199,n/a,16/08/2025,"So the show is not really about poor or average people getting a idea on how to get wealthy, its about rich people and they're clueless sense about spending money in short rich delusionists. The whole world has this concept of common sense that if I don't own someone or a entity money I don't go on shopping sprees or buy houses or yachts. Call it how to comfort poor rich American people, How to get rich tells a lie. (Characters needed to reach the 600 requirement Characters needed to reach the 600 requirement Characters needed to reach the 600 requirement Characters needed to reach the 600 requirement).",False
15,9,Deconstruct the relationship with your money (and your soulmate),sjfraga,n/a,16/08/2025,"A reality show about how to get what you want in life and what place money has in it (Spoiler Alert: yes, money matters but strangely it's not about quantity but planning)Through interviews and exercises with people in many different situations, we see Ramit (a financial ""counselor"") guiding decision-making around the core issues of his dreams and how to sustainably materialize them.In some points I was expecting an infomercial, but it never happened.It is entertaining and leaves you thinking. It proposes a great mix between Psychology, Economy and Happiness. A couple and young adults must see but others can take the advice.",False
16,2,Could have been good if it brings educational value,theemario,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPremise was right... it was needed... a show that can drive financial education on a wider scale, in a fun non-threatening way, which what alot of people in this world need... unfortunately, it doesn't teach you anything.... There's no actual financial planning advice here and how to actually implement some smart tactics...It ended up being way too focused on people, their characters, and their own problems.... How did the host help them? By just being generic... over the top generic... don't even get me started on how he convinced that girl to sell her newly bought home just to find an extra 500$ a month.... Horrible advice and I hope she didn't do that... obviously, the right financial advice here is to find a second job or start one on one tutoring...Only good thing about this show? It's 30 minutes an episode...",True
17,1,Phony Show by Phony MC with Phony Influencers,YYYYYYYYYYyyYYYYYYYYYYY,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did ya'll a favor and saw this show in advance to tell you to NOT WATCH THIS SHOW.1. Obvious stuff like ""oh don't spend money on games, foods blah blah"" - don't spend on things you WANT. Something we all learn in high school and college AND LIFE.2. This guy, Ramit, thinks he's a genius with money but, what he says and tells is finance 101 that we all already know of.3. This is the main reason I hate this show. THIS IS ANOTHER SHOW PROMOTING INFLUENCERS (what are they even influencing anyways? That term is so stupid). They apparently all have channels or personal start up business that they want to promote in this series.Just don't watch it. Stupid show.",False
18,9,Long-time fan of Ramit Sethi,cluuless,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have been a fan of Ramit Sethi since I was in college and paying for his Earn1k and Dream Job programs. Now, Earnable has changed what he is offering, but I still pay attention to his many email newsletters nonetheless. I have paid for some of the smaller programs as well.I saved up for Delegate and Done, and overall I read most of what he sends out. I have been enthralled by his podcast videos on YouTube as he explores whatever conflicts couples have when it comes to money. When I saw that his show was coming out, I paid for Netflix for the first time. I immediately watched the documentary Get Smart With Money including Mr. Money Mustache and Tiffany Aliche. There were other things that I had never opened, such as Wednesday and Bridgerton. Overall, I'm please with the value of having paid to watch Ramit's entire series. I can see that I will rewatch it in the future to continue to absorb things. I found it fascinating in the closing shots that Nathalie laughed about how sending her money to Ameriprise for them to manage it for 1% wasn't fixed yet. It is shocking that she's so financially illiterate when she can clearly sit down with her lovely and stable daughter Nicole to plug numbers into a spreadsheet. While Ramit says a Rich Life is lived outside of the spreadsheet, I'm definitely like the engaged dude who really enjoys saving and investing like a dragon atop of a hoard. I'm glad that pretty much all the couples made some kind of progress.",True
19,10,So intelligent but also so easy to understand,k-dance-72614,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ramit covers so many critically important financial topics in this show that unfortunately we never learn in school or from our parents. It's really interesting to see how many people never learned how to approach basic financial concepts like saving, credit cards, loans, etc.My favorite thing about Ramit is he doesn't come from a place of judgement or fear mongering. I love watching him dig into everyone's finances. He always has such insightful and intelligent points and breaks them down in a way that's really easy to digest and understand.If you liked this show, I highly recommend his book I will teach you to be rich!",False
20,2,Disappointed,draganaapp,n/a,16/08/2025,"Get smart with your money was so much better, you can really learn something. In this show, How to get rich, you don't get any advice really. Maybe it was explained to people in show, but we didn't see it. Ramit has behavior like love couch, kind of annoying. I didn't see any guidance. I watched whole season and. Sorry, your review is too short. It needs to contain at least 600 characters.Sorry, your review is too short. It needs to contain at least 600 characters.Sorry, your review is too short.

21,1,Just BAD,pharahuc-88744,n/a,16/08/2025,"AVOID THIS SHOW. I was hoping for sound financial advice, but got common sense advice for rich people that over spend. IT IS THAT BAD. This guy is worse than Suze Orman and that's BAD.I had high hopes to watch this, yet it ended up being about dumb stupid rich people that don't get they have to stop spending when they lose their income.Is anyone reading this stupid enough to spend 27k a month when your only income is 25k a month on child support for a 16 yr old girl and you know it is going to end soon?This is not sound advice and I could do better than this guy. UGH so frustrating. This guy got rich by making stupid people thinking he could make them rich;",False
22,10,Relatable and real money advice,sarahsarah-66548,n/a,16/08/2025,"Ramit gets into money psychology and helps viewers see that our money isn't just about numbers. He helps us see through a range of people's financial stories how to build a rich life that makes sense for YOU.He talks about the elusive myth of home ownership being the goal and and breaks down when it would actually be a good choice financially.I also love that he calls out percentage based financial advisors and helps viewers break out of archaic concepts of how to manage money.It's a fresh take on how to handle money, the concepts that made sense for parents and grandparents generations no longer apply and we need content like this to help us understand why.A must watch for anyone who wants to stop stressing about money!",False
23,3,"I tried, I really tried",zmos99,n/a,16/08/2025,"I just cannot imagine wasting anymore of my life watching the show, for a couple of reasons.It's true, too many of the hosts sentences begin with ""I"", ""Me"", ""My"". He simply spends too much time talking about himself, his opinions, his taste etc.But the thing that really blew my mind is when he recommended renting over homeownership! You've got to be kidding! His reasons for doing so didn't even make sense. It's like he had absolutely no training in finances whatsoever. I bought my condo 15 years ago and my monthly payment has not changed in 15 years, while all the rents in my area have skyrocketed. I couldn't believe my ears when he said that, and had to immediately turn it off.He's had some good ideas l, like paying off your credit cards. But beyond that, you really should not watch this show for good financial advice.",False
24,10,Points out really good things about finance,peltonenhannaeveliina,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched it all straight away and watching it from the opposite side of the world it showed me how different can it be. It gave me absolutely good points what to think and look into on my own behaviour with money.This program will absolutely help people with many different types of problem with money and things that has something to do with money. The whole season is ~4,6 hours so it gives a little sight about this and that but ofc it is that short it is impossible to drive deeep in to how to get rich. But this definitely will help many many people who are struggling. If you are in need of more information after this, Ramit has more content on his instagram and on his page.If you already are managing your moneys well, you probably still can find something new to your life from this. I love how it showed that how you use money, is not that simple, there is a lot do see ""under the surface"", the money psychology. Absolutely love it.",False
25,1,"Misleading, also some horrible advices",xjw1118,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOk so this guy, ramit sethi, goes around to visit different people with different problems to 'help them get rich'. Except. No one is getting rich who is not already rich. First episode included a couple who brings in like 25k a month!, another couple making potentially 250k a year give or take, and a lady who drives a Ferrari and lives in a mansion...these people simply spend too much money. This guy is not giving any useful or even helpful advice that people with common sense don't already know. On top of that, he is giving crap advice like never hire a financial advisor. Seriously...?? Does he think all rich people manage their money all by themselves??? What kind of stupid financial advice is that?? I feel like he's saying that because he couldn't pass his series 7. Either way. I looked him up on YouTube, he only has 200k something followers. Granted bigger following does not equate legitimacy, but smaller following def indicate that he is not adequately credentialed to have his own show where he goes around telling people to spend less than they make basically. Zero stars, thumbs down.",True

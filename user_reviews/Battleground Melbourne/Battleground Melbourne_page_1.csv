1,7,A necessary alternative viewpoint to mainstream coverage.,maxpugh-48104,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many others have said similar things so I'll try to keep it brief.this documentary isn't perfect, but it does a fairly good job of presenting an alternative view of events in Melbourne, free from an officialised, government based point of view. And that's important.the documentary is emotionally biased at times. The music is a good example of this. This tends to be a common trend though, and Sky News, ABC, both frequently do this. What's important is to concentrate on the facts presented. If you're in doubt, pause the video and go do some internet searching for verification.I wouldn't pay any attention to the 1 star reviews, they're likely grounded in their author's negative view of this documentary and it's creator (Topher Field) and a desire to smear an attempt to present an alternative view to the ""mainstream""Likewise, the 10/10 reviews are too positive. This documentary does have shortcomings!Watch the video with patience and an attitude of concerned interest. It's essentially a mix of video logging, street videography and perhaps some borrowed footage (who cares if it helps to deepen the narrative?).It presents some interesting background to mainstream news stories.It addresses the concerning willingness of the Andrews government to greatly reduce Melbournian's personal freedoms.And it importantly also shows that even among the police there were some who disagreed with ""the official narrative"".This is foremost a documentary about personal freedoms, and the right to disagree with your government, in a peaceful way, without having to fear that your government will punish you. Battleground Melbourne is proof that disagreeing with the government could, and did, result in punishment.",False
2,7,When the Government takes over,justbeme-95449,n/a,16/08/2025,How the events unfolded in Melbourne and what happens when the Government has too much control and acts against the people rather than on behalf of the people.,False
3,10,Truth Revealed,anne-157-26196,n/a,16/08/2025,I have watched in horror as my birthplace has become a dystopia. Thanks for documenting this travesty for all the world to see. Thanks to the brave souls willing to tell their stories.,False
4,10,If you want to know the truth here it is.,gilliesbmx,n/a,16/08/2025,"A wise man once said, the real skill of an intellectual is being able to entertain an idea or hear a story and not be consumed by it. Think for yourself, question authority.",False
5,1,Fairy Tales for Adults,yusop786,n/a,16/08/2025,If you're the type that is easily influenced and require someone to think for you; if you're into every conspiracy theory on the planet; if you still believe that Santa and the Easter Bunny Rabbit are real; then this tish is for you. Watch only if you accept that your IQ will be irrecoverably damaged.,False
6,10,True spirit of average Australians,ashleyjohnmcglashan,n/a,16/08/2025,"A Prefect doco on how close hundreds of thousands of Aussies have become in fighting in what they believe in, just like the stories of the ANZAC's in Egypt back in WW1, doing what they wanted and fighting for each other.",False
7,1,Recalcitrant nonsense,julz2009,n/a,16/08/2025,"A breathtakingly childish dirge of indulgent nonsense.Topher and his gaggle of dystopian gofundme misfitsThis production is certainly not a documentary, rather a collection of self anointed ""freedom fighters"" & citizen journalists whom have platformed themselves predominantly on social media by spreading misinformation and anti vaccine sentiment.A group focussed on rallying against community health, dividing community and manipulating their fringe following for profit, notoriety and facebook likes
Each of these participants have no qualifications in healthcare, nor are they accountable for the dangerous misinformation they distribute.A shared common theme the continued request for donations and the sale of merchandise from their manipulated following.Misinformation is a business model and a path well worn by the participants in this flaccid productionIn a time where misinformation is so very damaging to community health, and through history we have seen just how very destructive when distinct groups are targeted and manipulated, in particular far right extremismThis feature is in no way a factual representation of Melbourne, our experience through the pandemic, nor the sentiment of our community.This is a group of anti vaccination propagandists & opportunists playing on the fears of the marginalisedContent contributors... but a few...Carly Sodastrom

Far right wing extremist and serial pest, convicted of assaulting his former partner by throwing a chopping board at her, forever his legacyHow recalcitrant nonsense as Battleground Melbourne is celebrated as a work anything other than flippant dog whistling rhetoric would be extending it courtesy beyond endure.A complete montage of dystopian fantasy.",False
8,10,Life in Melbourne,denisonclydesdales,n/a,16/08/2025,"The rest of Australia has no idea what we went through. This tells is it all and it continues. Continues in our homes, down quiet alleys, in our workplaces and schools. Leave our kids the hell alone.",False
9,1,HOW DO I GET THAT TIME BACK........GARBAGE,ralphcoyote,n/a,16/08/2025,"Snippets of mainstream media footage and paid for nutter interviews, if I had chipped in for this rubbish I would want a refund. I have seen school projects put together on far less funding.",False
10,10,Finally an accurate account of what happened to us!,elenahammat,n/a,16/08/2025,Must watch this documentary it's a very accurate account of our lives over the past 2 years. This will go down in history as one of the worst indictments of government overreach and police brutality toward everyday citizens.,False
11,1,What's the motivation,maggiemitter,n/a,16/08/2025,"Battle Ground Melbourne has everyday heroes battling an evil democratically elected dictator, Dan Andrews. The film is shot as a sequence of monologues in the form of mock interviews that attempt tell the story of the heroes plight, this technique is quite unique and I gave it an extra star for this creativity.The acting itself is a little wooden, with the emotional scenes being far from believable, not to mention the sound mix, with the dialog a whisper and the music blasting as if you're at a concert at Rod Laver Arena, all these little mishaps makes it hard to concentrate on the movie and not the problems with the direction.The plot also is hard to follow and the demonic motivation of Dan Andrews and the reasons for his evil plan are never really discussed in the film, we can only assume it has something to do with a conspiracy to reduce the human population to solve global warming?",False
12,10,This is how it was! A true story!,dnboutique,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great documentary about what has really happened in this great city!Up to this day Melbourne is a supressed, depressing city and all the efforts to save it has been portrait brilliantly!Thanks to all involved of the making!",False
13,10,Emotional and disturbing truth,charholmes-58794,n/a,16/08/2025,"Extremely real and haunting if you have the courage to view thus brilliant film and accept the truth.Everyone whom I know who have seen it rave about it, and many recognise people and the events recorded. A vital record to complement the mass hypnosis and mesmerism of the msm.",False
14,1,Worst produced documentary ever,Amymelb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Where do I start, it was just terrible. The background music is so annoying it was hard to hear the voices. There are no dates, no context and interesting most of their film of events are from mainstream media.",False
15,10,I felt it all!,scruffydoo-02853,n/a,16/08/2025,"Nothing could be more real than this documentary movie. I felt all of it all over again with further insights of what I had questioned.I look forward to the next one, it needs a sequel because so much has happened already.Great watch!",False
16,1,Home & Away Sequel,dwattsy,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yeah, Nah. People are aware of those who truly suffered during lockdowns and the Covid period in Victoria. In my opinion is purely a self indulgent project that attempts to boost the profiles of these ""activists"".",False
17,10,Time to Heal,sdcf-00346,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary provides the viewer a clear accurate depiction of the totalitarian control by imbecilic premier leaders who were given power under a false State of emergency to inflict harm on so many Australian citizens under the guise of public health.The viewer will be left gobsmacked that people would allow this to occur and not stand up for a beautiful city that is now left decimated and is recognised now as the most lockdown city in the WORLD! HEARTBREAKING!,False
18,1,I couldnt sit through this,communicationruby,n/a,16/08/2025,I gave this a shot. The lighting and music are over the top in my opinion. I found the interviews boaring in my opinion. This comes from someone who has sat through 9 hours of David Icke easily on more than one occassion. Im sorry there are no startling revelations in this. A docco needs to be informative. But also entertaining. No matter its content or your opinions therein.,False
19,10,"Battleground Melbourne, Raw Courage Under Fire!",marketmathematica,n/a,16/08/2025,"A frightening expose of what happens when a state leader goes rogue and is hell bent on crushing anyone who gets in his way.The personal stories, raw emotion and survival under fire gives us a first hand view of these tragic events on the ground from everyday Melbournians caught in the crossfire!As we journey through a war zone of police brutality and oppression, the human spirit is undeniable and uplifting.Will Melbourne, once the most liveable city on earth, return to its former glory? Listen to their stories and decide for yourself! A must see..⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",False
20,1,Horrendous,christos-12445,n/a,16/08/2025,"Greatest piece of rubbish ever, the sound is appalling, camera work is the worst you will ever see, most of the crew are listed as anonymous, too ashamed to have their name on it, the comedy was created by an extreme right wing grifter.",False
21,10,essential to watch.,nmitchell-02946,n/a,16/08/2025,Those who says this isnt worth watching really dont value human life.The amount of lives and businesses and families that have had to suffer through this is ridiculous and breaks my heart. The case numbers never escalated until 'vaccines' were brought in and yet we were told the vaccines would protect us and stop transmission.Heavy handed mandates that now make absolutely no sense with covid positive nurses working in hospitals? But unvaxxed healthy australians not allowed to attend their own workplaces.And if anybody bothered to look for the information the Australian government has already admitted that 71% of covid deaths actually had life threatening comorbidities before becoming infected with covid. They never died from it they just died with it!THANKYOU Topher and the rest of the guys who worked tirelessly and put their own safety on the line to attend the protests and rallys as independant media contributors!,False
22,10,Honest and Accurate Portrayal of Melbourne During the Pandemic,vgrowdesign,n/a,16/08/2025,"Before I review this documentary, please disregaurd the bias and misinformation spread by the countless smears by the state sanctioned discriminators who will attack this story because they are incapable of analysis and honesty and whose job it is to discredit this film ...please see their reviews for what they are - spite and hatred and reflection of their own unhinged fears. The fact that they are out to destroy the film and suppress the story within, to me says that it contains information that you NEED to know. If it was a nothing film they would ignore it. The greater the number of bad reviews ..will signify its importance !!Battleground Melbourne is a must see narrative. It's a must see because the mainstream legacy media simply has completely ignored what actually happened .. if you do not see this film .. you will have no idea of the horrific police brutality that most definitely did occur here in Melbourne in 2020 and 2021.Don't you think you deserve to know what actually unfolded ?This film reveals the hidden narrative that is yet to be revealed to those who weren't there .. Do watch it and you will be shocked.It features actual rich archival film footage of epic historical scenes on Westgate bridge and Richmond .. this movie is historic and you need to see it!Do not miss it !",False
23,1,"Budget $15,000 (approx) What happened to the other $85,000?",kburdett-56455,n/a,16/08/2025,Terrible. Over 100k raised for this ??? Must have needed to pay for his legal fee's somehow. I would only recommend playing this when you have those unwanted visitor over.,False
24,10,Brilliant must watch,scanlink,n/a,16/08/2025,Very accurate account of the dreadful tyranny suffered by the people of Victoria during the c19 situation. Must see - Highly recommended.Important footage and real accounts from people who were there. Lots of footage that the govt and media don't want people to see.,False
25,1,A truly awful piece of lying trash,brendanlaidlaw,n/a,16/08/2025,"The entire ""documentary"" is a fiction created by grifters pretending they are being oppressed.Given the director grifted over $100k from his followers to create the film, the production is truly awful. Pretty clear the vast majority of that money went straight into Topher Fields pocket.",False

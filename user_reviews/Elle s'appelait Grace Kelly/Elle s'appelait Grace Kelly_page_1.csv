1,7,The anti-Marilyn,xWRL,n/a,17/08/2025,"Beautifully done documentary covers Grace Kelly's transition from Hollywood royalty to Monaco royalty. Cutting into the glamor are a number of harsh realities-her father's negative feelings about her seeking an acting career, the 250 unsuccessful auditions before her career officially began, the initial negative feelings of some in Monaco who questioned the propriety of their prince marrying an American movie star (and who later came to embrace her in her role), the sometime tedium of performing her official role as princess, which she took seriously, the paparazzi, and of course her death due to having a stroke while driving on a hairpin curve.While showing all this, the documentary sustains an upbeat tone, with many film clips of her as a fun friend and caring mother and loving wife. A dozen relatives and former friends bear witness to the fine person and friend she was to them. It was not quite the fairy tale life I was expecting, but it comes across as a very full life that was tragically cut short.",False
2,5,Muslims against Grace Kelly,mrdonleone,n/a,17/08/2025,I don't know how to feel about this movie to Great them to represent the life of a queen or an empress or whatever but it's really not so interesting to see if it starts at promising and you see people smile and Hollywood and all that then finally you discovered that is just the same old boring thing as all the time and the movie really doesn't tell us anything else we haven't seen on now already yes it must be interesting for the great fans and freaks of the royal house or whatever you might call it but it's not interesting for the normal viewer which is always the point why we are watching movies is not to be annoyed and this is why this movie fails inshallah allah Hu Akbar there is no power or Glory them with Allah.,False

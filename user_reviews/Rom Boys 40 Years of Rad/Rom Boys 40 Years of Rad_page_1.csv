1,7,Interesting,BandSAboutMovies,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerFifteen years in the making with archive material going back forty years, Rom Boys looks at one of the world's most unique skateparks, which is one of the only ones in the world to have official historic protection. This films does more than introduce you to the people who used the park, but shows you the rich influence that Rom had on their lives.With more than 30 interviews with architects, historians, entrepreneurs, street and graffiti artists, professional skaters and BMX riders as well as the old school locals who have been visiting the park since it opened, this is a first-time look at a very influential space.However, when the park suffers a major tragedy during the middle of filming, this film shifts from how these skaters and riders all come together to try and save the park from closure.There are some astounding shots of the park as well as rich footage of the past. If you have any interest in BMX, skating, graffiti or the influence of these activities on our culture, this is a must watch.",True
2,10,Concrete never had so much personality,mantastra,n/a,15/08/2025,"Absolutely brilliant film about the most unique skatepark in the world. Having been someone who skated Rom in the 80's, 90's and again in the last few years this film stirred so many memories and reminded me just how much it has shaped my love of skateboarding. Beautifully filmed and edited, you don't need to be a local, you don't need to be a skater, or BMXer, to appreciate this and really understand that this place s more than just an expanse of worn concrete, its a community, a refuge, a place to escape and so important to the scene it supports.",False
3,10,AN AMAZING LOOK AT A CULTURAL ICON,andyruffell,n/a,15/08/2025,"I admit I may be a little biased because I'm in it, but that aside, Matt has done an epic job of capturing the sprit of ROM Skatepark and the people that helped make it the most Famous Skatepark in the world! It's not just a well directed and edited journey thru time, its a monument to a place that has impacted millions of lives!",False

5,10,Rom boys a triumph of a film,trishafordham,n/a,15/08/2025,I was one of the lucky people who had the privilege of seeing the Rom boys film Premier at the The iconic Rom skatepark and was truly blown away. A true masterpiece from matt Harris. I also bought a online version to keep as a keepsake,False
6,10,"""Going In"" once more!",msandrewsuk,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film evoked so many memories of my early teens. Countless days spent travelling by train, packed into the guard's van alongside our bikes, with dozens of like-minded riders to the hallowed ROM Skatepark. The anticipation building as you rode up the hill until you caught a glimpse of it and seeing the queue snaking for what seemed like miles as the worry that you weren't going to get in crept into your head.Luckily I was never turned away and shuffling through to pay John Snr the entrance fee (always buying at least one rub-on sticker) felt like a ticket to nirvana.Going through the door and out into the park felt like coming home to where I could be part of a very special sub culture that non riders could never understand.ROM is unique.This film captures those feelings through the interviews with so many diverse characters and individuals that are featured. Many of them my peers (Billy Stupple was a legend).Most of them are in their fifties but still have that glint in their eyes that never leaves you. ROM shaped so many of us and played a big part in who we are today.It is wonderfully shot and produced and actually pulled me in so deep that I almost felt compelled to shout ""going in"" from the comfort of my sofa!Culturally significant but more importantly absolutely genuine.",False
7,10,From South Bank To Rom,ufuniazi,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I was a kid I migrated from the South Bank to Rom...it was around 1977/78. A friend of mine had become the park's resident professional and got us in free. From that point I didn't look back until the sad day it was closed by the then owners. I became a prominent member of the park team (I was known as ""Little"") and we represented the park in competition. The park was full on a daily basis and (for us serious skaters) unbearably packed at weekends. What people tried with skateboards there was 'rad' to say the least. Unless I'm sorely mistaken (I'm not) ""light buld"" and I were the first people to have thrown somersaults on skateboards out of the pool & the park manager seemed to find it hilarious telling me I wasn't managing to do ""snap-back gnarlers"" on the pool coping after about ten in a row. It was a vibrant place of freedom with ridiculous numbers of talented skaters. It was fun! I went back to South Bank briefly and brought my friends (the Americans Jeremy Henderson & John Sablosky) who were prominent on the English skateboarding scene at the time to the park...Jeremy got there and started throwing 6 foot aerials out of the ""big"" bowl (original park goers will know what I mean...the large bowl before the 6 foot of vert was cut right down in size!) and John was his usual classy self. But they noticed talent and went back to their teams...before you knew it Benjyboard was poaching park team members...that's how good they were. The entire thing is not completely as I remember it but then nothing is. Thanks to the film makers for a genuinely brilliant trip down memory lane...what a wonderful look at what is rightly a National Heritage Site.",False
8,10,A love letter to concrete,Bearded_Dev,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a skater you fall in love with spots, you find beauty in utilitarian concrete, you view the world a bit differently. You adapt to enjoy architecture that isn't designed for youRom, isn't like that, it was built for a purpose, it was built for skate boarding. Luckily the designers still made it an absolute unforgiving slab of concrete to ride. I think its this that has lead to so many people falling for Rom. It holds a special place in so many peoples hearts.This documentary introduces you to that affection, the users of the park through generations, tell their stories. Lost skin, scars a plenty, but under it all a deep love for the concrete. Rom has had some hard times over the years and this film does nothing to sugar coat that. It takes the watcher through a speckled history of UK skating through a single spot, a spot which for so many people means so much.",False
9,10,"Who knew, 1978 the start of a unique love affair",adrianw-33990,n/a,15/08/2025,"A touching love story full of real characters with hard veneers and soft centres bound together by comraderie easily identifiable in all skaters. As unapologetically gritty as the parks surface, the characters bare their scars and stories. In other times the Rom would have been described as a temple where they all congregate on a Sunday to pay homage, giving people purpose and keeping some on the straight and narrow. There's a piece of all of us in those bowls.",False
10,10,Simply Awesome.,hullycrew,n/a,15/08/2025,"ROM 40 years of RAD is up there ! Any BMXer or Skater will love this. I've watched it twice in as many days... added to my library of best watches including ET, BMX Bandits and RAD.Well done .",False
11,10,Shows the importance of community,toby-binstead,n/a,15/08/2025,"I remember seeing Rom in RAD magazines when i was a kid and the place looked like a military testing ground - harsh concrete that only let the strong survive. This incredible film just shows how strong the community around Rom is, and its importance of bringing together people from all ages and different backgrounds. Skateboarding has always been a brotherhood to me, Rom shows how it wrapped its arms around not only skateboarding, but BMXing and graf artists and pulled them all together as one big family. Long live ROM.",False
12,10,One to watch,monkeyglove-196-494783,n/a,15/08/2025,Wow great true story documenting 40 years of Rad where myself and lots of other people spent many a happy time.

13,10,Concrete dream,flovalflyer,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I was a kid Growing up on a council estate in Cumbria in the early 80's the BMX mags were full of pictures of my favourite BMXers riding Romford skatepark.
I literally dreamed of riding that park for years. When I finally got down there many years later it was chucking it down with rain, but it was still a dream come true just to be there to see and feel it for myself. I love this film.",False

15,10,Remember what it was like to have fun,lucy-77762,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Rom Boys are still Skateboarding!
Their love of the sport in their 40s 50s and 60s is a people story all of its own. Alongside the uniqueness of the place and family's coming along together to skateboard and BMX, this film captures that feel good factor about a generation that is still having fun and selflessly sharing it with young people today.",False

Underpinned with great case studies and characters, the film guides you through the story and history of the Rom skatepark.

1,7,"Interesting, but could use work.",strawberrymoondrops,n/a,16/08/2025,"The beginning is a lot of rambling and patting themselves on the back. Once you skip past that, the story is very interesting. Regardless of if it's true or not, it's a neat story.I just wish they wouldn't keep using the echo effect so much. Once or twice is okay, but they used it out of place a lot and it was annoying. (Echo: It was annoying, it was annoying, it was annoying). ðŸ˜…",False
2,7,The footage of world leaders is true,oilnbrush,n/a,16/08/2025,"These people are sincere they started out trying to document a ghost and Paranormal Activity and ended up receiving information that Rings true it just is true some of the things Hitler did Stalin good and the United States have done what the astronauts saw when they were on the moon I remember bits and pieces of the stuff in history the documentary they have in this show is phenomenal
Get past the first 15 or 20 minutes after your listen to it and you'll realize what the tattoo face men have handed him I'm surprised has been allowed to be released.",False
3,6,"It's an Alien (E.T), not a ghost!!",travisphifer,n/a,16/08/2025,I do believe in the supernatural and I believe in extraterrestrials and UFOs more so due to the overwhelming evidence over ghosts and spirits. It only took me 5 seconds after putting on Paul's and looking at the shape of the head the Little neck and the small frame of the body that resembles more of an extra terrestrial than any type of ghost I've ever seen on any show. Extraterrestrials are interdimensional beings so that's why they can pop up and disappear at will. I think it's insane that these professionals thought it was a ghost from the beginning which makes them not credible at all if they can't determine that without hearing other people's feedback!!,False
4,10,Extremely thought provoking.,ffgumvvu,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched Sir No Face and was in awe of what they captured. I love the paranormal, I love alien investigations but it has to be done on the right level. THIS is done on the right level. I knew there was another doco about Sir No Face but, 2020 happened, Covid happened and i forgot about it. I watched it last night and was left with my jaw on the floor throughout the entire documentary.There are tons of skeptics out there, I'm one of them. I have to see it to believe it but what Chad does and how he investigates and how he puts everything together does actually make you ""think""! There are a lot of people out there that just dont' ""think"" about it. I'm not into conspiracy theories but I dunno, this and Sir No Face has left me just wanting to know more..... MUCH more!",False
5,10,A Cool Documentary,Grojniar,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerI wouldn't say I believe in aliens but I do want them to be real and it would make sense for them to exist considering how large the universe is; also if they did exist it would be the americans that piss them off so the part of the documentary that mentioned their encounters with the americans through history seemed valid and made sense to me. Whether you believe in extraterrestrials or not this was still an awesome and enjoyable documentary. I hope I get the chance to watch Sir Noface and I hope Chad Calek makes more documentaries and movies.,True
6,1,Fake!,rahn_enterprises,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is supposed to be a sequel to a documentary, about a full body apparition that was supposedly recorded down in Australia. Both films (term used ver lightly) are so bad. The first film tried to make people assume the apparition was CGI, then right at the end woohoo it's not! It was very obvious that it was a prop peeking around a corner.Now this film (again used lightly) is saying in reality the apparition is an alien. Yet no evidence to back it up, except a mysterious package left by a mystery man with a face tattoo.But wait! The aliens aren't real aliens, they're robots disguised as aliens!What a mess. If it was so ridiculously dumb, it could almost be funny.This guy is supposed to be some big paranormal expert, in all kinds of shows, but he's a quack!Save yourself some grief and ignore his documentaries",True
7,10,Think..,medidkorn,n/a,16/08/2025,This film is so much bigger then their film of the ghost/grey all the other stuff is beyond truth we are in for a rude awakening..,False
8,1,Dumb,jtmace,n/a,16/08/2025,"Flat out dumb, echo, echo, echo...This is saying something along the lines of ""it's a ghost, but in order to milk more money off the story, now it's an alien, but now it's a ghost again"".",False
9,10,ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘½ðŸ‘½,julz-82148,n/a,16/08/2025,"I did watch Sir Noface & appreciated the incredible measures Chad Calek took to debunk it. He couldn't because there was actually something there. Just not what the team initially thought. I found this film to be incredibly informative. After hearing Dr. Greer's testimony, all of the previous shown facts lined up. At least they did for myself. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions & beliefs. Buzz Aldrin has been on many shows over the years claiming to see UFO's while in space. I'm excited to see what Chad & the Australian team find out next.",False
10,1,"Fake, and even if it wasn't, awful production",followpre,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's so amateurish, that even if they had a video of Jesus' birth, nobody would believe them. The amount of effects used reminds me of shows you stumble upon when you can't sleep. They use the echo-effect literally every 2 minutes, you could make a drinking game out of it.And yes, obviously it's completely fake, there is a blurry pic of a human in a mask and now we're all believers. Alrighty.",False
11,8,"Lose the echo, Chad! But much better than I expected",casey-42712,n/a,16/08/2025,"Takes a while to get going. The continual use of echoes and typing sounds gets old real fast, but tough it out. Crazy videos near the end, stuff you've heard rumors of, and these may be some real photos/videos. The connection to the volcanic lights made me wonder why he didn't didn't contact Jaime Maussan. The link to Dr. Greer's works was toally unexpected and very well laid out. Make your own calls. Don't let other ""1"" Worst movie ever BS put you off. Usually when this many people-bots are trashing something, you're too close to the truth.The load of stuff from the 'tattooed man "" is amazing - I hope much of it IS true.And Elon Musk warning us about AI? Spot on.Much better than Sir No Face -",False
12,1,Worst ever movie period!,agrgulliver,n/a,16/08/2025,What a load of unbelievable rubbish. School children could make a better movie than this shower....never have I left a review but this is that bad.Ramblings of nonsensical individuals and I would say the footage is fake but there is none! One part someone is allegedly followed out of a car park.....rrriiiggggghhhtttt. The originals and all the copies should be blasted into space as it is embarrassing to have witnessed such awful drivel.,False
13,9,Must watch,turnerrobert-86469,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOkay let's just say, it def starts off quite quite slow, but you have to give it time and thankfully I did. I am finishing it currently about 10 min left and it's just mind boggling and just makes you go what the f over and over but also if you are deep into what they get into with ufos and aliens, it really just makes what Dr Steven Greer has been saying for the past 30-40 years himself. That we have Star Trek type abilities for decades and that the world is trying to make it seem like aliens are a threat, so the masses can agree to all at war. If and when that happens, and if it does happen it's most likely just the government making it seem like it's aliens. How this is going to wrap around to the original documentary of sir noface and ghosts hopefully will be answered in the final minutes.I can say the most aggravating thing of this documentary is them repeating something 3xs. Yeah I get it's important but they just overdue it. I'm stunned I'm 5 years late to the party. I just stumbled upon it on Tubi and even though I personally was not impressed with Sir Noface, this had exceeded any expectations. Once again you have to give it time at least 40-45 min.",True
14,1,Sucktacular,davedukart,n/a,16/08/2025,"Poorly made, poorly documented, based on nonsense. The type of ""footage"" this movie is based on is the ultra phoney type of footage that gives UFO research a bad name and makes it all look like a big joke.Besides, WHO would send what would be ""game changing"" information to a nobody, super low budget documentary film maker?Nobody, that's who.And THAT is why there are these documentaries that waste people's time. Because actual film makers and UFO researchers wouldn't have even the main footage this is based on the time of day.The still used for the streaming source was obviously clickbait and the ONLY decent pictures/ footate in this film were not relevant to this documentary. They were stolen from good documentaries and randomly put her and there in it just so there was decent content.",False
15,10,The truth about what is to come,dhutch-67803,n/a,16/08/2025,"I have known about what was to come for years.as soon as I saw sir no face I knew what it was ,a grey made by us and with the help of other greys.you just can't ignore all the evidence,even if chad hasn't made these two documentaries ,the truth was still going to spill out.we have ruined the planet we live on,we should live in conjunction with earth not use it for a proving ground to test our nukes out,and I found the opening at antarctica and now they have air brushed it out yes God is an astronaut,there's gold at the end of the rainbow and the breed live at mideone ,even Elon musk is afraid of the AI we have invented.",False
16,2,Sad,Fileunderfunk,n/a,16/08/2025,"Talmar Woods is the best way to put it. So entirely low rent and a total waste of one's precious time. I'd truly rather pound sand. But, you can't blame the crew for making it. I guess a passion of sorts.",False
17,1,REAL Review,signalpathological,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis ""documentary"" is made in the style of ""I'm an amateur and come off as disjointed and real so people will believe me"". This 3286th installment of the blair witch chapter in the near endless tome of homemade paranormal videos is no less disappointing or revealing. This doc meanders through radio spots, stage screening appearances, and low grade shot on video footage all so people will believe in flashes of light and faceless aliens. Is this REALLY the best we can hope for with respect to and for the paranormal? There is absolutely NOTHING here folks, apart from fans of aliens and aimless paranormal heresay. The video touts the fact that it's the only government sanctioned paranormal study. How many of these government ""sanctioned"" (I wonder if the makers mean ""grant funded""?) studies did land down under turn away exactly? If this is honestly the best that an official study or project can deliver on, it's no wonder why they put the brakes on. Maybe these guys could get Stan Romanek to build them some better props and story lines next time.",True

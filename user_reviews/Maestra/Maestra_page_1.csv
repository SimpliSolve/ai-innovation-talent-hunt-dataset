1,9,Highly Inspiring and Moving,stragglemuffin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHighly inspiring documentary of a conducting competition in Paris for women. They go through all the 12 contestants backstories and the struggles they have faced. Incredibly fascinating relating to issues that many wouldn't even think about. Once we connect with certain members of this story we are hopeful for them to succeed while facing off against one another. Very introspective and really demonstrates the pressures and suffrage that happens in the classical music industry, and especially with this industry in regards to women and the abuse and misogyny that is still present today. Also important is the presence of bad feedback. ""Smile more"" and ""be more energetic"" are such useless comments and are more likely comments made about women by men. It also brings up the debate of pursuing a personal life, or a career and whether both are possible.",True
2,10,What can I say? Perfection.,kristenlynnepeterson,n/a,16/08/2025,"We are invited into the competition, understanding the pressure. The winner is not important. The star is the collaborative dynamic the women formed. You'll cry, laugh and cheer.Each contestant was framed to invite us into their world. It is clear that all, even those who didn't make the first cut, left Paris with so much more than they had prior. They faced their past, their anxiety and navigated through leaving behind their families to enter a highly stressful competition. Each had their eye on the prize, not knowing they all won so much more ultimately. Keep watching through the credit for career updates for each.And we never saw Larry David.",False
3,10,Sisterhood at its Finest,ocandrews-19604,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the pleasure of viewing this film with the Kentucky Theatre in Lexington, KY, home of the Lexington Philharmonic ( conducted by MÃ©lisse Brunet). The movie had a unique relatability regardless of one's career or upbringing, and audience members were moved to both laughter and tears as they followed the journeys of each woman. We fell in love with the women of La Maestra and cheered for them as they navigated the prestigious competition along with their personal lives.Each woman was a beautiful and unique representation of womanhood and its unique relationship with resilience. Well done!",False
4,10,When does it stop,robintroutmanrt,n/a,16/08/2025,"This entire show was about women breaking barriers, stepping into a world that has been closed. What upset me and soured the experience were the judges comments to 2 of the women that one had too much energy and the other should smile more. What the everliving f@###k. This whole program was to be about abolishing those old stereotypes and the judges perpetuate them. The judges should undergo training to lay aside their own stereotypes of what a woman should be. What a travesty to have bigotted fools judging these outstanding talented women. These women should be judged without bias, without preconceived notions of what women should be. Shame!",False

1,10,"Excellent, well-research and beautifully shot documentary",cwells-10468,n/a,16/08/2025,"Solid documentary that shows you can't know where you're going without knowing where you're from. For those out there feeling lost and not knowing how things can get better from here.... This documentary shares a roadmap with meaningful solutions. Beautiful stories here. Episode 1 shows the trials and tribulations of residents in the south Bronx in the 1970s, and how a group of people coming together, organizing, and putting in the hard work can truly make a difference and save a neighborhood. When the private sector shuts you out and the city government tries to make you disappear, the only way to fight back is together. Hasta la victoria siempre!",False

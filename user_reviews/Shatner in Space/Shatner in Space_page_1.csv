1,6,I love William Shatner. I despise Jeff Bezos.,M_Exchange,n/a,16/08/2025,"Someone wrote a profoundly racist rant against white people in his or her review. I do not view all rich white men as evil, but I consider Jeff Bezos the embodiment of pure evil. I skipped beyond every biographical detail about him and his opinions about the flight. I could not care less.But I loved to see Shatner's reaction to the things that he viewed. It was moving and touching. He was honest and raw about his feelings throughout the entire documentary.I am also glad that they added a lot of Glen de Vries footage. He died shortly after this experience. RIP.",False
2,6,Worth Watching,wtprincetx,n/a,16/08/2025,"Interesting. Definitely worth watching for William Shatner and Star Trek fans. But a little slow and anticlimactic, and somewhat disappointing overall. Once is enough.",False
3,10,Positive and inspirational,DasGlasperlenspiel,n/a,16/08/2025,"A few are doing what the vast majority of us can only dream of. That's true. But, I really enjoy watching these people do it! Because space is and remains a place of longing. And I don't think space travelers are neglecting Earth. On the contrary, almost everyone sees their vulnerability from a distance. And I can gladly overlook the fact that Jeff Bezos and his company are presented in a good light. In a way, they deserve it.",False
4,9,Ninety Years Old!,jrzodda,n/a,16/08/2025,I am so happy for Bill. When I think back to when I was a child I would never have imagined that he would go to space and go as a Ninety year old man. What a capstone to a life well lived. I was wondering about the behind the scenes of how it came to be and if you are also interested in this you will enjoy this.,False
5,9,"""Everyone should do this""",dertwonshuw-51350,n/a,16/08/2025,Shatner's words when he landed.So would you? Would you go if you had the opportunity?I think it is quite poetic that the star of a culturally iconic TV series many of us have watched over and over for years had a chance to experience this short flight. Good for him.Tastefully done documentary. Watch and enjoy. I did.,False
6,1,Bezos is a pitiful human,jakerocks,n/a,16/08/2025,I watched it live and seeing Shatner was incredible. He was extremely brave to make such a trip and it was truly an amazing high point in his life.But watching Bezos ignore Shatner's first words out of the capsule and interrupting what he was trying to say to run over and grab a bottle of champagne to spray everyone just made me want to throw up. He's disgusting.,False
7,9,I thought it was great,On_The_Mark,n/a,16/08/2025,"It was basically 45 minutes which is the perfect time for this type of documentary. Not a lot of fluff. Let's get down to it.Amazing thing is Shatner is 90, and he's got the old person's skin and boy but his mind is still that of a 40 year old. No slowing down or hard to process ideas. He speaks well and it's impressive. He's a young 90 and it was great to see him do this because he really appreciated it and that was nice.No big ego or ""I deserve this."" Just an actor who wants the planet to be healthy and cares about it who got to do something great. Well done.",False
8,5,Global Warming Lecture & Anticlimactic Finish,TheFearmakers,n/a,16/08/2025,"When they actually go into space, the younger crew/passengers float around for a few seconds inside the weightless capsule, while Shatner seems nervous, poor guy, holding himself down like he doesn't want to float around (after all, he's 90 and overweight) (he looks like he's sitting on a toilet)...The ""space trip"" is all very quick, and very awkward... staged and awkward...Then when they land, Shatner has to try explaining something that he says he cannot explain; but what he does say is just about all we have, since we, the audience, really saw nothing, experienced nothing...We didn't even experience them experiencing...As for the fifty-minute buildup, including a a ""last minute problem,"" it was as contrived as all documentaries that need to have the same kind of suspense as movies, because they ARE movies...Meanwhile for a Documentary there's hardly anything documented except the fact Bezos is a Star Trek fan and Shatner, well, he starred on Star Trek (they also show a cool Outer Limits)...And for a Reality Show it's not very real nor all that fun or involving (except for an instant when one of Shatner's daughters bluntly tells him he's too old to go into space; but before this real moment can grow we cut to another segment)...Plus there's the whole Global Warming lecture from Shatner ""30 days later"" and this is all a way for Bezos to contradict his critics who say he's just doing this because HE CAN... (And that is WHY he's doing it) (Shatner says that Bezos wants to put all the industries polluting Earth into space... so he wants to pollute space?)...All in all, Shatner-in-Space didn't seem authentic, and is merely a prolonged news story about the party trick of sending a sci-fi actor into space (next step, send Bryan Cranston into a legitimate meth lab)...As a person, Shatner seems an endearing kind of guy... a little loopy but that works for his legendary offbeatness... he's the kind of actor everyone likes even if they bag on him...But this all kind of came and went, an afterthought, really, just like the going-to-space experience seemed to for Shatner...Now had he done a spoken-word of Bowie's Space Oddity up there instead of hearing the female passenger repeat ""Oh my God!"" twenty times, that might've added something but, in all seriousness, the trip into space needs to be longer because frankly, it seems a big waste of everyone's time and money.",False
9,10,Fantastic man,Impman2,n/a,16/08/2025,"Mr Shatner came across as warm, witty, humble and intelligent. He was visibly moved, in fact brought to tears, by his experience.Excellent programme.",False
10,9,A dream fulfilled,nickbourne-00142,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA well balanced programme, although shorter than I hoped, following William Shatner aka Cpt Kirk who is given the opportunity at the age 90 to go into space courtesy of the space programme owned by Jeff Bezos.Beautifully filmed withe lead up to the big day and capturing the moment with the few minutes of actually being in space and weightlessness.Shatner's reaction upon returning to earth was humility in having had the profound experience and certainly emotional.A real feel-good 'space adventure' for those of us unlikely to the chance of experiencing looking back at what we call home.Recommended viewing just for the emotion.",True
11,9,Really great,gjenevieve,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI would have rated this a 10 if Bezos had gone up in it also. He should have been in there with Shatner. I like Bezos' idea of trying to find a way to move polluting industries into space so we can clean up the planet.I don't understand why people are so nasty towards Bezos. I think that they are just jealous. He helps out a lot of organizations. Every time I buy anything from Amazon, money gets donated to my favorite charity. He also pays his employees well, gives them good benefits, helps them with education .... If you want to have more money, go out and make it. I am working towards that goal and I already plan on using the money for scholarships and to help support several organizations. Just get your goals in front of you and take steps to make it happen.",True
12,5,A few minutes of good footage,Chriper7,n/a,16/08/2025,"I never watched Star Trek, but I know William Shatner from Boston Legal and thought he was great in that.As for this documentary, I did enjoy the few minutes of footage of the flying phallus shooting off the planet, the views of Earth outside the windows and the weightless antics of the occupants, along with Shatner's reaction afterward.We also learn that Jeff Bezos, environmentalist extraordinaire, plans to transfer the polluting industries of Earth to space so as to make Earth pristine again. That sounds totally realistic, non-polluty, affordable and achievable, and what could possibly go wrong?In the meantime, I guess astronaut Bill can sit on his porch, stare up at the sky, reminisce and wonder if one of those planes flying overhead are carrying one of the billions of packages Amazon deliver here on the terrestrial realm.",False
13,10,Amazing,kjxterra,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love space and love this planet then watch Shatner in Space....some people talk about dumb stuff like the shape of the vessel or billionaires going to space, Blue Origin is clearly about so much more than that.",False
14,1,I really can't imagine caring,ecmelton-186-105049,n/a,16/08/2025,"What can you really say about this kind of insipid self-indulgence that only exist to appeal to the absolute worst kind of weird nerd culture, people who aren't even capable of understanding the things that they have centered their entire personality around?It never ceases to amaze me the way people are capable of dumbing down media that possesses some genuine level of depth in turning it into the most vapid thing imaginable. Am I expected to actually see a meaningful connection between this sad little vanity project from the recently divorced world's richest man and a speculative fiction TV show about humanitarianism where money doesn't even exist? It's shameful and embarrassing.",False
15,10,Captain Kirk Lives On,2Pass_Time,n/a,16/08/2025,"A trekky through and through, it was lovely seeing Bill soar. I can't wait until flights last longer, safely. The comments about saving the earth I felt and share. Thanks Jeff Bezos for following your dream snd helping us get cliser to real space travel.",False
16,10,Shatner at long last becomes Kirk,searchersd,n/a,16/08/2025,"At 90 years of age, William Shatner, the actor, finally gets to leave planet Earth after many years of portraying a starship captain. As he looks down at Earth through the capsule's window, he sits, overcome with emotion, while his crewmates are gleefully bouncing around enjoying their weightlessness. Perhaps it takes advanced age to be able to understand the deeper meaning of such a journey. This documentary enables us to experience it through the eyes of William Shatner, to understand why such a short trip into space means so much more than just getting high enough away from Earth's gravity to be able to float around.",False
17,10,Did the real William Shatner come back from space?,Bernie4444,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw those Star Trek movies and other spacy things likeThe Astronaut's Wife (1999)and I know that there is a possibility that Shatner may have been exchanged.Someone may think of this as a big commercial; in reality, it is excellent timely documentation while the people and the places still exist. With one exceptionGlen de Vries.I met Jeff Bezos for a few minutes in 2004 at Amazon and he seemed like a standup guy. Very interesting and at that time Amazon let you take your dog to work. It seems strange to watch him in this program and think back.This flight is tied to history with scenes and photos from past TV programs as some are:Archived ABC news coverageFootage from the Twilight ZoneFootage from Star TrackOuter Limits

Now watch these programs and tell me if it is the same Shatner.",False
18,10,Amazing xx,joanneeccles-55847,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love William Shatner, what a great guy, watching this made me emotional, seeing him in space was so heartwarming,I loved ever second of it, also Jeff Bezos I really did not know much about him except he is very wealthy , I really liked him and like what he is doing , this is a must watch , I can not recommend enough if you are a space or shatner fan .",False
19,3,More of a Blue Origin Ad than anything else,fischer_patrick,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had higher hopes for this film. It didn't really delve into anything in a deep meaningful way that you would expect from a documentary. It briefly touched on Shatner's legacy, and the plans for Blue Origin, but other than that it kind of was just a bunch of rich people having fun playing astronaut.",False
20,3,Kudos to William Shatner,becca_cardinal,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI loved William Shatner's response when he experienced space. I was not surprised at Bezos' response. He walked away from a visibly shaken human being who was uttering profound statements and Bezos literally walked away. Funny how they never showed that in this ridiculous ""documentary"".Sending Captain Kirk to space was clearly a gimmick. I watched it all fall apart in real time. Shatner was clearly moved and gave an eloquent response. It obviously wasn't respected by Bezos. He got the shot he wanted then ran the other way.The editing done on this version was funny.So many years later space tourism isn't viable. Good luck with both oppressing the 99% and hoping you can make this a viable business. Lol!",True

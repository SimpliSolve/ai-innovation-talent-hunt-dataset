1,8,Eye-opening,rtamos,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you think you know Max Mosley from the press, you've missed the entire picture. Fierce intelligence, and a devotion to auto safety, both in F1 and the public streets (especially India), he comes across as a great man unfairly maligned by jealous rivals and the gutter press.",False
2,9,Not Who You Were Led to Believe,ianhuds,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love these doc's but this one is special, it shows a man who would hold his hands up when he got it wrong, it also shows a man who was constantly in the same target that some of us feel is aimed at us from birth, the target that finds fault and places blame on you at every opportunity it can, an obviously high IQ man who some wouldn't ever grasp fully, a man who strived to improve road safety and one who would go head to head with injustice and then follow it up so those who couldn't defend themselves would be able to, so bulletproof as well, the only time he actually breaks is when the death of his son is mentioned the rest goes over him like a racing incident, it leaves you or at least it did me thinking this man was so smart he was a danger to the climbers and those with an agenda, it's not about the scandal or F1 as such but is a great insight to how a maverick works, fire truck coming through a dead end road that's blocked by parked cars in an emergency.",True

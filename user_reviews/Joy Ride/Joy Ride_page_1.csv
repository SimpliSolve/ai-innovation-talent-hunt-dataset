1,8,Everything Eventually becomes Awful,name99-92-545389,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was fortunate enough to discover Bobcat once he got past his crazy ""I'm going to set things on fire to draw attention to myself"" phase and relied on actually giving a very funny set.If you like his standup, you'll like. It's maybe 80% pieces from his most recent tour, 15% chatting with Dana as they drive, and 5% random background footage.Unlike so many of these sorts of movies, the director seems to understand that we have little interest in hearing the background life stories, the struggle against adversity, the fights with parents and the rest of it; we want standup, and that's what we get, done well.I just wish the name of the movie were better. Fairly early on, Dana does a bit that ends with ""Everything eventually becomes awful"" and, honestly, isn't that so much better a title for any comedy album, especially for two comedians approaching the end of their careers?",False
2,8,Fun and funny,jellopuke,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a nice twist on the stand up special, being a duo/road movie/clip show. It works really well and is consistently funny. Bobcat is great live and this shows it (Even if Seinfeld doesn't think so).",False

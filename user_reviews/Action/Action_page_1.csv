1,8,Really interesting,dsb-02142,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I started watching this documentary series. But I was pleasantly surprised! It was really engrossing to watch how these guys do what they do - multiple times every day. The safety precautions taken and extent of precautions to ensure that the stunt person incurs the least amount of damage. Also, really interesting to find out about their backgrounds and their family lives. I think the most fun of all was that the majority of the filming was done and showed stunts from The Fall Guy, which was in theaters as this was showing. Would love to see another season!",False
2,10,BEAUTIFUL & ARTISTIC,felix-53816,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cooking for the last three-plus decades, I consider cooking an art, and when not in the kitchen, I love action films. This beautiful show displayed how Stuntmen and women make this job such an art. As an action movie junckie, I really appreciate action films even more. Looking into the lens of how stunt actors do the work and trying to balance family is truly a stunning way to show the world how our favorite acting films are made and how much dedication and passion it takes to tell these captivating stories. This show proves that, like cooking, there truly is art in every occupation, from stunting to directing and creating a story through film. The epic show truly loved it! And Violemt Night was an EPIC ACTION FILM!",False
3,9,If you are a fan of action movies,cpast50,n/a,16/08/2025,"This series is for you! I have watched the first episode and am currently watching the second. Both series focus on the making of the movie ""Violent Night"" which my husband, sister and friends thoroughly enjoyed. We all have watched the film multiple times. ""Action"" follows the group of stunt men and women who are hired to work and act on the set of the movie ""Violent Night"". When, not if you watch this gem you will learn that David Leitch is one of the masterminds behind this team. The team is a group of international individuals and they travel all over the world to do their jobs. Fabulous!!!",False
4,9,Not one credit for Music,jwil67,n/a,16/08/2025,"Who makes the decision to not give credit for all the music in a documentary like this? This is an excellent documentary, but to not include credit for all the music that runs throughout is just embarrassing. I noticed that they had a special thanks section with many names. I doubt that any of them were composers that contributed to this film. It's not like the days of film where having credits that ran too long was more expensive, way more expensive because film was expensive.Production assistance got credit, but composers?I would love to know the real reason why they would omit the composers. I doubt that I'll ever find out. Many people above the line just don't care.",False

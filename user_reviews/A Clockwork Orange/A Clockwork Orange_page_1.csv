1,8,"A great, but hard watch",davidmvining,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've struggled a bit with this film more than any other Kubrick. The problem is that I think I get it too easily, or I don't get it at all. I'm never quite sure.One thing's for sure, it's a hard watch at times. Kubrick, taking Anthony Burgess' novella and running with it, creates a main character so loathsome and charming all at once that it can create a certain dissonance in an audience (Roger Ebert's review of the original release is a fantastic example of a reviewer who simply could not see past Alex de Large as anything other than a celebration of antisocial behavior). The film jumps off the deep end from the very beginning, showing the audience Alex at his most primal and pure, an advocate of the good ultra-violence in charge of three droogs out to cause mayhem and pursue their own pleasures. So unburdened by any existing power structures at any level that Alex can simply get high, beat up other gangs, steal cars, break into houses, rob said houses, and rape women and just crawl back into the bed in his parents' apartment without so much as a serious question from an authority figure. He's not getting caught by the police, so he doesn't care and neither do his parents, so it seems.The introduction of Alex's violence is interesting in its structure. The first incident involves the beating of an old drunk man. It's filmed in shadow to help hide the particulars of the violent act, but it shouldn't endear Alex to the audience. The second, I believe, has an unexpected and subtle effect on its audience. Seemingly just bored, Alex seeks out a rival gang. When he finds them, the other gang is in the process of trying to rape a woman, and in comes Alex whose presence allows the woman to escape. No matter what Alex's intention, one of the direct results of his actions is that a woman is saved from rape. I think there's an unconscious acknowledgement by much of the audience at that which pushes many of them to side with Alex. That is undercut, though, by the next sequence where Alex breaks into the country home, beats an old man (crippling him), and cutting off his wife's clothes (while singing ""Singin' in the Rain"" of course) and, implicitly, raping her. Alex is a monster, but in the middle of our long introduction to him where he intentionally does nothing good, he accidentally does something good. I suspect it has an effect on some people they don't really realize.Anyway, Alex, dealing with some internal strife from his gang led by Georgie, ends up killing a woman and turned on by his mates. He's thrown in prison where, two years later, he is the chaplain's devout assistant. In fact, our introduction to Alex's settled life in prison doesn't really focus on him. The scene is focusing on the chaplain giving a sermon and some rowdy prisoners. Alex is off to the side, manning the projector for when they are to sing. Alex, though, hasn't changed at all. He's modified his external appearance, dressing well in his uniform and studying the Bible, but he only really likes the bits about blood and sex. In his mind, he's still the same depraved monster he was at the beginning.He jumps at the idea of an experimental treatment that promises to get him out of prison early. The treatment is that famous bit where Alex is tied into a chair, his eyes pried open, and he watches horrible things on a cinema screen. Combined with an experimental drug, Alex grows sick at the ideas of three things: violence, sex, and Beethoven's 9th symphony. He's not happy with any of the three, but it's the loss of his beloved Beethoven that hits him the hardest. The very sound of the 9th makes Alex ill and unable to function. It's around these experimental treatments that the chaplain makes explicit (shockingly so in a Kubrick film) that what I consider to be the central idea, ""Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""Alex can no longer chose to be bad. To a certain extent, he ceases to be human, and his return home after the successful demonstration of the treatment's effects help solidify this. His family want nothing to do with him. They've rented out his room and can't, for the sake of their boarder, let Alex move back in. Alex finds his former Droogs as police officers after the old man from the beginning of the film attacks Alex while he's incapacitated. The former Droogs nearly drown Alex as he's unable to fight. He's become so dehumanized that he can't even stand up for himself in any way. He ends up required to rely on the kindness of a stranger, the man whom he crippled and whose wife he raped. This man uses Alex's inability to take Beethoven's 9th symphony and drives him to a suicide attempt, casting himself out of the window.Recovering in a hospital, we discover that Alex has been cured of his cure. He's right back to being the antisocial loathsome creature he started the film. The fantasy sequence that ends the film, showing Alex romping with a naked woman to a cheering, Victorian dressed, audience solidifies that.So, is Kubrick saying that Alex's victory is being violent and psychopathic, as Ebert asserted nearly 50 years ago? No, I think Ebert missed the point. The point isn't that curing people of violence isn't a worthy goal, but that the cure needs to originate from within the person. Alex had to want to be changed, and he never wanted to change. He was always looking for ways out of his predicaments in order to get right on with the good ultra-violence. Forcing the change on him dehumanizes him. Better to do what the Chief Guard obviously thought best for Alex, locking him up forever, was probably a better fix.So, that's a thousand words on the film's thematic exploration. After having written it, I feel like I have a greater grasp on the ideas of the film than before, so that's quite nice. I still think that A Clockwork Orange is a second tier Kubrick film, though. I've read the film as a black comedy for a while, and it can be quite funny through that lens. The performances require a certain special mention. I don't think anyone in the film is doing a straight performance. Everything is mannered to such odd degrees, and I love them all. Patrick Magee as Mr. Alexander, in particular, tickles me. It's so off-kilter and perfect for the world yet still so utterly bizarre as to be eminently watchable.It's smart, but I don't think it looks as good as many of his other films. I feel like having the chaplain explicate the movie's central theme twice makes the ideas less interestingly presented. These are relatively minor complaints, but when comparing this to such films as 2001, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Dr. Strangelove, or Eyes Wide Shut, I have to just say that A Clockwork Orange isn't as successful. Perhaps it will grow on me more with time, but I cannot imagine ever quite loving this movie as much as the listed others with a first act that makes me cringe so much. Yes, it's intentional and successful, but still...that's a hard watch.",True
2,9,"Brilliant, stunning and disturbingly entertaining",FZ-FX,n/a,15/08/2025,"Few films are as sensational or infamous as Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"". It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent ""reformation"" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever.While the film's depictions of violence and sex are what it's most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government's attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied.Equally excellent to the film's content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick's perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick's use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist's behavior and the government's policies.A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think. Real horrorshow all around, Oh my brothers.",False
3,9,We Are Seeing Our Future,Hitchcoc,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerHaving read Anthony Burgess's novel years ago and working my way through the amazingly creative, futuristic dialogue, I really looked forward to seeing the movie. It was not a disappointment. In the hands of Stanley Kubrick, it comes to life. It is the product of the desensitized world that we see unfolding before us in the beginning of the 21st century. There will be a lot of Alexes in the future; there already are. We are slowly moving away from conventional morality and playing with forms of nihilism. Our politics are beginning to diminish the individual rights and safety of our citizens. Our young people are beginning to band together in little covens, the cell phone and the computer creating little worlds where anonymity can lead to diminution of what is good. Pardon my diatribe, but what Alex and his droogs are doing isn't all that out of the ordinary these days. The manipulative, controlling, anything for ""me"" society is just being formed. Kubrick and Burgess had a a vision. Sometimes this movie is called science fiction. The only science fiction thing about it is that it takes place in the future. The violence we see is the violence of those who no longer care what that word means. This whole world is more frightening than the terrorists we see behind every rock. This enemy is us; or the us yet to be.",True
4,10,One of those films you have to watch multiple times,Agent10,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's hard to judge a film such as this. Its cold and hard, yet can be exhilarating and sarcastic. It can be average, yet it can be visionary. Exploitive? Satirical? Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today. The younger generations are out of control due to lack of parental control, junk culture is becoming commonplace, violence is desensitizing the masses, and we all seem to be enjoying the ride on the way down. It's very difficult to find movies which can make such startling commentary, yet hold on to such accusations for an extended period of time. Nowadays, films are focused-grouped to death, conformity is more powerful than artistry, and money is far more important than quality. Kubrick took a huge leap with this film, challenging society to take a hard look at itself. Unfortunately, society wasn't ready for this film, which is why it is revered now more than ever.",True
5,10,"""I was cured all right""",nickenchuggets,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIt's not an everyday occurrence where you watch a movie that is just so weird and hard to describe to people that haven't watched it that it stands in a category of its own, but that is clockwork orange. This movie was banned for many years and catholics were prohibited from seeing it because of its sexual nature, which literally makes itself known in only the first minute or two. Right from the beginning, when you see Alex, the ""protagonist"" who beats, rapes, and tortures people for his own wicked amusement, staring emotionlessly into the camera, you know you're about to see something that doesn't hold anything back. Clockwork orange is full of acts of violence, sexual imagery, and brutality throughout its various scenes, but that's the whole beauty of it and why this movie still holds up after half a century now. It does what other movies (especially back in the 70s) were afraid to do. The only other one that comes to mind is the exorcist, but that was still 2 years away. Anyway, Alex commands the audience's attention in the first half of this movie, and it's understandable why the people watching would be afraid of him and his sociopathic tendencies. Even his fellow criminals are appalled by his actions, but he makes it very clear to them that he's the leader. That is until the second half of the film where he is arrested and sent to undergo an experimental procedure which is supposed to cure his violent nature and habits. The infamous scene in which his eyes are forced open while watching acts of violence in the theater is something the viewer won't ever forget. Clockwork Orange is another rare example of a movie that, in my view, doesn't have a single dull or disinteresting moment in it, and the film can be easily classified as three parts: the first segment where Alex is still a criminal, the second one where he is sent to prison and ""rehabilitated"", and the last segment when he is released. As said earlier, there will probably never be another movie like this one, and it stands alone in its own category because it is just that unique. There's horror movies, there are comedies, there are thrillers, there's film noir, and then there's clockwork orange.",True
6,10,One of Kubrick's best,MovieAddict2016,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTo say that the Alex character from Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is unlikable is like saying the Manson family was sort of bad. He's not just unlikable; he's despicable, terrifying, sick, twisted, and ultimately a haunting embodiment of all our greatest realistic fears and worries. But Alex does not see himself as a sick person. The key to this is in his voice-over narrative.Alex does not see himself as a pervert, just as we do not see our own flaws and Ramond Babbitt did not see his own autism. To us, we are all normal, which is a scary thought.""A Clockwork Orange,"" which was originally released in 1973 after an appeal for an R rating (that was granted after originally being tagged as an X-rated motion picture), had been banned from Britain for close to thirty years. Most film fans in Europe will tell you that they had seen the movie on grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young and curious.But for those of us lucky enough to enjoy (or squirm through) ""A Clockwork Orange"" in its entire odd splendor, it is an experience you are likely to never forget. Its characters, its style, its subject matter, its explicit material--all of it combines to create a marvelous whole that will stay with you long after the credits stop rolling.Essentially a tale focused on Alex's journeys in jail and his process of being re-submitted to the world after inhumane treatments to cure the evil out of him, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is indeed as offbeat as its title.All tales of redemption involve characters that we gradually come to appreciate, or like, or--at the very least--learn to tolerate. Not ""A Clockwork Orange."" Our narrator remains the same throughout the movie, always an incarnation of everything wrong in today's modern world. He goes through no cleansing process and by the end of the film we like him less than we did at the beginning. That's daring.",True
7,10,A second viewing does the trick,Ch4ndler_B1ng,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerA Clockwork Orange is directed by Stanley Kubrick, my favorite director of all time and this is my second favorite movie of all time including one of my favorite villain performances of all time! A Clockwork Orange is every genre, it's Sci-Fi mixed with crime, drama, psychological thriller, satire, horror elements and most importantly romance (nah, I'm kidding).At the time of release it was considered purposefully disturbing, boring and overall just not a great movie, however years later, when critics gave it a second viewing, they retracted their reviews and it is now considered one of the best movies of all time! Same kind of thing with two other Kubrick movies- 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining- when these movies were released critics hated on them, same complaints with all three of these films, yet a second viewing (once again) proved that it was misunderstood and genius.A Clockwork Orange has one of the greatest opening scenes in cinematic history, we have Alex looking directly at the camera, while his droogs are passed out and looking elsewhere. His intense stare and narration create a weird and already disturbing atmosphere. On this first viewing, I strongly disliked the movie, and I couldn't make it through that first r**e scene, I was completely and utterly disturbed. A year later I decided to rewatch it, after watching other mature movies I think I was ready for A Clockwork Orange, and I was right, this movie is beautifully filmed, perfectly scripted and the fact that Kubrick did most camera work, wrote the film, directed it and produced it is beyond me. He is a perfectionist and you can tell that with each shot - even the minimal ones - he put in the most amount of effort that he could and it truly made me appreciate cinema more.Some scenes are deeply disturbing, when I went back and watched it for a third and fourth time, I always shut my eyes during the ""Singin' in the Rain"" scene. Alex DeLarge is a monstrous human being, yet he is our protagonist, he commits these heinous crimes and he gets jail time he deserves. He runs into all of these people who he has beaten earlier in the film, even runs into his two droogs, they all punish him and we feel slight sympathy for his character, he is locked in a room by Mr Alexander (the husband of the woman who died from injuries sustained during the Singin' in the Rain scene) and forced to listened to Beethoven - this music reminds him of the crimes he commited and it tortures him to the point of near-suicide. He jumps out of the window and Mr Alexander goes to jail.The Ludovico techique is seen as wrong and is being pushed to be stopped, Alex is now seen as a hero in the newspapers and the ending is left to interpretation, I think that Alex definitely wasn't cured, he is going to continue this endless cycle of r**e and violence, unlike the book's ending which has Alex become a normal human being. Overall, this is the most unique and intriguing movie I have ever seen.",True
8,n/a,Great Piece of Art,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I would say that the movie is really a gem of an art piece. The use of excellent imagery coupled with pretty out-of-the-place background score tells us about the uniqueness of this movie. Stanley Kubrick has really applied a lot of thought into this.The director wants the audience to feel something as bad not because he is showing it as bad but because it really is bad. The background music accompanying the ultra violent scenes is comical, and not dramatic or anything else that is commonly associated with such scenes. This gives the viewer an opportunity to feel the bitterness not because the music hints so but because he himself feels so. Viewer's emotions should arise irrespective of what the director is trying to show, and this is one of the greatest successes of the movie.Another glorifying feature is the central idea of the movie. If a human is striped of the choice to choose from good and evil, he no longer remains a human, he becomes a clockwork. When Alex is brain-washed and ""programmed"" to choose only good, he wasn't accepted by the society and this shows the irony in the objectives of the British Government. The word Orange from the title presumably comes from the word ""Ourange"" that loosely means man. And hence the title is so appropriate to the movie.The artificiality in dialogues and sets give the movie a unique feature and enhance the grip on it. This also means that the viewer has to get more involved. This is definitely one of the best technically shot movies, another masterpiece of Kubrick like the Space Oddessey.For the uninitiated, set in near future Britain, the movie shows Malcom MacDowell as the head of a group of youngsters involved in sexual violence. Turn of the events leave the protagonist in the hands of the police. Worried by the growing number of prisoners the British Government devises a method of ""programming"" them so that they always choose the good. Alex is chosen as one of those on which the new system is to be tested. The rest unfolds as a saga of the very human characteristic.Lastly, I would like to say that you may be compelled to leave the movie in between, but if you are watching it for art and cinematic experience, I recommend you to sit through.",False
9,10,Kubrick's best,ickyptang,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerStanely Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" is one of the first movies that proved that cinema can be the most enlightening and amazing art form around. Movies have always been a true love for me, but it wasn't until this film challenged me that I fell deeply in love.  The first viewing left me speechless, unable to describe how weird and terrible I felt.  I thought it was the film that left me in this mood, so of course that was the easy target to blame.  It was just a bad movie, overrated and stupid and a waste of time.  But upon further thought, I realised the film did exactly what it was supposed to.  It showed how the world can be a weird and horrible place, and how this young man who goes around torturing people and being a wicked person ultimately doesn't have to pay for what he does.  And it's funny too. So this film brilliantly satirises this world, showcasing pure evil and people who ordinarily do not perform such evil are forced to laugh and observe what we all hate to admit is the truth.  It's sick, but at the same time brilliant.  And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it.  It just is what it is.  It's real.  No one really sees it very often, but it is out there and everyone knows.  And no one does anything about it.  In essence, ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the ultimate satire, and one of the ultimate film experiences.  It's art, it's life, and in a funky way, it's entertaining.",True
10,8,A controversial and offensive masterpiece.,tyson-hunsaker,n/a,15/08/2025,"Anyone looking to watch A Clockwork Orange might be wanting to revisit some of Stanley Kubrik's work and might be interested in studying this film. Those who have already seen this film tend to already have strong opinions regarding this dark sci-fi movie but for me, I approached this film recently to obtain an opinion for myself and study one of the great masters of cinema.The fact that this film was regarded as one of the most controversial films ever made (rightfully so) sparked genuine curiosity to give this flick a full viewing and while I have large issues with the film, the experience as a whole was both satisfying and a learning experience.This story centers on ""Alex"" our main protagonist and his gang of hoodlums set in a not so distant, dystopian Great Britain. The beginning portion unfolds Alex's dark and twisted soul as we watch him and his gang fight, rape, and kill. When he's eventually caught, he undergoes controversial ""treatment"" to be cured of his dark soul.I first appreciated the inmate concepts of this story and the type of questions the story attempted to raise to the audience. Furthermore, much of the psychological ideologies surrounding freedom, choice, good vs evil, and selfishness were extremely thought-provoking. It had a way of making me feel self-exploratory despite the character's complete inability to relate with (hopefully) any viewer.Performances were top notch; especially from the lead: Malcom McDowell. His performance felt so authentic there's never a single moment that feels fake or forced with his dark character. As always, Stanley Kubrick directs the hell out of this. His commanding and authoritative shooting style is apparent in every frame of the picture and he does a wonderful job at sucking the viewer into this terrible world to the point of enthrallment.While all these positives make for a great movie-going experience and when Kubrick is at the director's helm not much can go wrong, the film's biggest downfall is indeed its controversy. Disturbing subject matter in this piece is indeed vital to the essence of the story but taking off the gloves when it comes to fighting, rape, and killing (especially the rape) make this so incredibly disturbing that it's difficult to muscle through. I found that A Clockwork Orange was not only offense because of its disturbing content, it was personally offensive in so many ways. Frankly, these extremely rare and offensive movie experiences are not quite the reason I enjoy films in the first place; stories can still be thought-provoking while not morally offend and damage the viewer internally. In addition, a viewer looking to study the work of Stanley Kubrick can still experience some of cinema's greatest and transcendent experiences without feeling like their conscience has blackened.It's understandable that not everyone feels this way; just as stated before, opinions about this film are all across the board. As time has passed however, A Clockwork Orange has stood out has one of Kubrick's finest and has been adored by die-hard fans so much its fan base has grown over the years.The best advice to give is to see it for yourself. Much like all other Kubrick films, relying on anyone's opinion won't help one bit. Seeing it and deciding for yourself is the best course of action. That being said, despite it's strong artistic merit, I wouldn't recommend seeing it simply because of the morally offensive and sickening content that most don't appreciate. Overall, it's been the hardest one to review in a long time because it's not a simple: see it or don't see it. There's much more to this picture than that. If you do decide to see it though, be warned and well prepared. If not, that's probably just fine too.",False
11,6,I just didn't get why it's a masterpiece,coombsstephen,n/a,15/08/2025,I looked forward to seeing this classic for the first time but came out a bit bemused about what all the fuss was about.It was an ok film and certainly quite out there in the content and the way it was filmed but I failed to see what made it such a cult classic.Maybe its a generation thing.,False
12,10,My brief review of the film,sol-,n/a,15/08/2025,"A disturbing but yet very beautiful piece of film-making, Kubrick has created the ultimate study of mind manipulation in this film. It is a protest against reform programs that take away freedom of a choice, and the message of the film in terms of paying for one's sins in all eternity is inescapable, evident to a large extent in the sardonic nature of the tale. Although set in the future, it hardly feels like it is, this being because the message of the film is overwhelmingly powerful and capable of applying to any age. The film has a number of possible hidden meanings to it  a feat equaled on scale only by Kubrick's former film '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Besides for the meaning behind the film, there are still the marks of a masterpiece. Kubrick's direction is superb alongside the good photography, capturing shadows and angles needed to establish tone. The editing is excellent too, done in a flashy, brainwashing style at times to have relevance to the film. The choice of cast is again inspirational, however the film achieves the most in terms of music. Kubrick manages to use one of the earliest forms of art, classical music, and give it an unforgettable style and importance in the film. It is truly a difficult task to explain what is so great about a film such as 'A Clockwork Orange'  it is maybe best explained by watching the film itself.",False
13,7,The milky bar kid,Prismark10,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Clockwork Orange was always a film I wanted to watch but it was one of these films that I was too young to watch when it was initially released in British cinemas and then banned by Director Stanley Kubrick from being available in Britain. The ban remained until he died.The film became infamous for its depiction of violence and sex. It overlooked the fact that despite its initial scenes of brutality and rape, in its heart it is a dark comedy set in a futuristic Dystopian Britain.An adaptation of Anthony Burgess novel, Malcolm McDowell might be a shade too old to play the teenage delinquent Alex getting high on milk-plus which is infused with drugs and then partakes in an orgy of ultra-violence which includes beating up a vagrant, fighting with a rival gang and then speeding through the country roads where they burst into the house of a writer who gets beaten up and watches his wife get raped as Alex sings Singin in the rain.We know Alex is still at school as he lives in his parents flat and is visited the next morning by his probation officer who is concerned about his absence from school.However Alex's luck runs out. He falls out with his fellow gang members and when he breaks into another house, he kills a woman with a phallic sculpture, betrayed by his gang and caught by the police, he is sentenced to 14 years in jail.The opening part of the film would had been deemed shocking in early 1970s Britain. I doubt that level of sex and savagery would had ever been seen before in a mainstream British film.However the film becomes more of a surreal prison film once Alex ends up in jail where he joins a church group and tries to fend off advances from fellow inmates. A visiting government minister offers him a chance to take part in an experiment. Once he undertakes an experimental aversion therapy for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks the film becomes a black revenge comedy.Once freed from prison and rehabilitated Alex finds there is no room for him in his parents home, he gets set upon by a gang of vagrants as the tramp who he beat up in the beginning recognises Alex. His old gang members are now in the police and they torture him. Worse still he stumbles into the house of the writer who he attacked and he gets his vengeance as well. Poor Alex now cannot listen to his favourite piece of Beethoven without doing harm to himself.There is an underlying political satire of a government wanting to tackle violence in society by being draconian themselves until public opinion turns against them.The film contains a lot of slang derived from east European languages and although I mentioned he looked rather old to play the teenage Alex, Malcolm McDowell delivers an amazing performance providing a narrative with his Yorkshire tones.The film might put off some of its audience with its disturbing opening but settles in well after that.",False
14,1,Boring 1970's attempt to shock,parcdelagrange,n/a,15/08/2025,"I watched this film on its original release, I also watched it a few days ago, I was hoping that with age it may have appealed to me more, but unfortunately it failed to hold my attention now, just as it failed to hold my attention way back then. The director has chosen to use graphic sex and violence to gloss over a bad script, feeble plot and mediocre acting. This film is remembered today for all of the wrong reasons. If looking at full frontal nudity is your thing, or unrealistic violence turns you on, then this film would probably appeal, but if you like a movie to entertain or to be thought provoking, I should give it a miss.",False
15,10,Kubrick and the Art of Violence.,nycritic,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerStanley Kubrick has a way of telling stories about violence without actually exploiting them, or going into exaggeration. In DR STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE THE BOMB violence as war was discussed, overheard, never truly seen until the final reel when a flurry of atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as the song ""We'll Meet Again"" lovingly played in the background. In 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY Hal-9000 terminates an entire crew in a most chilling way and all we see is a computer screen indicating the termination of life. Now, in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.Alex DeLarge is the leader of a band of 'droogs' who move from location to location terrorizing their victims, putting them under outrageous acts of violence. When two of his 'droogs' refuse to follow Alex's path of destruction, he turns on them and beats them, until an act of reversal turns against Alex and he is brought down by the medical industry who decides to ""reform"" his heretofore sociopathic tendencies. One he is cured, an interesting chain of humiliating events that bring Alex even farther down ensue: he is, for example, now attacked by his very ex-mates, now policemen, and his ex-victims. Sometimes the cure is far worse than the illness. Karma is a bitch.Kubrick has a particular way of visualizing his films. A CLOCKWORK ORANGE has a look and feel completely out of its time, closer to sometime in the future, and its torture sequence in which Alex is regenerated also looks straight out of a science fiction movie. However, this is not a science fiction film. It's actually quite difficult to categorize CLOCKWORK because it's something of a social satire, something of a drama, has comedic moments and deconstructs a musical for a horrifying rape sequence; however, its approach to the material gives it the feel of a hybrid out of time, out of place, but visually arresting and impossible to take for granted. It's this approach that makes the work the product of a master of direction -- it can be seen multiple times and every time a different perspective arises, and all one can be left with is with the notion that this is pure, ultra-modern cinema.",True

Alex. we love, hate, and or just plain utterly confused about how we feel of Alex. Alex is the greatest villain ever because he is ourselves, he is the worst of ourselves. hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surface eventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you. the way Alex stares into the camera in the first scene just freaks me out, he has a little smirk on his face that seems to say you may hate me, but you'll never be rid of me, because there can never be good without the bad, and i am the bad.",False
17,8,orchestra of violence,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"In a dystopian world, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell) leads his 3 followers in ultraviolence. Eventually, he is arrested for killing an old lady. In prison, he finds the violence in religion to be calming. He volunteers for an experimental treatment program. The treatment makes him ill when confronted with violence and sex. He is released and is confronted by the violence that he himself promoted.This is almost experimental in its examination of sex and violence in society. It is an unique surreal film. The ideas behind it may be lost to people who sees this simply as an artistic violent movie. No matter how one dissects this, Malcolm McDowell's performance is beyond reproach. He shows his great acting abilities.",False
18,10,This is an all time masterpiece,kevin_robbins,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Clockwork Orange (1971) is a movie I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows a little gang of misfits who travels the streets of England causing chaos through their random acts of violence. When they cross each other one night trying to establish a leader the direction of the gang and leader of the gang changes permanently...this movie is directed by legend Stanley Kubrick (The Shining) and stars Malcolm McDowell (Halloween), Patrick Magee (Zulu), Michael Bates (Patton), Warren Clarke (Firefox) and Adrienne Corri (Bunny Lake is Missing). This story from beginning to end is absolutely captivating. The sets are eccentric and unique. The dialogue is brilliant as the terminology is entertaining and well delivered. The acting by McDowell is all time great. One of my favorite all time performances. The circumstances throughout the film are horrifying, hilarious, intense and unpredictable all at the same time. The cinematography within the film keeps your mind turning throughout. This is an all time masterpiece that is an absolute must see and a 10/10.",False
19,10,Best movie ever made,ChrJahnsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"A Clockwork Orange is the finest film that has ever been made, in my view. Stanley Kubrick has made so many masterpieces, and is by far the best director that ever graced our world. A Clockwork Orange is simply his finest hour!The film grabs you and glues you to your seat from start to finish. Malcolm McDowell gives us a shining example of superior acting, and the movie is as perverted as any of Kubrick's masterpieces (and then some!). It contains horrifying violence, extreme emotions, perversity and weirdness at it's very worst. It all boils down to serve you a plethora of thoughts for you to take with you and contemplate, after the film ends.However, with all the perversity bursting out of this film, you will probably NOT like this film the first time you see it. I know I didn't. Fortunately, I gave it a second chance, and thought: Hey, it was actually not bad at all. After the third time, I was lost for words.After the fourth time, there was little doubt in my mind, that this was the finest film ever made, and regardless of how many great masterpieces I see, A Clockwork Orange still towers above them. I'm sure you'll agree, if you give it the chance it deserves, although it may require for you to see it more than once.",False
20,n/a,The Eye and the Genital,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerSpoiler herein.Kubrick's films are misunderstood. Reading the professional reviews and comments here, one would think the reason for this film to exist is for Kubrick to make a strong satire. What bunk. What a small view.This movie is about the tyranny of movies (and similar performances). The fact that so few people see it as something else is a testament to the self-protective nature of films in our soul.The Droogs engage in performances. Their speech is theatrical. Their rival gang is discovered on the stage. There is a focus on the eye. They wear costumes. The sex with the teeniboppers is cast as a performance (and photographed that way). The accosted writer is (selfreferentially) the writer of the film, who incidentally drives the character to suicide by exposing him to a performance. During that attack, the Droogs act out another film.The therapy is forcing `us' to watch movies precisely like the one we are watching. Kubrick follows the Film-within-the-film rule of having the distance of abstraction from the film with to the film be the same as from `real' life to the film. The entire film can be seen as (pick one): one of the punishment films; a subsequent vision in the hospital; a musical drama played out in some kid's head; a simple hallucination in the milk bar; a simple invention of the gay writer (who pretends he had a wife).All of Kubrick's work starting with Lolita is an exploration into the plasticity of narrative, in the context of obsession (`Lolita'), war (Metal'), power , space (meaning the environment as in `Lyndon'), and invented reality (`2001') and adulterous fantasies (`Eyes'). Here we work with violent adolescent sex: cockworks. It is what Phil Dick had in mind.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 4: Worth watching.",True
21,6,What this film is really about,mls4182,n/a,15/08/2025,"KARMA. The best intentions and efforts of society may fail, but karma will get you.The first half of the film is pretty brutal to watch. The second half makes it all worth it. I don't think young viewers will be disturbed by the violence in the film, but I think they will be shocked by what real breasts look like. They actually MOVE. They have all been cinematically weaned on silicone.",False
22,10,One of the greatest films ever made,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI haven't read the novel that this film is based upon, and I didn't know that much about it before I sat down to see it. I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it. I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful. From the very first frame to the very last... amazing. Kubrick's style is magnificent, his storytelling is among the best ever seen in cinema. With this film he truly captures the raw and pure qualities of violence. I don't think(well, I certainly don't hope) that anyone who ever has or ever will see this film confuses this as an ode or a tribute to violence... this is not, in any way, shape, or form glorifying violence or violent behavior. Quite the contrary, you might say. The film proves, once and for all, that violence spawns violence. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The angles, pans, tracking shots... fantastic work. The ideas presented in the film are more than enough to disturb and freak out any normal person... which is(at least part of) the point. If I mention the words 'eyes opened forcefully' you probably already know what I'm talking about, right? That famous sequence has been referenced, spoofed and talked about more times than just about any other visual impression in the history of cinema. The way everyone and everything turns at Alex after he's apparently cured... truly disturbing. I found a surprise at every change in scenery or even in immediate situation, especially in the latter part of the movie. The way society turns against Alex after he rejoins it, apparently a better man... one of the most 'true' and real cinematic truths ever told of humanity. We are beasts, we are what is commonly referred to as 'inhumane'... and Kubrick tells us this in a truly astonishing manner. The plot is very good. It deals with the main character of Alex, beautifully played by Malcolm McDowell, who loves 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. He is incarcerated and offered a chance to be re-entered to society, after being 'cured' of his psychotic tendencies. The pacing is... well, hard to describe, really... it feels slow, the movie seems to move slowly... but it hardly drags at all. It's exhausting, not to mention hard to sit through, both due to the extreme content and the slowly moving plot, but it's all worth it. The point is pure genius. Pure Kubrick. The acting is flawless... and believe me, that is not a term I use lightly. Every single actor performs perfectly. The characters are perfectly written, credible in every scene and interesting. The cinematography is pure beauty... pure excellence. I've come to love Kubrick's visual style. His cuts of varying speed and intensity, his long takes when dealing with dialog... truly amazing. His use of music is astounding... the use of classical music is great and really adds to the ironic tone and the atmosphere, the mood of the film. This is truly a work of art, and an exhausting but truly worthwhile film. I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or intelligent theater. If you believe yourself to be perceptive and intelligent enough to understand the film on most or all of its levels(I don't claim to, not at all), or even on the most basic levels, such as theme and morale(which is what I understood of it) then you should, nay, then you *need* to see this film. Be prepared, though, it does contain quite a lot of disturbing themes and ideas, and is not in any way for the faint of heart. 10/10",True
23,7,"Stanley Kubrick's satire on crime and justice is just shy of being a great movie. It's perverse and provoking, but there's also mad genius beneath its repulsive content",TheUnknown837-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"One thing was certain about Stanley Kubrick: once you gave him complete control over the story of his film, you were at the mercy of his malice and onslaught. Like his science-fiction classic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", his 1971 film ""A Clockwork Orange"" was and still is a film of heavy controversy and debate. Some laud the movie for its satirical and dark humor when addressing crime and punishment. Others believe it's just too dark, too nihilistic, too right wing, and brutal to be taken for art or even a good movie.What's my verdict? Well, somewhere in the middle. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but to me, it's not a masterpiece. I really enjoyed the first half of the movie. I liked the middle section, but the third act just fell apart for me. Perhaps I wasn't quite ready just like I wasn't prepared for the Star Child scene in ""2001"" and wasn't sure how to take it. A second viewing might help. But one thing is for sure about ""A Clockwork Orange."" It is a brutal, disturbing, and even at times offensively off-putting madman story. But buried beneath all its exterior horrific content, there is also a sort of mad, maniacal genius that holds it together.The film is set in futuristic Europe, during a time when all the people in world seem to have gone nihilistic and pornographic without a fear or care. A young rapist named Alex (Malcolm McDowell) is captured by the police after accidentally murdering his victim and becomes subject to a new sort of government test that should cure him of his evil waysbut things might go awry.The first half of ""A Clockwork Orange"" really shocked and appalled me. There were times my stomach turned around inside of me because it was so disturbing. I actually felt uncomfortable and even a little unclean sitting there watching these scenes of explicit rape and nudity and almost dance-like violence. Kubrick clearly wasn't afraid to let his expressionism free on the screen. But oddly enough, although I felt really bad watching these scenes, I also felt kind of awed for I understood that Kubrick wasn't glorifying crime, he was kind of alerting us to how many people seem to glorify it. In a way, he's alerting us to our own perverse thoughts. This is also aided by the fact that our protagonist is one of the screen's most offensive villains.The middle section of the film was not as good as the first part. When Kubrick started to satirize the justice system gone madI felt the movie became way too talky and verbose. Characters would say a whole lot of words but communicate very little point. And then the third act just became too slow for my liking and this is what ultimately cost the film a potential fourth star. Kubrick had a lot of say, but I don't think he said it with the right notes.I say notes, because Kubrick is also making majestic uses of classical music during scenes of violence and madness. Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonies are used several times throughout the film in surprisingly appalling but ingenious ways. Edward Elgar's classic ""Pomp and Circumstance"" also makes a wonderful appearance in a wonderful sequence. You can say another thing about Stanley Kubrick's (and can see this also in ""2001""): he had good taste in music.Perhaps I am writing this review a little too early. Maybe ""A Clockwork Orange"" is not a film that can be properly analyzed and reviewed after a single, unprepared viewing. But I will say this about my first impression of this dark and perverse tale. It is good film-making. And the performance by Malcolm McDowell is hands-down brilliant.",False
24,1,The most overrated film in cinema history.,Analog_Devotee,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've seen this film three times over the years. The first time I saw it, I was completely blown away by how awful it was. Surely I was missing something, right? I mean, after all, it's considered to be not only one of the best films of the 1970's (no slouching decade) but of all time! I asked a friend of mine who was studying film in California what I was missing, and his answer was, ""Well, it's a Kubrick film, so you may have to watch it more than once."" And so, that following year, I sat down and watched this film two more times waiting for the reveal to finally wash over me. Today, I can tell you that was easily the worst piece of advice I've taken so far in my life. This film makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, and any ""underlying themes"" people speak of is a load of hogwash. It's just bad. Period.So, why did this film become so popular over the years? Probably because people LOVE to bow down to Kubrick as being the greatest filmmaker of all time, and nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the only movie I've seen from him that's actually good is Full Metal Jacket.Although I've never read the book, I'm sure it's much better than this film. People were a lot less likely to bandwagon books pre-Harry Potter. If a book got a lot of attention back then, it probably deserved it. My recommendation would be to read the book and not waste your time on this pretentious, illogical, downright frustrating film.",False
25,10,My favorite movie,Ayatollah,n/a,15/08/2025,"Without a doubt, my absolute favorite film of all time. I first saw this movie three years ago and I have been in love with it (and Stanley Kubrick) ever since. I never get tired of seeing this movie. Why it remains so underappreciated (at least by ""casual"" movie viewers) is beyond me. Everything is great; acting, direction, cinematography, the sets, everything.Something that I don't think anyone else commented on was the Russian motif. The names of the droogs (Alexander, George, Peter, and Dim...short for Dimitri) are decidedly Russian. The singer referenced in the record store, Johnny Zhivago, has obvious Russian overtones. The statement made by the Minister of the Interior about the ""peace-loving citizens"" is a direct reference to the name that Soviet government representatives applied to their people when talking about the Cold War. Red seems to stand out from other colors. And, of course, who could forget Nadsat, the Russian slang language? I wonder what Burgess and Kubrick were trying to suggest about the future of Ingsoc (those familiar with ""1984"" will understand)?",False

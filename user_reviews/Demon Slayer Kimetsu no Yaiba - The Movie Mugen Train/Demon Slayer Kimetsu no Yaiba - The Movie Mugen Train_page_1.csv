1,9,I've read the manga. I expected the best. It will definitely deliver.,TheGreatGreenBadger,n/a,15/08/2025,"Ufotable is honestly on a roll with the hit Demon Slayer series. It's simply bloody fantastic but also has a lot of heart, as a lot of people will see in this movie, which introduces one of the other Hashiras of the Demon Slayer Corps.",False
2,8,Breathtaking,Movi3DO,n/a,15/08/2025,"Set Your Heart Ablaze..... Rengoku-sanAh finally back at the theater. It sure felt good. This is the Mugen train arc that was set up at the end of season 1 of Demon Slayer.I expected the same level of animation in the anime, and this movie delivered that aspect the best way it could. It was pleasure for my eyes to see the flame, water, and thunder breathing techniques on display. The action scenes were breathtaking and intense.My problem was that the plot was pretty simple, which made the movie felt too short. I wanted to learn more about the characters, especially Rengoku, and even the demons. The emotion did not hit as high as it could.Overall, the movie was still a blast. 8.5/10.",False
3,9,Nearly Perfect,akshatmahajan,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI liked the anime but was not impressed that they are continuing anime with movie. After I finished the movie, i realize that I shouldn't have worried about this thing from the start. Every scene in this movie was really well planed. Action, comedy, drama everything was balanced. Composition of action and conversation in between were also balanced. (This thing is difficult to balance but they did it). Rengoku's character was well written. I started admiring him and felt very sad at what happened at the end.I watched the movie at home but I think it deserves theatre experience. Overall, a great watch.",True
4,10,Piece of art,rayanejelidi,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you liked the animation of the season 1 of demon slayer you will simply adore this film this is a true masterpiece with a captivating story and music that will make you cry , a must watch for any fan of the show .",False
5,10,"10 is not enough, from Japan",mty20ktgn,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI want to set the score 100, not 10. The story, characters, visual, actions and moves, professional voice actors, sounds, Lisa's main song are so completely mixed at supreme level.
(By the way, the meaning of ""Mugen Ressha-Hen"" is ""Infinite Train Arc"". The name of the train in the film is ""Mugen (Infinite)"".)I love movies, seeing it in theaters. Net-streaming is OK as a supplement, but I think it cannot be the mainstream of this industry, and I do hope this movie will be released in USA, Europe, China soon, pull the people back to their nearest theaters, save the industry.I saw this movie on the 1st Saturday, the 1st show (8AM) in a theater near me. 400 seats were 100% full, the audience must wear a mask, drinking was allowed, but no eating (usually in Japan, no shouting, no chanting even without COVID19).Just before the start, I felt ""total concentration breathing"" of the all audience in the theater, complete silence & 100% focus on the screen, that explained how we all were long waiting for this movie's release.The movie itself is really great, so ""breathtaking"". This is the ultimate Anime of a popular Manga/comic series, and I want to give big big big applause to Ufotable who have created this masterpiece.For those who have seen the anime series only (26 episodes), not known the full story of this film, you must go and see Rengoku-san's several ""Flame-breathing"" forms, which give you goose-bumps. His scenes are so super and great that make all people understand Hashira's power & strength.For those who have seen the anime and read the manga series (known full story), you also must go and see how each panel of the manga moves (it really moves!!), and enjoy comparing the scene and the panel after watching the movie (like me). You can also feel the characters' feelings more vividly than the manga series.In the end of the movie, you would be thankful and grateful for the mask, not only for anti-COVID19, but also for hiding your tears and runny noses. (this happened to me, I was so moved and emotional...) In the end, during the last song, the theater was filled with many sobbings.---- Spoilers ----
I try to minimize my spoilers here.Before the last battle, I felt that the all audience again did into ""total concentration"" one level deeper, and I guessed that most of them must have already read the manga series.The last battle was so so great, I have never seen such a great battle in my life that I cannot describe it with my poor English vocabulary. I can only say that it surpassed the episode 19's battle in Demon slayer anime series, and Ufotable has realized/materialized the manga 100% or more with visual, sounds, voices, backgrounds, etc.I also praise the power of Japanese professional voice actors/actress. They express the characters' feelings completely and you will be easily captured by their voice-performance. I really feel great and am proud that Japan has such great voice actors. I recommend all people in the world to see this movie with Japanese original voices with your own language subtitles, so you can listen/hear/feel their great performance.Ufotable/Aniplex did very good job to make it secret about the last battle. It was not revealed until the opening day. They also even hid the voice actor's name of the key character in the last battle. When I heard the voice in the theater, I felt like and shouted in my mind, ""Wow, it's him! Yes!"" Some of them in the theater must have been same like me. The voice was 100% fit and so convincing that I was like persuaded to become a de....Anyway, please enjoy (with tears)! I am looking forward to seeing/reading your reactions/reviews about this film from all over the world.",True
6,10,Might just be my new favorite film of the year.,asherrbh_15,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rengoku is awesome in this film, and you understand why everyone looks up to him.I just have to state the most obvious thing though, this animation is truly breathtaking, if you love the show you're going to love this movie.To be honest I just had a great time watching it, me and my friends all loved it, not to mention the fight scenes are impeccable.Definitely an A+",False
7,10,Incredible,jasminn_tan,n/a,15/08/2025,"I read the manga so I knew what would happen but seeing it animated just brought another level of heartbreak to me. With the amazing animation and background music, I was engrossed in this movie. Also, the final fight scene between Rengoku and the Upper Rank Three demon was probably one of the best fight scenes I've watched so far. Granted, I haven't watched many fight scenes. Still, it was such a pleasure to watch.",False
8,10,I never wrote a single review in my life and here is my review for the first time.,hhktdkncey,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you have watched the first season of Demon Slayer. You will not be disappointed. If you only read manga, you will also not be disappointed. Feelz are real. Visuals 10, feelz 10, sound track 10, humour 10 and story line 10. So don't read other reviews to decide if you should watch it or not. Go and Watch it.",False
9,10,"The action, the feeling, it's PERFECT",gracejonwilin,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was worried because the movie is in the train, and I was afraid it will become boring. After I finished the movie, i realize that I shouldn't worried about this thing from the start. Every scene in this movie is really well planed, if the action scene start getting too long they will change it into another scene so we will not get bored with the action (I mean the composition of action and te conversation is balance.)And then the effects, both 3D and 2D. It's P E R F E C T. Even though we only have 2 hours to know Rengoku character, but the feeling, the emotion still really hit me. Like I cry a river in the cinemaðŸ˜¬It's really recommended! But please remind this in your mind that you need to watch the season 1 before you watch this movie.",False
10,7,So pretty,Mr-Fusion,n/a,15/08/2025,"Had no idea what I was walking into, that's as frank as I can make it. Out of nowhere my kid has a love for Demon Slayer and here I am along for the ride. But she's seen the show and I had no context. Here we have a bunch of people on a train, one of them really excited about his bento box (""Umai! ... Umai!""), another wearing a boar's head, now everyone's asleep and pretty soon the fighting begins . . .That said . . .It is a gorgeous film. The battle scenes are exciting, the animation is superb, and the high quality bears out (Tanjiro's water effects are crazy).Purely on a visual level, I enjoyed this film. I have no doubt that any self-respecting anime fan is scoffing at my ignorance, but it is what it is. Mugen Train is easy on the eyes.",False
11,10,Amazing movie!,suvanshgkhr,n/a,15/08/2025,"An amazing thrill ride full of comedy, dark and emotional moments that will leave you begging for more. If you liked the Demon Slayer anime, you are sure to love this movie.",False
12,n/a,its good!,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"I wont say the best but its really good, full of every anime recipe. This is my first time watching anime movie in cinema its worth it. Feel like gonna watch again!",False
13,7,What you think about this movie depends on what you think about the series,isaacsundaralingam,n/a,15/08/2025,"Demon Slayer: Mugen Train is a movie that was looked forward to universally with as much hype as possible. And when it eventually did come out, the reviews were great and so was its box office performance. And ever since, this movie has been a pretty big deal amongst the anime community.I finally was able to watch it, and I guess I'm a little underwhelmed by the whole thing. My reaction to this movie was very similar to how I felt about the series, and I think the same can be said of everyone. The series, in my opinion, is a decently enjoyable B-Tier anime with 1 exceptionally phenomenal episode. But that's just my take on it and I'm aware I'm in the minority here, because the amount of love this series has garnered is almost unbelievably massive and universal. So what Mugen Train caters to is exactly that demographic of fans (as so it should), meaning that for someone like me who found very little to go crazy about in the series, would find very little to go crazy about in this movie. But if you're one of those who loved the series for its goofiness and style, then this movie is in every way a treat.I don't think Mugen Train was a bad movie in any way. It was decently enjoyable and had its little moments. The plot is pretty straight forward but makes very little sense if you even stop to think about it. The progress was lazily convenient and the stakes never felt real until at the very end of the movie. The humor was pretty goofy and the characters were as over-the-top as they were in the series... Enjoyable, still The animation was pretty good and consistent throughout; especially the action scenes that were choreographed as well as they were in the series. The colors, the visuals, the music... they're all pretty great and add to the visually pleasing appeal of the movie.In conclusion, this movie doesn't add anything to the medium in any meaningful way, but it stays true to its style and convention as that is what people love most about the Demon Slayer universe. If you loved the series, you'll love this movie... Go for it!",False
14,5,Just 2 episodes as one,sandervanderheide,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie takes of where season one of the series stops and it is just that, 2 episodes stitched together. So if you didn't see the series, you need at least watch a recap before watching this. Although I've seen a lot of anime movies and I know Japanese animation has a different approach than western animation, I was very underwhelmed by this one and not moved at all.when characters start crying in this kind of anime, they open the flood gates, visually and auditory. But that doesn't mean you will understand or feel their pain. So you're watching just some crazy emotional stuff and it doesn't move you at all. It almost made me burst in laughter when someone fell down to earth and started crying like crazy.most characters are very superficial, although the storyline pretends they have a lot of emotional bagage to deal with.the storyline doesn't hold much: a train has been taken over by a demon who needs to be killed80% of the movie is just fighting with no build up. So after a while, this gets boring and when you think it's done, there is another 20 min fight. It looks stunning thoughOnly watch this movie when you love the series.",False
15,10,Unbelievable out of the box,yashdeepverma,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWorth watching in cinemas, This movie gonna insane for demon slayer fans you all definitely love his songs an animations.Some of scene able to make you cry.Very Insane!!.",True
16,10,Just wow!!!,sheilaleesl,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI didn't expect such a tragic ending. After the movie ended, I just sat there and wonder to myself, ""what just happened?"" The visual, the art, the masterpiece behind this movie was truly astonishing and just amazing. I can't describe how great this movie was. At this point, take all my money. Even until now, my heart just couldn't accept the fact it ended that way (trying not to spoil it). I highly recommend to all my anime lovers.",True
17,8,demon slayer,MB-reviewer185,n/a,15/08/2025,"Having seen the anime I loved this movie. Outstanding animation and likable characters (tanjiro, zenitsu, inosuke).(Saw in japanese with english subtitles)Really funny and emotionally investing scenes with awesome looking fight scenes.",False
18,9,Worth the wait,vin-siddharth,n/a,15/08/2025,"A true delight for the demon slayer fans, starts slow but picks up the pace brilliantly after the interval.",False
19,9,There is a reason this became the most succesfull anime movie of ALL TIME!,and_mikkelsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"Yeah the succes of this movie is no secret by this point! It started a trend where other studios also made movies that tied into the shows, such as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, One piece Red and the upcoming Haikyuu final part 1 and 2!The movie is guarenteed to blow you away og shock you in one way or another! The story is simple, but effective! It never feels like it slows down, and the almost 2hr runtime will go by fast! By the time the movie ends you will have cried your eyes out! So many emotions in this movie! The animation is also INCREDIBLE!! UNREAL AT TIMES!! Set the bar for the amazing fights in season 2! The characters are also likeable and all get their moment to shine! Soundtrack is also incredible, especially Akaza and Rengoku theme!Overall a fun and emotional train-ride i would highly recommend!",False

22,7,A tail of two halves (terrible to great),dkalmikov,n/a,15/08/2025,"First half of the film was pretty cheesy, slow and I found uninteresting compared to how amazing the show really is.The last 20-30 minutes of this movie really was the anchor as it was a spectacular fight scene with incredible animation that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Made it worth the watch and hopefully they figure it out in the next film where the the whole story will be interesting to watch.",False
23,10,Truely a masterpiece,luucong,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerTanjiro cried, Zenitsu cried, Inosuke cried, the crow cried, I cried and everyone cried. Graphic 10/10, Music 10/10, Rengoku 11/10",True
24,7,It is not even close to becoming a masterpiece.,hpsadiq,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a movie that starts after the events of the anime I expected more, because you don't need to identify the characters or build them, You have a lot of time And the movie didn't use this time properly, It could better by showing up more characters and deeper villainess.I loved the drama in this movie and touched me at some points.But at some point the comedy in this movie wasn't at the right time and exaggerating, and I fell they trying to say whether you like it or not you should laugh.Production wasn't the best they used cgi wasn't very bad, but it's cgi anyway, actually the animation In episode 19 of the anime was better.",False
25,5,"Nice animations, but very corny and clichÃ©",Juggen,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWhat a pointless movie!Fanboys, get your lube ready, this movie got some amazing animations, everything else: not so amazing... and corny as ever.This movie could have been a 25min-episode if they didn't draw the fights out to infinity. Can't believe this went on for two hours.Only point in watching this is if you only value cool animations, seriously.Summary: Get on train, fall asleep, fight slimy things, watch Rengoku being badass, END.",True

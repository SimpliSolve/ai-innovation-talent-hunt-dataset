1,10,"Excellent documentary about Chuck Leavell, gifted musician and humanitarian",Sasha_Lauren,n/a,15/08/2025,"Who hasn't genius pianist - keyboardist Chuck Leavell, a mostly self taught rock and roll musician with serious soul, played with? A member of The Rolling Stones, Allman Brothers Band, and founding member of Sea Level, he played with Pink Floyd, Black Crowes, Eric Clapton, John Mayer, George Harrison, Miranda Lambert, Blues Traveler and many more top notch players, Leavell, highly loved and respected by friends, fans, and fellow musicians is a gem of a person with a bright, warm grin. The talking heads include many of the musicians he collaborates with, his family, Billy Bob Thorton, Jimmy Carter, and of course, Bonnie Raitt who seems to be interviewed in a good percentage of rock docs I've seen and always adds quality and insight regarding musical history and it's players.In this documentary about Chuck's life, we are gifted with an extraordinary soundtrack, fantastic concert footage, a moving love story, and a look into Leavell's life as a highly decorated environmental activist so dedicated to combating climate change that he stays busy typing even on International plane flights on his way to play gigs with The Stones. Chuck who runs an award winning tree farm in Georgia with his wife Rose Lane, is a leading voice in the area of sustainable foresty. He really loves his controlled forest burns.If you want to learn about trees and get to know more about Chuck Leavell, a brilliant, accomplished musician who radiates goodness, check out this film. It left me feeling uplifted.",False

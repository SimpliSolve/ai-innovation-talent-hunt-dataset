1,10,What an Inspiring story!,ky-75363,n/a,16/08/2025,"At Sundance 2024 , I watched ""Igualada."" This film centers on a Colombian black single mother who becomes the vice president, sharing powerful stories of resilience against government treatment of her village. This story is incredibly inspiring, and what stood out was its accessibility. Unlike other lengthy, artsy documentaries, it was easy to follow and exceptionally well-made.Over 15 years, they captured her journey, chronicling events that unfolded in her life. A particularly impactful moment was when a feminist questioned Francia about her stance on feminism. Her clear and thoughtful response personally earned my respect. Francia emerged as a woman who wouldn't let external influences manipulate her.It's remarkable that, without big financial backing, she gained widespread support, attracting numerous young volunteers. Her journey to becoming the Vice President of Colombia symbolizes women's power and the essence of free speech.I highly recommend it.",False
2,5,Interesting but underwhelming,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched this at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.""Igualada"" is one of those documentaries that has some really interesting subjects and ideas explored but unfortunately, isn't as powerful as it hoped for. The main subject Francia MÃ¡rquez is an interesting person as there are a lot of interesting stories and discussions from her that are insightful and the approaches on the political system of Colombia is interesting.There are some good archive footage usage, discussions made from peers, and some good visual presentations. But for a 78 minute runtime, the documentary feels too formulaic and uninteresting because the direction and approach to the subject felt underutilized and not as impactful as it hoped for.The filmmaker does have something to say but it feels as if the topics were a little unfocused and at times, unsure what it wants to say. Overall, good subject but feels lacking.",False

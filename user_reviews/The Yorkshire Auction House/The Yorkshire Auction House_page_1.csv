1,7,It's got potential,susansundaisy,n/a,15/08/2025,"I like it but it's like it's going to need some work. Showing the empty rooms and watching the guests cry isn't really very fun to watch. If they don't get some higher priced items, and I don't mean $1m items, but better than old sofa and magazines, it won:t be entertaining. The real downside is that if they aren't careful, it could be very depressing to watch widows get Â£1000 for everything they own.",False
2,8,Likeable,terrymsweeney,n/a,15/08/2025,"Likable characters and show some empathy for the people they are helping clear stuff out, for whatever reason, could make more of the peripheral characters but overall a good antiques entertainment program. And nice to see stuff selling for real.",False
3,8,Salvage Hunters meets Bangers N Cash,chrischapman-47545,n/a,15/08/2025,"Another variation on the antiques/collectables genre as we look at the work of a Yorkshire auction centre handling anything from a house clearance upwards. Not as pretentious as the management in Salvage Hunters but possibly not quite as warm and naturally funny as its Yorkshire car auction sister Bangers N Cash. However, in all fairness at the time of this review it is early days and the programme makers have had to cope with Covid - hopefully we will see more of the personalities of the staff and regular customers as the series progresses.Some of the conversations seem a bit staged and I don't see why they need to show us tracking shots of what rooms look like once they are emptied. The range/distances covered are quite surprising. Angus is a genuine warm person who knows his antiques, etc.Overall it is a promising concept done sympathetically and not underestimating the intellect and knowledge of the audience. Perhaps they could emulate Bangers N Cash in showing more about the successful bidders and where the items sold end up and also what happens to items that prove unsaleable.",False

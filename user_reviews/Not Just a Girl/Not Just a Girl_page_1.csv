1,7,"A concise walk through Shania Twain's professional career, with some bits that didn't belong",siderite,n/a,16/08/2025,"All I knew of Shania Twain was that when I was a hormonal teen she looked amazing and she teased me with that You Don't Impress Me Much song. I liked her songs, but I would never have considered myself a fan. This documentary starts from her humble beginnings, goes through her explosive years, approaches the great trauma that she experienced immediately after and comes out at the same time as a compilation album from 2022 containing a new track as well.Is she making a comeback? I don't know. It certainly feels too late, but then again, you never know.This was a very informative film, although not one that made me feel closer to the person. It was heartbreaking to hear about how Lyme disease derailed her entire life, but after watching the documentary I don't feel I understand Shania more, only that I know a lot more about her. Other than that, it was a good documentary.I hated the talking heads who were trying to slap their political agenda on Twain's career, even after she herself said she only wanted to express her personality, not enter in some political piss contest. Personally I admire her steadfastness and I do feel like she is a decent human being. She was a true feminist before it was fashionable, and did it leading by example, not by pushing talking points in unrelated conversations. Unfortunately, that's exactly how those few minutes of slap-on social agenda bits feel, completely out of place and annoying as hell.Bottom line: ignore the talking heads and focus on the story and you will get to admire Shania Twain more.",False
2,6,A well-made and enjoyable music doc,Sir_AmirSyarif,n/a,16/08/2025,"Joss Crowley's 'Shania Twain: Not Just a Girl' is a well-made and enjoyable music documentary that digs into the career of one of country music's towering figures. The film doesn't provide any new information for those already familiar with Twain's life and work, though some of the interviewees are insightful.",False
3,7,Pleasant,Kingslaay,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shania Twain's story in her own words was nice to see. We saw her humble beginnings, courage and resilience. I grew up listening to her wonderful music. It was catchy, melodious and sung beautifully. She truly is a music icon. I learnt some new things about the music icon and some of the struggles she overcame. She hasn't lost her simple and down to earth nature despite her enormous success. I was unaware she had Lyme disease which affected her unique voice and had such an impact on her life. It took courage for her to make a comeback with the help of her friends. She seems like a wonderful person and it was pleasant watching her tell her own story.",False
4,n/a,SHANIA!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Well, well worth watching, Shania is awesome! It is a great review of each album with insight on how it was created. Personal history of her life and how she made it. She is SO strong and an inspiration to all artists. ""You're Still the One""!!!",False
5,7,Not bad,brett-76260,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not a bad show don't get me wrong.. but it's basically the exact same format as countless other biographies. Just insert shania and boom, you have a documentary. It's basically behind the music type format.",False
6,10,FANTASTIC,wwydwt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Not all documentaries manage to convey a story with both compassion and excitement. I'm a fan of Shania yet I managed to learn so much along the way about her struggle, her passion, her commitment and drive to succeed. I was a fan of her music before but now I am a fan of the artist, the woman. Excellent watch.",False
7,10,Well Done!,kidsheartsflyfree,n/a,16/08/2025,"I enjoy watching documentaries but lately they have been portly written, they skip around time frames and they are way to slow moving to keep my interest. It's like they are just trying to fill up air space from the start to the finish. BUT not this one! This one was well done from the start to the finish! I learned a lot of things about Shania that I didn't know. She seems very down to earth and like someone you want to get to know better. Shania could've taken this opportunity to publicly speak ill of her ex and her ex BFF, but in true Shania form, she handled it with class. She's a fighter and an inspiration.",False
8,9,Of course not: she feels like a woman!,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended and I am almost surprised the documentary didn't go with the song title. But the documentary is not focused on that one song (also she has quite a few hits under her belt). It is about her upbringing and how she evolved in the music industry. What her parents meant to her and how she broke through - what was expected of her mixed with where she saw herself.It had been quite a while since I had her on my radar, but her influence on music is not to be disputed! And the documentary is clearly showing it. Now give me a Sheryl Crowe documentary too! She deserves one too for sure. Female music power ftw! Of course she gets compliments and nods from other celebrities and musicians ... a quite short documentary but one very well researched.",False
9,5,Strictly by the numbers bio-documentary,paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"As ""Shania Twain: Not Just a Girl"" (2022 release; 88 min) opens, various talking heads are heaping praise on Twain. ""She was a trailblazer across musical styles"", comments one (correctly). We then go back in time to ""Timmins, Ontario"" where Shania grew up and at a young age (just 8) started performing in bars... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this bio-documentary is directed by Joss Crowley, who has done a number of other music documentaries (involving Elvis Costello, Hall & Oates, and others). Here he looks back at the amazing rise of Shania Twain, who out of nowhere (and after a failed 1993 debut album) then released 3 albums in a row that each went diamond (more than 10 million copies sold): The Woman In Me (1995), Come On Over (1997) and Up! (2002), and then pretty much disappeared into thin air for the next decade plus. This documentary is completely straight forward and strictly by the numbers. Twain's musical and personal partnership with Mutt Lange, coincidentally or not starting with The Woman In Me, is of course mentioned but otherwise not reviewed in depth or otherwise questioned (Lange was 17 years her senior). Also not clear is why exactly Twain decided to move to Nashville in the early 90s. Bottom line: this bio-documentary is entirely free from any controversy, and as it happens also (or perhaps more accurately, hence) lacks much new insight as to the phenom that Shania Twain was. I saw Twain in concert just once, when she came to Cincinnati on her Up! Tour in 2004. The arena was sold out, and she put on a thoroughly professional ""well oiled machine"" performance.""Shania Twain: Not Just A Girl"" recently premiered on Netflix, and I just watched it the other night. If you are a fan of Shania Twain, be it a die-hard or, like me, just a casual fan, I'd readily suggest you check out this documentary, albeit with expectations in check, and draw your own conclusion.",False
10,9,Pretty good watch,severe_lady,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really liked this documentary. I am not a huge fan of Shania, I like most of her music and having time to kill I decided to give it a go. After watching Not Just A Girl, I have a lot more respect for her given all that life has thrown her way and how she managed to overcome it. You go Shania!!!",False
11,10,Let's Go Girls,babsdunne-33410,n/a,16/08/2025,"Let's Go Girls - 3 words that will forever be related to Shania Twain in the best possible way. A working class fighter with a hunger to be what she always knew she'd be, a fantastic documentary circling around her genre wrecking ability, top notch ðŸ‘Œ",False
12,10,SO GOOD!,sofiavarona,n/a,16/08/2025,Wasn't a massive Shania Twain fan before to be honest but this movie made me really see her in a totally new light. I confess I am now a converted fan! She's amazing!! Definitely worth a watch.,False
13,n/a,loved it,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"First of all you have to like Shania Twain's music to really appreciate this documentary. If you don't like her and her music, this is definitely not something you want to watch. She is one of country's most talented songwriters, performers, producers and singers. She dominated the country charts in the 1990's. This movie was very well put together. A fan of Shania? Watch this movie.",False
14,4,Nothing new a pointless documentary,jakethesnake-42007,n/a,16/08/2025,Documentary either come out later in someone's career that expose secretes or have interesting stories or they come out and show the singer doing a tour and this is neither. There was nothing new to the documentary and it's quit boring and pointless.,False
15,n/a,Thoroughly enjoyable,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not a die hard fan but have enjoyed her music from time to time. She seems so cool and down to earth and, wow, what an amazing journey she's had, incredible, much respect to her.I really enjoyed it from start to finish as she really has had an amazing career and it was quite fun taking a glimpse into that.",False
16,10,Man....what a woman!,estelle58,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI kept seeing this come up in my NF suggestions. I thought, she had some cool songs, nature gave her a beautiful face, and that was about it, so I just kept skipping the documentary.Then, last night I was looking for something to catch my eye, (between my son and I, we have 7 streaming services) but nothing was appealing to me, even with all of the choices available. When this came up again, I decided, why not.Well, let me tell you, this gal is an amazing example of human endurance and explosive ambition. Her story could surely inspire many a young girl to say
""yes I can"".Forced to start performing at a very young age, then suffering a catastrophic tragedy that looked to put her music career on hold, actually led to an open door that covered her financial needs and kept her career on the upward trend, that she was bound for. I believe it was in the stars for her.I am really glad I watched this. Highly recommended.",True
17,5,Eve Barlow is in the video,valcurd,n/a,16/08/2025,"Once I saw Eve Barlow was in the video I stopped watching it. After review of the cast, it was also noted that Eve Barlow was not listed, she should be removed.",False

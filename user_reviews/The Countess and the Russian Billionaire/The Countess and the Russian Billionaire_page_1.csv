1,7,Russian politics,robsonmccabe,n/a,16/08/2025,"And how these politics made several Russian men, usually pals of Putin, billionaires. I found the story of this relationship and their unbelievable wealth both fascinating and sickening. The countess has a bit of grit about her which makes this documentary different from poor little rich girl stuff.",False
2,3,Poor little rich girl,ndeshi1110,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerBasically a story about a posh spoilt girl who didn't get what she wanted and now cries because she's lost his billions. Boo hoo.,True
3,3,MISSION IMPOSSIBLE,philip-00197,n/a,16/08/2025,"A, relatively common, point of a documentary is to present ""new and revealing facts"". Not doing any of the footwork and relying on the assumption that; presenting two extraordinarily biased viewpoints will somehow cancel out each other with a documentary as an end result... doesn't work. The end result more resembles a docu-soap than anything definable as a documentary.An other hallmark of a good documentary is when it manages, with facts, to sway the opinion of the viewer. The Countess and the Russian Billionaire conducts virtually no background checks or fact finding mission. The outcome is likely to do little more than confirm what ever opinion the viewer had in the onset.The only information provided is a, very marginal, fly on the wall glimpse into a, rather unusual, lifestyle.It is verging Impossible to feel any empathy for the protagonist - which is probably the only effect sought by the director. A biased documentary that doesn't even manage to, remotely, generate bias - is close to as bad as it gets within the documentary genre.A few stars for, probably, not spreading disinformation - or at least attempting to balance out contradicting misinformation.",False
4,1,Money doesn't smell,renatastevens,n/a,16/08/2025,"How much it was paid to the countess for this program. It's a joke! Shame on all of you!Wasted hour of my live, watching these lies about rich russkies.",False

1,9,Solid telling of the last hour of Flight 93,On_The_Mark,n/a,16/08/2025,"They did a great job. Just enough of the relatives of the heroes of this flight telling their end. The forensic studies of what happened on the flight revealed are great.We all know about the flight but we get a good detail of happened with this documentary. No fluff or bad recreations. People involved tell their roles and what happened.Very sad, but well done documentary.",False
2,2,Detailed story brought down by heavy handed production,cbradley4-83-743411,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary did itself a massive disservice by layering in lots of intense music, and a slow ominous voice. They heavy handed approach made it feel as though they were trying to make the story intense - as if it isn't intense enough on its own. This made an informative documentary feel like a fake-y docu-series. It was an incredibly baffling decision that left me distracted much of the time.The documentary does have a lot of details and interviews with many people who were related to the flight in one way or another, which was a redeeming quality. I appreciated the explanation on some of the forensic work, and there was some great (awful) footage of 9/11 weaved throughout.",False

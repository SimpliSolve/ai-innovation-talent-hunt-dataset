1,7,Solid documentary topic but ambivalent about over the top dramatic conventions,anderharp,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerStill considering this film at the T/F world premiere. Very solid , it pulls the viewer in with both topic and empathy toward the three storylines. As the topic builds, prevalence of this underworld economy/ network is quickly apparent but when does it become too much ? Very surprising FX/Disney taking on this topic but congratulations to them as well as the writers/directors. As I've been exposed used these decades to the many conventions used in the non-fiction film genre, the iaddition of a storyline to a non-fiction film can be compelling. However when the viewer can spot inconsistencies in the film, what is a True topic with real world implications quickly become a false narrative not of the characters but of the production team. 7 for production but lacks credibility for social impact. In the spirit of T/F = false My recommendation to view this film.",True

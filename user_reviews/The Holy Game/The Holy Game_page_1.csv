1,4,Nothing Really Here,johnproton,n/a,16/08/2025,The film feels really hollow. It felt like the duo directors were trying to find a story where there wasn't a story. The cinematography made the doc feel slow but you can tell there's some talent behind the lens. There just isn't an interesting story here.,False
2,1,An incomplete documentary with very little to say,cummgroyper,n/a,16/08/2025,"I don't understand why this needed to be made. It's about an hour long, so not even really a feature-length film. I didn't really like it at all. Strike two for Hodgee Films, because Pharma Bro was bad too.",False

1,7,Painful,paul2001sw-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shane MaGowan infused Irish folk music with a punk attitude and took it into the charts. But 'Crock of Gold', a look into his life, is hard viewing at times. It's imaginitively made, and there's interest in the story, but it's basically reverential tone (epitomised by the appearances of Johhny Depp, who produced the film, and an obsequious Gerry Adams) can't hide the fact that this is the story of an intelligent man who has spent his life drinking himself towards death. His own story of his primitive background is hard to sqaure with the normal appearances of his parents and his sister. Something clearly happened to screw him up; and it's hard to celebrate the result. Some artists truly live their music; but if your music is the story of drunkards and losers, that's not a happy form of authenticity. I wish Shane well, but at heart this is a grim tale",False
2,7,"Bad editing, but good everything else",Jeremy_Urquhart,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerAt times it almost felt like the editor was going out of their way to tank the movie, because some of the choices were too much, and the jarring cuts between styles and animation and music tracks that would only play for a short while and at inconsistent volumes got exhausting.BUT: Shane McGowan is so interesting a subject - and the music of The Pogues so damn good - that this remains an engaging and sometimes emotional watch despite sometimes not great editing.
Mild spoilers, but the ending scenes were particularly effective.I loved the brutal, sad honesty of the idea that MacGowan isn't going to give up his heavy drinking, as so many documentaries about addiction end with fake optimism about going clean and getting one's life back on track after the credits start rolling. I don't like it in the sense that it means his health could deteriorate further, but I do appreciate how honest and sad it was, when so many similar documentaries would try to force some hope into the ending.Also heartbreaking yet beautiful was footage of MacGowan singing with Nick Cave on stage, another legendary musician with a troubled past filled with tragedy and drug addiction who seems to have gotten his life back on track. Cave seems to have kicked his vices, is still recording some of his best music ever (Ghosteen is very good, Skeleton Tree is phenomenal), and to boot, looks about 15-20 years younger than MacGowan despite also being born in 1957.It's a sad way to end a 2-hour movie, but dammit if it isn't powerful.",True
3,7,Pogo Forever,Manhattandatingproject,n/a,16/08/2025,"""Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan"" came on suddenly on ARTE after Shane MacGowan's passing.Reading the name Julien Temple made the reviewer very happy, since we are a big fan of his work. The film features some of the Pogues & Shane's timeless extraordinary music. But the artist himself says a couple of times that he might not agree to all the footage and at times even wonders, if the cameras were rolling. Having had the honor of hanging out with Shane in the early days I feel bad for him about the editing of the film. Some shots seem too long and some footage I rather would have not seen, since it seems very intimate. Also not a great fan of some of the cartoons. Shane's music and the Pogues & Popes make up for it, so turn it way up and maybe just take a listen to the lovely tunes. I very much do like the archival footage & background info. Well done!",False

6,n/a,Temple's talent shines through,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerMacGowan's talents as writer are clear; but those same talents did not extend into his understanding of modern Irish history - which is, at best, fantastical.And seeing Gerry Adams' interview with MacGowan - which is threaded throughout the documentary - reinforces this sense of fabulism.At one point, Adams asks MacGowan about 'The Dunes', a song about the burial of victims of the Irish famine, prompting stock footage of children playing on sand dunes.You can only hope Temple consciously created that chilling semiotic, otherwise we might relegate him to the same dunce filled history class as MacGowan.There is not one critical voice in this documentary offering an alternative view of Irish history or the impact of Republicanism on both countries.But perhaps where the documentary fails, it succeeds in exposing the intellectual motivation behind nationalism - a concept which first emerged in the late 19th century, 700 years after the Anglo-Norman's landed on Wexford's coast.Perversity.At one point Adams ventures that the word 'Punk' stems from an Irish word for 'a Yank'. Even MacGowan - a self proclaimed Republican - receives this assertion with a look of incredulity - or so you'd hope.Fact: 'Punke' is a word used by Shakespeare to refer to prostitutes. Shakespeare was born in the 16th century; America was founded in the 18th century.More painful still, is watching MacGowan's descent into a pale of drink and drugs. On the back of Fairytale of New York - a song which allegedly grosses .5 million per annum - The Pogues were treated to a gruelling touring schedule that Shane, according to his father, never came back from.Retaining a relationship with your brother or your son when they have become world famous must be complicated; add to that several ringed walls informed by alcohol and substance abuse and it surely becomes painful.Addiction - to give it a name - is complex. No doubt MacGowan had his own good reasons.But as much as it's important not to fall foul of a romantic version of Ireland, it's equally important not to romanticise MacGowan's life long dependencies on substance abuse.MacGowan's sister talks about a soul who is kind, thoughtful and intelligent - all great qualities entombed by a sarcophagus of indulgence, with no hope of excavation.All that said, Temple's talents as a director shine through. Had this film been given by any other director it would have been dull, lifeless and vapid.Let's hope MacGowan's songs live on, he's added so much more to the Irish song book. But let's also hope his version of Ireland stays buried, because we can't keep moving forward to the past; at some point, Ireland has to be allowed to change.",True
7,6,ITS CERTAINLY A CROCK OF SUMMAT,miceal-427-294269,n/a,16/08/2025,"Sanctimonious, ill informed,fantasist .Great songwriter ,but then,George Best was a great footballer",False
8,10,Perfect Documentary,m.dunne,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is one of the best documentaries about a musical artist that I have ever seen. An absolute must watch, regardless of whether you are a fan of Shane McGowan and The Pogues.",False
9,6,Phoned in from the hospital bed,conannz,n/a,16/08/2025,"Most of the movie is Shane talking to a few different people over a drink or two. He is definitely not well and it is like watching someone in hospital on their last days.I can understand Shane and his wife wanting to share a few more stories and it does seem like many of the songs and the whole updating of Irish folk that the Pogues were part of has been under rated. It was good to hear about that but It is hard to watch.Fairytale of New York is a great song but you know what I""ve never listened to the whole thing and never tried to decipher what it is about. It has always been just a few fragments of heartfelt emotion that seems to fit together well and it seems like commercially it did the trick for Shane and his band.I'n glad I have a bit more background but fear Shane is not long for this world.",False
10,10,Rattling Death Trains and an Angel at your Head,SFTeamNoir,n/a,16/08/2025,"A sublime and transcendent experience for fans missing the glorious Celtic romps of the Pogues in their prime. Director Temple wildly enhances the underwhelming interviews with a mostly ruined, but still fascinating, Shane MacGowan with psychedelic animation, heavenly black and white Irish pastoral scenes, and an engaging trove of archival footage that includes Shane dancing in the front row of a Sex Pistols' show. Gets to the very heart of Shane and connects all the essential dots ultimately revealing a brave and free spirit who was ripped away as a child into the devastating whirlwinds of his era yet managed somehow to ride them all out.",False
11,6,Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds with Shane MacGowan,jboothmillard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI heard about this biopic documentary film about a year after its release, I missed it a couple of times broadcast on television, but I couldn't ignore it when it was shown again the day that its subject sadly died at age 65, produced by Johnny Depp, directed by Julien Temple (Sade: ""Smooth Operator"", Earth Girls Are Easy, Bryan Adams: ""(Everything I Do) I Do It for You)"", S Club 7: ""Have You Ever""). Basically, it is about the life and career of Irish singer, songwriter and musician Shane MacGowan, lead singer of Celtic punk band The Pogues. MacGowan was born on 25 December, Christmas Day 1957 in Pembury, Kent, but raised in Tipperary, Ireland. It is shocking to find out he started drinking alcohol when he was five years old, smoking huge quantities of cigarettes and took excessive amounts of drugs by his late teens. This would explain the poor health of his teeth and it is remarkable that he lived for the length of time he did. MacGowan co-founded The Pogues in 1982, they were originally called Pogue Mahone, based on an Irish phrase that translates ""kiss my arse"". They fused punk influences with traditional Irish music. Early hits for the band, specifically in Ireland, included ""Dark Streets of London"", ""Boys from the County Hell"", ""A Pair of Brown Eyes"", ""Sally MacLennane"", and ""Dirty Old Town"". It was in 1987 that The Pogues had their biggest hit with the Christmas song ""Fairytale of New York, with MacGowan duetting with Kirsty MacColl; it was kept from the UK Christmas Number One by ""Always on My Mind"" by Pet Shop Boys. They also released the party song ""Fiesta"", and the political protest song ""Streets of Sorrow/Birmingham Six"". MacGowan performed endless shows across Ireland and the United Kingdom and he suffered a breakdown. He later returned to music and formed a new band, the Popes, and he made an appearance in the 1997 version of Lou Reed song ""Perfect Day"", hitting Number One and raising money for Children in Need. In the film, MacGowan talks about his experiences but comes across as a slightly aggressive and sometimes bewildered participant in his own story. The film also uses animation to depict his childhood and unseen events from the past. With contributions from Johnny Depp, Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie, former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, Siobhan MacGowan (Shane's sister), Maurice MacGowan (Shane's father), and Victoria Mary Clarke (Shane's wife). I will admit it is slightly uncomfortable and awkward viewing, MacGowan is a tragic figure you feel sorry for in some respects, but he is equally a legendary figure and, to be fair, it is an interesting biographical documentary. Good!",True

Really enjoyed it.",False
13,6,MacGowan at the top of his game!,tabitha-toledo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Predominantly compiled from (excellent) old footage that fans will be at least familiar with, there is plenty of eye & ear candy here nonetheless, and it's great to see Shane so sprightly - bouncing all over the place, quick-witted, & a testament to the fact that the doctors were wrong all along - drink and drugs being no more harmless than a bag of smarties.",False
14,2,They say you should never meet your heroes...,El-Kapitoshka,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm not so sure what they were going for here. The honestly is refreshing and you see what Shane is really like which is a bit of a bully. A sort of plastic republican IRA wannabe who was born in England whether he likes it or not. The only person who stood up to him was Gerry Adams who is likeable and comes over as wise.Depp was unbearable and it seemed like he was trying to put on an Irish accent.Even Brendan Behan softened up as he got older and proclaimed that:'The older I get, the more I see sense of my grandmother's statement: 'Do you know the difference between having an Irish Republic and being a section of the British Empire?''No,' says I, 'what is it?''You'll get an eviction order written in Irish with a harp, rather than one written in English with the lion and the unicorn.'Confessions of An Irish Rebel, p134 (1965)Overall a disappointing film with little to no mention of the Pogues (who were mostly - and thus probably inconveniently - English) who arguably helped solidify him as a legend in the first place.",False
15,10,"McGowan, Johnny Depp & Stephen Deuters. Absolutely brilliant",jlh-15688,n/a,16/08/2025,"Definitely the best music docu I've ever seen. Really thorough look into Shane's life from being a wee boy, God knows how he survived! I'll be honest & admit I'm not a huge fan of The Pogues music but found myself singing along and swaying on my chair, I just got lost in the magic of it all. This has got to win some sort of award. It's incredible! Well done to Shane, Victoria, Johnny, Stephen & Julien. 10 out of 10.",False

18,10,"This is really, really good",kpepper-96697,n/a,16/08/2025,Fascinating to learn about Shane's life and I loved it interweaving with Irish history and music history. Also the film is quite moving. A most interesting man and a truly excellent film.,False
19,10,Great doc worked for me.,maddox-richard,n/a,16/08/2025,"Some may not enjoy it but I love this doc because it faces all the sadness and challenges of Shane head on but ""prints the legend"" with a knowing wink.I reckon the film somehow achieves what few docs do : it catches his soul - even amid all the contradictions: He may be a 'self mythologising' non-Irish alcoholic and yet he's potentially as important a poet as Yeats.The title works on all these levels too.Many of my favourite artists are contradictory and unreliable biographers: Nina Simone, Sun Ra, Lee Perry, Scott Walker... and I've found acclaimed documentaries about them to be wanting. Whether by accident or design (some restrictive constraints undoubtedly forced by Shane) Julien Temple here achieves something quite rare, if not for all tastes.",False
20,1,Absolutely Abysmal!!,misshimimpossible,n/a,16/08/2025,"A excruciatingly depressing look at what happens when artistry competes with addiction. If Shane once was talented, it's difficult to even recognize the artist that once is said to have existed in this rotting shell of a man. As hard as I try to empathize with Shane, the concept seems to have been developed through a drug haze or drunken stupor. If Depp or MacGowan are any indication, it's clear that money and fame don't buy happiness or health.",False
21,10,Amazing,Jxsbee,n/a,16/08/2025,"I wasn't sure what to expect but it was incredible! So lovely to see natural footage of Shane with his friends and the clips of his birthday celebration had me welling up.

1,9,Golden era of Turkish theater,erhanipekciler,n/a,15/08/2025,"Very good documentary.. It was on my list since months and after 'caniko' finally I watched and I loved it. When I watch this documentary and when I see suberb names of Turkish theater, I felt so happy. Haldun Dormen is not my favorite actually because I always think he is not a good actor also I don't understand him because of his accent and also he speaks so fast but there is a truth like he is a visioner, talented producer and real gentleman. He made lots of things for Turkish theater and when you think best actors now, lots of them graduated from his school. God bless him and I wish long life. Highly recommended to watch and excellent documentary.",False
2,10,Theatre is his life!,meyzib,n/a,15/08/2025,"Haldun Dormen is undoubtedly one of the most important theatre directors in Turkey. An innovator, creator of musicals, actor, writer, teacher, and mentor to whom many Turkish actors owe him their fame and success.This documentary is his story and the story of his theatre, one of the first, if not the very first, private theatre company in Turkey.You will be mesmerized by Mr Dormen's energy, kindness, talent, passion and flair.At 90 plus Haldun Dormen is still the young man who has dedicated his life to the theatre, has seen success and failure and accepted it all with grace and honesty.Don't miss it as it will warm your heart, make you laugh, and discover a modern Turkey which is no longer here.",False

1,10,Nail in the coffin for cult shunning,scotthoman-21678,n/a,15/08/2025,"Witness Underground is powerful and inspiring!It captures the intensity of a big life transition that often follows religious deconstruction. What really blew me away was the completeness of their deconversions and the depth of their research. They are clearly intelligent, respectable, and value truth. They seem to have deprogrammed themselves, which is never really discussed as a path to free, independent thought.The way the film demonstrates shunning may be the final expos√© needed to put an end to this hateful practice, used widely within this high-control group. This film should be used as an educational tool for legal, political, and anthropological research on the B. I. T. E. model (Behavior control, Information control, Thought control, and Emotion control). It's all discussed and demonstrated with authenticity.I see so much of myself in this film. Watching it makes me feel pround of the people in the film but also proud of my own life choices. I've now watched Witness Underground more than any documentary in my life. With each watch, something new has impressed me and given me a new perspective on my own internal emotional landscape.It's journalistically fair towards all parties. The message is positive.The highlighted music they created is amazing! I have to get the soundtrack!",False
2,10,The JW Creators Conundrum,o-s-forever,n/a,15/08/2025,"Couldn't sleep last night so I got up and watched the doc. Great stuff. I related to a lot of it. The whole trying to make cool music, but the whole group is trying to be in ""The Truth"" was exactly my life experience. The whole ""creators have to create"" is a real thing I've felt for a long time. I also didn't know you could make tea in a French Press, I need to give that a try!The editing and captions were all well applied.Fantastic watch, I will shoot it over to the one person I still know.I have in my notes to do a song about creators that get lost in the organization that I will make one day sooner than later.",False
3,10,"A Moving Indictment of Brutal, Religious Malpractice",relevants,n/a,15/08/2025,"Entertaining, Heart-wrenching, Authentic and Well-Crafted!What is presented as an excuse by the allegedly ""Christian"" organization these unfortunate (too)-young folks joined as a Scripturally-authorized procedure to ""keep the congregation clean"", is actually something VERY different, altogether. Ironic that, while claiming Divine direction, WT creates a great crowd, a global contingent of ""skinned and thrown about"" victims, many of whom have, sadly, taken their own lives. Surely, Jesus' empathetic observation about those under the terroristic tyranny of the Pharisees is going largely ignored by this religious order, with often tragic results. The ""fruitage"", or consequences, have long been dramatically evident. Hopefully, the trend of governments like Norway moving to protect their citizens, will continue and brutal religions will fade into extinction.While Watchtower may boast of freeing people from the fear of Hellfire, they feel no compunction about going ""beyond what is written"", inflicting their own, real-life, HELL ON EARTH. So glad that Ryan, Eric, Cindy, Jim, Chad, ( Scott!), and thousands of others have endured and survived this systemic, ecclesiastical abuse.Much love & respect!",False

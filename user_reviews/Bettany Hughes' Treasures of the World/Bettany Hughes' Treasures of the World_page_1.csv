1,7,"Informative, with great cinematography",bbewnylorac,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary series is very under-rated, taking us to some out-of the way places in countries like Georgia, Bulgaria and Greece. Often we see breathtaking ruins and priceless relics that tourists wouldn't have access to. The cinematography and direction is outstanding, with the use of drones and imaginative points of view. Bettany Hughes does love the spotlight, but she is refreshingly down to earth at the same time. She's good at explaining complex subjects and histories in an accessible way. I love it when she meets the locals. She is great with the people she meets and curious about them. But her other strength is her enthusiasm. She doesn't fake her sense of wonder. She is genuinely in love with history and culture and you feel like she is seeing these sights for the first time, along with viewers.",False

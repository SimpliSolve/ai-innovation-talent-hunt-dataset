1,3,incoherent,imdbfan-8259709329,n/a,16/08/2025,"At one point Pat Metheney says there should be less talk about Milton and more listening. Advice the filmmaker should have heeded. Basically the film is snippets of music interrupted constantly by talking heads, all saying the same thing. Like, Milton is unique, one of a kind, etc. And his music is profound, complex, while being simple, etc. Lots of footage of traveling to concerts with touristic shots of European cities. Lots of shots of musicians setting up for stage shows. Very little footage of the concerts themselves however. I don't think a single song played through completely. I'm not sure because I left twenty minutes early, with very little advancement of my knowledge of his music. Other than that it is deep and complex while being simple of course. A very disorganized documentary that sadly fails its subject.",False

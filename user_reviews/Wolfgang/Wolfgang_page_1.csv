1,10,How Delightful to Learn about Wolfgang Puck's Journey to Becoming the Master Chef He is Today,rannynm,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary Wolfgang talks about how that food is family and food is love. This film depicts the culinary development of Chef Wolfgang Puck and I was delighted to learn more about his upbringing and journey to become the chef and businessman that he is. Wolfgang is celebrated in my home every day as I use his cookware and my family incorporates cooking tips that my mom learned from watching him on various television shows. He made her feel more comfortable in the kitchen and in trying new concepts with his easy style and engaging personality, which have also influenced my love of cooking.The film starts showing Wolfgang's early family life and the reasons behind his joy in the kitchen and love of cooking. We follow Wolfgang's culinary training until he becomes the first ""celebrity chef"" and really defines ""California Cuisine,"" putting the gardens of California on a plate. After all, as Wolfgang says, ""The right ingredients make all the difference."" His incredible work ethic had leads to great monetary rewards, but at the expense of disrupting his family life. At the end of the documentary, as he looks back on his life, it seems that he has now found the right balance in his personal life as well as in the kitchen.The documentary is an emotional journey guided by Director David Gelb. I love the beautiful cinematography and the use of archival footage. Brian McGinn's script makes you really feel that the movie is in Wolfgang's voice as he discovers that his purpose in life has been to make people happy through food as a conduit to love. The interviews throughout the film are meaningful and highlight the importance that Wolfgang Puck has made on the food industry.There are so many important messages in this film such as following Wolfgang's work ethic and how it's important to believe in yourself and not be afraid to take chances. Giving up is not an option if you want to pursue your dreams, as nothing comes easy. Wolfgang says a lot of inspiring things in this film; his sentiment I love most is that ""the grass is greener where it's watered the most."" Where to put in the effort applies to life as well as to your garden.I give Wolfgang 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. The documentary will be available on Disney+ June 25, 2021 so don't miss this inspiring story. Reviewed by Selene W., KIDS FIRST!",False
2,4,"Hagiography, not documentary.",FreddyShoop,n/a,16/08/2025,"This type of storytelling is best for a mediocre TV show, and doesn't work as a documentary. For true documentary, you need to see more reality and less polished views. It needed more grit. I mean, no mention of the first wife?! No mention of financing?",False

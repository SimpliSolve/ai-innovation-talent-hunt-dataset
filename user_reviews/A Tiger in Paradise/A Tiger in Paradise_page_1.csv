1,3,Lacks heart and soul,biazita-64039,n/a,16/08/2025,"Boring, pretentious without any depth. I love José's music and this was a full disappointment.If you are thinking of joining one of the viewing events, it is not worth it.A film that doesn't say anything with a bunch of disconnected inner jokes between the director and José. Mikel (the director) is better off making music videos and staying away from opening his mouth on the viewing, while José can stick with playing his beautiful music.During the viewing the director makes all these shallow references to other cultures and religions without any self critic of his own home country. A lot of white privilege hidden behind a shallow narrative around rationality and science.",False
2,9,Unique and beautiful,brunogork,n/a,16/08/2025,"I saw this film at the premiere at Cphdox in Copenhagen, and like most of us in the room that night, I found both the film and the talk around it with José and the director absolutely fascinating.The film's philosophical undertones were thought-provoking, challenging you to contemplate deeper questions about life, existence, and the nature of reality itself. It was also really playful, and skillfully blended humor and intellect.The cinematography was also stunning, with each frame carefully composed, drawing you into a world that felt both familiar and yet subtly surreal. A feeling also enhanced by the music of José!As the film progressed, it delved into topics that I think some people might find a bit provocative, depending on who you are, and your view of the world. However, it did so in a way that was really respectful, encouraging viewers to reflect on their own beliefs and perceptions.The post-screening discussion with José and the director provided great insights into the film's creation and the underlying concepts it explored and I think it gave me an even deeper appreciation for the film and its intentions.I highly recommend this film to anyone seeking an intellectually stimulating and visually captivating experience. It is a rare gem!",False
3,3,Another self-centred artist with no authentic message,meyerseb,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just returned from the world premiere of the movie at CPH:DOX.Was excited about it as I both like the production team behind this documentary as well as Jose's music.So why 3/10?-there are a bunch of great questions raised by Jose in the beginning of the movie. But the movie doesn't really answer any of them.-yes, it's admirable to open up about mental health, but it ends up being a journey of artistic self-adulation. And someone thought it would be interesting enough to make movie out of it.-it feels like a movie about the making of an album that has the purpose of promoting it, it's difficult to spot other reasons for it to exist.-second part of the movie feels very stretched, considering the length of the film, it feels someone just filled with content that has no apparent purpose.I listened to a lot of Jose's music in my life and it feels like he essentially lacks a creative concept to bring forward as an artist. Even in the movie he reminiscences about becoming a scientist instant. So what does Jose do with his artistic reach? Another artist gone ""save the world"", ""be more human"", ""believe in facts""...That's all he came up with. Very creative.80 minutes of people's attention wasted by looking at the ""difficult"" life of Joss. If you want to make the world a better place, focus on the problems of the life's of other non privileged people, instead of pitying yourself. Even Jose's wife seems to be annoyed. Don't annoy yourself and avoid this movie.Even this review is already too much attention for an artist whose message remains as insignificant as the UNICEF branded football teams he despises so vocally.",False

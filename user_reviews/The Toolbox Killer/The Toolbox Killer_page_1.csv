1,7,Good Documentary,Astaroth22,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst and foremost, Bittaker was an animal and if anyone should have gotten the death penalty it was him. Next, we will probably never truly know what motivated Brand to contact that maniac. Of course we get the superficial reason but actually going through with it and investing so much time goes WAY beyond that. Some may call her brave while others might call her stupid. Either way, the end result was that it worked. It's undeniable. Bittaker obviously accepted his fate to live out the rest of his days in prison. And yet, his need to feed his sick starvation for attention from a pretty girl necessitated he provide Brand information that everyone always wanted - but could never get. However, developing a friendly relationship with him was literally making a deal with the Devil. And yes, Bittacker was manipulating her because he didn't possess the ability to think or feel like a normal person.The biggest question I had once it ended: Was it really worth it?",True
2,6,Hanger Killer Would be Better,jeroduptown,n/a,16/08/2025,"The story of the toolbox killer(s) is sick --- the retelling of it in this documentary...is not. Gruesome and confident, the toolbox killers terrorized the Redondo beach area in the late 70s.",False
3,7,What a Creep - I mean the Student Profiler!,Mehki_Girl,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis was really hard to get through as much as because of the crimes that were committed by Bittaker and Norris, but also because we had to listen to the naivete of the FBI investigator or whatever she was.If it wasn't for the no nonsense retired FBI agent who worked in the behavioral unit, I don't think I could have stomached her.She really believes that this POS ended up feeling feelings and she wasn't being manipulated - of course he manipulated her!She actually looks very much like the victims that he preferred. If you look into his sick mind and read between the lines, in which, admittedly, one of the truest things he said - if he had, had better parents, he might have been a better person and that he wanted pictures, so it would look like the girls actually wanted to be with him.One of the reasons for recording these girls, besides for his sadistic urges, was to pretend that he actually had a girlfriend - but he's such a sick f*, I genuinely believe that he believed taking pictures of girls being tortured would somehow translate into them being interested in and wanting him.I tried to look past that FBI person, but when she sent a picture of her innocent son to Batteker in prison, I was done with her. And her trying to justify her friendship with him at the end. Disgusting.I would have been able to handle the ""relationship"" she claimed to have had, which I would have never used that word in relation to him and myself, if she said she was detached from all of this and was focused on her mission.I actually have a cousin who had gone to jail several times mostly for drug-related abuses. He told me one time that if we knew what those creeps say when a kid comes across the screen in a tv room - it would make a goat vomit. I didn't ask him for a specifics because I really don't need to know. And she sent that email things a picture of her little boy.And boy oh boy what were her psychological issues what was she doing pregnant and homeless - does she identify with the victims in that way?Frankly, I would have loved to have heard from the retired profiler to give us a profile on that chick.I'm so glad that they had the contrast of the retired FBI agent on there to cut through the BS because there might have been a few people who would have actually believed that somehow he had become a different person.As a lot of sadistic creeps like himself, the only empathy he ever had was for himself; and just like he demanded a fake relationship from those poor girls, he was manipulating her into a fake ""relationship"" with him and she stupidly fell for it. You could be an empathetic person, but don't let your brains fall out of your head.Lastly, I'm glad that the doc had the decency to not put the tape of those girls' dying out on the air.None of us have a right to know.",True
4,8,"Put together very well, but very hard to watch.",alexandertom-86032,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's been a long time since one of these ""true crime docs"" really got under my skin. This one did definitely not for the faint of heart. Just felt really sad for the family and friends who were affected by this evil. I did think the Psychology student was playing with fire.",False
5,1,It's not about them,ingamazonaite,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is not about killers, its more about woman, who decided befriend laurence bitteker. I don't think this story worth watching, because why would I want to know about someone ( nobody),who made friends with sadist, who enjoyed raping and torturing young girls. What they did to Lynette hounts me and I can't imagine suffering and fear, agony,pain and loneliness she felt in that van in last hours of her life. She was 17 only. She was a good girl, who worked late and simple accepted ride home from handsome man.And here we see a wannabe ( who has a cheek compare herself to Claire from silence of the lams). I don't feel, she showed any kind of sympathy for victims. She did not confronted him. He didn't say nothing new.I really think death row in california should be functioning, because this vile individual did not deserved life. Electric chair would've been good.Now he died living comfortably in the cell and having this type of wannabe visitors.Disgusting.",True
6,8,Disturbing,josephloveys,n/a,16/08/2025,The crimes of Bittaker and Norris were brutal and there are plenty of details and images in this doc that will be upsetting for some viewers. It's a well-made doc and certainly shows compassion for the victims and family/friends of victims too. One interesting aspect is how the criminologist was able to get Bittaker to talk when he had refused to do that before. Her approach was successful.,False
7,2,You have got to be kidding me,mrocco-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a well done documentary. But I had difficulty getting through the murder details, so just skipped when the details got to graphic. The main interviewer, Laura, was psycho herself. All her giggling on the phone made me physically sick. You can say this was for some greater good but I call BS. Her 'connection' to this sick sadistic killer and visiting him while pregnant? Then talking to him while in labor, sending pictures of her SON and asking him to be an honorary uncle? OMG this woman should be ASHAMED of herself, but instead she is proud of putting her goals before her son. Look how empathetic and non-judgemental I am!!!! Can you imagine sending your kid's picture to a serial killer and ask him to be his her uncle? She never once condemns a man who tortured young girls with items from a tool box in the worst way imaginable, let that sink in. His murders were so horrific the investigator killed himself over it. She actually buys into his remorse when he's dying as something other than self-pity and manipulation. And she states she was sad when he died because he was an authentic friend? God I hope no one in law enforcement employs this woman. Thank God for the voice of the FBI profiler (who is a bad-a** lady) and the prosecutor, or I wouldn't have been able to get through this tripe. One star for each of them.",False
8,8,Hard watch,GoldenGooner04,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI can understand people being angry with Laura, how she become his friend and called him ""Uncle Larry"" But I suppose, to get the info she had to show him friendship and a bit of love, to take his guard down. And she did find out stuff, which he told no one else. The worst bit for me was ""when he cried"" He knew he was going to die and suddenly wanted pity and people to feel sorry for him.I admire what Laura done, but do find it a bit bizarre that she actually in her mind become his friend. Surely once she got the info, the @@@@ should have been hanged.",True
9,2,don't waste your time,bluejacquet,n/a,16/08/2025,There really isn't anything unique about this story. Same as all other serial killer movies. Simply put this is just trite. Sadistic men innocent women.,False
10,10,A must watch,clynn-95755,n/a,16/08/2025,"In order to understand the mind of anyone, one must cultivate a relationship in order to step into their mind. In this particular case, it wasn't the most popular or well liked person on the block. However, this kind of psychology and work is necessary and critical. To physically step into the cell of death row at San Quentin and successfully cultivate a relationship with Bittaker and Norris along with stepping into their mind is exactly what Laura Brand did. She started building this relationship over the phone and even after being shunned at first, Laura simply wasn't going to take no for an answer. I give her ten stars for being able to get the location of the victims remains that even the FBI wasn't able to successfully do. This wasn't an easy task, but she did it and she did it well. I look forward to reading her book because the show barely touches the surface of all the work she's done on this case. The families of the victims are lucky she is giving them a voice, a voice these sadistic serial killers thought would be silenced until they met Laura Brand. Expect to see more of her amazing work in the future.",False
11,9,Great insight into the mind of a serial killer,iwhofan,n/a,16/08/2025,"They did an amazing job not only telling the story of Norris and Bittaker, but also the victims. Laura Brand did an amazing job interviewing Bittaker over several years. She was able to get information from him that police and investigators have tried for years to get. I only wish that they showed more of their relationship and what information he provided to help her find the missing girls. Laura is a true Jersey girl at heart and is fearless. She will bring the girls home!",False
12,10,Extremely well made,admesq,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was unsettling due to the subject matter but what made it so compelling was Laura Brand. This woman made one of the most sadistic serial killers of all time give all kinds of information uo for the first time, including the mapped locations of two victims never found. Laura Brand is that rare blend of intelligence, heart and humanity that compels even the most evil monsters to spill their guts. She is a revelation and I hope to see her do the same thing over and over until we can predict and stop these killing machines before they wreak havoc. This show is worth watching to see a fresh and effective approach to unraveling the sick minds of these evil doers. I am giving it 10 stars for this reason.",False
13,10,A New Approach,joda116,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brand used a different approach and although it is controversial, it did work! She got Bittaker to talk and he didn't talk to anyone.Victims of family members and interviews with those who knew them was crucial to this and I am glad they got to say their peace.",False
14,10,Very good documentary,cannelleintulsa,n/a,16/08/2025,I love crime documentaries and this one was outstanding. Laura Brand was able to get information that Bittaker refused to give to the authorities. She didn't try to rush him but built up trust and that made him willing to share information with her. Way to go.,False
15,10,Mind blowing.,skybabe75-837-153044,n/a,16/08/2025,Laura Brand was able to break through the mind of one of the most sadistic serial killers to date. Her ability to gain his trust blew my mind and it will blow yours.,False
16,10,The Bravery this women had!,abrewer-43824,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had watched documentaries about the Tool Box killer before, but the the way this woman really got to know this killer on such a human level is crazy to me. Her bravery and balls of still is admirable.",False
17,10,Chilling and thoroughly informative,tristaw,n/a,16/08/2025,It is incredibly chilling and amazing. Laura doesn't stop to get the answers she is looking for. She takes extreme steps to get those answers. Bittaker and Norris were evil mean and this documentary was one of the best I have ever watched. Captivating and leaving you wanting more.,False
18,10,A side of true crime that has never been seen before!,msjones-16196,n/a,16/08/2025,A must see in my opinion. To do what Laura Brand did was near impossible and she showed us just how skilled she is with a mix of empathy! I would love to see a part 2 to The ToolBox Killer that goes more in depth with exactly how Laura accomplished breaking such a sadistic serial killer.,False
19,10,Emotional rollercoaster,kun-alexandra29,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary shocked me in multiple ways. First, it made my blood run cold, then I felt deeply emotional, then horrified again. At one point I was even crying.I have seen a lot of documentaries so far, and this is one of the best for sure.Laura did an amazing job and her story blew me away.A great piece of work!",False
20,10,Amazing Documentary,kimberlyeisenman,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is an absolutely amazing documentary. I love serial killer documentaries and this is one of the best! Laura put herself into the belly of thebeast to get to the heart of this story. Very in depth and let's you see into the mind of the killer. If you ever wondered why we look over our shoulders and watch our surroundings, this is why.. Definitely a thought provoker. Highly recommended.",False
21,10,Seriously worth watching! Unlike any documentary I've ever seen!,Qtchickita,n/a,16/08/2025,This was bone chilling! So fascinating to see the progression of the relationship that Ms. Brand cultivated in order to get information that likely would have gone to this mama death bed. Such a wild ride watching the up and downs and the closure that several of the victims families seem to have finally got to experience! Looking forward to the book!,False
22,10,Left us wanting more!,elleehmcee,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hear a book is in the works 🖤🥀
Laura Brand , talented, cunning , a sweet smile and dark humour so charming even a former FBI agent hadn't thought of approaching a case in this manner!Hearing Lawrence Bittaker retell his evil acts was chilling nonetheless and not for the faint of heart .Can't wait to hear more details !",False
23,10,Amazing show,surgecortez,n/a,16/08/2025,This show had me at the edge of my seat from beginning to end. Looking forward to more work and shows from the creator. It was both creepy and fascinating at the same time.,False
24,10,Scary! Must watch!,Emtchick,n/a,16/08/2025,Laura was so brave to get in contact with a serial killer! She got so much information from him! I had never heard of these guys before. This is such a crazy and scary show! It's a must watch!,False
25,10,Nest True Crime Documentary to date,rbwoodson,n/a,16/08/2025,"The Toolbox Killer documentary is by far the best True Crime Documentary I have ever seen. The story of the most sadistic serial killer in history is told in a way that makes you cringe, have chills, and weep for the victims and their families without showing too much gore where you wouldn't be able to watch. It is very well done.Laura Brand needs a movie written about herself on the level of Silance of the Lambs. She really reminds me of Clarice Starling. She is an extremely intelligent, sharp-minded and tenacious. Without her, we would never know the story of the most sadistic serial killer ever.This is a must watch true crime documentary. I can not wait for the book and I hope this is made into a theatrical release.",False

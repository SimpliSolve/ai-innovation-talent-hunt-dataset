1,5,Nothing new here...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I had the opportunity to watch the 2024 comedy special ""Jeff Dunham's Scrooged-Up Holiday Special"", and opted to do so, though I have to admit that I wasn't exactly harboring the biggest of expectations, since the few couple of shows have been running on routine for Jeff Dunham.""Jeff Dunham's Scrooged-Up Holiday Special"" is a rather formulaic show. Yeah, there isn't much renewal to the shows, so once you've seen one, you've essentially seen them all. And that is sort of growing stale already. But hey, the good news is that if you are a diehard fan of Jeff Dunham, then you will definitely enjoy this 2024 holiday special.There were a couple of funny moments here and there, but I wasn't really brought to much laughter throughout the course of the 59 minutes that the show ran for.As always, it is Peanut that steals the show, and guess what? Also what happened in this comedy special.Now that I've seen the show, I can tick it off of the watch-list, and I can honestly say that I am not returning to watch it a second time.My rating of ""Jeff Dunham's Scrooged-Up Holiday Special"" lands on a five out of ten stars.",False

1,1,"Not about ""chasing Ghislaine"" at all",nancyjohnson106,n/a,15/08/2025,"This show should be called ""Another Show about Jeffrey Epstein"". It has virtually nothing to do with Ghislaine and her sick complicity in helping him carry out his crimes against young girls. If anything, it tries to absolve her guilt due to her privileged upbringing and because she was lovesick. A total waste of time.",False
2,9,"Well done, the rich covering for the rich",nyobatusa,n/a,15/08/2025,"Great Docuseries. I wish there was more background info on Jeffrey E. As well as there was on Ghislaine. But it was not as much as expected. Father was a bully, poor Ghislaine narrative is not going to cut it during the trial, though, she will get the maximum sentence. Who else will be exposed is more important at this point. I am not too hopeful this case can bring any closure to the victims, nor I believe there will be any justice in the form of recycling of souls. However, it is a very educational to see how the rich entertain themselves and how the business is done. How weakness can be exploited. Hopefully pretty girls parents will be more aware now and protect their kids more.",False
3,3,"Literally all of this was already covered in ""Epstein's Shadow: Ghislaine Maxwell""",ricewithaspoon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Was this woman milking it or am I cranky & too intolerant today?I mean, wasn't literally all of this covered in ""Epstein's Shadow: Ghislaine Maxwell"" - minus the footage of her (Ward) with earplugs in front of the computer zooming?Why did she feel the need to do this? Because she knew her 'casually'?I wouldn't recommend this. To anyone in any situation.I could find more 'input' watching the worst Hallmark movie.",False
4,8,Shocking Story,amysreelreviews,n/a,15/08/2025,"In light of the guilty verdict of Ghislaine Maxwell, watching this three part episodes gave a insight to Maxwell's life, and maybe how she ended up being Epstein's accomplice. Journalist Vicky Ward shows the story of Maxell's past, and how she would do anything, absolutely anything to please the powerful men in her life, including her father, and Jeffery Epstein. She was his child gatherer, to suit all of his deviant and perverted (and yes, pedophilia needs). 5 Reels definitely from Amy's Reel Reviews.#AmysRR.",False
5,3,Could have been good,mls4182,n/a,15/08/2025,These low cost programs are always so long and drawn out when an hour would be fine. I suggest skipping the first episode. This is why the Discovry app is only $5 a month.,False
6,1,This is more about Epstein than chasing Ghislaine,maryrussell-67455,n/a,15/08/2025,"This would have been a great story BEFORE Epstein was jailed since this journalist knew for years but didn't say anything. It's really now just some lady cashing in and not wanting her ""friend"" Ghislaine to be held responsible.Don't waste your precious time watching this, it's clips of everything you seen before and this woman admitted knowing he was abusing girls from 2002 but done nothing, now she wants to cash in though, it's really just trash!",False
7,1,HUGE LEAPS OF BIAS & HEARSAY,ebqrkhf,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wow, i FOUGHT through the 3 episodes and just couldn't believe the way they shaped this narrative. I don't want to 'spoil' anything, but wow, this is an example of the death of authentic, unbiased journalism, plus some of the people have passed, (RIP) so they can't even defend themselves.",False
8,3,DonÂ´t watch this misleading documentary!,carro-20412,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary is not about Ghislaine, it's about her father and about Epstein. It should be just an hour long, the other two hours are just fluff and repeating stuff. It doesn't explain much, it says things and doesn't explain them further or explain why they were said. The reporter is dodgy and it's unclear why she's doing this documentary. So, the title is wrong and untruthful and the content is not worth watcching.",False
9,4,Quite a letdown,pommy1,n/a,15/08/2025,"Unsatisfactory account of the depraved lifestyles of Maxwell and Epstein. Offers little to explain how a second-rate human being like Epstein could have wielded such influence over the world's richest and most powerful men, including 2 ex-presidents and Bill Gates.Easy to see why the doco maker Vicky Ward has been accused of self-promotion and she certainly puts herself at centre stage at every opportunity.",False
10,4,The new upbeat narrator was the straw that broke the camel's back,thelawstudentsaide,n/a,15/08/2025,This show was alright the first few episodes that is until they changed the narrator in what seems like (S1: E103 Who is Prince Andrew - the episode before that as well) to this upbeat girl with quirky music that made it sound like I was listening to some Youtube tea channel. Dropping it.,False

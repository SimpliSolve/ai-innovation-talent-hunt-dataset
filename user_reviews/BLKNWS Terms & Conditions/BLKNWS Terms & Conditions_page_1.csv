1,10,Monumental masterpiece of art,peter0969,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watched at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival.I absolutely adored this movie. A massive overload sensation of art, music, colors, and cinema through the black experience. Khalil Joseph has crafted one of the most unique, enthralling and deeply ambitious stories through the lives of black individuals and their experience. Presented with beautiful music, colors, and sound designs, it is something I have never ever experienced in my life.Based on his exhibition works, this longer extended experimental joint dives deeper into his ideas and themes. Exploring philosophical concepts through the landscapes of people, footage, music, scenes, and history, it creates this visual appealing consciousness, that sucks you into the mass. The idea of exploring and blended both politics, memes, blackness, experience, and people all into a art collage that is cinematic and ambitious, is so unique and something that nobody would ever do, except Joseph.There has been some behind the scenes issues during the Sundance Festival but I'm so glad it got to premiere at the event because it is one of the most unforgettable experiences I will ever have.",False

1,10,Unique historical contribution about Isreal's beginnings,qrpgnfzqm,n/a,15/08/2025,"Sometimes only personal memoirs can enrich and add authenticity to an historical story, and this documentary achieved that mark splendidly. What is particularly striking and resembles similar accounts narrated by the offspring of those who were the protagonists of major world events, is this grand daughter's discovery of her inherited family legacy. I was reminded about how trauma is transmitted inter-generationally where parents or grandparents were key actors or victims in alarming historical events. Wether one is from a ""survivors' camp"" or a ""perpetrators' camp"" in relation to the Holocaust, or Nakba tragedies for example, trauma is passed on to the children in both situations, and the offspring are then beset with the task of processing what happened in the past through their direct relationship links. That's quite a challenge!",False

1,8,A good documentary,inacan-90-894261,n/a,16/08/2025,I never really knew about the KITH history and was only familiar with them on tv. It was a good and fascinating ride. I honestly would have liked to see another episode where it explored the individual members solo careers and how they kept interweaving with the others and what they've learned. Make it a 8 or 10 part series.,False
2,8,Affectionate look back,jellopuke,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you grew up with the kids in the hall then you probably already love them and know at least some of what's presented here. If not, then this does a very good job of explaining the reasons behind their success, the routes they took to get there, the fallouts, and the come backs. It glosses over a few key things and might have benefitted from even adding a third episode, but for what it was trying to do, it does it well.It would have been nice if it had gone over a bit more what they did on their own, ie directing, other series, Buddy Cole one man show, but the era from 1999 to 2006 is skipped over fast, as is from that to now. Still, nice to see them all talking again and having fun.Check it out if you're a fan or if you're curious what they were all about.",False
3,8,Great Story,DVK1234,n/a,16/08/2025,"History of KITH. I saw them at the Rivoli and I believe the Factory Theatre (somewhere on Bathurst St) in the 80s. They were so different. I believe I saw them before Scott Thompson joined. You could tell they were going somewhere. They all were very successful independently as well. I didn't know the group had differences around the time of Brain Candy. Nice to see their friendship remained after that tough time. Part of Canadian comedy history, along with SCTV.",False
4,10,Outstanding,travisbroy,n/a,16/08/2025,"If you love the Kids in the Hall, then this is an absolute must-see. It walks you through every step of their shared careers, and it is funny and emotional throughout. It reminds viewers that they were groundbreaking in multiple ways, that they were constantly going against cultural norms even as they were influencing pop culture. And, gloriously, it's announcing that they are not going anywhere- at least not until one of them dies.",False

1,10,What Really Happened in Election 2024?,nathanclark-11898,n/a,15/08/2025,"I gave this film a 10 because it needs to be seen. Journalist Greg Palast documents an under-the-radar system of suppressing the Black vote that has gone unchallenged and largely unreported. It began in Georgia under Gov. Brian Kemp and spread to the rest of the states, at a scale that may very well explain the surprising re-election of Donald Trump. A convincing argument is made that many or most of the voters struck from the roles are perfectly valid registered voters, many of whom have lived in the same house for decades. We hear from some of the victims, as well as from election workers and even some of the ""vigilantes"" who compiled lists of Black voters to challenge their right to vote by falsely marking them as deceased or having voted in another state.",False
2,9,Wow,jms_mckelvey,n/a,15/08/2025,"I just happened to run across this documentary a few days ago. Why this wasn't plastered across every media platform leading up to the November elections is beyond me. I'm not a tinfoil hat wearing conspiracy theorist, but Greg Palast, makes some damning revelations in this. I wasn't the biggest fan of Harris, but I'm definitely no fan of Trump and the way the GOP has bent over and kissed the ring of MAGA.Why hasn't the NAACP, ACLU, slammed the state of Georgia, with lawsuits over this absolutely mind boggling to me. Is it the entirely controlled GOP legislature, and more than likely state Supreme Court, just hem hawing and just delaying potential lawsuits?I don't know what it would take to get answers. But this is not good in any way.",False
3,10,There aren't enough people talking about this,emeraldstar09,n/a,15/08/2025,"In the wake of what feels like a revolution in America, on the heels of a fascist regime, we need to understand, there WERE people who were investigating into what happens when people choose to money over democracy. We had people fighting to make votes heard for all Americans and those who chose to big on the wrong side of history. This film is eloquent in its execution and will be a hard pill to swallow for those who think they got a fair shot. This needs to be shown to as many people as possible for now and for future generations. We need to educate ourselves, learn from the past and stop repeating history.",False

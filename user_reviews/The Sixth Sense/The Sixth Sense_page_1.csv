1,8,A movie with a gentle but long-lasting impression.,undersky,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Sixth Sense enjoys being playful with our imagination. What your eyes see is not exactly what it is. What your mind paints is not exactly what there is. In the world of The Sixth Sense logic is your worst enemy.There are obvious (and sometimes less obvious) hints right in front of you but you don't grasp them because of your preconceptions and premises. I once read a novel called 'Somewhere carnal over 40 winks' which used similar techniques found in this movie, but in writing. I'm sure you will enjoy this book as much as I did, if you like to be intellectually surprised.If you haven't seen this movie, don't read reviews and don't talk to your friends who have already seen it. The movie is very much susceptible to spoilers. It is suffice to say that the ending is just shockingly delightful.I don't consider this movie heavily philosophical or thought-provoking. Having said that, it is one of the movies I love to watch again and again.",True
2,8,"Even if someone spoiled the ending for you, it's still worth seeing",rooprect,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are over 2000 IMDb reviews for ""The Sixth Sense"" so I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said. But in case someone has already spoiled the ending for you (like some dumbbutt did for me and the entire office back in 1999, causing me to avoid this movie for 15 years), never fear... it's still VERY MUCH worth watching.The cool twist is, of course, the main punch of this film. But it's the kind of film you have to watch twice. Once for the story and once for the poetry. So to all my fellow film lovers who happen to have friends & coworkers with big mouths, this film is still a real treat on a poetic & artistic level.M. Night Shyamalan is one of the few directors who deserves the hype and popularity he gets, at least for this film (I haven't seen any of his others but soon will). Everything is meticulously planned, every camera movement, every shadow, every color and every editing cut, almost to the point of obsessive mania. In the DVD extras he and his crew explain why they did everything the way they did; for example they do a lot of long takes because their philosophy was that rapid cuts tend to disrupt the viewer's thought process. So instead of showing a dialogue between two people in a volley of closeup cuts, the scene is done with 1 camera filming them from the side, slowly, almost hypnotically moving between both of them as it gets closer over the course of perhaps 2 minutes.I could go on for ages about such scenes, but you probably get the point. If you enjoy the classic directors known for their careful & deliberate approach to filmmaking, directors like Orson Welles (""Citizen Kane""), Otto Preminger (""The Man with the Golden Arm""), Kurosawa (""Seven Samurai"") or even the younger crop of great directors like Steven Soderbergh (""Traffic"") and Alfonso Cuarón (""Children of Men""), you definitely have to check out this movie and other works of Shyamalan.",True
3,9,Still Very Good Even When You Know The Ending,ccthemovieman-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"This was hyped big-time when it came out and, if memory serves me, was a good conversation piece among those who saw it at the theater.I didn't see it for a few years afterward, on tape and now on DVD. It was very good but I didn't find it as ""the greatest movie ever"" as some did. It is an involving story, however, and I've come to appreciate it more with multiple viewings. I've seen it three times, the last one looking for mistakes to disprove the surprise ending....but couldn't find any. The filmmakers covered their tracks. However, a couple of scenes were misleading. Those who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about. For those who haven't, I'm not going to spoil it here.I enjoyed both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the two leads. Willis has had many action-packed, profane macho roles in his career but I like him best when he's low key, as he is in here (and in ""Unbreakable,"" to name another fairly-recent movie) The story is slow-paced but it sure is not boring. In a way, it's nice to see a slower-paced film be a big hit, as this was.Osment, meanwhile, is a terrific child actor, as he has proved in other films. He's simply one of the best of his young generation. He and Dakota Fanning are the two best child actors I've seen in many years.This isn't just some supernatural-horror movie. It's a nice human interest story. There is one scene late in the movie in which Osment's mom is having a talk with her young boy in the car. It is an extremely touching scene that brings tears - a great moment in the film.",False
4,n/a,A movie that will not be outclassed in its genre for years to come,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I first saw The Sixth Sense, I didn't know what to expect. I guess I was looking forward to a good scary horror flick.  I was very surprised. I found that the purpose for this movie was far greater than just trying to scare the audience.  I found this movie was showing not only the emotions of fear, but also faith, commitment, sadness of loss, and love.  The end was so surprising, I had to see it again.  The second time I watched it, I did it from a totally different perspective (this is a very rare quality for any movie), and I enjoyed it just as much, or maybe even more. I also, as many viewers have, tried to detect fallacies in the story.  I couldn't find one. In addition, for those that appreciate great soundtracks, the music only helps to heighten the experience of the movie.I believe that a great movie is one that helps the viewer perceive life and the world differently.  The Sixth Sense is one of those extraordinary movies that does that to me.  This movie reflects on some difficult subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking eternal questions.  Questions about death, about letting go, about eternal love and commitment, about the love between parent and child, and between husband and wife.  Maybe I read too much into this very wonderful film, but I believe it will be difficult to find a movie that has touched on these subjects so poignantly and so well for years to come.",False
5,10,An appropriate spoiler-free review,kylopod,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe surprise ending to ""The Sixth Sense"" has gotten so much attention that it threatens to overshadow the film. I occasionally hear people say things like the following: ""The 'twist' was so obvious that I figured it out in the first five minutes!"" Some of those people may even be telling the truth. There's no way to know. But there's a lot of condescension in such remarks, an implication that anyone who didn't figure it out must be a really dumb sucker. At least in my case I have an excuse. When I first saw this film back in early 2000, I knew nothing about it other than that it was about the relationship between a psychiatrist played by Bruce Willis and a child with some sort of psychic power. I didn't even know what that psychic power was, and an early scene led me to think it was telepathy. In short, I had no idea even what the movie's subject was until about the middle of the film, so I was completely adrift as to solving the movie's mystery.Still, to anyone who did figure the secret out quickly, I have this to say: you may be smarter than I am, but that does not make this a bad movie. Hitchcock went to great lengths to keep the ending to ""Psycho"" from leaking out. Many people who watch that film today figure the twist out (probably because it has been imitated in countless thrillers since then), but the film is still a classic that holds up well today. Surprise endings are, ultimately, just clever contrivances, extra layerings on the cake. They do not constitute the difference between a good movie and a bad movie. A movie must work on its own terms before springing a surprise.Nevertheless, there can be no denying that the twist in ""The Sixth Sense"" is particularly clever. It's no virtue if a twist is impossible to predict. It is just as important that the twist be logical as that it be surprising. Plenty of thrillers feature twists that are arbitrary, where the plot fails to provide enough hints. Even a clever thriller like ""Fight Club"" requires a bit of a stretch to accept the ending. What makes ""The Sixth Sense"" impressive is that it never cheats by suggesting that earlier scenes were imaginary. Everything we see is real, and only our assumptions fool us. If, however, you weren't fooled, all the better: just because you figure out the magician's trick does not make it a bad trick.Consider what appears to be happening in the film. Willis plays a psychiatrist who has received accolades for helping children with problems. We see a romantic evening with him and his wife at home. Then he gets into an ugly, violent confrontation with a former patient. Willis believes he has failed, and he wants to make amends by helping a new child (Haley Joel Osment) who appears to be having the same problems (and perhaps the same abilities) that his former patient once displayed. But just as he thinks he's making progress with Osment, his marriage seems to be falling apart. His wife isn't talking to him, and is beginning to see another man.However these events may be reinterpreted by what is revealed later, the movie is effective because it works on this basic level. In a key scene, Willis asks Osment what he wants most, and Osment answers, ""I don't want to be scared anymore."" It is not always clear that Osment is really facing a mortal threat. But because the movie establishes that he is undergoing a scary experience, by the time the movie reveals what it is that is frightening him, we have our emotions invested in the character, and the terror is very real to us. This is a step that most horror films neglect, the recognition that the most powerful fear may be the fear of fear itself.When I was a teenager, I assumed that all good horror films had to have an R rating. Even as an adult, I was surprised that a movie as frightening as ""The Sixth Sense"" received only a PG-13. In hindsight, however, most of my favorite horror films, whatever their rating, have relatively little violence. Like all good horror films, ""The Sixth Sense"" allows the suspense to build and does not rely on either excessive violence or cheap scares. The ending adds an additional level of intrigue, but it is not necessary to one's enjoyment during the first viewing. Still, if you have not seen the film by now and remain woefully ignorant of the surprise lurking in its plot, I urge you, before someone ruins it for you, go and watch the movie!",True
6,10,Incredible,Spirit-2,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Sixth Sense is one of those films that rarely happens these days.  In other words, I knew so little about it before sitting in the cinema that it wasn't ruined before it started.I don't want to ramble on about it so I'll just say... absolute perfection. An incredible story that had me and my friends gripped from start to finish. The twist in the tale was totally unexpected as well.After it finished we sat through the whole of the credits and talked about how fabulous it was.  If only more films were like this.  I can't remember the last time we did that!Congratulations to all involved in this masterpiece.",False
7,9,M. Night Shyalaman's standout movie.,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,15/08/2025,"Cole Sear had a special gift, the ability to see dead people, his mother Lynn is worried beyond belief at the change in him, and Child Psychologist Malcolm Crowe is brought in to help him.For my money, this is still the best film from M Night. Shyalaman, since this film some have been good, some of been woeful, this however has stood the test of time.A real mind bender, this film is thought provoking, dramatic, unsettling at times, and on occasion a little moving.Arguably one of the best films for Bruce Willis, he's tremendous here, as are Toni Collette and Haley Joel Osment.I would never dream of giving a spoiler away, as some have done in their reviews, there's a big moment in this film, where everything falls into place, it's very skillfully done, and a real jaw dropping moment.9/10.",False
8,10,Brilliant,indianajonze,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Sixth Sense is a brilliant film, plain and simple. It is unique in that it relies on imagination and psychology to scare you and make you think twice about the world around you. The director did a fabulous job constructing the imagery of the film, and I genuinely did not know about the ending until it was revealed. Quite a shock! The Sixth Sense goes in my book as the single greatest psychological horror film I have ever seen. Anyone who bashes it are simply not giving it a chance or don't fully realize the complex dialog and imagery around them. Brilliant",False
9,9,You'll be knocked for six,Joanna Kelly,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is an incredibly powerful film. Awash with emotion but never stooping to sentimentality this is the story of one frightened little boy you will never forget. All your worst childhood nightmares: the noises in the attic, the intruder in your house, that cold breath that makes your hair stand on end are here and then some.Bruce Willis gives one of the best performances of his career as the child psychologist trying to get himself back on track after a violent encounter with a former patient and it would be a crime if Haley Joel Osment were overlooked at coming awards ceremonies for his powerful performance here. It has been a long time since a child actor displayed such maturity in a role. Cole's innocent little face hidden behind his absent father's large-framed spectacles betrays a child coming to terms with a terrifying secret in the only way he can.You don't need to go and see this film again to realise why the end is such a surprise but you will rush out to watch it again purely because it's an almost perfect example of it's genre.Laugh, cry, jump a mile out of your seat, sigh with relief - but not too early... We did!",False
10,9,One of the best films of 1999!,Xophianic,n/a,15/08/2025,"I am embarrassed to admit that the only reason I saw THE SIXTH SENSE when I did was because THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was sold out. I hadn't seen BLAIR WITCH yet but I heard great reviews, and of course it was sold out when I went to see it. So my friend and I decided to see THE SIXTH SENSE instead. Not only did it turn out to be a better movie than BLAIR WITCH is, but it turned out to be one of my favorites.THE SIXTH SENSE is about an award-winning child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), who is depressed because one of his former clients committed suicide because Crowe was unable to help him. Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) is a child that has social problems frighteningly similar to Crowe's old client, so Crowe decides he will try to help this child in order to find redemption. Cole later reveals that this problem goes well beyond normal social problems. He claims to be able to see the ghosts of dead people, but no one else can.The acting in THE SIXTH SENSE was superb. Olivia Williams does well as Anne Crowe, Willis' depressed wife, and Toni Collette does a great job as Lynn Sear, Osment's loving mother who is very concerned for her child. I think that Bruce Willis is at his very best in this movie, and I happen to be a fan of Willis. But I think that Haley Joel Osment stole the show. He did an amazing job, expressing more combined emotions that most adult actors have to deal with. He is definitely the best child actor I've ever seen, and I am glad that Bruce Willis let him have the spotlight.The plot is very entertaining, though at times you may wonder where it is going. The ending is the best part of the movie, and it completely changes whatever you originally thought of the whole story line. I applaud the advertisers of THE SIXTH SENSE for not leaving a trace of the surprise ending in the previews of the movie (unlike DOUBLE JEOPARDY) and I certainly will not give it away in this comment. But I will say that it will completely surprise most all of you. (I think many that say that they saw it coming are probably lying.)THE SIXTH SENSE is one of my favorite movies, and I think it is surely one of the best films of 1999. I hope it wins many Oscars this year, and I recommend that you go out and buy this movie now.",False
11,7,"I got the ending before in the theaters, but good film",peterwang-1,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Sixth Sense has a surprise ending ( many films will use this in the following years) but it's not all about the ending ( in contrary to certain other films that I will not name to avoid spoiling). The story on itself is very interesting but the ending is the cherry on the pie. Many who saw it the first time were in disbelief: is this right...? After re-watching it several times...yes it is. The plot is almost watertight. I suppose if you want to you can always find tiny little mistakes but I haven't found any big ones.The Sixth Sense is unbelievably well cast: Bruce Willis delivers his 2nd best performance( 12 Monkeys is his best), debutant Haley Joel Osment is excellent( his performance in A. I is also excellent, other movies of his were mostly disappointing performances), Toni Colette delivers the first in a long series of Oscar-worthy performances (also see The Night Listener, The Hours, Little Miss Sunshine ao. ) and the performance of Donnie Wahlberg musn't be forgotten even though he only gets 3 minutes of screen time. Olivia Williams may be the only lesser performance in the lead cast but she still does an OK job.We can see several Shyamalan's trademarks for the first time: He uses very natural colors( brown, white, gray, beige, green) in the interiors and clothing. Another trademark for his work is the fragmentary use of a rich red color to break with the dull colors in the background. He doesn't overuse the red so it preserves its power. We can also see Shyamalan's excellent use of colors in The Village ( even more then in the sixth sense): red stands for evil,misfortune and fear while yellow stands for weakness. The Village is M. Night's third best film in my opinion (Unbreakable is the one that closest approaches TSS brilliance). It's also unbelievably well-acted, the story is strong, the settings are beautiful...definitely worth watching ( if hope you have seen it but if you haven't...you know what to do). It's a bit under-appreciated on IMDb but don't let that fool you.I'm no direction expert but I found it to be brilliant. The brilliance lies in the details; the excellent use of mirrors and shadows, the lighting, eccentric camera viewpoints,...it's a delight for a filmenthousiast( like yours truly) to watch. You can feel Shyamalan is both writer and director; he knows exactly what to do with the material and which camera shot would be best for which scene.",False
12,10,One of the films of the Nineties,Readster,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is perhaps my film of the decade so far. The reasons are too numerous to go into in such a short critique. Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.It is such a relief that the performances of Willis and the excellent Osment live up to an excellently directed quality storyline. I will be disappointed if the youngster doesn't receive at least an academy nomination.I seldom go to the cinema twice to watch a film, in fact I cannot remember when I have done it before. Tonight I am taking an old friend to see this film as it will be a tragedy if he doesn't see it on the big screen. He has heard so much about it that he is reluctant to go, as I am when something is over-hyped. Just for a change though, here is a film that lives up to its billing and has you thinking about it for weeks to come. As for the twist at the end? Well it totally disorientated me, my mind spinning back throughout the whole film. A fantastic punchline to my film of the year.",False

This goes to show how popular the movie is.The basic story is Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) Is a child psychiatrist that goes on one more try and chooses a new child Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) to help with his tendency to see dead people.After watching the movie, the first time, you will want to watch it again to see the clues you missed.

14,n/a,The most careful attention to detail,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"What makes this film so wonderful to watch is not simply the acting, or the terror it instills, or even the plot itself.  It is the way in which the writer/director M. Night Shyamalan takes his vision from the page, and carefully crafts a tale that completely absorbs the viewer.  As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion: fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.Haley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character's soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.Bruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.The Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.  But at least they'll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way.",False
15,10,one of the greatest reveals of all time,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"Child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) celebrates an award win with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams). Deranged ex-patient Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) breaks in and shots Malcolm. Vincent then commits suicide. The next fall, Malcolm is treating distressed Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment) who lives with his single mom Lynn (Toni Collette). His suffering leaves him an outcast at school. After another episode leaves him in the hospital, he tells Malcolm his secret that he ""sees dead people"".This is one of the best reveals in movie history. It's not simply a shocking twist. Anybody can write a random twist that aims to shock people. This twist is well-planned and constructed from the first moments of the film. Shyamalan lays out not only clues but the right amount of clues. It is a twist that people are unlikely to foresee but then beat themselves for not forseeing it. He gets the perfect balance.The other question is whether this is a good movie without the twist. The great thing is that the intensity does not rely on the twist. HJO has the perfect wise innocence quality. It has great creepiness. It's a traditional ghost story and a well made one. The intensity ramps up as the ghosts reveal themselves. This would be one of the great horrors even without the twist.",False

Many of the non-spoiler reviews spoil the epic plot-twist of The Sixth Sense, and if you know what the twist is, then your enjoyment watching this amazing thriller and one of the best movies I've ever watched, will be ruined.

So, if you know THE twist, you'll probably not enjoy the film nearly as much when you first see it. But, if you haven't, it's a heck of an enjoyable film.Haley Joel Osment delivers a truly amazing performance considering his age. He is THE reason the film works as well as it does and I wish the Oscar folks had given him some sort of special award to honor his great work. And, in addition, I can't believe I am saying this, but Bruce Willis and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, were at the top of their game as well. The other huge star here is the writing--and it was superb because it was so original, creative and the story bears many repeated viewings as each one reveals yet another layer of complexity.By the way, while nominated for six Oscars, the movie somehow won none. Instead, the darkly cynical ""American Beauty"" carried off five of the trophies--though I really didn't think this winner was nearly as good a movie.

Touching without being cheap. Visually it is stunning. There are some truly amazing shots, the attention to color is appreciated. Haley Joel Osment as Cole is extraordinary. What a promising career ahead of him. Bruce Willis, as a workaholic child psychologist, ought to be extremely proud of this, as it may be some of his best work. Tender, brooding, regretful, determined. Perfect. Toni Collette, is really phenomenal. I think she gets overlooked, but with any less talented actress, the film would have certainly suffered.I watched this film again recently, absolutely certain I would have lost some of the awe I had for it since last watching it on the big screen seven years ago. I was pleasantly surprised. It was just as moving, eerie, and beautiful. An obvious top five film of all time for me. Quite the freshman effort from Mr. Shayamalan.",False
19,10,The reason why everyone loved Shyamalan back then!!,NpMoviez,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerShyamalan at his very best! I said it, I don't care what people think. Many people claim Unbreakable to be his best film till date, but for me, as much as I love Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense will always remain as the best Shyamalan had to offer.Good : It's his masterpiece. Shyamalan has never been better. What does it not have? Emotions, drama, character development, storytelling, great writing + directing, all of it. Willis does a really good job. It is perhaps the first time I saw him in a role like this, one of the best examples of casting against type. The arc of the child played by Osment and that of Willis have been given full justice. Seeing them help each other overcome their problems and fears in the way they did was very good. There are some emotional moments which hit the right notes, all because we have known the characters very well. We get a happy ending for the kid, and while expecting something similar for Willis, we get the infamous twist. The first time I watched it, I was blown away. It feels kind of obvious having it watched so many times now, but man was it incredible! Bruce was dead all the time. This made me analyze some parts. Bruce died with the bullet on his abdomen, and in a scene where he is getting out of a flower shop seeing his wife with another guy, he is clutching the exact place where he was hit. And in every scene after he was shot, his interactions with his wife feel and are obviously him talking to her, but her talking to herself. For a first few views, it is unnoticeable. And, it doesn't even feel that way. Also, Willis is not interacting with physical object. What I thought of a plot hole in the first few viewings were actually genius writing and directing. And I would also like to talk about the horror aspect. It's something I call genuine horror. There are creepy stuff going on and you don't know what is actually happening. It's not a horror movie but has got the elements perfectly. And of all the emotional parts, the final moments after the twist hit perfectly. I wonder why this wasn't an Oscar worthy film.Bad : Not necessarily bad about the film. But Shyamalan was called the next Spielberg after this film. His next great film was Unbreakable, followed by Split. Split was good, but nowhere near the former two, which was leaps and bounds better than Signs and Glass. And besides these, I don't even want to name the rest of his disasters. I still think he can make real good films, but comparing most of his films, I sadly feel that he was no Spielberg but just a one hit wonder.Conclusion : It's the greatest Shyamalam film ever. Unbreakable is a close second. Those who think Shyamalan didn't have any potential must watch this. It is just that Shyamalan must have stayed this way. Also, any thriller fans out there? Watch this immediately, if you haven't watched it.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+",True

21,7,M. Night Shyamalan's finest moment...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've actually only seen the 1999 movie ""The Sixth Sense"", from writer and director M. Night Shyamalan, once before. And that was back in the day when the movie was new. So I opted to revisit the movie again here in 2024.Now, I have to say that the movie's storyline is one that you definitely remember vividly from the first time watching it. So I suppose that writer and director M. Night Shyamalan really managed to put together something very unique back in 1999, especially since the memory of the movie still is fresh in memory after 25 years. But at the same time that is also the weak point of the movie, because once you've seen the movie, there is no surprise moments or elements to the storyline.The acting performances in the movie are good, and the have a good cast ensemble, with the likes of Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams and Donnie Wahlberg. I really like Haley Joel Osment's performance in the movie, because he carries the movie phenomenally well, even at such a young age.""The Sixth Sense"" is a 'whoa, did that just happen' type of movie the first time you watch it. I fondly remember the unveiling of the plot twist, I hadn't seen it coming back in the day. And that alone makes it well-worth sitting down to watch the movie.The second time around watching the movie, I was looking for all the subtle clues and things that I missed the first time around. And when you know the plot, you easily pick out the minute details that M. Night Shyamalan placed throughout the narrative in so many scenes. And it really works well, because it is so subtle that you don't notice it the first time around.I will actually go as far as to saying that ""The Sixth Sense"" is M. Night Shyamalan's finest achievement in his career. He haven't gotten anywhere near this movie since.If you haven't already seen ""The Sixth Sense"", you most certainly should find the time to do so.My rating of M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 thriller ""The Sixth Sense"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",False

There are a couple of good scares, rendered more effective because I dropped my guard.  My sixth sense says such was the Writer/Director's express intention. :-)It's a ghost story yet doesn't rely on special effects and computerization to chill your bones as the Haunting tried to do.  The scares come from the sliver of possibility ""what is happening may be true.""  Well that, and the dropping your guard thing.Everyone in the cast is outstanding.  Bruce Willis is at his best since Die Hard and The Last Boy Scout.   His patient is 33 years junior to him ( played by Haley Joel Osment) is outstanding.  Truly.  I was mesmerized by his ability to get into this ""sixth sense"" possessed character.  Malcolm and Cole helping each other resolve their problems occurs with good chemistry, and is believable, despite the heights you have to take your mind to believe the story's premise.I am sooo tempted to give clues on when to grip the one you're with or arms rests a little more tightly; but alas, cannot in good conscience (or for fear of hate mail!)  And out of respect for M. Night Shyamalan for a very good script and story thesis.Summing: if you're ""only"" looking for the Chill Factor, take in Blair Witch over this one for those final 10 minutes.  The reality factor is stronger, both despite and because of the low budget factors.  But if you want to see one of the best Hollywood manufactured horror films in a long time, give Sixth Sense a chance.  I enjoyed it.",True
23,7,Stunning drama with horrifying and hair raising images and wonderfully directed by Shyamalan,ma-cortes,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film focuses a child psychologist named Doctor Malcolm(Bruce Willis).One night, when the doctor and his spouse(Olivia Williams)find themselves their home, they are visited by a nutty patient and the tragedy take place. More later, the Doctor sees a traumatized young boy named Cole(Haley Joel Osment), he communicates with dead people who don't know they are dead. Cole's mummy(Tony Colette)is worried about her terrified son's nightmares ,increasing problems and episodes of acting out. Because of this, Cole is named geeky in the college where appear various dead people who ask his help.The film provides creepy scenes, a well-knit drama, grisly terror when the living dead appear and suspenseful throughout.The flick contains the more famous plot twist from cinema history, because the ending leads to a breathtaking and unexpected outcome on what's happened before. For that reason , gets a highly original and imaginative script by Night Syamalan,-also director and secondary actor, as usual in his films-, and has been copied and imitated several times, such as, ¨Stir of Echoes¨(David Koepp) and ¨The others¨(Alejandro Amenabar). Acting by main actors is top notch, Bruce Willis is magnificent as restrained psychologist and Haley Joel Osment is awesome as traumatized little boy, carrying the movie on his frail shoulders; furthermore, appear future promising actors as Mischa Burton(OC) and Trevor Morgan . Mysterious and sinister cinematographic atmosphere is well made by Tak Fujimoto and eerie soundtrack by James Newton Howard, both are Shyalaman's usual collaborators. The motion picture is produced by famed Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy(Spielberg's producers) and stupendously directed by M. Night Shyamalan.",False
24,1,Mr Mauve's justification is wrong.  PLOT HOLES!,Jeff-197,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe line that the poster below mentions may explain why Bruce Willis does not see other ghosts, etc.  (SPOILER) But it DOES NOT explain how he ""lived"" for a year without wondering why nobody could SEE HIM!  He lived for a year without ANYONE ever speaking to him?  Without EVER trying to say anything to his wife besides ""are you gonna get that?""  I don't buy it.  The twist ending is implausible, no matter how you slice it.Furthermore, the romantic sub-plot is once again underdeveloped and secondary, just a filler for the erroneous twist ending.  We could've seen a little more development of the lack of their marriage (showing how he was inhumanly busy for a year, etc.)The script was recycled from ""The Shining"", a much better film as far as acting, cinematography, music, development of the characters, and most other aspects go.  Save your money and rent that classic instead of this fluff.",True
25,n/a,"Death, Lfe, Fear and Hope",n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Review: The Sixth Sense, Director: M. Night ShyamalamAs a film which has undoubtedly caught the eye of the film going world, it was difficult to avoid the surrounding hype and publicity. Luckily most of the people I had spoken to who had seen the film did not spoil the 'twist' at the end, which, although is rather a laboured point by now in reviews, certainly adds to the ""Oh, I see now"" factor.The story revolves around a child psychologist played characteristically by Bruce Willis. I say characteristically, because although his portrayal is quite real, and at times touching, there always seems to be an unnerving 'Die Hard'-ness to his speech, lending the dialogue some comical qualities. Having said that, his overall attempts at revealing the vulnerable and disturbed psyche of his character achieve good results. As the psychologist, he is plagued by a particular event in his professional life which he perceives as his personal failure, and sets out to redeem himself by righting the wrong and wiping his failure from his conscience. This opportunity presents itself to him in the form of Cole Sear, played devastatingly well by Hayley Joel Osment. Cole has a problem, he sees dead people. To the outside world he is seen as a loner, a problem child, and has become increasingly isolated. Hence the need for a child psychologist. Once we have been introduced to these two central players, we are taken on a journey of discovery, as both of these characters in the space of the film will learn a great deal about each other, themselves and human nature.It is this particular point which the film attempts to address so strongly - human communication. That when this breaks down, an inevitable cycle of interpersonal destruction takes course, sometimes irreversible. This is framed within the context of a superbly told ghost story. The sheer truthfulness and honesty with which the concept of fear is expressed by all the characters, is breathtaking. Cole's' experience of the walking dead, appearing out of nowhere, Malcolm's fear of a deteriorating marriage, and Cole's' mother's fear relating to her own existential angst. All of these are played against the backdrop of the often difficult but finally warm relationship between Cole and Malcolm. Eventually, and against the odds, each character displays courage and bravery as they face up to their existential and supernatural fears.There are one or two niggling problems plot wise, but in a film where the overall atmosphere created is one which encompasses death, fear, and finally hope, it is impossible not to overlook incongruencies. Superb direction, acting and ambience lead me to think that M. Night Shyamalan has really succeeded in telling a chillingly touching story about the triumph of the human spirit.February 14, 2000 Harshad C. Keval",False

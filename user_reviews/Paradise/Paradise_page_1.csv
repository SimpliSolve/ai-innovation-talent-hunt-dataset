1,9,Wonderful look at a life well lived,johnnydmiles-43286,n/a,16/08/2025,"The focus of this film is Joe, an octogenarian who was inspired in his 20s when he lived three years in Borneo with the natives there while in the Peace Corps. He wanted to live in balance with nature so he bought a piece of land at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains in the 70s and began cultivating various ""adaptogen"" plants that had medicinal properties. Over the years he partnered with several people to develop the site as a place of learning that included a library, that is until a recent fire destroyed his vast collection of books along with other structures and plants. Down but not out, Joe worked to restore what was lost. We then learn during filming that he has stage 4 cancer and only months to live. The film then becomes a beautiful look into dying with grace. After his passing one of his close friends was digging his grave and explained that he was incredibly sad but also felt unfathomable gratitude. I was deeply moved by these heartfelt words. Joe's philosophy may be disagreeable to some as he wholly rejects the status quo of western life. I recommend watching and opening your conception of what it means to truly live.",False

1,5,It's... Fine.,anissa-taylor,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a reasonable documentary, nothing revolutionary. It doesn't contain anything fans don't know. The editing isn't great, frequently they leave the narrators mistakes and/ or restarts in which is annoying and should have been picked up.All in all there's a lot of ""allegedly"", a psychologist giving his repetitive thoughts on why Eminem did what he did and how he felt, and basically one interview Eminem did decades ago interspersed with stock images and footage when the (random) interviewed ""specialists"" aren't talking about eminems music and life.It's basically a fan film, and is fine to kill some time if you're bored, but isn't ground breaking.",False
2,1,The majority of this documentary is AI generated,tgcmynyzr,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like one of the other reviews said, this documentary is very likely AI generated (not including the speakers), you can hear accidental repeats (one moment it said ""In 1991, in 1991 Eminem was..."") and repetitive wording (""beloved uncle Ronnie"" was said several times). Throughout the documentary, his music is barely played with only about 2 to 3 exceptions. Overall, this documentary provides no real insight to Eminem aside from what we already know. At the end of the day this documentary feels like an hour plus long version of a Wikipedia article. Simply listening to the narrator, you can hear how it is a script being read by an AI.",False
3,3,Interesting subject matter poorly executed,finnigan82,n/a,16/08/2025,"Really cheaply made, reuse of images over and over, weird blurry images and stock pictures of old America (no idea why). Almost every video clip is out of sync with the audio, any music video is out.Narration is fine, but again poorly edited, I'm not sure anyone watched this back after editing it. I've not seen quality this bad for a long time, not something I'd expect nowadays.Talking heads are okay, but not sure how qualified a middle aged Liverpudlian ""psychologist"" is to talk about a white kid growing up in urban Detroit.This has 4 stars on Amazon Prime, no idea how. You'd be better off just finding a video about Eminem on YouTube, I'm sure it'll have better content and quality.",False
4,1,Just ... bad.,lexgough,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary is a letdown on several levels. The background music is constantly playing, and it's weird and doesn't fit with the content, creating a distracting atmosphere. The editing is sloppy, with noticeable mistakes by the narrator left in, and there are awkward silences that break the flow. It repeats itself a lot, making the same points over and over, which becomes tedious.The information about Eminem is nothing new, just rehashed facts that most fans already know. The music and video are not in sync, and there's an overuse of poor-quality stock images and footage, which makes it feel cheap. It seems like the documentary was released without anyone watching it back to catch these errors.Overall, it feels like it was made by an AI with very little human input. This rushed and careless production makes it fall far short of being engaging or informative.",False

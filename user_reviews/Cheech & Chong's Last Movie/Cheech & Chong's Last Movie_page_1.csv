1,8,Dave's Not Here!,stevendbeard,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI saw Cheech & Chong's Last Movie, starring Cheech Marin & Tommy Chong.This is a documentary containing interviews, sketches and never before seen footage of the comedy team. It covers their 50 year career of stand up comedy, records and movies, including their rough patches. At the height of their career, they would open for rock bands, including one time for the Rolling Stones in front of 20,000 people. I'm old enough to remember seeing them opening for rock bands-not the Rolling Stones one, but others-and it was surprising at the time. You learn how their partnership influenced others and who influenced them. How their childhood was and how they met. Basically, everything you ever wanted to know about Cheech & Chong.It's rated R for drug content, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes.If you are a fan, you should enjoy this one. I know I did and it would be a good one to stream. Dave's not here!",True
2,8,thought this was going to be an actually movie but this works just as well.,subxerogravity,n/a,16/08/2025,"The fame that is Cheech & Chong was slightly before me. I'm aware of Cheech Marin, who, as an actor, I was aware of from my childhood, starting with his film Born in East LA, so for me, the film was most interesting from the standpoint of Tommy Chong, who, from my perspective, was just Rae Dawn Chong's father.Both of them had pretty interesting lives before meeting one another and starting the comedy duo. Lives that I thought were more interesting than the comedy team-up
As far as docs go overall this was two interesting men with a great story to tell and worth paying attention to even if you are not familiar with their iconic turn in comedy.",False
3,6,Good Documentary,tkdlifemagazine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Cheech and Chong's Last Movie is a pretty good documentary. It is a retrospective of their lives and careers and provides a lot of information about the duo that most people do not know. I liked it. It is as much a historical and social documentary as it is about the comedy team. The filmmaking is not great. The movie is not so incredibly well directed or edited, but it does have a lot of archival footage. These two really did carve out a unique and singular style of comedy that doesn't seem brave now but was brave at the time it was forged. They have an important place in comedy and this well memorializes it..",False
4,10,Awesome recap of a crazy career!,dandruff-864-324366,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to be invited to the showing at the DGA, It was a great trip to learn about these hilarious guys and how their careers exploded. I had no idea that Tommy Chong was Canadian AND had a club in Vancouver that did improv while strippers were on stage! Also that Cheech's dad was a LAPD cop. These guys were huge when I was a kid and their story is one that can never happen again. A comedy act opening for the Rolling Stones in front of 20,000 people? They had some magic and this movie captured a lot of it. Such a cool story told of these guys. It was a really fun movie that flowed well beginning to end.",False
5,9,First Rockstars of Comedy,StanleykubrikStan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerFirst off I grew up watching Cheech and Chong films at a young age where I should not have been watching them , but i am so glad my dad did not care. These two have been a big part of my life bringing laughter and silliness into it. They shaped my view of what was funny and how it was essential to laugh at the powers at be.Going into this documentary I was not sure what it would cover but they start driving in a car in the desert on their way to the ""joint"". It first starts going over both their childhood lives. It shows the struggles both tommy and cheech faced growing up in areas where they struggled with their cultural backgrounds where people found them to be ""different"" I related to this especially since I had a unique upbringing and loved that they never let it get them down. They would recognize it and move on while not dwelling on their differences but rather embracing it.The film then goes over how the two got into their start into showbiz and how their paths started to cross when cheech first heard a song written by a t.chong and then lived where tommy chong grew up. Cheech then goes to the club tommy chong was performing at and once he saw his girl in a ""mink/rabbit"" coat he knew he was going to join the group. They instantly hit it off and began their long comedy careers grinding it out on stage figuring out what worked even after losing their main comedy group.Eventually they hit pay dirt realizing people related and loved their hippy dope comedy after trying their various acts over time. They begin to embrace hippy and drug comedy and their success followed shortly after. It then goes over their skyrocket to success after much hard work payed off while also seeing the industry take advantage of their work. Even though they did not make much on ""Up in Smoke"" they still do not let it get them down. They brush it off and get onto the next films after they rework their deal saying they still appreciated the opportunity they were given by their producer.The next section goes over the creative and production differences they both had when making the films. I really admire and respect that they cover this topic and do it in a lighthearted but direct way. Other documentary would brush this under the rug but in tommy chong and cheech marin fashion they talk openly about it. This is what makes them so special to me, they have no fear being so open about their differences and still remain friends. Chong makes jokes about how he didn't want to be a background actor or cop in cheech's born in east la video as they both went their separate ways.The end wraps up hilariously as they get out of the car as they were ""driving"" that is revealed to be a car on a flatbed that is filming the doc. They end up finding their ""joint"" destination and the film ends.I highly recommend this to cheech and chong fans looking to learn more about them, and to any comedy fan to understand the rich history it shows. It is sad to see their last film , but great to see them ride off into the smoke filled sunset.",True
6,10,Really good way of understanding their history,LawsonM-7,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was captivated by how the documentary allowed the Cheech & Chong characters to be fully human, rather than merely showcasing their positive past experiences. However, I would have appreciated a farewell to the iconic characters. The documentary's structure perfectly encapsulates the essence of the Cheech & Chong legacy, which has always been about defying conventions. It was fascinating to gain insight into the creative process behind the development of these beloved characters. If I had to describe this movie in a single word, it would be ""desideration"" because every moment of this film was essential to me for society to truly comprehend the journey that transformed a mere idea into generational icons.",False
7,10,Nostalgic Joyride!,drfeelgood-73141,n/a,16/08/2025,"This one is for the fans! I was lucky enough to catch the 4/20 early screening and had a blast! I've always been a fan of their movies but had no idea there was so much history involved with these two! If you're a fan of this iconic duo, this is a must see! It was so awesome to see the backstory and the in depth look at how they became one of the most popular stoner comedy acts of all time! There is a fun little movie going on with the current Cheech and Chong at the same time of the documentary that has some truly funny moments and keeps things running smoothly. Smoke one and check this out!!",False
8,9,Required Viewing,pmtelefon,n/a,16/08/2025,"Director David Bushell does a terrific job with ""Cheech & Chong's Last Movie"". Bushell tells C&C's story in a fresh way. It's funny throughout. It's a great journey as it builds up to a true behind-the-curtain moment. I've read a few reviews that said that ""Last Movie"" is too long. I disagree. I would have liked it to go on longer. ""Last Movie"" is a great watch for any fan of Cheech & Chong. It would also be a good watch for anyone interested in seeing a movie about a long term relationship, whether in entertainment or not. If ""Cheech & Chong's Last Movie"" doesn't win the Oscar for Best Documentary, I won't know what to say. (I saw this movie at AMC Raceway, Westbury, NY.)",False
9,10,A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE!,jacksonf77,n/a,16/08/2025,"I grew up a fan of Cheech and Chong, My parents had the some original albums and I had several of the cassette tapes as a teen. Their comedy is timeless and this is a beautiful story about their crazy journey together. You don't have to be a stoner to enjoy Cheech and Chong's comedy, but it doesn't hurt either! They both take turns telling how everything happened, where they were from, their life as kids, about their parents and what life was like growing up. The things in their lives that led them to find each other and create such an iconic duo. All the good times to all the not so good times, the things that pushed them apart all the way back to them coming together to tell us all about it.",False
10,9,A document with a forgiving heart,voeltgoed,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is a very personal document about fun, smoking weed, friendship, talent, success, and the downfall that came with it. But what stuck with me the most was the brutal honesty and forgiveness that made the journey of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong's life together come full circle.They never backed away from painful confrontations with each other, which at times makes it awkward to watch - but in the end, it explains exactly what happened to their relationship, which was very much like a marriage.The often brilliantly funny footage shown brought back many memories from my past as a big fan, and it also helped put together a lot of the missing pieces of the puzzle - like why some of their films became hilarious classics while others simply didn't work.It all came down to the stage of life they were in at that moment. This film tells the story of friendship of two guys I care about a lot.",False
11,10,The one who knows,BradypauljasonGamble,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm 54 years old and have multiple Cheech and Chong albums, I may have stole them from my Hells Angle father, but they are quality productions. Cheech and Chong have been played and replayed in my in my broken home for years as a youth, they are still laugh out loud funny. Let's talk about this new movie. I loved it. The documentary style format is supercalafragislistticexpealladocious. I was with them the whole time. I felt so much because I listened to everyone's of their albums to many times to mention. I wanted to be in movies in some way because of the albums and their movies, but I digress. This movie is top notch. I brought me in, kept me there, intrigued me, stimulated me, and made me laugh cause in know the bits. I love these guys. I'm so happy the crew made this movie. There were several instances that brought me to extreme emotion, I know. You too are the Bomb. Cheech and Chong is a staple, as a once wanna be actor, I wish I could achieve the impact you both did. Please if you read this, WATCH this movie. You will fall in love if you don't know. If you know, you will feel the things and emotions I experienced. Go see this you won't be disappointed.

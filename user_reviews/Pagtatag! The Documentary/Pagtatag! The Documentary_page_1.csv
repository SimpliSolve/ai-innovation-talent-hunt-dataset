1,8,A Glimpse Behind the Glitz,renaxx,n/a,16/08/2025,"It captures the raw emotions and challenges the group faced during their Pagtatag world tour. For long-time fans or those who joined the fandom during the ""Pagtatag"" era, this film is a goldmine of insights, showing what truly goes on behind the scenes-beyond the smiles, fan service, and bright lights.As someone new to SB19, I found it tough to connect at first since I wasn't familiar with their backstory or past issues. But even so, the film is incredibly inspiring and motivating. It shows how much SB19 loves their craft and their fans, and it humanizes them in a way that makes you respect their hustle even more. Despite the exhaustion and anxiety they face, they keep going because this is what they love, and they want to give back to their supporters. Pablo was a revelation for me-learning that he's not only the leader and chief songwriter but also the company's CEO was mind-blowing. You can only imagine how challenging that must be.While I enjoyed the experience, I wish the film had been longer, as it left me wanting more. Overall, ""Pagtatag"" is a compelling watch, especially if you're an A'TIN or looking to understand what makes SB19 so special.",False
2,8,An Honest Look at SB19's Journey,jecillechiongson,n/a,16/08/2025,"Behind SB19's string of hits and the beginnings of worldwide recognition, this film shows candid and painful moments that fans and casuals do not see.It's not all glitz and glamour. SB19 is not just handsome faces. They put long hours to rehearsing their dance moves and their singing. Their quest to achieve their 100% in spite of unexpected hurdles is something that inspires and challenges each of us.The time to give our best is NOW. There is something in us that we can contribute in our chosen paths -- be it in the arts, etc.A must-watch for those who want to know SB19 more!!! ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­Catch it in cinemas!",False
3,8,The Price of Bringing PPop to the World,negryan,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary officially closes SB19's Pagtatag! Era, during which the group got nearer their goal to get Pinoy music to the mainstream global stage, on their own terms. That the journey almost got derailed by what can only be described as corporate greed was an unintended plot twist. The details were not disclosed, nor were they needed . They are unimportant vis-Ã -vis the bigger picture- SB19's survival and their consequent emergence as a stronger, more determined yet ever humble and grateful group of artists.Yes, that tumultuous name issue is a highlight of the film, but its real core is the boys: their heart, their love for their craft and their fans, their appreciation for the people behind the scenes, and their hunger for and dedication to their ultimate goal of opening the eyes and ears of the world to PPop. Carrying the weight of all these, we see them struggling with anxiety, feeling disappointed with less than stellar performances, powering through physical sickness and exhaustion and, the most gut wrenching part, questioning their life choices.In short, the film showed SB19 to be what they are: humans with superhuman aspirations.",True
4,7,PAGTATAG! DOCUMENTARY by SB19: A Fan's Perspective,lloydsalviejo,n/a,16/08/2025,"Watching the SB19 Pagtatag! Documentary on its first day was an experience I had eagerly anticipated. As a long-time fan, I was thrilled to see the group's journey captured on film. While the film undoubtedly celebrates SB19's global achievements, its execution left room for a more impactful and cohesive narrative.What Could Have Been Stronger:
1. Storytelling Cohesion: The documentary could have benefited from a more cohesive narrative. At times, it felt like a compilation of different vlogs rather than a unified story. While each segment offered interesting insights, the overall flow seemed disjointed, making it harder to connect with the film as a whole.2. Deeper Dive into the Creative Process: One of the major aspects that could have been improved is the depth of exploration into the album's synthesis and the conceptualization of the concert. The glimpses into the making of the album and concert were tantalizing but brief. A more detailed showcase of the creative process would have provided viewers with a greater appreciation of the immense work that went into preparing for the world tour.3. Lack of New Revelations: For those who closely follow SB19, the documentary didn't offer many new revelations. While it was a joy to relive familiar moments, I was hoping for fresh insights or behind-the-scenes content that hadn't already been shared with the fanbase.What Shone Bright:
1. Highlighting Global Stardom: Despite the areas for improvement, the documentary shines in showcasing SB19's global impact. It's clear that they have reached new heights in their careers, becoming arguably the only OPM group to have such a wide reach among foreign audiences. The documentary successfully underscores their achievements, including performing in U. S. states that no other OPM artists have reached.2. Vulnerability and Sacrifices: The raw and honest portrayal of the members' struggles and sacrifices humanizes them, allowing viewers to connect with them on a deeper level. This level of honesty and transparency made me love and appreciate them even more, reminding me why I became a fan in the first place.3. Cultural Significance: While not explicitly stated, the film subtly showcases the cultural impact of SB19. They are not just a boy group but also representatives of Filipino talent and pride on a global stage.Overall
The PAGTATAG! Documentary offers a mixed bag of emotions for fans. While it could benefit from a more structured narrative and new content, it still succeeds in highlighting SB19's incredible journey and their rise to global stardom. For fans like myself, it's a heartfelt reminder of why we continue to support them, flaws and all.",False
5,10,You don't have to be an A'TIN to watch this,vawritesfinally,n/a,16/08/2025,"SB19 Pagtatag! Documentary is an embodiment of every human being who aspire, who dreams to become someone someday. Every one who struggles to reach their goals and do sacrifices can relate to them. It highlights the Pagtatag! WORLD tour, and at the same time, it shows that they are all human. Yes, they're monsters on-stage, they're all smiles in front of the camera, but behind the curtain, they're just 5 simple boys who only want to create music and elevate the Philippine music scene to global stage. They want nothing but to give back to their family, like each one of us. This movie is for us.",False

9,10,CONGRATULATIONS SB19,florafe,n/a,16/08/2025,"My honest review, Jed Regala should feel guilty for not giving his all, it's true that he is not around during most of the filming but as for me I can feel that there are still some good screenshots rather than those that are already posted on YT, if you have watched all SB19 contents in YT you will know what I mean, and seeing those in the movie I have to say Jed what the heck?!, is this your all?! (I BELIEVE THERE ARE MANY GOOD SHOTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE) and even the story telling could have been better (I MEAN IT IS REALLY GOOD ALREADY), but he could have done better if he is around or his team to do the technical shots and what not. ITS VERY RAW TO THE CORE because even in this movie, SB19 gave their all, and is very vulnerable, if not for their very raw reactions this movie will not be felT and so i am giving 10/10 for SB19 genuinity!CONCLUSION WE NEED NETFLIX BECAUSE THERE ARE SCENES THAT ARE WORTH REPLAYING!!!NETFLIX!!!This is my honest reviewWatch it guys the SURPRISE IN THE ENDING!!! We SAW it!!!",False

They are not a big company or even rich company but they are rich in talent and determination. You will find yourself amazed on how they handle things. They just keep on going despite of the uncertainty. If there is one thing you'll get from watching this documentary it is a lesson that there is rainbow after the rain.

12,10,A must watch Docu film,vondluffy,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love this Docu film. I wasn't really suprised when our Mahalima (SB19) announced that they are going to have a docu film coz i know in my heart that they will make one, and then they did. This pagtatag docu showcased their talent on their Pagtatag world tour, and also the struggles of an artist/s when doing tours. You can also see in the docu how much they take care of each other, as family.The one that really hit me hard on this film, was their short hiatus when they weren't allowed to use their group name bcoz of legal battle with their former management.Hardship, struggles will always be there. And im glad they get overcome that hump and move on. Im just glad i get to see them overcame it. Will always root for SB19 on whatever goals they have even as a group and their solo proj as well. Im also glad they have the right team backing them up now.",False

As a viewer, I felt every emotion they wanted to convey to the audience. As someone who followed the group, I can say that this documentary demonstrates the authenticity of SB19.

Salute to SB19 and their team behind for pursuing this docu, because of this I will continue supporting them. I realiazed that problem they encountered was that huge, because the LIHAM was sent directly to his personal mailing address?

18,10,A documentary that shows their victories and struggles in this EP,hgrlutero,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary featured all their success as a group. On how they achieved all the awards and their aspirations as one of the PPop Artists in the Philippines. You'll find yourself laughing at the beginning then the next moment, you'll burst out crying upon their struggles in the Pagtatag Era. It is really hard to establish a name for themselves as a group. The struggles as a group and as an individual will really take a toll on them in the middle part. I found myself crying because I felt their pain.At the end of every storm, there will always be a rainbow and they never failed to show that to the viewers. One of the lessons that I learned in this movie is that after every struggle, it is always the willingness of the person and the support of the people surrounding everyone that is important in uplifting yourself. And once you get a good head start from all the failures, it would start up a fire on you to become better and stronger.Aside from their story, I was amazed as well with the outcome of the documentary. It didn't miss anything. It was genuine. I like how they built up the story, the fall, and the bringing back the aspiration of each members of the group.Just like a lyric song, ""What doesn't kill you makes you stronger"", the SB19 will always be an inspiration and a model to all of us; no matter how hard life gets, survive it, and it will be a story waiting to be told.",False

1,5,activism is not a career choice,howboutthisone_huh,n/a,16/08/2025,"I lived in denver in the 80s so I was curious what this was about since I never heard of this area or 'the holly'. And what it's about, I still don't know as I couldn't threw the whole film w/o tapping out. Sure, I heard of the bloods and crypts and the latin kings and so on and I remember the 80s but just because you grow up poor doesn't mean you join a gang or turn activist and raise money or start a program. Don't have a clue where that comes from. The scene where they interview these young black men on the street. They're not like anyone I ever met in denver or anyone else but they're definitely young men I wouldn't hire to mow my lawn either. You can't live the gang life and expect you get rewarded with a white collar career and they're not products of their neighborhoods but products of themselves and brain washing by the media. Same goes for anyone claiming to be an activist. The road to h is paved with good intentions. I didn't get to the gentrification part but that's part of capitalism. When I lived in dc, I was frequently taking a subway at potomac ave and I saw gentrification first hand. At night, looks like some scary urban street scene from a scorsese film. During the day, look close because the people with money moving into these brownstones and turning them over have the best doors. You won't see them in the neighborhood like shopping or anything but you can tell by the door it's secure and expensive and baricaded behind there are people with money. And they're not all white like the media makes them out to be and they are not tearing down the neighborhood; they don't want to be part of the neighborhood but they want is a box they can afford that belongs to them and nobody else. American home ownership and making money is what it's all about. With all that the black power movement every spouted, what did they ever do to advance that for black people or even reduce black on black crime.",False
2,10,Great film!,crisanta-51599,n/a,16/08/2025,"The documentary is well done, informative, and covers topics that have that have been permeating in not only Denver, but various cities around the country. Through it's storytelling, it provides the deeper look into how greed and gentrification goals have made way for corruption, violence, and negative political influence to thrive in the area.It dares the audience to consider how some of what's happening in the Holly neighborhood may be happening in other historically black neighborhoods throughout the country.If you haven't seen this film already, you need to watch it. It's an absolute must see!",False
3,10,A must watch!,imaniroselle,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great story.telling! This documentary told a complex story and wasn't shy of touching on tough conversations and topics. I recommend everyone to give it a watch. You will learn so much. These are real life issues. We have to talk about them. We have to hear these stories in order to learn and understand. If you didn't know about the Holly neighborhood, you discover that through the film makers work of art. 10/10 would recommend.To incite change we can't ignore the corruption that exists in inner cities or with institutions claiming to protect and advocate for the needs of our youth. This film is a great step in the right direction.",False
4,10,"Meticulous original reporting, raw and powerful story, expertly told",jphinnyc,n/a,16/08/2025,"This must-see documentary is a riveting, unforgettable look at the heartbreak and corruption, entrenched pathologies and dueling interests that enable the cycle of violence in one urban Denver neighborhood to roll on and on. The plot twists and danger, stubborn hope and cynicism in play, the world weariness of people who doggedly continue to try to improve things anyway (often at great risk for their safety), illustrate why problems are so deep rooted and change is elusive. Terrance Roberts has put himself at the intersection of all of it - a maelstrom of gang members, police informants, neighborhood kingpins, developers and the local cops and prosecutors.",False
5,10,Profound movie! Must watch!!,christabelleguevara,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is very profound and is an eye opener for what's happening to our youth in Denver. I'm proud to see Terrance Roberts is running for mayor. It's time for real leadership and change in this city and me and my family are supporting his campaign.Hopefully now we can talk about what youth of color are going through in America. Terrance Roberts has been fighting for justice for decades and now he can fight for justice as the next Mayor of Denver. There should be a reality show around his campaign as we speak, someone in Hollywood is dropping the ball and missing out on historical content.",False
6,10,"Powerful, MUST-SEE film!",ScottduPont,n/a,16/08/2025,"I got to see ""The Holly"" recently in Los Angeles and was blown away. It was a riveting , thought provoking and inspiring movie that I highly recommend people check out. No spoilers here, but there were a few twists I did not see coming. Terrence Roberts as well as Julian Rubenstein (the Director) truly inspired me with the journey they have been though for so many years. This movie takes you along their wild ride and the journey that they both went on and it will not dissapoint. This film is an Academy Award contender for sure. I am telling everyone I know to go watch this film! A powerful, riveting story that I am glad was told!",False
7,10,Great Documentary with Great Characters and Storytelling,carterbaskin,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis documentary is very well done, I was kept wondering what was going to happen to the main character, Terrence, for the entirety of the film. It is structured in a way that makes it impossible to form an opinion on Terrence until after the movie is done. I believe that this is done very much in service to the message of the film. Starting out, I did not trust Terrence and the claims that he was making at all, it seemed like an open and shut case of senseless violence. However, as the story wears on and we see the Director uncovering more and more about what happened on the day of the shooting, you start to see where things don't align and gradually build up a trust for Terrence. I think that allowing this trust to get built up is largely what makes the message so impactful and is the reason why I believe and trust Terrence as a good man and activist.",True
8,10,"Absolutely riveting, heartbreaking, terrifying",borisfishman,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHard to do it justice in a summary, but it was impossible to stop watching. It tells an incredible complex and inconclusive story with a tremendous amount of nuance, power, and insight. These stories are happening around us all the time, and God knows they're not going to get the nuance they deserve from politicians, and even, often, from the media. Terrance Roberts is a heroic, complicated man, and Julian Rubinstein was just as fearless and dogged in making this film as Terrance was in trying to revitalize his neighborhood on the neighborhood's terms. That was perhaps the most revealing and shocking part of the film -- its revelation of the way external political and economic forces who value power and money over people edge those people out. It's a heartbreaking story even if those forces were not complicit in the attack that nearly killed Terrance, as this film implies they were.",True
9,9,The Holly Is AMAZING,friendedcash,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerTerrance Roberts was a fascinating figure, evoking an initial sense of unease in me when I first learned about the Holly shooting. However, as the documentary peeled back the layers of his life such as his childhood, his struggles, and his transformation-my perspective shifted. His fearless approach to sharing his story, particularly regarding gang activism in Denver, made him even more compelling. When his trial arrived, he remained unwavering in his confidence, standing firm in his actions. By the end, I found myself rooting for him. Learning that the man he shot had killed his daughter filled me with rage-Terrance had every right to defend himself. This case revealed how media narratives can be manipulated, omitting crucial context and painting an incomplete picture. To the police, Terrance was an anti-hero, but to the children of Holly, he was a protector. I fully trust his dedication to change, though next time, he might want to keep his gun in the truck. The use of b-roll during narration helped us, as viewers, piece together the story in our way, creating a deeper human connection to Terrance. The repeated news footage of the shooting, zooming in closer each time on Hasan falling to the ground, made the moment feel more raw and intense. Likewise, the shots of Bloods approaching Holly in groups amplified the tension, making it easier to grasp the immediate threat Terrance faced. The film's commentary also underscored the media's role in shaping narratives around gang violence-what gets shown, what gets left out, and how stories are twisted. In Terrance's case, the media misrepresented critical details, including the placement of the knife, failing to provide real investigative depth. This highlights a broader issue: journalism's responsibility to tell the truth and the dangers of misinformation. Many people take the news at face value, unaware of its biases and gaps.",True
10,10,Shadows of Change,adides,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe Holly is a gripping and thought-provoking film that explores the challenges of grassroots activism in America. The story follows Terrance Roberts, a community leader who confronts the harsh realities of systemic oppression while working to create change. Through his journey, the film highlights the personal and political struggles that come with activism. It's both inspiring and sobering, showing that true change requires not only courage but also the willingness to face difficult truths and contradictions in society. A must-see for activists and anyone interested in understanding the complexities of social justice movements.",True

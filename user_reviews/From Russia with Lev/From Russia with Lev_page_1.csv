1,9,Facts matter. The truth has never been more urgent.,MediaFanatic,n/a,16/08/2025,"From Russia with Lev is a documentary based on solid evidence, exposing Trump's efforts, alongside Rudy Giuliani, to create false accusations against Joe and Hunter Biden.Lev Parnas, once a trusted Trump insider, reveals secret deals and the push to remove America's ambassador to Ukraine, all to advance Trump's personal goals, rather than for the good of the United States. The documentary supports these claims with recordings and concrete evidence.The film highlights how Trump's influence spread into the justice system and media, with Fox News aiding Trump in a disinformation campaign, without any attempt to fact-check.Parnas's shift from confidant to whistleblower is presented clearly, with his wife Svetlana playing a key role in protecting important evidence. The meeting between Parnas and Hunter Biden at the end adds a heartfelt touch to the larger political story. You see firsthand how disinformation campaigns destroy lives.This is more than just a political story. It's a reminder of how easily democracy can be undermined by lies and corruption. Every American should watch it before voting.",False
2,8,Important Content! Get rid of cheap stills & music,fireflyjournals,n/a,16/08/2025,"I was fascinated watching this and watched twice. The information and storytelling is wonderful. I just wish music choices were less dramatic. Stills of Trump and Guiliani are over the top. No need to use exaggerated moments. Takes away from the validity of the film which are powerful and need to be presented as cleanly as possible.Honestly I wasn't prepared to like Parnas as much as I did but he brought all the receipts. Pics, videos and corroborated events all made this a serious documentary despite Parnas' thug-ness. And his wife has such a poignant part in the telling of this story. I hope this film can be edited so we don't loose right wingers who'll want to dismiss this as Fox style trope. This is an important film.",False
3,9,Important historical document,icreate-93312,n/a,16/08/2025,"1. A Deeply Personal Journey
""From Russia with Lev"" offers a captivating glimpse into Lev Parnas's mind, forcing viewers to grapple with the nuances of his narrative. His firsthand account is undeniably compelling, yet it raises essential questions about trust and sincerity. Is this a story of genuine redemption, or just another chapter in his ongoing con game?2. Redemption or Manipulation?The film successfully immerses us in Parnas's perspective, but it also leaves us with the task of discerning his true intentions. Are his apologies and reflections authentic, or simply a strategic play to reshape public perception? This ambiguity is what makes the film both engaging and contentious.3. A One-Sided Lens
While critics might label the documentary as 'one-sided,' it's crucial to remember that it presents Parnas's narrative-an important, albeit limited, viewpoint. The film excels in showcasing his journey without overtly pushing a political agenda, allowing audiences to draw their own conclusions.4. Provoking Thought
The absence of explicit judgment from the filmmakers allows viewers to explore the complexities of Parnas's character and motives. Are we witnessing a man truly transformed, or are we merely seeing a rehearsed performance? This thought-provoking ambiguity invites deeper reflection on themes of accountability and redemption.5. Historical Context
Despite its singular focus, ""From Russia with Lev"" serves as a significant historical document, encapsulating a pivotal moment in recent political history. Parnas's narrative is bolstered by tangible evidence, providing a unique lens through which we can analyze the events that transpired.6. Audience Responsibility
Ultimately, the film challenges us as viewers to engage critically with the material. It emphasizes the importance of questioning and contextualizing what we see, urging us not to take Parnas's claims at face value but to consider the broader implications of his story.7. High Production Values
Aside from the compelling narrative, the documentary boasts impressive production values. The careful crafting of the film enhances Parnas's storytelling, making his journey not only a personal reflection but also a visually engaging experience that merits attention.8. Epilogue
Maybe someday there will be some other bookend epic film that outlines and scrutinizes all the players across all the nuances of that time, but the film ""From Russia with Lev"" has obvious historical value as it is, presently offering in Lev's own words a sweeping overview of all the players and connections in his immediate orbit, in his tale recapping a particularly peculiar juncture in time, and even though this is simply one person's point of view --- his --- his telling of his own experience --- it is under-girded by his extensive collection of proof via supporting photos, documents and 'receipts' (the very documents that were used to indict him and send him to prison). As such, the film is an important document in that it captures directly his own words, the subtle details of his expressions, his posture, inflection, the words of his wife, peers and lawyer and therefore it stands as a prima facia document with which to measure and try to extend the understanding of some of the historical facts again, recollected in Lev's own words, of the course of events of this era, and as such, cannot be so easily dismissed. History will ultimately sort, judge, balance and contradict what may be our current assumptions and understanding of these events.Arch Angelus Sturaitis.",False
4,n/a,"Filled with details, insider Lev's exposé hits hard",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Directed by Billy Corben, this documentary project from MSNBC host Rachel Maddow provides a cogent, intentionally one-sided detailing of corruption on a massive scale, centered upon and incriminating Donald Trump and his associates, notably Rudy Giuliani. Obviously, MAGA cultists and collaborators including the folks at Fox News won't profess to believe any of it, but it becomes clear that good bad-guy Lev Parnas has the receipts and ""in the room where it happened"" credibility to tell an important story that is highly relevant now that Trump is competitive (if self-destructive) in the upcoming election attempting to regain the presidency.Corben's approach overwhelms the viewer with facts, endless testimony from especially Lev and his wife, plus satirical jabs against Trump and his cronies that I found immersive: mainly persuasive but also at times over the top. Like Michael Moore, he is a truth seeker, truth teller and entertainer, but perhaps a more traditional docu format would carry more weight. Yet the finale of Lev meeting and coming to terms with one of his chicanery's victims, Hunter Biden, is powerful.",False
5,10,Every single American should watch this at least once!,ksmestrada-492-49762,n/a,16/08/2025,"Brava to Rachel Maddow once again! I am so incredibly grateful for all the documentaries, books, articles and newscasts that have helped us all make sense of how Trump rose to power with the help of Putin and numberous criminal activities by Trump and his associates. All this craziness is tragic, criminal and putting us all at risk! We must all fight hard to get Harris/Walz elected! This election is truly a fight for right and for our democracy! Those of us who see the truth of who Trump really is and the threat he is to our country and to our world must help those that sadly been sucked down the rabbit hole into the cult of Trump!",False
6,10,"Trump, The gangster president and his men.",michaelhartert,n/a,16/08/2025,"This great film is going to be one of the finest explanations of the Trump rein of corruption during his time in American politics. The amount of time it must have taken to gather all the information blows my mind! It is so well put together to show the story of what Trump and his weaponization of the DOJ did to destroy our trust in journalism. The Fox news propaganda that was spread in the name of protecting Trump is just so egregious it should be an un coalification event for their moniker of: ""Fair & Balanced!! I think it's great that the truth be shown of their involvement in the decline of trust in our government and society! Facts matter, and Rachelle has always been a beacon of trust for me to navigate during this dreadful period of American history!",False
7,10,American History In Your Face!,rgator-88824,n/a,16/08/2025,This documentary and the information it contains will be a part of American History that will be written about for decades to come.Trump and MAGA are totally exposed in this documentary as Putin's puppets. The great thing about this movie is that it has all the receipts to back it up.Lev Parnas is the hero/anti-hero and he was a key figure behind the firing of America's ambassador to Ukraine. Parnas was doing Rudy Giuliani's dirty work within Ukraine pulling strings to get dirt on Hunter Biden.This movie is very well made and it is something that every American ought to watch at least once.,False
8,10,An Eye-Opening Journey Into the Trump Machine,jeristuart,n/a,16/08/2025,"From Russia with Lev is a riveting exploration of political manipulation and betrayal. Director Billy Corben expertly guides us through Lev Parnas's shocking story-how he became a pawn in Trump's desperate attempt to discredit the Bidens and was discarded when the mission yielded nothing. The film masterfully portrays the tension of a man trapped by loyalty to a leader who sought to suppress the truth. Parnas's wife emerges as a quiet hero, saving vital evidence from destruction. Hunter Biden's grace and humility at the end is an emotional crescendo, leaving no one unaffected. A powerful debut production by Rachel Maddow, this film is a winner in every sense.",False
9,10,Stunning journalism. Trump's corruption exposed as never before.,chatwithmichaelmac,n/a,16/08/2025,"Finally a clear, concise, factual expose of the appalling corruption that infests the trump empire at every level.This documentary is destined to be 21st. Century touchstone of investigative journalism and a worthy successor to Woodward and Bernstein's All the President's Men of last century.Trump's appalling playbook of winning at any and all costs is laid bare in this outstanding film. So too are sycophants like Fox News and the Republicans who lied and lied and lied to keep him in power.This documentary digs deep and names names of a wide spectrum of truly evil characters in the Trumpsphere and by doing so demonstrates a high level of bravery.Highly recommended.",False
10,10,Trump's Ukraine extortion attempt told from the perspective of Trump's main footsoldier in the scheme,stephenreedcpa,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film is very well done.It puts a spotlight back on what lead to Trump's first impeachment. He tried (and failed) to extort the government of Ukraine to officially announce that they were opening a corruption investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden (even though they did not have any evidence of that), to benefit his own 2020 presidential campaign, or Trump and the United States government would withhold economic and military support to Ukraine and that the administration would withdraw Zelensky's invitation to the white house that had been previously set up.It is told from the perspective of Lev Parnas, one of Trump's main footsoldiers in the extortion scheme that went behind the back of official diplomatic channels. His claims are backed up by mountains of digital evidence he shared with the production team and presented throughout the documentary.These actions ultimately led to Trump's first articles impeachment.Really shows the warped, criminal/mob boss instinct that pervaded Trump's decision making process as president.",False
11,10,A MUST WATCH DOCUMENTARY,racookespa,n/a,16/08/2025,"EVERY AMERICAN should watch this documentary BEFORE they vote in November! Some of the revelations surprised even me, and I pride myself on being well-informed. This documentary was extremely well done and provides indisputable evidence of blatant corruption on the part of Trump and Rudy! More important, it not only proves Trump is a danger to American democracy and to the World, it also proves he was NOT acting on behalf of this country, so his actions should NOT qualify for immunity! In fact, he, along with ALL those who enabled him and covered for him, belong in prison! Well done Rachel Maddow! This is Oscar worthy material!",False
12,10,"No big surprises here, yet still eye opening.",joelmarks-70405,n/a,16/08/2025,"Gripping from beginning to end. Does Lev Parnes have a checkered past. Absolutely. That's what gave him the credentials to be recruited by Giuliani on behalf of Trump. Is Parnes speaking the truth about Trump's motives and what went down. Absolutely. Everything he describes lines up perfectly with the Trump playbook we've come to know very well over the past 8 years. His wife's sincerity and intelligence and his dedication to his family are very convincing. Taking into account January 6th, the actions described in this documentary and many many other devious actions and statements by Trump and his co-conspirators, it boggles the mind that he's still seemingly supported by 40% of our population.",False
13,10,Revealing!!,crazypretty,n/a,16/08/2025,What a great job Rachel Maddow and her team did to create this doc! It was an absolutely necessary story to be told!! The depth and breadth of Lev and Igor's involvement in the schemes and games the Trump campaign played is mind blowing. I tip my had to Parnas for being brave enough to step through his own shame of his past behaviors to speak out now for the evils he has seen in the Trump administration and those who circle around Trump. There's such a need for these stories to be told and I'm super grateful this one has has light shed on it.Trump is gonna hate this so much and I love that! It's Brilliant!,False
14,10,"A Must Watch Before November 6th, 2024.",mikemover-94982,n/a,16/08/2025,"Whether you're a Republican, Democrat or Independent doesn't matter. If you're an American who either votes or knows someone who does, this is a must see before November 6th, 2024.This documentary shows how the inner circles and workings in the Trump administration churned along. How easily policy was and could be manipulated and the lengths to which Trump and the people close to him would go to continue holding onto the power that they had.It is also a study that anyone with a geopolitical interest should see. It shows how mis-information begins, spreads, and is echoed and those that are involved.In other words, THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR EVERY AMERICAN!",False
15,10,THIS NEEDS TO BE WATCHED BY ALL AMERICANS!,yvtsggzyr,n/a,16/08/2025,Watching this documentary really saddened me at how easily we are handing our ideals over to Putin and the most extreme in our country. Every time we allow Trump to get away with his words/vile actions we lose a little bit of America. The fact that 70 million people will continue to vote for this man as he actively try's to ruin our democracy is insane. Trump and all his cronies need to be jailed and held accountable. Please release this documentary on every streaming platform before Election Day. It may not change the mind of his cult members but the rest of us need to be ready and we need to be LOUD with our votes.,False
16,10,Nothing will surprise-everything is still shocking and saddening,lawrenceb56,n/a,16/08/2025,"Think you are immune to being drawn into a cult? Apparently so did Lev. The story of this man's trip down the rabbit hole and the damage he did to harm others at the behest of Guilianni and Trump is breathtaking. His return to the world through honest soul searching and deep remorse gives us cause for hope. Trump voter? There is a way back to reality. But just ask Lev-it won't be painless. Admitting you've been duped is difficult when those in charge of the duping have known all along how to play on your weaknesses, but the truth will out and stepping back into daylight after paying you dues has given this man a second chance. Good for him.",False
17,10,Highly Recommend This Movie,brehm-89771,n/a,16/08/2025,"From Russia with Lev is terrific. Thoroughly entertaining, funny, relevant, a must watch! This film is both compelling and irreverent at the same time. Trust me, you will love it. Lev is an affable, irreverent character who you want to hang with and scold at the same time. Billy Corbin and Rachel Maddow need to make more films together. Lev's wife Svetlana steals the show with her honest assessment of the situation. She both throws shade at the characters and her husband, while showing her love and support for this flawed but lovable guy. Do not miss this film, you can thank me later! Pour yourself a cold one and enjoy!!",False
18,10,Lev Parnas is a Flawed and Compelling Character,EnnuiDisallowed,n/a,16/08/2025,"Wow. I knew the history of Lev Parnas and I knew the facts of his actions working with Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump. Yet this documentary does something that we all need to pay attention to ... especially at this moment in time. The show lays out Lev's actions in a straight forward and concise manner. There is even a little humor thrown into the mix. If you have a chance, please watch ""From Russia With Lev"". You owe it to yourself and to the U. S. to understand how Lev helped to orchestrate a great deception on the U. S. public and he did so at the urging of Rudy Giuliani and Donald Trump. Ultimately, Rudy and Don threw Lev to the wolves and he took the fall for them.",False
19,10,Crazy,austin_250,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm a 25-year-old male who pays only occasional attention to the news and is an avid listener of Joe Rogan. I had no idea the Trump administration was so obviously and deeply corrupt. This documentary would be a massive shock to anyone who primarily gets their news from independent, center-right sources. I used to believe Matt Taibbi, who called Russian collusion the 'hoax of the century,' but this documentary completely changed my perspective. I didn't realize that someone with a background in the mafia and ties to Russian oligarchs was working closely with Trump, influencing American politics and pushing baseless theories that would later appear as front-page news on Fox. It really exposed how tightly controlled right-wing information ecosystems are.",True
20,10,"Do yourself a favor, experience Lev's 💜",estelle58,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have been catching as many interviews as I possibly could with Lev Parnas as the guest.I remember when I first heard of Lev, which was when he and Igor were arrested. They appeared as some smarmy underworld thugs doing the bidding of the corrupt Rudy Guilliani and of course, donald trump.Then Lev was released from prison and began to show who he really is. And I saw what many others also discovered, a soft spoken, gentle soul, who got taken in by the lies, and believed totally, that donald trump was out for the good of this country, instead of completely out for himself.We all make mistakes, but it takes a really, really, strong person to admit one's horrendous mistakes to the world. It takes an even stronger person to admit in person, that whom you have personally hurt, ask for heartfelt, tear inducing forgiveness, again, as the whole world watches.So do yourself a favor, and allow this gem of a man, warm your heart, like he has mine. Time spent with Lev, is definitely time well spent.",True
21,10,Proves why Trump was Impeached-First Time!,dljbishop,n/a,16/08/2025,"Knew Trump was Corrupt ""from his days of cheating Companies"" in NYC. Yes I'm that old!! Trump's Scheme was: Pay his bills, UNTIL the project was completed. Then casually STOPPED PAYING the rest of the BILL. Trump had about 20 Slimy (Mobsters) for Attorneys. Just like he is doing in 2024!! Sometimes it was 10 Years before the trial would even start: but by then the Company that Built his Buildings went bankrupt first! So Trump's Case was withdrawn. A little scary and gave me goose bumps to actually ""see"" all the evidence against DonOld. Learned a lot from Lev's Wife. So honest and ""down to earth"" reality. All U. S. Voters need to read before Voting in 2024!",False

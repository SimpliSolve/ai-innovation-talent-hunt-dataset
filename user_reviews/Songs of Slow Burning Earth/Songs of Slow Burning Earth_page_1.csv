1,10,What is war for the average Ukrainian,romashkaiya,n/a,16/08/2025,"War for ordinary peaceful Ukrainians is sirens, constant sirens, sounds of explosions in the background, broken windows and doors, shells under your entrance, wounded on three sides of the house opposite, a broken tram at the stop, a burnt-out bazaar, planes and helicopters directly above your roof, an explosion at the bus stop next to the cafe where you buy coffee. And killed, wounded, unfortunate people who lost their relatives and friends. And what is the war in Ukraine for you? I remember 02/24/2022 very well. These days are forever etched in my memory. Mattresses on the floor, broken phone screen, because she was nervous and dropped it. Cold, very cold tap water. My knuckles still break when I wash them in cold water. And fear, constant fear that the next rocket will hit the window. And a child is huddled next to him, he is even more afraid. And on the other hand, the grandmother, she just started to forget what war is and here again she is War. It's scary, it hurts, it's not normal.",False

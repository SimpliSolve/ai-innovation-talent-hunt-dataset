1,8,Two good guys from a Bellingham basement,unityforall,n/a,16/08/2025,"It's inspiring to see that two casual but committed musicians can make it big and bring their friends along on the journey. This film differs from other band documentaries in that it doesn't glorify the personalities and gives credit to the larger production team and dozen performers who make up the Odesza live experience. Like their music, the movie is crafted with love and attention to detail, showing the power of optimism and connection. While there's nothing like being at a live show, watching this feels like being there!True to Odesza's work ethic, the production quality and sound clarity were top-notch. I'm glad I saw it in a cinema and can't wait to see them live! Thanks to Clay and Harrison for representing Seattle and the PNW well.",False
2,10,What an ecstatic experience,junidougherty,n/a,16/08/2025,"I fell in love with Odesza's music in 2016 and I'm still deeply in love, all these years their music has been helping me go through ups and downs, I love it beyond words! As a fan, this is a Super good documentary(ish) film, the stage visual effects were incredible, some background stories really added some depth to the songs, we cried a few moments during the film, I'll definitely go to their shows when they come to Europe, I'll go probably multiple times, their music is the only thing in this world that can make me feel euphoric, it touches my soul deeply, I'll be so emotional and tearing up uncontrollably at their show.",False
3,6,Laying it on thick,sambryans,n/a,16/08/2025,"Was an over-the-top scmaltzy production feeding the ego of the lead musician as he pondered the question of his own mortality whilst desperately trying to convey emotion and meaning by focusing on shallow superficial Californian girls crying at the sound of the music. Was expecting more behind the scenes footage, instead the visual artist featured for 10 seconds, the lighting crew and stage production maybe 2 minutes?....When you watch this you'd think everybody is just crying at Odesza gigs. Disappointing. Although I've been quite a fan of Odessa's music I have to say I actually like them a little less now :p.",False

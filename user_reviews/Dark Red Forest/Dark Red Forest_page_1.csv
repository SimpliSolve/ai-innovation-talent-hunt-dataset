2,9,Beautiful and sometimes difficult film,theemailofrichard,n/a,15/08/2025,"This film offers a unique window into a fascinating part of the world and a complex culture. Beautifully filmed, warts and all. Both touching and harrowing, it captures the devout dedication these women have to their world and their enlightenment. Can't help but wonder if the hardship they endure ultimately pays off for them or for humanity, but ultimately that's for them to decide I suppose.",False

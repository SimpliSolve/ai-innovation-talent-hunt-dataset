1,6,El castillo,CinemaSerf,n/a,17/08/2025,"I wonder if this isn't quite a good example of being careful what you wish for? Justina Olivo served as housekeeper for her mistress until she died, and was rewarded with ownership of her ramshackle mansion house on the Argentinean Pampa. She is determined to make a go of it, and with her daughter Alexia they try to keep the place running. They have cattle to bring in some cash, but with the humidity and the frequent rainfall the roof is leaking and the building is beginning to reach a point of no return. The remoteness of the location is also taking it's toll on Justina as her daughter starts to feel restless and she has to come to terms with the loneliness this existence delivers. It's perhaps that loneliness that's best portrayed in this rather pace-less documentary. Locked off cameras and telephone imagery illustrate quite effectively just how cut off they are and at how relentless their routine of maintenance is, but after a while that becomes a little soporific to watch. From a practical perspective, though there seems an abundance of electrical power, the plumbing has long since bitten the dust and so her quality of life isn't the best, either. Justina doesn't want to sell it, but even if she did - could she sell up? Would anyone want to buy it? This provides quite an interesting observation for about forty minutes, but once it's made it's point then it does rather repeat itself. That does emphasise her feelings of ennui but it might also induce a certain similar feeling in the audience too.",False
2,9,A Refreshing Reminder of the Power of good directing,patrick-553-787683,n/a,17/08/2025,"""El Castillo"" is a truly remarkable film, showcasing the exceptional talents of director Mart√≠n Benchimol. The film's pacing is masterfully crafted, creating an immersive experience that is so convincing it feels almost like a documentary. The acting is superbly authentic, with each performance feeling grounded and entirely true to life. The story itself is slowly crafted and developed, leading the audience on a heartwarming journey that is both engaging and real. This is the kind of film we need more of: one that pushes the boundaries of what cinema can achieve and leaves a lasting impact on its audience by its realness. Highly recommended!",False

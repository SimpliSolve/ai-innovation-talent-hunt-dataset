1,6,Getting worse,td_username,n/a,16/08/2025,First one was something different / art creating new worlds. These are definitely getting worse. This one is what the Grammy performances should be like but with advertising. Most of the artists are outdated where the first one had travis Scott Migos etc.,False
2,8,Inclusivity,eenright-92782,n/a,16/08/2025,"Shout of to including all body types, races, and sexual orientations in this show. It feels good to watch diversity being celebrated.",False
3,10,ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥This was Fiyah!!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥,chrizonk,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI love this fashion show/music video. It has everything all shapes, sizes, skin tones, genders, sexual orientations, young to seasoned, from the known to the unknown, etc... etc. This video covered it. The music and the dancing was on point with fashion. I couldn't take my eyes off this video and stop saying ""YAAASSSS!"" Rihanna you did the damn thang! Singer, actress, fashion designer, and businesswoman... You get it Madame Fenty! For all those people wanting to know what she has been up to and MAD cause you haven't put anything new music out... PFFT chill, enjoy the video, she has been busy.",True
4,10,It's not for the Victoria Secrets Stans.,harlequinofmars,n/a,16/08/2025,SpoilerIf your version of fashion and beauty is cookie cutter women starving themselves in prison labor made lingerie then don't watch this.This is for fans of fashion that understand the world is diverse and evolving. That beauty isn't dictated by conglomerates but by the people that live in this diverse world.The clothing is geared towards rap and hip hop culture and the cinematography is aimed towards fans of heavy and artistic Lighting.,True
5,10,Loved it,alwayzaladyc,n/a,16/08/2025,"Loved this show and I'm 60. The only person that was missing was a true gray haired person. Age. Just because we are older doesn't mean we don't like to look and feel good as best we can. The diversity on the show was awesome ,the show was well put together. Diversity aside, it was captivating. The choreography was on point. The coolest thing I've seen in a long time. Keep going Ms Rhianna. You got it goin on!C.",False
6,1,Dreadful........,dlr-06705,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI'm obviously missing something here, as the 'collection' just looked cheap and tacky and very 'strip club'!The only likeable thing about the show, was the fact that the garments were worn by an amazingly diverse group of individuals.",True
7,9,It's the inclusivity that matters.,shanlouisemurray,n/a,16/08/2025,"I can't explain why but every year when I get round to watching these shows it makes me so emotional. I understand that it's a fashion show, so if people don't like the items being shown then that's fine as everyone has different taste. But what Rihanna brings to the table every single year is so much better than a standard boring runway show. She incorporates the collection in such a fun way it's always exciting to watch, she has completely redesigned what it means to have a runway fashion show.The INCLUSIVITY!! That's the stuff that makes me emotional. Seeing so many different people wearing her garments, so many different skin tones, weights, body types, genders, sexualities and disabilities etc. It's so heartwarming to witness. The way the show is put together is so well done, the visuals are always amazing.Every year I'm left waiting for the next one!",False
8,1,What is this nonsense?,K1MCity,n/a,16/08/2025,"Im confused. It's not enjoyable, there's no clothes or anything if ever wear it anyone would really... What is this nonsense?",False
9,1,What a waste of my time,carmen_ignat2006,n/a,16/08/2025,Wow!!! Is that what is called a fashion show these days???Such ugly and weird people and dreadful clothing pieces or whatever those are. Horrible but hey that's what popular means these days.,False

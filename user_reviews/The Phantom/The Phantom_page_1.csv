1,8,Justice gone wrong,purple_tx_dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a case where the justice system failed because they wanted to close the case. 75% of the evidence was never put into the case and used, the actual man that committed the crime had been on the radar of a CCPD for yrs, but just didn't listen to him. Me being a Texan, it hit home as a case of one of the worst injustices we could have done.",False
2,6,Mistaken identity?,Sleepin_Dragon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA beautiful young woman is killed during a robbery, it isn't long before a man is arrested, and quickly charged, sentenced to death, he protests his innocence until he's executed.It's an interesting story, a real life tragedy, I did enjoy it, but if I'm totally honest I thought it was an overlong production. There is a habit with such documentaries to over produce them, and that is again the case here, it does feel a little patchy at times.The story is really interesting, I found some of the insights very thought provoking, you get a sense of what's going on back then.If you're for or against the death penalty, this will make you think and question, was an innocent man publicly murdered?Overall, interesting, the cutaways detracted somewhat, 6/10.",True
3,6,"The story deserves a better, lengthier, and more detailed presentation. [+59%]",arungeorge13,n/a,16/08/2025,"While the makers only manage to scrape the surface of this deeply unsettling murder case, it is definitely a story that needs to be told. In a state known to hand out a lot of death penalties (Texas i.e.) especially to its citizens of color, the case in question is undoubtedly the most outrageous one. The first half of the documentary marches ahead like it wants to paint a straightforward, somewhat lazy picture of Carlos De Luna as a vicious murderer, and then proceeds to turn that story on its head, ripping apart every detail piece-by-piece.For what its worth, The Phantom is best enjoyed when you know as little about the case as possible. In fact, don't even read its one-line description. The second half dives into a much darker space, when a second character is linked to the incident. However, the holes are aplenty. Even the makers struggle to piece the whole thing together. It's done haphazardly at best, but the very fact that an innocent person may have been executed without question is extremely disturbing to digest.",False
4,6,"Interesting subject, bad editing",Calicodreamin,n/a,16/08/2025,An interesting true crime story that was short but also kind of scary. The interviews were relevant but sometimes off topic. The video editing was poor and the first five minutes down right disorienting.,False
5,7,looking in a mirror,ferguson-6,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerGreetings again from the darkness. Will the real murdering Carlos please come forward? Unfortunately it's too late for the other one. Store clerk Wanda Lopez was murdered in Corpus Christi, Texas one night in 1983. The recording of her 911 call is brief, but documents her identifying the assailant as Hispanic, and noting that he was brandishing a knife ... the knife the man would use to take her life.After a short manhunt, the Corpus Christi police found a shirtless 21 year old Carlos DeLuna hiding under a car. He was identified by eye witnesses and immediately arrested on suspicion of murder. From the beginning, DeLuna was adamant about his innocence and claimed he knew the actual murderer, Carlos Hernandez, DeLuna's doppelganger.Patrick Forbes is a documentarian whose previous topics included Brexit, the human heart, and WikiLeaks. This time he walks us through the steps of a criminal system that executed the wrong man. He uses interviews, archival footage, and documentation from the police reports and trial. We hear from the District Attorney, the defense attorney, Wanda Lopez's attorney, and the eyewitnesses. The original Medical Examiner (ME) even reads aloud from his report. Forbes presents the facts of the case so that we understand how such a travesty occurred.The evidence that convicted Carlos DeLuna was limited to the eyewitnesses and a wad of cash in his pocket. No fingerprints. No blood on his clothes. No DNA. Somehow this was enough to not just find him guilty, but also sentence him to death. DeLuna testified at his own trial and claimed under oath it was Carlos Hernandez - a man the Corpus Christi police were unable to find, despite his significant (and violent) criminal record.We hear from the reporter who received correspondence from DeLuna while he was incarcerated. She recounts their exchanges and notes that she was a somewhat green reporter who had no real idea how to handle this. We also hear from the Chaplain who details the issues that occurred during the execution, and from DeLuna's estranged brother who tried to assist. Mr. Forbes is efficient and precise in the structure of the documentary based on the Columbia Law School research paper, ""Los Tocayos Carlos"". Is the criminal justice flawed or outright broken - for those wrongfully accused and convicted, the answer is simple.Opening in theaters on July 2, 2021.",True
6,6,Interesting,juan_moran,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerInteresante hasta el final donde colocan lo de las muertes por ser personas de color, CARLOS HERNÁNDEZ TAMBIÉN ERA LATINO, OSEA NO TIENE SENTIDO .",True
7,7,"Good but a little boring, sorry to say",dp1dp,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThey tell the story in the beginning. Then they tell it again somewhat towards the end. They didn't really seem to add much in the second telling. Pacing was a little slow and disjointed. Not executed (no pun intended) well.Story was interesting. I could see how one could easily argue they got the wrong person. Two people called it out for being racist. I don't get it. I think it was a little more about police incompetence, laziness, and desire to close a case. It's not inconceivable to me that they could have made a mistake in the 80s. It happens today, even with technology. The two people in question looked very similar. The guy they arrested had no blood on him even though it was a very bloody scene. He has no history of such violence or even using a knife, it's absurd to say ""a criminal is a criminal"". The other guy has a ton of history of violence with a knife that looks exactly like the one at the scene of the crime. But this guy who was arrested also wasn't behaving so smart: was that because he was afraid or in an emotional state?Based on only the information in the documentary, I can see that it's extremely easy to accept they made a mistake. Who knows what information is missing. I am already someone who is against the death penalty, so this didn't change my view on it. I'm not sure what they wanted me to get out of the documentary. That police make mistakes and that they sometimes put the wrong guy in jail and don't really seem to care? No need, I know it's true, even if it's rare.All in all, it was fine for the casual viewer but not super compelling because they didn't structure the documentary super well. I'm sure there are worse documentaries, though.",True
8,10,I'm deeply disturbed of how innocents' lives are destroyed and taken,rayanalswilem,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm deeply disturbed of how innocents' lives are destroyed and taken. I cannot believe the incompetence of the police. Even though, they were given the name of the original killer who has been accused several times with the smilier accusation (similar weapon) , left evidence behind in every scene, they were blindfolded, they want this inccent man's life to be taken.....cannot believe it.",False
9,5,Drags on and on and on.,rememberdave,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a poor attempt in telling a serious story. The first 45 minutes is redundancy after redundancy after redundancy. Really, do not waste your time. Read an article about the story. Please, save yourself 1h21m.",False
10,8,Disgraceful Miscarriage of Justice,njboden,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have seen many shocking films and series about miscarriages of justice like 'Making a Murderer', 'An Innocent Man', '10 Rimmington Place' and 'In the Name of the Father' and read about cases such as Krishna Maharaj but this is probably the most shocking: like in the true crime film '10 Rimmington Place' an innocent man is executed for a crime committed by a serial killer but in this instance the police know the accused is innocent all along but let the killer free to kill again merely because he's a police informant. In effect the police have murdered the innocent but convicted Carlos De Luna and the serial killers future victims, or just the serial killer himself (called Carlos Hernandez). They even lied and claimed they could find no trace of Hernandez despite him having an extensive criminal record consisted of numerous arrests and convictions and some prison time! Shame on these corrupt murderers and shame on Texas for even having such a medieval form of 'justice' as the death penalty in the first place!",True
11,1,Can't hear the dialogue,economywater,n/a,16/08/2025,Tried watching this but the music and sound effects are WAY too loud and drown out the dialogue so I had to abort. Whoever did the sound design should never work again.,False
12,4,"Race baiting ""documentary""",maguirejamesjm,n/a,16/08/2025,"It is a heart felt story that implies the justice system got it wrong. But it wasn't an unbiased documentary presenting facts. It was designed to make it seem like race was involved. Rene Rodriguez was in this ""documentary"" and had nothing to do with the case. Everyone from corpus christi knows that Mr. Rodriguez is known for race baiting and doesn't actually doing anything positive for the city. Does tell a great story of potential flaws in the case but brings too much about race into it. When there is no proof of racism. It has plenty of witness' that heard things but never called it in, but magically have something to say for the documentary.",False
13,2,Huh?,ecmarmon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCould it be that two men with extensive criminal histories, both named Carlos, each committed terrible crimes?This documentary entirely fails to convince the viewer that police got the wrong man. Very poor story telling, completely unconvincing. Zero evidence that the wrong man was convicted. I kept waiting for the bombshell, and I'm still waiting. I could go on and on but, unlike this documentary, I know when I've said what I need to say.Just another Netflix cash grab in our beloved true crime genre.",True
14,1,Another true crime con,SirHenry,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerCarlos DeLuna is portrayed as an angel. He had a very long criminal record himself - including attempting to rape a woman. Is this someone we are supposed to be crying over?At the very best he was part of a robbery, where his longtime friend stabbed a woman to death, and then they both fled - then covered for his friend. Innocent angel? I don't think so.He deserved death for the attempted rape so I wouldn't lose sleep over this beast.",True
15,1,Waste of an hour and 20 min.,pj-37438,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerEven with the one sided agenda based presentation, only people with limited understanding of violent crime and violent criminals would think this was worthwhile or proved what is wanted to.",True
16,5,Too long and racist.,vmanson-49017,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is an interesting case spoiled by bad story telling. First half, 45mins of the documentary was basically the same thing repeating over and over again. They spend 45 mins trying make you feel sorry and somewhat emotional about Mr. Deluna. Then the other half where the real thing is supposed to start, it just skimmed over the top.Definitely not for fans of crime documentaries. Not much details given other than the fact an innocent person was hanged and it's all because of racism.Never mind the fact that Deluna lied many times and made it hard for anyone to believe his story in the beginning. But it does make a solid argument against the death penalty. The racist angle their spin kinda was like the cherry on top of this bad documentary.An ok watch if your a casual viewer. Not recommended for crime fans.",True
17,5,Propaganda,Mg6,n/a,16/08/2025,"I love how the state indicts and convicts someone, multiple appeals courts uphold the conviction, but they are all wrong because a law professor with an agenda can present innuendo and hearsay to question said verdict. And make no mistake, the so-called evidence presented that tries to place blame on Carlos Hernandez instead of Carlos DeLuna, is nothing more than innuendo and hearsay. Absolutely nothing discovered by the Northwestern University innocence professor would have ever been admitted as legitimate evidence. It is smoke and mirrors, you can do it with any crime. But it is nothing more than propaganda. Texas got the right guy.",False

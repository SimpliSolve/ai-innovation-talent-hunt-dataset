1,6,Ok,PinkPuffin,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a Brit, so I have known about big cats in Britain all my life, but thought I'd give this a watch. I think it must be made for the American market....lots of unnecessary dramatic music , exaggerated efforts to try and make it ""exciting"", and a narrator that sounds as though he's straight out of Mary Poppins. His narration was unbearable, so much so, I nearly turned it off after the first 5 minutes. Give me Chris Packham or David Attenborough any day! There was a lot of repeated stuff, telling you again, what they had just seen done. As per usual with these types of programs, there was no conclusion about anything.",False

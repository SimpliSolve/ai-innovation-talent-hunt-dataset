1,5,A mixed bag,jneiberger-1,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerLet's start with the good: remote viewing is real, and Paul Smith is the real deal when it comes to practitioners and instructors.Now the not so good. It was obvious that the PK experiments with the foil in the jars could be explained by heat/IR from their hands warming up the air in the jar and creating currents. I'd like to see them repeat it with maybe double-walled jars or, better yet, a vacuum.The EEG stuff wasn't even paranormal. That's just writing code to translate brainwave patterns into sound or colors. Kind of cool, but not even remotely paranormal in any way.The Ben Hansen stuff was outright fraudulent. It would be like demonstrating a telephone call and telling someone it was magic. Total nonsense. And don't even get me started on his infrared camera idiocy. The guy apparently doesn't know that he's just recording residual heat. It's embarrassing.And lastly, the kids who can see while wearing blindfolds. There is someone I trust who is a scientist who swears this is real, but blindfold peeking is a thing. I just can't believe this unless I could do it myself. Until then, I can't help but assume they're peeking. That's why they hardly even look directly at what they're reading. They need to get a bit of an angle because that's where the gap in the blindfold is.",True
2,5,Really,s201098765,n/a,16/08/2025,"I hate to crush everyone's fantasies of esp psychic powers, but there's no such thing as psychic or remote viewing. Some people are just really good at guessing.""...Through a series of groundbreaking on-camera scientific experiments, viewers will find themselves connecting the dots about the true nature of their own consciousness, the relation between mind and matter and discover whether they live in a simulated matrix or if they can have control over their physical reality and create a fulfilling human experience. The film ultimately shows that once the invisible worlds are made visible, this attained higher awareness will transform humans into superhumans.""",False
3,7,much cherry picking of talented high IQ folk to demonstrate that a few have extraordinary gifts,bimbim14,n/a,16/08/2025,"This is a phenomenon of high iq, it is entrepreneurial types who tend to demonstrate psi, these folks are used to ""mind over matter"" IOW bending reality to their will without too much effort. I believe this is a real phenomenon but I also realize that the naysayers are upset because these folks are essentially ""pulling rank"" on the rest of us untalented masses without these powers. Just as there are people who are tone-deaf who can never become musicians, there are the majority of folk who can't do psi because they lack ""the right stuff.""",False
4,n/a,Extremely unscientific nonsense,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"The movie starts with a display of brainwashed kids and a misquote of Einstein, and it goes downhill from there. The so-called ""experiments"" conducted show a complete lack of understanding of basic scientific principles. Instead nonsensical hypotheses are presented as facts with a complete lack of supporting evidence, and backed up by pure word salad.I have seldom seen such scientific incompetence paired with such a level of abuse of measuring equipment, such deeply flawed understanding (way beyond misunderstanding) of obtained results.If any of the absurd claims in this disaster film were true these people would have won the million dollar JREF prize a long time ago, along with various Nobel prices. But they didn't because they weren't.Some real scientists (absent from this film) actually do research frameworks such as a computational reality, but this film has absolutely nothing to do with neither reality nor science.0/5 would be too generous.",False
5,1,"A string of conman's ruse, and bad science.",m1dhun,n/a,16/08/2025,"Yes ""shotgunning"" is an excellent cold reading ruse.
Electromagnetic waves exist. Human bodies leave residual heat. Transcranial EEGs can pick up brainwaves. If you shake the table, a suspended foil covered with glass will move.
How any of this is meant to help a viewer connect the dots about the true nature of their own consciousness is beyond me.
What I find appalling though is one of the ""experts"" idea of a control reading in an experiment regarding the pH of water. The host not knowing that the co2 from her breath will reduce the pH of the water, tries to mentally reduce the pH of water while sitting above and breathing on it.
The DNA conductivity test that follows is laughable, both in apparatus and observations. The control readings are taken off of the same sample used to experiment with. 3 reading are taken and averaged. Each 'control' reading is observed in quick succession, and appears to reduce with each reading. So the conductivity seems to be increasing with time. Then more time passes as the ""intervention"" happens. If there was a control, that ""intervention"" did not happen on, I have no doubt that it would also show a change.
As for the exploited children the film uses to bring home its point. Currently the mid-brain activation scam is a global pandemic. Exploiting both children and well meaning parents for financial gain. They condition children into performers, much like carnivals and circuses did to their boy wonders. Except there is a lot of money behind it, how much you ask? Enough so that you can buy a franchise to midbrain activation academy. Teaching children to lie has been a main stay of blindfold peeking, since illusionist realized they are too old to throw a tantrum or wriggle about like a toddler. if you don't believe me, google midbrain franchise. In this film the name may be different, the scam is the same. These people should be charged with child abuse and fraud.

6,8,Don't listen to the low reviews if you have a curious mind,ms-14585,n/a,16/08/2025,"The ability to perceive the things that are discussed in this documentary come to people two ways: You are born with a stronger ability to perceive energy OR you gain the ability to understand and perceive energy through a life-challenge (trauma). I have had a moderate amount of awareness but after the death of my daughter those abilities grew exponentially, beginning in the hours before her death. I woke out of a sound sleep and KNEW that something horrible was happening or going to happen. I paced for hours in the middle of the night, then that intense feeling released and I was able to go back to sleep. That aligned with the exact time of my daughter's dying and death. In the years that followed I have experienced things that I would have absolutely discounted before. These things are very real.The low reviews speak of this as ""scientific nonsense"" because they lack the ability to perceive what is being discussed, in the same way that fundamentalists cannot begin to wrap their minds around evolution. Just because someone has no knowledge or understanding of a concept or a truth doesn't make it untrue. Remember what Shakespeare said: There are more things in heaven and earth than are...dreamt of in your philosophy.The scientists interviewed in the documentary all have serious credentials and, being of a scientific mind, they are endeavoring to understand *something* that they have experienced...frequently to their shock.If you are experiencing these things or you have a desire to develop these abilities you will find this a solid and fascinating documentary.",False
7,1,Pure B...........it,Ebert,n/a,16/08/2025,"For those who appreciate self-deception it will look like the masterpiece that confirms their beliefs. For anyone with the minimum of objective and scientific knowledge, it's nonsense without size. Don't waste your time!",False
8,8,The People Complaining Have Never Tried To Do This.,andromedamuse,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis has happened to me my whole life. I was able to predict my boyfriend crashing when I was 18 yrs old, down to the minute, and I went out driving and immediately found his car. I've warned people of things that end up happening. I have been out of body numerous times. I have had prophetic dreams. It all happened to me, so I know it's true, BUT I PUT IN THE WORK.So when people who have never even put in two seconds of training come and say things don't exist, it really ticks me off. It's like immediately dismissing something you have no idea about and have never tried. If they all would put in the work, they would realize all of this stuff is more than possible.I came here to see if this was a good documentary and I was expecting to find people knowledgeable on the subject. Instead, I found people with no subject knowledge giving their opinion that none of this exists with zero evidence.Sure, it's hard to prove, but so were the existence of atoms until one hundred years ago. I don't agree with everything here, but I can tell you there are things I have known and done that I could not explain.I get feelings and instincts about things that i would have no way of knowing. I have never done this for monetary gain. I only do it for myself and for my friends and family. They call me the witch, even though I am of no religion. Im agnostic and practice nothing. I don't like rituals.It doesn't just happen all the time either. I wish. It just comes when I need it. I don't control it. At least I haven't learned that (if there is a way).Dont listen to the ignorant naysayers saying this is all lies. Most of the stuff said here is basic science, and goes perfectly well with most theories of the universe. They speak about Einstein, Tesla and energy-- all basic stuff.The remote viewing was kind of funny...no lady, that was a house you were drawing not black bars. I was laughing at that.Like I said, it's hard to control, but trust me, if you meditate and learn to train your mind, you can do some pretty crazy stuff.And all you saying it isn't true, why don't you all quit with your negativity and actually TRY TO PUT IN THE WORK. You can't really just expect this to happen for you out of thin air. You must train your brain. It took me 3 months of intense meditation to learn to go out of body. I worked at it, until I achieved it. Anyone can do this with the training.Also, I didn't pay a dime. I just read info on the net and tried it out. Pretty simple. I am now 45 and I started when I was 18. Back in the 90's before most of this stuff was even public knowledge.If you believe you CAN ACHIEVE.Like Olivia Newton says in Xanadu ""You have to believe we are magic, nothing can stand in our way. You have to believe we are magic, don't let your head go astray. And if all your hope survives, destiny will arrive, and bring all your dreams to life.....for you.""---the muse.",True
9,2,Facepalm.,themadcamel,n/a,16/08/2025,"Like a bad smell to the senses, this Documentary film is insulting to the Intellect. These charlatans could so easily be flawed with simple questions and/or basic tests that are never asked or tested. In order to call it real science you would also need an attempt to dissprove your own hypothesis. Don't get me wrong I'd love to believe in this stuff but there's a big difference between having an ""open mind"" and just being straight up ""gullible"".",False
10,10,Naysayers are BS,banditcat-84016,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great showing of what our conscience can do when open instead of closed minded.This documentary took courage. Finally something that looks into who we really are, Spirits too.",False
11,1,"So bad, I want to give it -10 stars",jgerton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Could not finish this movie, it's ridiculous. There are really bad ""scientists"", working with brainwashed subjects, performing non-scientific research and then just claiming the results support their obviously biased opinions. Just an assault on your intelligence.",False
12,1,A fraud,comptespierre,n/a,16/08/2025,"Scientist make fool of a filmmaker that seem to believe everything she's told, who totally lacks science knowledge and twists real scientific results into her fantasy delirium.The experience that ""proves"" people can move a little piece of paper in a closed bottle is a well known fraud... don't you know that when you put your hands on a bottle, their heat goes to the bottle and heats the air in it that moves...

13,1,Garbage for gullibles,papelindholm,n/a,16/08/2025,"Initially, subtract a star (for the primary audience: it means reduce the existing ratings symbol).

14,10,The EEG music visual system is real,colinsynaudio,n/a,16/08/2025,There are a lot of reviews bashing the science of the film but I can assure you that EEG headsets can pick up your brainwaves and interpret them into thoughts (pattern recognition) and emotional states. Those can then be used to control generative music visual systems and image recall among many other things like controlling wheelchairs or speech computers.,False
15,1,The most horribly mind numbing thing I've ever watched.,vnqtfxpj,n/a,16/08/2025,"Full of horrible acting and mindless pseudo science.

17,1,World changing extra sensory abilities,lukehil-16217,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are many different extra sensory phenomena displayed here and ""proven"" with ""scientific"" experiments.Sceptical viewers are left with one big question at the end - which the believers don't appear to have caught onto.These special ""forces"" have the potential to do so many amazing things to help people, so why is Ms Cory spending all her time making documentaries and writing books? Imagine how much publicity she could create for her discoveries by actually putting them to good use. Remote Viewing would be very useful if used to find missing children. Dna altering powers could heal the sick. Training the Police, doctors etc in how to use these abilities would change the world.Reviewers who claim these powers are real should be wondering why we need to watch this series to hear about them. If it was all true it would have already been in the news headlines frequently. So the question is what is the actual purpose of this show?",True
18,10,The kids reading while completely blindfolded.,brothnine,n/a,16/08/2025,"Much of the scientific experimentation is interesting but is at an early phase. I suggest you assume good faith. That is much easier to do if you go directly to 1 hour 33 minutes and 41 seconds into the documentary. Look at the kids reading while blindfolded. Caroline Cory shows the blindfolds. They totally block all light. All the edges seal up against the face. Once you see the kids reading while blindfolded, and the adults identifying colors, and people finding stuff in grocery stores (all while blindfolded), then the rest of the documentary is much more interesting. I heard an interview with Caroline Cory beforehand, and was much more open-minded going in. Also, I knew of some of the scientists. They are not lightweights. I think some of the theorizing though about how this stuff works is complete guesswork. But the tests and experimentation is interesting.",False
19,1,That is the biggest idiot thing that I have ever seen,edsm100,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fake, pure fake, because they interview serious scientists who do not even know what program is and they speak about other things, and the scientists who put themselves in favor of the program, are not serious, that is the biggest idiot thing that I have ever seen, pure stupidity, as the aluminum role that it floated and turned under the flame hot air before she coming, from so light that it is, and they induced and trained children to respond to what they want, uncourciently, trained in figures albums, but when they grow, they will give all that, even the false tests, that an example is to do 20 tests and the person just hit 3 and them shows only these positive 3 results. That prizes can not be serious, they are very suspicious.",False

22,10,Actually seeing people with abilities.....,jnmldo,n/a,16/08/2025,Seeing people with abilities that I also have almost brought me to tears. I haven't practiced in a while but I used to to a lot of Remote Viewing. Especially real-time RV. It's pretty sad how every review here is filled with ignorant people who don't even pit ANY thought or effort into trying these things out for themselves. Nor do they even do there own EXTENSIVE research. I mean come on. The CIA has declassified documents ON THE CIA website about Remote Viewing. Counties have pit a lot of money 8nto psychic research. Just Google it. Lol. Why would a country put so much money into such research if they didn't see fund something profound 😑 The easiest thing to do is to look up Remote Viewing training classes. Do A LOT of extensive research on Remote Viewing and you will slowly begin to change your mind.,False
23,10,Exceptionally inspiring!,M1racl3sHapp3n,n/a,16/08/2025,"I've known some of the experiments in this documentary since the 1980""s. However, reading about them is one thing but seeing them is a completely different experience and what's most important is that the subjects are common people like you and I: we are all potentially superhuman. Scientists are involved to explain and carry out the experiments. This is a must watch for quantum physics enthusiasts and truth seekers!",False
24,10,Superhumans Scare You,secretcourtofintenders,n/a,16/08/2025,"I am on my second run with this super informative documentary that represents the powers of our mind.I know this is scary. You can do your own test to see just how powerful your mind really is.The governments have been exploring the subject of the Power of Mind for a century.Obama paid IONS 10 million dollars to study the power of long distance prayer. That study became secret.I would guess that most of the negative reviews are written by the C1A to discourage people from any further study on the power of the mind.You don't have to believe anything in this documentary, but it is all still very true.",False
25,10,Watch out for fake reviews.,smokeysmokeysmokey,n/a,16/08/2025,"Many negative one-star reviews from people who cannot do five minutes of research into remote viewing and similar techniques. The remote viewing community on Reddit now has 72,526 users and growing. It's has been studied by various governments for decades and is easy to learn about if you have some curiosity, and especially if you have some mediation experience. Bonus points if you don't come to the table with a big ego and a know-it-all attitude.There are many accredited scientist in this documentary, including a neuroscientist that studied children and adults with equipment to test for light entering the mask while people demonstrate this skill in a controlled and blinded (literally) laboratory setting at the University of Bari in Italy. Either this is a ruse involving tens of thousands of people worldwide, or it's a real ability. Watch the documentary and you be the judge. Better still, learn the skill and prove it to yourself. You can't go home again. Every documentary series on physic functioning or natural health has many lazy one-star reviews that can be disproven in minutes. Hmm... food for thought.",False

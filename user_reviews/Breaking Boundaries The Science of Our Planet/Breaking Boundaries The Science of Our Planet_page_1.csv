1,8,The tenth boundary: global human population,edwin-wks,n/a,15/08/2025,"Johan says that the actions of humans alone in the past 50 years are responsible for pushing humanity and the planet out of the 10,000-year Holocene and into the Anthropocene. So it seems astounding to me that the global human population was not included as a critical boundary to the destabilization of the planet.The global human population was just 3 billion in 1960 and it now sits at 7.9 billion, a 160 % increase in less than a lifetime. Just as any farmland has a maximum capacity for the number of livestock, the planet must also have a maximum capacity for the number of humans that demands all of its resources.Countries like Brazil have seen their populations tripled since 1960; there were 70 million Brazilians then and there are 210 million now. As draconian and inhumane as China's one-child policy was, their population would be 2 billion without it, instead of 1.5 billion, if they had the same population growth as Brazil. Human culture has to change because there is no evolutionary need for any family to have more than two children since most children will survive into adulthood.",False

3,8,A great documentary with a major flaw,GatoMysterious,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is a very good documentary for sure. Everyone must understand that it is not just a small problem, but we are facing a global environmental crisis and we do not have 30-50 years more to start changing status quo of destroying everything around us. What was missed is the way how everyone can make an impact right away, without waiting for politicians to finally act. We need to adopt a fully plant-based diet to stop killing billions of animals each year, stop polluting rivers and oceans with cows' and pigs' manure, stop cutting forests so we could eat ""less beef"". We do not have time anymore for ""less meat"" and ""flexitarian"" nonsense. Our planet is dying, and we have mounting evidence that the plant-based diet is the best way how every single person can make the change. And yeah, side effect include better health, normal weight and a great feeling that you are not paying someone to keep living beings in terrible conditions with a brutal slaughter at the end of their short life so you could eat a steak for lunch.",False
4,10,The future of the planet is in our hands,ryolusky13,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is definitely worth of your 1 hour 13 minutes time to watch this science-based documentary about how humanity has the dominant role, as Sir David Attenborough perfectly highlighted on his closing narrative, as the only Earth's conscience and brain, whether to lead the world and its ecosystems to the danger zones by continuously doing our business as usual, or to secure the future with a healthy and fresh air, clean water, stable climate, nutritious land, and resilient planet, by doing everything we can to not break the planetary boundaries.",False

6,6,Good but wrong message if you want to actually change anything,jgeiser-11650,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerOh great, another climate change documentary. Don't get me wrong, I am all about saving the planet which is why I decided to watch this documentary, however, it shows more doom and gloom rather than solutions which i think would be a better message to portray. At this point, most people understand that humanity is in a crisis. At the end, the only solutions that are offered are planting trees and reducing emissions substantially. That's it. Like, really!? That's it!?Very little incite is mentioned on that we should change the structure of our economy if we are going to change in the long run. No information about different techniques to slow climate change down other than reducing carbon and planting trees of course. No carbon capture, cloud creation, sea weed farming, solar, wind, geothermal, wave, etc. Just mostly doom and gloom, which CAN be a powerful message, however, I fear it has been overplayed. People are tired of hearing about the ""tipping points "" and are more interested in solutions. Let's talk about solutions and ways to implement them ASAP. That would be a much better documentary imo. It's more uplifting and shows that we as humans can be in control of our future.All we ever hear about climate change anymore is that the clock is ticking and we are running out of time. People don't get motivated by that message. People feel defeated and they tune out and go on with their daily lives business as usual.And also for the love of god stop attacking the consumer about their energy consumption and water usage and start attacking the PRODUCERS!!! It's the producers that are the ones to blame, not consumers. If all electricity generated was from a renewable source you wouldn't care if we left lights on or if all vehicles emitted no co2 you wouldn't care if we drove too much. Start pressuring the producers and force them to change, that way consumers don't even have a choice but to choose renewable or sustainable practices. Exxon Mobil has been using this technique to shift the blame off their shoulders to the consumers. Tobacco companies have also done the same thing. You have to stop the producers. That is all.",True
7,10,Some flaws but everyone should see this,usommer64,n/a,15/08/2025,"David Attenborough is a hopeless optimist and in connection with the concept of Planetary Boundaries this gets to a point where it becomes nearly comical.A major flaw of the film is that it is sometimes so unprecisein it's science that it verges on being incorrect. It insinuates, for example, that if we start living inside Planetary Boundaries today we cound somehow get all the toothpaste that has already left the tube back in. This is, especially for the climate boundary (and consequentially for the ocean acidification boundary, the connection of which is clearly explained in the film), simply not the case.Another flaw is that the things we actually can do, right now, are given not very much space in the film. Especially the connection between a meat-centric diet an the bondaries land-use change, biodiversity loss and nitrogen/phosporous cycle are nor at all explained,But what can I say? Johann Rockström on Netflix. All is not lost. This should receive a huge audience.I also think that science is only one part of solving this puzzle. Mr. Rockstöm and Mr. Attenborough telling us that we can solve the crisis by cutting, as private citizens, our emissions in halfge every decade, is really, REALLY oversimplifying things. We as private citizens can rearrange the deckchairs but without politics steering the whole ship away from the iceberg this will not do, not by a long shot.",False
8,n/a,The end of all life on Earth.,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's easy to see how humans are responsible for the devastation done to the environment. Industrialists and the governing bodies of every country are 100% responsible for this. It's the end. I'll be gone, and you may be gone, but the future of humanity is without doubt going to be filled with strife, and probably extinction of 99.9% of life on the planet. No one cared, so no one will live. It's the apocalypse, and you are all here to witness.A great flood is coming after fires that burn the planet. Wild stuff.",False
9,6,Great potential-missing solution-based elements,nikkidp-29840,n/a,15/08/2025,"This documentary was on a good track but missed a lot of key points. The maybe-1 minute spent on ""making healthy choices"" was a complete cop out move because the producers likely didn't want to ruffle feathers of the agricultural industry. The doc touts soy as one of the biggest crops leading to deforestation-now let's continue to make the connections that the documentary fails to do: about 80% of all soy production is allocated to livestock feed. So, it makes sense to say that if humans decreased meat consumption, it would result in decreased demand for livestock production and subsequent decreased soy feed, and finally, decreased deforestation since soy wouldn't be as in demand. But, this film would not dare say or elude to consuming less meat because it was trying to keep all parties happy. The truth is: Feathers need to be ruffled here because the future of the planet is at stake. Agriculture is a huge money-making industry and eating (way) less meat is something they would fight against at all costs. However, it's actually something everyone could easily do to change the trajectory of the planet. It would also impact water use and pollutant run off, dead zones, etc.Also, as another reviewer mentioned, nothing was stated about the global human capacity?! Earth resources can only sustain a certain amount of human population (and we have surpassed this long ago). Again, I think the movie was trying to sugar-coat everything so as not to upset anyone...but we are no longer in an era where we should be concerned with repopulating the world, so 2 children max (it's actually 1.5 but not sure how to navigate that one).",False
10,10,The most important media of our generation,goelmadhav,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is the most important of documentary of our generation. And it is very clear, easy to understand and impressive. Hats off to Sir David Attenborough and Professor Johan Rockstrom for creating this eye opening media.",False
11,6,Overpopulation is a most dangerous than all,zanyarkf,n/a,15/08/2025,Overpopulation is most dangerous than all 9 boundaries because that bounder is cause of all the crisss before id human population is down to like 50 years ago I think most of problem is been solved...!!!,False
12,10,Everyone should watch this !,aerkiner,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is years of research, science-backed information being shared about what has happened due to current normalized daily practices and what will happen if we continue the same way without changing our approach of how we live on plant earth. We all have to take action now!",False
13,6,"Good documentary, but...",marco_mct,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerWell, we kinda see things in this documentary that we already saw a lot of times in many other docs, its always interesting,but, there's also some misinformation. When they talk about covid-19, they try to insinuate its because of climate change that this situations can happend, covid-19 has nothing to do with climat change, just read the news that are comming out, and everyone will understand, from where the virus came from.",True
14,5,Informative but very utopian,the_danny,n/a,15/08/2025,"It feels like a self-help book for society to feel good about how we are destroying the environment, not doing anything to change, and hoping that things will get better. Also, the documentary fails miserably for not calling out big corporations and the unsustainable capitalism model that is causing our own extinction.",False
15,10,Open your eyes and heart,christianchelaru,n/a,15/08/2025,If you care about the next generation or the living organism ( earth) . You have to watch this or stay an hypocrite and an ignorant and be proud . Your move.,False
16,10,IT'S NOT TOO LATE,albertval-69560,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's scary to learn that we, humans, have crossed several boundaries leading to tipping points during the age of Anthropocene. As Johan Rockstrom clearly points out, what we do collectively will determine the future of our planet. The main challenge is to reach zero carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. We're now at 415 parts per million (ppm); the high-risk zone is 450 ppm. Can we transform into a fossil-free world economy in 30 years?We've done this before with the problem of ozone layer depletion. We can address the challenge this time, too. The documentary reminds us of the interconnectedness of the planet's systems. So that we have to address them as a broad front.Above anything else, this sobering documentary has shone the spotlight on what we can do now. What can we do as individuals? Plant more trees, eat healthy food, avoid waste and reduce CO2 emissions by 6-7% annually. It looks like these are doable. And we should have started yesterday.The documentary makes a compelling case through its vivid visuals and the resource speakers invited to share their knowledge. Nowadays in this pandemic, we're reminded to mind the science. The experts have spoken laying down the science of our planet. It's not too late to do our share.",False
17,n/a,Almost a complete explanation of the situation,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dear filmmakers everywhere: it is a good thing you attempt to do by explaining the sorry state of the planet but you all miss the key problem and solution. People are not going to change their behavior or expectations. They aren't going to give up their electronics or other creature comforts. So what is the problem really? It is people. There are too many of us on this planet now and it isn't sustainable. More people are coming so if we don't name the problem, how can we ever fix it? Overpopulation is the entire problem and reducing population is the only solution. Why is it so hard for people to see that?",False
18,6,Chill it with the ridiculous cgi graphics!,georgejbhornsby,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's like this show is made for ADHD sufferers, you don't have to flash up cgi neural networks or bombard us with clips within clips to keep us engaged. Let the content speak for itself.",False
19,10,Good overview,Beevy,n/a,15/08/2025,"Good overview of this gigantic problem we unleashed. Some things could be shown in a slightly less irritating way like the animations of the danger zones. But I'm not really going to analyze it, it's a complete overview in easy language for the deniers (they actually still exist unfortunately). Rating high anyhow because everyone should see at least see this and face the sad situation we got ourselves in.",False
20,7,Nice documentary...,Thanos_Alfie,n/a,15/08/2025,"""Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet"" is a Documentary in which we watch David Attenborough and scientist Johan Rockström talking about climate change, biodiversity and the boundaries that exist and that must not broken to save our planet before it's too late.I liked this documentary because I learned more about the boundaries that exist on different aspects of environment and how humans have influenced and changed it through the years. The direction which was made by Jon Clay was good and he presented very well the main problems that cause climate change, who is responsible for it and how we can save our planet before it's too late. David Attenborough and Johan Rockström made us understand even better how our planet has changed, what all of people have to do in order to save it and what are the boundaries or limits that we do not have to cross because afterwards it would irreversible to save our planet. Even if you have already watch other documentaries like ""Our Planet"", ""Life"" and ""David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet"" I am definitely sure that you will learn something new by watching ""Breaking Boundaries: The Science of Our Planet"" so, I highly recommend you to watch it.",False
21,9,Watch this,kswin-37350,n/a,15/08/2025,"Thought-provoking, troubling, accessible, informative, measured, disturbing but ultimately hopeful if rather densely packed, this documentary communicates clearly and at times movingly that the future of our lives and our planet is in our hands..",False
22,7,Can we just interview the guy in his office?,wouterleeman,n/a,15/08/2025,"Can we just interview the guy in his office? Why are there so many flashing things while important information is being shared?I mean, the shots of nature are really nice. I think this perfectly balances with a swedish guy in his office spitting facts!Am i supposed to get super frustrated and annoyed with the visuals and editing so that i stop watching this film and go read a book about climate change to not waste energy on a tv or computer?Uhm netflix is a bit stupid, but david attenbro is my bro for life. One love. Peace.",False
23,9,When is the last generation before we become extinct?,andreszykier,n/a,15/08/2025,"Bees, pollutants, ocean acidity, aerosols, waste recycling, and more plant based diet. The 9 causes for end of humamity. The last is global warming and 2020 fires in Australia gave us a wake-up call. Will our crisis in Covid-19 be the first sign that we are at the end? Watch, think, then share. Just do it. Its your future now. 2040. 10/10.",False
24,6,Does not show us the way to fix our mess,alex-278,n/a,15/08/2025,Unfortunately this film does not have a compelling narrative. It felt rushed and does not deliver a coherent message and should have been done much better. David is the ideal person to deliver such a message but I had the feeling that he was introduced to try and give the film credibility.The silly neuron like graphics and tearing images coupled with zombie like people walking to the edge of some boundary was sensationalistic and added absolutely nothing to the message. If there was a message and if it was that we have reached the tipping point then the scientists should have been able to sate what the consequences would be - but that was lacking and so at the end I was left wondering well - so what?There was not one syllable regarding the obvious over population that is causing these problems nor one syllable on how we should go about fixing it.,False
25,5,Netflix nature,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,"David Attenborough and scientist Johan Rockström pleads for action in the fight against global warming. Climate change and biodiversity collapse is threatening the world. In every environmental measurement, the world is walking willingly into the danger zone and we are running out of time.David Attenborough brings his environmental message to Netflix. While I approve of the message, I always judge these on two standards. They either convince disbelievers or rally supporters. I don't think that this does either. First, I would reconsider the idea of the danger zone and the graphics of non-descript human figures slowly walking. I would make some of the figures be animal species and have them fall off the edge. I would zero in on one recently extinct species and do a story on that species. The most powerful section of the whole hour is the five minutes or so with the lady researcher crying over the Australian wildfires. It's really the only compelling part of the film. The rest is a lot of talking heads complaining. While I support the complaints, it's preaching to the choir and quite frankly, it's more like preaching on Super Bowl Sunday. People are just itching to leave the church. Finally, there is the section on COVID 19. It's a little annoying with the narration saying that we are the cause of the pandemic and yet it shows only images of the western world. I thought the virus originated from China in a wet market. How is Times Square responsible when nobody is eating bats there? Somebody needs to be as careful with making this film as the scientist claims to be as careful with his research.",False

1,9,Wonderful Film,steviegjd,n/a,15/08/2025,"I loved this movie.It has a wonderful message of tolerance and unity. The voice acting is charming. The animation is very good, stunning at times. I liked the story, though I can see some people feeling it's too schmaltzy or corny.In a world that is so divided, and a country that is seemingly hopelessly divided, it's very comforting to experience a story of characters coming together, being able to accept their differences, and building a community. Sadly, that's what makes it fiction too. But it's nice to dream.The fact that the title character, and the character that inspires all the change, is the ultimate ""other"" only serves to make the point more elegantly.I suppose some people will think it's manipulative and needlessly tugs at the audience's heartstrings. But that's part of the beauty to me.I loved this movie.",False
2,8,A worthy contender for the Animated film of 2024,eddie_baggins,n/a,15/08/2025,"Marking the end of an extremely successful and entertaining era for DreamWorks in-house animation studios which will move onto outsourced works in the future, Chris Sanders newest venture behind the camera following his well-liked works as overseer on hits Lilo & Stitch, How to Train Your Dragon and The Croods is a wonderful send-off for the brand that gave us many an animated classic, with The Wild Robot a genuine contender against box-office heavyweight Inside Out 2 as the animated film of 2024.An adaptation of author Peter Brown's hit books of the same name, Robot has already been drawing rave reviews and comparisons to the likes of The Iron Giant and Sanders own Dragon adventure, far from feint praise for a film in this genre that here manages to become an all-round package sure to inspire those youngsters that will flock to the story of lost robot Roz and her budding friendship with street-smart fox Fink and young gosling Brightbill, who she acts as a surrogate mother for but also a film that will resonate with older viewers who are sure to find much to enjoy from such a lovingly crafted film full of heart and soul.Utilising the entirety of its quickfire 100 minute running time, Robot has very few lulls or downtime as Roz's journey of discovery with new friends, as well as what it means to truly care and love outside of her designed confines takes us on a familiar theatrical ride but one that's done with enough uniqueness and sense of its own identity that there's never a worry that Robot is merely ticking boxes along its way to crafting a memorable outing that will have you cheering, laughing and more than likely crying throughout its course.Standing out amongst everything here is Robot's CG animation style that Sanders himself describes as ""a Monet painting in a Miyazaki forest"", a style that creates more than its fair share of visually outstanding segments and when this lovingly crafted vibrancy comes together with thoughtful lead voice performers Lupita Nyong'o as the loveable Roz and Pedro Pascal as the initially detestable but eventually likable Fink and enhanced by Kris Bowers exemplary and soaring score, Robot comes together as a complete package in every department.Narratively Robot undoubtedly takes few risks and many key happenings will be overtly predictable for any seasoned viewer but it would take a very jaded and cold cinematic soul to not find joy and comfort from a film so enjoyable as this, a fitting swansong to a wonderous period of DreamWorks products and a further reminder that the animation world is alive and well with many more notable stories yet to tell.Final Say -One of the years most pleasant surprises regardless of genre or design, The Wild Robot is a winning mix of heart, humour and imagination, gifting this familiar feeling tale with a sense of wonderment and adventure that should ensure its place amongst the years biggest audience hits.4 feigned deaths out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",False
3,9,What Walt's Watching,waltermwilliams,n/a,15/08/2025,"""The Wild Robot"" is this generations ""Bambi""...yes it's that damn fine...like a coffee from ""Twin Peaks"".The Key Lime Pie in this animation masterpiece is the beautiful, inclusive story that deals with so many hot topic issues including: finding your heart or living with a disability, without preaching to anyone.During the first act I was laughing so hard at the brilliant, natural comic moments shared from the book of the same name written by Peter Brown.By the second act I was in awe of where this story arc was taking the audience and by the third act I felt salt water in my eyes.""The Wild Robot"" will make you laugh, cry and sigh!The celebrity voiceover cast of Lupita Nyong'o, Catherine O'Hara (""Beetlejuice"" she's so hot right now), Bill Nighy, Matt Berry (""Toast of London""), Ving Rhames, Mark Hamill, Pedro Pascal and so many others do an amazing job of breathing life into this screenplay, backed by the lush island atmosphere and the gorgeous creatures that inhabit it.Director Chris Sanders obsession with animation from ""Lilo and Stitch"" to ""The Croods"" has paid dividends in ""The Wild Robot"".This film shows us that sometimes to survive you must become more than you were programmed to be.",False
4,10,Bring a box of tissues!,kaleighpanda,n/a,15/08/2025,"When I watched this movie I was not familiar with the book, so i was going in blind, and boy I was not disappointed. I loved the movie from beginning to end because of the animation style, the characters, the soundtrack, and the different themes from the movie. I always love whenever movies leave a lasting impact on you and this one definitely has. I will be honest I didn't expect to cry during this movie but I did......three times. It was so simple yet complex in what themes they were conveying, and I highly recommend people of all ages to watch this movie. The themes that I picked up on were motherhood, being viewed as different in society, and growing up. I loved and adored this movie so much and I cannot wait to watch it again.",False
5,10,The Best Animated Film I've Ever Seen,beachlove84,n/a,15/08/2025,"I saw the Wild Robot during its TIFF premiere and I have not been able to stop thinking about it. It's one of those movies that really makes an impact on you, and you leave that theatre feeling completely changed. The story was so beautiful, so heartfelt and touching that I cried 3 times. It was a beautiful tale about a found family, unexpected bonds and the beauty of motherhood. I'm currently reading the book and can't wait for the rest of the world to see this wonderful movie. Not to mention, the animation is so adorable, especially Brightbill, you will be holding in a coo every couple minutes. I absolutely adore this movie and can't wait to watch it again.",False
6,10,Instant Classic,arafatchito,n/a,15/08/2025,"Chris Sanders comes back right when he's needed, this animated movie will go down in history not only as one of the greatest animated films but as one of the greatest films in cinema history. This is solid 10/10 for me, my only wish now is for this movie to succeed at the box office as well.Hours later from seeing the film and I'm still emotional, I'm not your average movie goar, and of late very few movies can surprise me much these days, however today I met my match with The Wild Robot. I can't remember the last time a movie made me feel this way. Am truly in awww with Wild Robot, I highly recommend you catch it in cinemas with family.",False
7,10,Simply stunning and emotional!,lucasrptj,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had low expectations for this movie, but guess what?! My goodness, I haven't seen a movie like this for a long time! Simple but deep at the same time. The message about life and how it's goes, and how the life is, it's deeper, inspirational and I think it can move us to think about life and our relationships. It's a such good movie for a kid or an adult. I'm very impressed! I hope that the industry could copy the formula for doing a great movie. The message on the movie helps and make our life's richer about what really matters. It's instantly a classic, and I hope my review helps more people to watch that movie and experience a beautiful master piece!",False
8,7,A human tale with no human characters,TheVictoriousV,n/a,15/08/2025,"Remember when animation was meant to achieve things that weren't possible in live-action pictures or on the stage? The folk at DreamWorks (and sometimes Disney) certainly seem to remember. We know you can use computers to make photoreal lions recite The Lion King; we also know you can mix photorealism with stylization and surrealism if you actually try (and if the film is called Rango). We get how good people are at making things look ""real"".But now's the time to let our imaginations soar again. Hence, highly stylized 3D productions like Arcane, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Turning Red, the Spider-Verse pictures, and now Chris Sanders' The Wild Robot, productions that look so good and sometimes emulate 2D styles in such a unique way that even someone like my VFX-software-programming dad, whose job is to ""know how this works"", barely fathoms how it works. In the case of The Wild Robot, we get an imaginatively presented story about animals and machines that, oddly enough, is ultimately as human as it gets.The film is based on a Peter Brown novel about a service robot (here voiced by Lupita Nyong'o) washed ashore on a remote island, where it uses its intricate programming to effectively ""translate"" the noises of the various animals and so is able to speak to them (luckily the animals don't seem to have any language barriers among themselves), although the creatures largely regard it as a monster. Its... Her only friend becomes a mischievous fox named Fink (Pedro Pascal), who also helps her in raising a small gosling, the only surviving egg in a nest that she accidentally destroys by the start of the movie; feeding and raising the bird becomes her primary objective. Fink initially meant to have the gosling for dinner, but the robot makes him see things differently.The gosling, named Brightbill because that's what the robot deems an apt designation for such a lifeform, grows into an ostracized youngster shunned by other geese for being the child of a monster and being unable to fly (on top of using the same sort of ""robot speak"" as his adoptive mother, e.g complaining that bullies beating him up ""induces a pain response""). Soon enough, he begins to question his true place in this world.This isn't stuff we haven't seen in animated films before. Characters like Belle, Hercules, and Flik the ant will inevitably come to mind at various points during Brightbill's journey. But the fact that certain beats seem familiar to you and me doesn't really matter much when this is a film for young kids -- who may not have seen this sort of fish-out-of-water story in any shape before -- albeit one that will undoubtedly move parents just as much, if not more.Besides, the movie overall feels fresh and original, although it is technically based on pre-existing material. While it has influences, it mixes them into its own distinct world and atmosphere. (Even the plot as such takes several unexpected turns once it starts to feel ""familiar."") Sanders has stated that he wanted to make a Monet painting set in one of Miyazaki's forests and certain shots of ""technology at peace with nature"" recall the works of Swedish retrofuturism master Simon Stålenhag.Among his inspirations, Sanders has also cited Disney's Bambi and Bird's The Iron Giant, both of which this movie lives up to. Additionally, the name of the main character's product line -- a ROZZUM unit by Universal Dynamics, though she prefers ""Roz"" -- is derived from Rossum's Universal Robots, the 1920 Czech play that originated the term ""robot"". (The original title is Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti, ""roboti"" being a play on the Czech word for ""forced labor under serfs""; when the play was translated to English, the mechanical slaves of the title became known as ""robots"".) Details like that are a testament to the thoughtfulness of this deceptively simple-looking film.I mentioned before that parents will appreciate this film at a different level than kids, which should come as no surprise considering Sanders' track record with Lilo & Stitch and How to Train Your Dragon, which achieved more -- something deeper -- than simply being sci-fi and Fantasy adventures, respectively. Kids and adults always view art differently, of course, but here, that is precisely the point.I even fancied the voice work, although we're once again getting celebrities over proper ""voice actors"". Nyong'o, Pascal, Matt Berry, Bill Nighy, Stephanie Hsu, Mark Hamill, and Kit Connor all nail their characters; we never simply hear actors standing near a mic. And I gotta say, this might be the best use of literal nepo babies I've ever seen/heard -- some of these lines are made funnier by the fact that they're clearly being read by some random child who has never set foot in a recording booth before.Granted, I will admit that there are a few jokes that fall flat and a number of story elements that don't achieve their full potential. (Brightbill eventually learns of the accident that killed what would have been his real family but it doesn't seem to affect the sequence of events all that much.) While I adored the film, the claims that this is DreamWorks' best movie, if not the greatest animated feature of all time (!), strike me as just a touch hyperbolic. But it's nice to learn that DreamWorks was apparently just kidding with Kung Fu Panda 4, Megamind 2, and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken.",False
9,8,Perfect during the 1st and 2nd act,pedroquintaoo,n/a,15/08/2025,"DreamWorks managed to bring back the magic of animated cinema with The Wild Robot, a feeling we used to associate with Pixar. For years, Pixar films were all about heart and originality, but over the last 14 years, I feel most of their movies, except for Inside Out (2015), have become more generic and superficial. Thankfully, The Wild Robot, even though from a different studio, brought me that same nostalgic feeling I get from watching Pixar's older films.The story of The Wild Robot is simple yet beautiful and moving. It explores the contrast between technology and nature in a way that's both touching and thought-provoking. From the beginning, we're drawn in by the innocence of the main robot and the curiosity of the animals around it, showing us a unique example of how the natural and artificial can coexist. This contrast is handled with great care, and for most of the movie, I felt fully immersed in the beauty of this interaction.The characters, each with their own distinct personalities, are instantly captivating. Every scene has this nostalgic touch that takes you back to the magic of classic animated films, the kind I watched as a kid that seemed endlessly enchanting. It's a film that can truly appeal to both kids and adults.However, while the first two acts are genuinely emotional and avoid clichés by leaving out forced villains or action scenes, the final act takes a more conventional turn, which is a bit disappointing. It seems to lose some of its original essence and the potential for a unique message, and the ending feels unnecessarily bittersweet, almost as if the producers were already considering a sequel. This final act could have been better developed or even left out entirely to preserve the story's integrity. Personally, I think it would have worked just fine without a traditional villain, focusing instead on a pure journey of discovery.Despite this change in the ending, The Wild Robot is a fantastic title, a breath of fresh air for the genre, and so far, the best animation this year. It's a film with valuable lessons that can charm and move us, leaving a positive impact on everyone. I highly recommend it for the whole family, reminding us that animation can still touch the hearts of adults, just as it did when we were kids.",False
10,6,"Like being hit repeatedly over the head with a giant, squishy hammer.",jrgdavieswalter,n/a,15/08/2025,"It is genuinely baffling when you come out of a movie like this, having read all of the reviews beforehand calling it one of the great animated movies of all time and this generations Bambi; and wondering to yourself if you'd even watched the same movie.The animation was great, yes. Although for me personally, the animals became too overly personified and lost some of their charm once they started speaking. But there were some visually stunning scenes, particularly towards the end.Where the movie was really let down for me was the script writing and the story, which felt clunky and often forced. The writer knew where he wanted to take us and what messages he wanted to convey and he was going to squish the characters and the ensuing narrative into whatever shape they needed to be in order to get there.It felt overly feel good (all the animals are going to live together in harmony forever after, really? And what are the predators going to eat?), while also being occasionally injected with odd moments of brutality - like a possum mother's child being eaten - which were treated in a weirdly humorous and offhand manner that didn't fit with the film.Maybe i was just feeling overly cynical while watching The Wild Robot, or I'm too accustomed to the subtlety of Ghibli movies that the various messages that were crammed into this film felt like being hit repeatedly over the head with a soft and squishy hammer.",False
11,10,Heartfelt Masterpiece,cutie7,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of ""The Wild Robot"", and it quickly became one of my favourite films this year. This beautifully animated movie goes beyond just being family-friendly; it's an emotional and thought-provoking experience. From the stunning visuals to the heartwarming story, ""The Wild Robot"" delivers powerful messages about empathy, connection, and what it means to belong.The film effortlessly blends lighthearted moments with deeper emotional themes, making it an instant classic in my eyes. I was an emotional wreck (in the best possible way) for most of it, completely immersed in the story and the characters' experiences. It's rare to find an animated film that strikes a chord so deeply, and I can't recommend it enough. ""The Wild Robot"" is a true 10/10, and I'm excited to see how it touches others just as it did me.",False
12,6,Totally Overrated,FireJach,n/a,15/08/2025,"Before it hit homes, I'd heard how beautiful and magical the movie is, or how Dreamworks has made another classic. I was so excited after reading all of these opinions, I prepared myself and bought chips and beer. Well, shortly after 30 minutes I realized the movie goes to nowhere.It's another movie about teamwork, respect, tolerance - I've watched dozens of them in my entire life and here I got nothing new.The movie begins super slowly and doesn't build up anything quite deeper besides one actually cool thing - realistic nature where animals eat each other. The movie is not long so I feel they wasted lots of time on telling/showing us how the robot is designed to serve people. At some point the robots adopts a bird and with help of the fox, they're trying to raise the bird, which is sometimes rushed. The moment when the bird needs to migrate like the rest of his kind, I didn't feel anything because the movie didn't build up any emotional connection. The story here is super cliche and flat. Well, [It's another movie about teamwork, respect, tolerance - I've watched dozens of them in my entire life and here I got nothing new], an average comedy movie made 15 years ago delivers the same message, which makes EVERYTHING predictable.There are some major problems I dislike such as:Why didn't the company send another aircraft after the failed one? They waited for another signal despite the story shows us how important the robot was for them. The robot had time to spend more time with the nature therefore you can see how the time pasts.Maybe I missed it, but I thought the central part (the core) is the most important part of the robot to be ""alive"". Minor spoiler! The robots throws it away to save its bird and then everything it's alright for a long time.I hate it, I HATE IT, how the story ESTABLISHED the nature is realistic but at some point they say: You know, you can change. No, the animals can't stop eating each other. Dreamworks showed the animals are realistic here and it's a part of this story that they need to adapt, obey to the nature. It's not The Lion King where that part is ignored. You can't say it is analogy to a real life issues while the thing is a basic need of the characters. Some people might compare it to anger, toxic responses etc. But we as humans can live without these, so that is BIG MINUS.The movie is alright, watch it with your kids. I think Puss in Boots 2 has deeper meaning, more creative story, more engaging characters, more emotional - better.",False
13,5,A movie made in a lab,UnbiasedAnonymous,n/a,15/08/2025,"The first 10 minutes felt like it was setting me up for something special, with stunning animation and self-aware dark humor. As it went on, it divulged into a story I've seen hundreds of times already.This film feels as though it was made in a factory to evoke an emotional response whilst not actually saying anything at all. There is also a song that plays during a montage that seems to have been placed solely to get awards contention in best original song that is just as generic.The plot constantly molds around whatever it needs to regardless of what was established prior.Every character was uninteresting and had arcs that you could write yourself in 5 minutes. I was never worried for any of them because I knew what would happen.It's not a terrible movie. The animation is fantastic, and the voice acting performances are decent, but the plot and characters were as monotonous as they get.",False
14,8,Beautifully written and Widely relatable,obeidallahmohmmed,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie, despite being based on a book, has a unique concept. A robot surviving and adapting in the wild is both whimsical and thoughtful. It captures the viewer immediately.The idea of an emotionally detached robot slowly becoming more human than machine through her interactions is intriguingly captivating. Not to forget the gorgeous illustrations and animation
Subtle but powerful themes about nature, empathy, and what it truly means to be alive.The only flaw is that some characters feel as if they are not quite developed for instance Pink Tale is a fun character and seems to have a nice background story, but it was only insinuated. Overall, the movie is heartwarming.",False
15,10,Chris Sanders strucks gold once again with an instant classic from a literary phenomenon that is Ruby Gillman & Cast Away meets Avatar & Iron Giant. A triumphant Masterpiece,craigmills-02167,n/a,15/08/2025,"Legendary Oscar nominated filmmaker Chris Sanders had triumphant in creating an instant classic in feature animation once again. After directing an adaptation of Jack London's classic The Call of the Wild, Sanders adapted an number 1 bestselling novel by Peter Brown called The Wild Robot, it's a heartwarming emotional tearjerking science fiction drama about a robot named Roz, who is stranded in a uninhabited island, and must learn to adapt the surroundings and have responsibility of adopting a young orphaned gosling named Brightbill.Sanders, who wrote and directed the film made the film a masterpiece, with his longtime collaborating partner and executive producer Dean DeBois, and producer Jeff Hermann, Sanders had joined forces with Dreamworks Animation, the studio that made Ruby Gillman: Teenage Kraken, to create this groundbreaking animated masterpiece.With Oscar Winner Lupita Nyongo in the lead as Roz, along with an all star voice cast, groundbreaking animation, and a heartwarming story that brings the literary phenomenon to life.The visual storytelling were influenced by films like James Cameron's Avatar films, Brad Bird's Iron Giant, Zemiecks's Cast Away and Kirk DeMicco & Faryn Pearl's Ruby Gillman Teenage Kraken while the emotionally character driven acting were also influenced by films like Nick Cassavetes's My Sister's Keeper, Tony Goldwyn's The Last Kiss, Nigel Cole's A Lot Like Love, and R. J. Cutler's If I Stay. Sanders, and the film's Head of Story Heidi Jo Gilbert had crafted a beautiful and heartwarming script and story that developed the emotional relationship between Roz & Brightbill, and setting a even more serious tone that no animated movie had ever gone before.The voice cast were amazingly well picked, with Lupita as Roz, along with newcomer and British sensation Kit Connor as Brightbill, Pedro Pascal as Flick, voice-acting legend Mark Hamill as Thorn the bear, Catherine O'Hara as Pinktail, UK sensation Matt Berry as Paddler, Bill Nighy as Longneck, Stephanie Hsu as Vontra, and Ving Rhames as Thunderbird The Falcon (a brand new character created for the film), they give their best performance that could give this film an potential Oscar frontrunner for best animated feature.Sanders had assembled a team of animators, artists, and VFX designers to create a revolutionary and groundbreaking style that was influenced by some of the recent innovations in feature animation with stylized 2d/3d hybrid looks to bring Roz and the world of The Wild Robot to life.The music and songs were beautiful written and performed, with Academy Award winner Kris Bowers chosen to write the score and songs alongside pop star and singer-songwriter Maren Morris performing 2 original songs written for the film, which includes the indie-folk ballad Kiss The Sky, which is very important to the film.The film's core message of tech, climate, survival and tearjerking emotional drama made this film a true winner out of all of the other animated films released this year.It's one of the best animated films of the year, an unforgettable landmark in feature animation since last year's Ruby Gillman.It's a winner.",False
16,n/a,One of The Best Pieces of Art Humanity Has Ever Created,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"The Wild Robot is a monumental film that in many ways transcends the medium of film into something greater - a portrait of universal human experiences.Throughout the film, a beautiful tapestry of human experience is woven - comprising the experiences of love, nature, connection and belonging. Almost every frame, through the music, through the colours, through the narrative and the composition and the environments, are able to communicate, in their own way, the essence of one of those experiences; and when they are put together they create something far greater than the some of their parts.Now this film, is not a masterpiece, but in my opinion no film or piece of art can be. In many ways it just serves as an excellently made 'kid's movie', with nice universal themes and Schadenfreude humour. But what's great about this film is that it's visceral; it's direct. And that is in opposition to many films that are just targeting an adult audience.A common mindset shared between many artists is that oblique complexity lends itself to high value art. That vague themes and narratives ushers the art into the club of 'high art.'But in part due to the fact The Wild Robot is a 'kid's movie', it avoids those pitfalls of obliqueness and is able to beautifully and directly convey its themes.And although The Wild Robot is a film, it has the essence of a tapestry, of a painting. In so many of the frames, there is a profound sentiment expressed. The frames pique a ruminative state, while also engrossing your emotions. It's truly something special to experience. And an experience I have not had before in the over 300 films I have seen.In terms of film-making techniques, originality and creativity, there are certainly other films that could be said as being superior. But in terms of visceral expressions of love, of human experiences and the ups-and-downs of connection - The Wild Robot is in a category of its own as a film. And I think it belongs with some of the best art humanity has ever created.",False
17,10,Absolutely and Breathtakingly Incredible,GordonShumway86,n/a,15/08/2025,"THIS is definitely director Chris Sanders' (of Lilo & Stitch and How To Train Your Dragon fame) magnum opus. A beautifully gorgeous combination of Wall-E and The Iron Giant that serves to prove that DreamWorks can still occasionally put out a quality product. Every single thing about this movie is absolutely filmic perfection. It's very sad that cheapo DreamWorks won't be making their films in-house after this one, because this film proves that animation can be pushed to it's limits in how amazing it can look. Even though the movie was incredible, I hope this will just be a special little once in a lifetime standalone feature. Even if the box office is high, I hope DreamWorks doesn't try to cash in with crappy specials and other cheapo things.",False

21,6,"Cute enough, but utterly undeserving of its praise",drfacetious,n/a,15/08/2025,"Once or twice a decade we get a movie that is ostensibly ""just for kids"" but still manages to be creative, original, intelligent, visually striking, and inspiring. From the universal acclaim directed at The Wild Robot I assumed we had a new entry in this category. Perhaps these lofty expectations were to blame for how deflating I found the experience of watching it. The first act is unique and quirky, and the edge is taken off the unsettling juxtaposition of modern technology with the natural world by a hilarious series of interactions between the titular Wild Robot, Roz, and the inhabitants of the environment in which Roz arrives, neither of whom have any ""programming"" to manage their encounters.While a cleverer movie could have run its whole course sticking to this intriguing limitation, The Wild Robot takes a sharp turn in its second act, in which Roz learns to communicate with the animals (who can apparently all also communicate with each other). Suddenly, the movie becomes a fairly standard parade of anthropomorphism decidedly lacking in original elements. Without spoiling the plot, the remainder plays out much like you would expect for an animated adventure.Part of me wants to leave it at that - my 6/10 goes into the pile and hopefully contributes to bringing the overall score down to something a bit more reasonable. It is ""just for kids"" after all, right? And it's funny and colourful and charming, I'm sure the kids will love it, so why rain on the parade? Because kids' movies are ultimately about ""the message"", and while this movie seems to pride itself on an inspiring message, that ""we can all overcome our programming and work together"", this is precisely what left a sour taste in my mouth after leaving the cinema.The ""inspiring message"" is predicated on the idea that, not only is nature apathetic to inter-species cruelty in the fight for scant resources, but /intra/-species cruelty and competitiveness is also somehow the ""default programming"". Never mind the co-operative patterns underpinning the survival of all but the most apex predators on the planet, or the countless examples of sacrifice and teamwork abundant throughout the animal kingdom. Even geese, who are the ""main character species"" here, fly in formations that prioritise collective protection in the real world. Not in The Wild Robot, where it's everybody for themselves, unless they learn otherwise.What a rotten message to teach kids. Co-operation IS our programming, it HAS to be, or we'd never have made it here. It is the modern world that breaks this programming to teach unkindness, not the other way around. And so successfully has it broken this programming that we treat this sort of messaging as ""inspiring"". What an unpleasant takeaway.",False

The writing is great. The absurd, yet accurately dark humor, parental comments from Pinktail, a mother opossum, (Catherine O'Hara) are so relatable. Her shocking statements make her character so enjoyable. The animators illustrate the emotional reactions of island animals to perfection. Roz's help initially causes more chaos than assistance. When Roz sees a beaver building a damn, rather than help build it, her programming tells her it's an obstacle and she destroys it. The beaver's response is priceless. The confusion and disbelief when Roz provides a sticker communicating that the task is complete is hysterical. These moments contribute to the humor and build on the character development of The Wild Robot as we watch her struggle to connect with the animals on the island. Her adventures with Fink and Brightbill create bonding moments and we see how belonging, acceptance and connection can be influenced by kindness.The Wild Robot provides an uplifting message of how belonging and acceptance come from one's heart. It successfully shows how kindness and caring are valued by all. Parents and viewers should be aware there are flashing and strobe lighting effects, loud noises and dark humor, which may be unsuitable for some viewers.I give The Wild Robot 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 12, plus adults.

23,6,Predictable and simple,rebeccagruber,n/a,15/08/2025,"The movie is beautiful, but paced very oddly. The story is predictable to the point where I felt I could close my eyes for a while in the cinema because I knew exactly what was going on anyway. The first 30 minutes I thought I was watching an animated short and I was wondering where it was going. None of the characters or developments are fully explored in a satisfactory way. Just as I thought an interesting plot point was getting worked on they moved on to something new. New characters are thrown in at break neck speed and disappear just as fast. It's essentially fast food - easily digested and will give you a dopamine kick, but leave you hungry again in less than an hour.It'll tug at your heartstrings, but more is needed for a memorable experience.",False
24,5,Did not like it like most people,akoaytao1234,n/a,15/08/2025,"Wild Robot tells the story of a robot who was misplaced into a mysterious island. Loss without a sense of direction, she bypassed her ""algorithm"" and developed a new sense of purpose when she found the remainder of a duck family she stepped on accident - and decided to be a family to it.The most shocking thing about this is it is so basic. People, on the downlow, reviews this is as one life changing movie BUT this is so beyond basic. Its literally how any Dream-works film goes that includes parenting. This also made me realize that I think the people wants just good and formal stories. Maybe the times had been just quite rough with this kind of family films where it is for kids BUT it can be enjoyed by older viewers - this is like that. Its such an serviceable family film you could replay in the background for kids.Everything about it kinda works but also feels so mediocre.The animation is good looking BUT I felt like the decision to make it paint-like (especially in the background) makes it quite a uncanny film to watch. Even the voice over work feels just fine. Its an acquired taste I guess. I wanted definition AND maybe true separation to be honest. Though this criticisms definitely can feel a bit of a personal thing, on my side.Not my cup of tea.",False

1,10,Straight through the heart,jayhopia,n/a,16/08/2025,"Growing up in Minnesota, specifically in the Metro area of Minneapolis, but having had a father that played hockey at Warroad '62 and then his family moving to Eveleth, thus my grandma's residence, this film was very moving to me.I thoroughly enjoyed Pond Hockey, but this film hit me hard in the gut! The Drone footage of the range and Hermantown was gorgeous! I loved this movie!The sound and music selection was A+. The usage of Bob Dylan in this film was the nail in the coffin..Cannot say enough of the emotional impact this film had on me on being proud of Northern Minnesota and the hockey life.Fantastic movie, the music, the story.. Damn good! Great job team!",False
2,10,"Hockey home on the Range, the best!",sewaisanen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I'm a hockey fan, and when your Dad is from just south of the Iron Range, raised going Up North & to the Range to see extended family. I was taught that is where, in the ""State of Hockey"" that it was born out there on frozen lakes & outdoor rinks. The footage of Eveleth & the Range was breathtaking, reminded me of all the drives in/through town. The same for the shots of Hermantown, and surrounding area of Duluth. The footage did an outstanding job capturing what a hockey family endures, the lengths it goes to (not just in drives for games either) for the boys, and how the community gets behind the team. It's games & teams like what this documentary showed, that are what I think of when I think of hockey. Families with generations of hockey history, who have it in their blood, and know it's about the level of skill & dedication. Also, a nice surprise to catch a glimpse of family in the film. Can't wait to stream and watch again.",False
3,10,Worth your time...,bryangonzales,n/a,16/08/2025,"As a hockey fan and high school coach, I loved this documentary. Great, but brief glimpse into life on the ice sheet, and the importance this game has for the boys that aren't necessarily going into the NHL. Sure, there's one or two of them that we might see in the future, but for most everyone else, there is a camaraderie and family aspect to the game that is unparalleled in other youth sports. I'd love to check in on some of these guys a few years down the road and see how the sport has affected their lives. If you're a fan of the game or know someone that is part of a high school hockey program, this film is worth the watch.",False

1,7,Impressive show overall,valthompson-90164,n/a,16/08/2025,"I haven't seen previous Fenty shows so I can't compare but I give this 7 stars for great choreography, body size diversity, Maxwell's performance, Winston Duke (huge crush) and the clothing really is stellar. On the negative side: Johnny Depp...really? He looked beyond uncomfortable and out of place and his inclusion threw the whole thing off for me. There are other issues with misogyny in a lot of the song lyrics but unfortunately that's expected so it is what it is. Overall, a showcase like this is definitely preferred over a cat walk show and we get to experience and enjoy hundreds of talented dancers and artists.",False
2,n/a,Fantastic show!,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love this show! This is actually the first time I've seen a Rihanna Savage x Fenty show and I was really blown away. I've rewatched a couple times now to catch all the details. It has so many great performances, singing, dancing, stunning fashion and it all goes by way too quickly lol. Loved the variety of music and it all blends together seamlessly. I was surprised by the combo of live action and animation-very cool! But maybe that's the usual style for this show?Lastly, what a fantastic guest appearance by Johnny Depp! So happy to see him in a production again. I wish his segment had been a lot longer.",False
3,10,Love this new style of fashion,myevilgummybear,n/a,16/08/2025,I love the new direction that the fashion industry is taken when presenting their clothing. And I love the fact that Rihanna chose to use Johnny Depp who was found innocent and was even awarded 10 million dollars for his defamation case. I've never been into stuff like this before but this is definitely something I will continue to watch to see the new styles and fashions that are presented. Keep Johnny Depp alive and bring him back for some more because whatever he's wearing we are buying. Everything she touches turns to gold so it would stand to reason that her having Johnny Depp on is a significant sign that he's back.,False
4,10,Mother nature!!!,nokuthuland,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerNo one can ever do Riri like Riri does Riri.She does not disappoint. Ever. The best show.I was so happy seeing Cara walk. Love her. She looked absolutely amazing.I loved Rihanna, but her not paying attention to the so called backlash, puts her on another level in my book. Love love love her for that.Narratives are dangerous. People don't even know who they are anymore because they have to support a stupid narrative even if they don't believe in it. Just keep doe you Riri & we will support you because you are unapologetically you. She gives absolute queen energy every single breath.Holy moly! Tara J. Sis looks so good.Now, I'm placing an order for something. Anything.....",True
5,1,massively inferior to the other savage x fenty,brian_spence_ni,n/a,16/08/2025,"Can we have more stars and more diversity? I watched this and I was straight-up bored. I'm so disappointed, as I loved every other savage x fenty. I felt most scenes just mimicked the earlier ones and it felt on an endless repeat cycle.This just feels like lazy, bad (I know that's objective but it was all samey) music without enough diverse and current references and with such a similar setting. Really little to no opportunity to showcase the new collection. Disappointed, and it puts me off completely from buying stuff from here. Please don't sit on your laurels in the future and focus more thoroughly on quality and marketing.",False
6,10,"Rihanna ruined fashion shows for other venues, she turned it OUT!",IdgeE,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is the first show I've watched and I'm all in. If I can catch the previous ones, I will.First...it's a fashion show, introducing Rihanna's latest collection. I tried my best to focus on the pieces and I love, love, love them! I don't know how much Rihanna actually participates in the design, but whoever the designers are have created something that literally made me cry. The collection is all-inclusive, meaning that there are pieces for curvy to extra thin people and they all look fantastic. It's so warm and cozy to see ALL types of people modeling the outfits. Sheryl Lee Ralph was hot as h-e-double hockey sticks.Second...it is a music video, featuring various artists' work and some of their performances. I really enjoyed watching Anitta. Daaaaaaaang! That was a hot scene. Also liked Maxwell's scene, it was very elegant and his outfit was nice. Didn't like the opening scene/music but I'm not hating on it, just don't like the message I think I heard, that's that.And then there's Johnny Depp. He looked cute, although a bit stiff. Loved seeing him and Ian Isaiah, that was nice eye candy for me. Actually, there was a ton of eye candy, everyone was beautiful.I'm about to go spend all my money on whatever I can from Savage X Fenty! This is a great line and I deserve it. Love!!!!Watch it, enjoy it if you dare!",True
7,3,Why so angry?,browneyedgirl911,n/a,16/08/2025,"I will admit the only reason I watched was to see Johnny Depp. Big fan of his. Boy did he look out of his comfort zone. He wanted to smile, but didn't dare because apparently in this fashion display you must be fierce, sexy and wanting it bad! It was so overly sexual that I found it amusing. Give it to me here, lick me there, all night oh yeah. Many of the lyrics would not allow me to post this. But you get the point. The dancing was just the same thing over and over. Very tribal and you must have a fierce look on your face at all times. No fun will be allowed here. How many different ways are there to hump and gyrate and punch the air? Well I think they found most of them here. It was too much. How about dancers laughing and having a good time, which btw is contagious. No these dancers all looked so angry. Perhaps they all had wedgies from the scant clothing/loungerie/sports gear/sexy time pants? Not sure what style of clothing this was. The only thing I enjoyed was how uncomfortable Johnny Depp looked, and the performance by Maxwell.",False
8,10,Johnny Depp was breathtaking,lylliemagic,n/a,16/08/2025,"The only reason I watched this show was Johnny Depp. I am generally not interested in fashion shows or lingerie. However, this show surprised me. Not only was Johnny's cameo absolutely stunning, the show itself was unlike anything I'd ever seen before. It was enthralling and fun. The vibe was unique. I actually enjoyed watching the entire thing. The choreography was actually very good, as well as the setting and of course, all the outfits. I also loved how incredibly inclusive this was, in ever way - gender, weight, age, race, etc. But most importantly of all: Thank you Rihanna for standing with a fellow DV survivor, Johnny Depp, regardless of gender, and regardless of the hate of MSM and misandrist ignorant people.",False
9,n/a,Choreography slayed,n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThe choreographer did a fantastic job. The movements and vibes are like that of wild creatures in the mystical world. The lighting was also so modern-looking.We see Rihanna make an appearance in one scene looking proud. One singer sings about how they are practicing making babies. I loved her outfit and her twerk! She dances with another dancer where movements are inspired by sex. Cara Delevigne and Irina Shayk took my breath away. I love how there are different body shapes and backgrounds. One woman with large breasts is shown being worshipped and adored by male dancers. Simu Liu makes an appearance. In the end during the mountain/hill scene, Lilly Singh makes an appearance in yellow. That's all I can remember off the top of my head but it is a must-watch!",True
10,10,Loved it,elaine-40954,n/a,16/08/2025,"I thought it was absolutely amazing. So creative and very entertaining. Absolutely loved that she had Johnny Depp in it. Survivors supporting survivors and im here for it! The music was amazing, the dancing was amazing, no one does it like RiRi. It's the first Fenty show I've watched and I'll definitely be going back and watching the previous ones. Thank you RIRI for having JD and not being afraid to show your support. We definitely need more women like her out here. I will be watching every future Fenty show and I'm sure they'll all be just as great as this one. The creativeness is amazing!!!!",False
11,10,Ohhh Chile!,crmickens-81226,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was the show. I loved every moment, outfit, person, size, color dance, EVERYTHING! Just left me wanting more. The music selections were great. Loved seeing Maxwell and his voice is everything to me. Ree Ree, congratulations honey, this was BOLD and BEAUTIFUL üòç. The dancers were phenomenal! Jhonny looked lost, but he still had swagg. The Makeup was on point with every theme. A round of applause to all your stylist, love all the hair styles. And the fact, that all the ponytails stayed in place throughout the dancing, honey i was empressed.ü§£ I can not wait to see what's coming next year, you already it's going to be Epic.",False

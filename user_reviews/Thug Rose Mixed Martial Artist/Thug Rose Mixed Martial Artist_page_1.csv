1,10,This really capture the essence of Rose and those around her.,viggoblix,n/a,15/08/2025,"Rose is an amazing person and fighter. A true Champion. She has overcome a lot of hardships during her journey and landed not only on her feet every time but also on the top.She finally got a full-length feature movie about her life so far. I am happy to say that this movie has struck the perfect balance between Rose Namajunas private life, and her life as a UFC/MMA fighter.This is a must watch for all Thug Rose fans out there. I am one of them. This is efficient storytelling, and it shows just the right length from each fight, and from each highlight from her life. And the transitions from one thing to the next is masterfylly executed. Rose shows great examples of her piano skills. As always when Rose is involved, there will become emotional, and this movie is no exception.We get to see new footage of Rose's family, dad, and from her childhood. She has really managed to surround herself with a great team, family, friends and fans. I love this movie. It really does justice to Rose's legacy so far. And as Rose saids: ""The best is yet to come!""Thanks for making this masterpiece of a movie.",False
2,9,"Movie, that takes evey minute of your attention",ievac-78323,n/a,15/08/2025,"One word - awesome. Director with lithuanian roots creates stunning documentary about fighter, good-hearted fighter, who loves and cares about not only sports, but her lithuanian roots, other people and even more than that. Movie shows amazing story about what it takes to become a champion in not 'girly' type of sport - martial arts. Starting with her childhood, that not always been a bed of roses, continuing with her first steps in martial arts and moving on with all the psychological factors, fight not only in the cage, but in your own head. As people say there are stories worth a movie and after watching this, I have to say - this is worth a movie. So, I would highly recomend to watch it for everyone, even if you are not interested in sports.",False
3,8,"A ""small"" woman with a huge enthusiasm worthy of respect",giedriusles,n/a,15/08/2025,"A documentary presenting the long and professional career and personal life of a fighter, showing different personal characteristics and experiences, which are very sensitive, some of which are strongly motivating.It is good to see not only the taste of victory, but also to know and see the risks of sports and health, because it is presented here in considerable detail.Rose herself is not just a robot, she is a very human and strong person mentally and physically, who has gone through a lot of life since childhood, which was more difficult than expected.I called it a good and meaningful conversation more than a documentary, because from the screen you can feel how much experience she has accumulated and how much you can get from it when it seems that you don't want to try to move anymore.It's disappointing that sport is heavily influenced by politics and any spoken word can be presented in the media in any way, even negatively, the more negativity. I'm glad that there is a compatriot who found a place under the sun, but I'm more glad that she didn't lose herself, so watch the film not only because of the Egyptian struggle, but what happens before and after it, a good and meaningful time is guaranteed.although Rose will not see it, but know - you are the best! You are a champion!",False
4,9,Inspiring lithuanian woman,megeeskimas,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerIntresting story, nice views, good person even her life was tragical she managed to be stong and the best in the world. Very inspiring lithuanian woman, it is pleasure to see Lithuania flag in such story! Also I think it is very good that producer and hero talks about Lithuania story, about our independance, how it is important and how it was hard to get. Also it was nice to see Lithuania in this movie just they could use more views from beautiful Lithuania nature to show everyone how wonderful it is because I think that a big part of this movie viewers will be from other countries and maybe they don't know where this coutry is so it is a good way to show them why it is nice to visit it.",True

1,7,"Guilty, well investigated by south wales police",innocentjack-75466,n/a,16/08/2025,"Anyone who has followed this investigation and indeed looked at the evidence from day one and the concise collection and presentation of it during TWO murder trials will know this man was guilty. I say was as he is now dead.It's a well put together account with original material and witnesses, of course an anti police agenda by those who cannot grasp basic information let alone understand it is included. But that's people all over the world. I couldn't help but notice that one of the 'anti' mob in the documentary had failed on three occasions to actually get in the police.It's worth a watch, it's a well produced account but don't rely on the armchair critics, because that's all they are. Untrained and generally unintelligible both verbally and in life. Rely upon the evidence collected by the investigation team which convicted this guy on two occasions. And rightly so.",False
2,10,Brilliant!,craigwalding,n/a,16/08/2025,"Absolutely fantastic documentary. I binged it all in one night. What I found particularly great is, its very unbiased. There's equal accounts and coverage on each theory. The four part docu-series takes you on a journey of all those affected by the horrific murders in Clydach. The interviews are very raw and very real. Harrowing too. A lot of time and research has gone into this. I have lived in South Wales all my life and the way they capture the distrust of South Wales Police is very accurate. No one has trust in police here. They have covered up and lied to the public countless times. This is explained well.Highly recommended. 10/10.",False
3,9,This was TROUBLING! But great!,GeorgeTinNYC,n/a,16/08/2025,"It lost a star because it leaves you open ended. Which drives me bananas. We, as in the viewers KNOW who did this. The only people I have sympathy for are the wrongly accused in jail (who then, SPOILER ALERT, died), their families AND the victims. It's one of those docs that makes you keep shaking your head, but you THEN realize this wasn't a murder in the 1980s THIS WAS twenty years ago!? How or WHY would an officer with experience and merit handle a crime scene in such a reprehensible way? ... apologies to jump around like this but TWINS!!!! I literally fell out of my chair at that revelation. However this was a tragic story that failed the victims, and demonstrated how a broken system will never really change unless by the hands of those it is created to protect. It was astonishingly reprehensible that this detective who handled the case was involved with the victim. I understand small town nonsense, BUT that is just insane. Knowing there's a possible link or MOTIVE between the victims and the Inspector leading the case should have been handled within the first day of this investigation.",False
4,10,The South Wales Police are full of it !,deepkut,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerI have such respect for law enforcement in general. But let's face it, at the end of the day they are human beings - men and women who are just as capable of making poor decisions just like the rest of us.During Episode 4, when the very smug South Wales Police Chief replied to the interviewer ""Why would a police officer kill a whole family ?"" For the exact reason i mentioned above. I had to briefly turn the documentary off. I was fuming. I mean what ? Like a police officer can do no wrong ??? I think we already know that's some bullcaca. It just seemed so obvious to me they were protecting one of their own. South Wales Officer Stuart Lewis to be exact. Neither he or his identical twin brother Stephen were PROPERLY investigated according to this doc. That same smug police chief in the beginning said something to the effect of ""Arm chair detectives think they know who did it but they don't have the facts... and we follow the evidence."" Only they didn't. And might I add his air of arrogance was so telling, as if it were his way or the highway.Now I'm not saying Stuart or Stephen (or Stephen's wife Alison) absolutely had anything to do with the murders or thwarting the investigation, however either it was the way this show was edited or there really was no solid forensic evidence that Morris, the man serving time for this crime, actually committed it. They kept harping on this gold chain with brick dust and green paint which seemed circumstantial at best. Bottom line for me is that it created enough doubt that I question the motives of South Wales law enforcement. It didn't help that the filmmaker referenced other cases where people were wrongly convicted of crimes after evidence was planted and reports were doctored by these very same officers who, once again, could and would do no wrong, right ? Ha !Production-wise, this was very well done ! Highly recommend this eye opener if you're a true crime aficionado.",True
5,9,"Good, but very frustrating",lindanikon,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerPsst. Spoilers.This was comprehensive and very much covered both sides of the question about the conviction of David Morris for the murder of Mandy Powers, her mother, and her two young children. Yet the investigation was so flawed, it's mind boggling. The review 20 years later lends itself to more questions than answers.It is incredibly infuriating that the South Wales police department was allowed to conduct a review of the South Wales police department. Truth be told, if Stephen and Stuart Lewis were innocent, the police overview would have been released to the public. I am, admittedly, not Welsh or a UK citizen, but I'm vexed by the idea that a larger investigative entity couldn't have handled the situation better.The documentary is excellent and asks the type of questions most will not. They certainly could have asked the necessary follow-ups that could have taken the South Wales police to task, but overall, it was an excellent watch in a time when so many true crime docs are incredibly one sided.",True
6,10,Amazing documentary in such a complicated cockup case?!!,kurt-coyle,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerOne of the best crime docs I have seen! Watch it and enjoy because every episode is huge with information on what happened in the timeline and what is missing in the timeline?!! Especially Steven's twin brother chief constable Stuart! A CHIEF with no checking in and lapse of a timeline for 2 hours and 55 minutes during the approximate murder time. And admittedly been to the house and possibly touched evidence, ... what the ?!?!!! They didn't focus on this enough for me especially as he was way out character for such a meticulous PC AND the Twin brother (also a policeman?!) of the wife having the affair with the victim!! Still I feel justice WAS served and an Independent Study of the DNA proved it! Wow.. didn't see that coming. SO GOOD SO ENJOY!",True

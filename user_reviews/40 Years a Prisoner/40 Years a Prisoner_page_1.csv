1,7,"Kinda fair, but",stevenkongju,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerHaving grown up in the Philly area in the 70s and 80s, I was curious about this film. I thought it was fairly balanced by showing how crazy MOVE was, but, in the end, showing the police brutality and blatant lying. Oh, and Ed Rendell, good save. I don't know whose bullet killed Officer Ramp, but I generally blame MOVE even more than the belligerent Frank Rizzo. After 40 years, I am good with the parole of Mike Africa Sr. and Ms. Sims (her name escapes me as I write, sorry) Mike Africa Jr. comes off really well. After his parents rightfully went to prison, somebody raised him well. Good for him and great that he and his parents, who now seem very different from the Move members of the 70s, have time together. The ""but"" in my title is the lack of follow-up in the documentary. And the balls to have Wilson Goode talking about police mistakes when HE was the one who authorized dropping the concusion bomb on Osage Ave. in the 80s. No mention of how MOVE again terrorized a community. LNo mention of how they forced the children to live in squaler. No mention of storing gasoline on the roof of Osage Ave.. More Death followed.",True
2,7,"""40 Years a Prisoner"" vs. ""Let the Fire Burn"": and the winner is...",paul-allaer,n/a,16/08/2025,"""40 Years a Prisoner"" (2020 release; 109 min.) is a documentary about the Phillie radical activist group called MOVE. As the movie opens, it is 2017 and we are introduced to Michael Africa Jr., who informs us that both his parents are in prison and have been since 1978. We then go to ""Philadelphia 1976"", as we get to know the MOVE headquarters compound, where a group of 10-15 adults and their kids live community style and basically have cut off ties with the surroundings. This is not what the mayor and other authorities in Philadelphia have in mind, and things eventually evolve into a stand-off and outright siege... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie.Couple of comments: this documentary is directed by Tommy Oliver (""1982"", ""Black Love""). Here he reassesses what happened to MOVE and its members, while also examining the long shadows of these events now 4 decades later. The documentary's primary focus for sure is on the events of the late 70s, but towards the end pivots nicely to today. What is really amazing is to watch the racist dog whistling from the Philadelphia politicians, and when you look at what is going on today in the age of Trumpism, one must conclude that things haven't gotten much better, if at all, now 4 decades later. Meanwhile, ""40 Years a Prisoner"" now serves as a time bottle of what (urban) life was like in the late 1970s. It ain't a pretty picture, that's for sure. All that aside, you may recall that in 2013 there was a documentary called ""Let the Fire Burn"" about another incident involving MOVE, this time in 1985. Like ""40 Years in Prison"", it uses archive TV footage extensively and it also makes for compelling if not incendiary viewing. So which MOVE documentary is the better? In my (subjective) view, it's ""40 Years a Prisoner"" by a nose, simply because it is more comprehensive, but in reality I'd readily encourage you to seek out both.""40 Years a Prisoner"" premiered on HBO a few weeks back, and is now available on HBO On Demand and other streaming devices. If you have any interest in. If you have any interest in a particular 1970s slice of life involving a radical black activist group, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",False
3,8,Moved me enough to seek out more behind what really happened,jrneptune,n/a,16/08/2025,The documentary provides a great deal of information around the group that was known by MOVE and how it started. It is focused NOT on the bombing of the homes they had moved to later in the 1980s.It leaves its leader or founder much in mystery and I wonder if that was done intentionally but that point isn't important to the primary focus. The focus of this documentary is about 8 people that would be charged and sentenced to prison for 30 to 100 years.It does a great job of showing how the Mayor at the time wanted to use the Police force as a tool for social change which rarely if ever happens. It also shows how the media had the chance to explore the story in more detail but too many times took the yellow journalism route. There were reporters that did examine the issue more deeply but they were being drowned out. Ultimately it was video taken by some brave reporters that nearly saved the day in the end but just like today even if you see the video and hear the story behind it it might not be enough for real justice. Which is where the documentary also shows the influence of Police Unions protecting officers even when obvious crimes are committed. I don't want to throw in a spoiler but when someone pointed out the hundreds of deaths in a year and over half were unarmed and person said coldly well they might have been armed so they deserved to be shot and killed it showed clearly what the attitude was then and even now.Also wondering if they had sought religious protections for their group. Knowing this is just one viewpoint overall it has made me curious enough to seek out more information about the history behind the group.,False
4,7,"A powerful, emotional documentary",Mysterygeneration,n/a,16/08/2025,"""40 Years a Prisoner"" is a powerful, emotional documentary that digs deep into the continuing legacy of the 1978 confrontation between black liberation group MOVE and the Philadelphia police. Weaving archival footage with present-day interviews, the director, Tommy Oliver, makes a finely wrought narrative that underscores the intersections of race, justice, and resilience. It is anchored by the relentless pursuit of justice by Mike Africa Jr., whose quest to free his parents-imprisoned for decades-brings a deep level of personal understanding to the greater political context. Heavy at times, the documentary never becomes inaccessible or alienating. It's an important watch for those who want to understand the complexities of American history and the ongoing struggle for civil rights.",False
5,9,This is powerful stuff...,aguilerakurt,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just another example of the ongoing war between minorities and law enforcement. No matter which side you are on, the standoff is intense and the fact that Rizzo perpetuated the whole thing says a lot about the government. A must see if you like stories of society clashing with the powers that be. Great music and interviews. I'm surprised at the rating of 6.5",False
6,10,That was a Sad time in Philly..,sharontinnin-14604,n/a,16/08/2025,I was in high school when all of this took place. I remember it all.It was sad that an officer lost his life but it was also sad how they treated the Africa family. Making babies suffer and killing babies because you don't believe what they believe or agree with their lifestyle. No reason for what happened to happen.I'm glad to see that the family could finally be back together. 40 years is enough time.I'm sure more if my home folks will see this and remember like I do.,False
7,10,"Corrupt Mayor Rizzo, Corrupt Judge Edwin Malmed And Corrupt Police Who Denied Killing A Baby!",silicontourist,n/a,16/08/2025,"The following is the belief of a very sad person with a lowlife attitude on morality and race! The reviewer 'pfleminglocal' 29 June 2021 thought this story of Political, Police and Justice system corruption was a ""JOKE""...as they put it. He/she said, quote ""They want u to feel sorry for these dirtballs lol everyone of them are scumbags"" unquote.The only scumbags in this documentary were Mayor Rizzo, who in a self promoting media grab, continuously poured fuel on the fire, the entire Philadelphia lowlife members of the Police force, a disgusting excuse for a human being known as Judge Edwin Malmed (who actually broke the law with the justice system rules in order to make sure a guilty verdict was passed; thereby denying the all white jury the right to make that decision) and the Parole Board members and Attorneys - over 40 years - who denied the MOVE members any rights; either Human, Criminal and Justice. And who for 40 years covered up the death of the police officer that day had come from another officers gun!A totally unbiased, and revealing, documentary of superb reporting and exposure. This is enough to make any fair minded, and good moral human being, be ashamed of being a member of such an evil and corrupt Human Race! Yet here we are in the 21st century of 2022 and the same Police brutality, murders and corruption have not changed one iota!",False

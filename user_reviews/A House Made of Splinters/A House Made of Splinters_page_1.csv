1,7,Quite heartbreaking and sometimes hard to watch,peter0969,n/a,15/08/2025,"Originally premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival in the World Cinema Documentary Competition Selection.""A House Made of Splinters"" examines the children and staff in a special kind of home: an institution for children who have been removed from their homes while awaiting court custody decisions. This documentary is pretty brutal and touching. The exploitation of children in the institution was well presented as the documentary focuses on how the children are being effected and their life isn't easy.The camerawork and presentation is very well done and the soundtrack fits properly to the film's tone. Each children that is explored give interesting discussions about themselves, their families and sometimes horrifying confessions of what their parents are like and what they had seen through their eyes. The documentary isn't entirely depressing with some nice wholesome moments where we witness the children experience happiness, but the overall lore is pretty depressing. There are some pacing issues halfway in the film and some of the music is a bit cheesy but for the most part, it was effective.For someone who has young relatives, this documentary was pretty tough to watch sometimes. But it's very important to be seen. I'd recommend it.Rating: B+",False
2,7,Fractured Families...,Xstal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Your parents prefer the bottle over you, like to drink themselves to death while they eschew, as you're a child you are then taken, left feeling totally forsaken, at a loss to know, what you are meant to do. At least the people at the house really do care, and all the other kids with which you have to share, but if those parents don't recover, no one comes along to foster, the orphanage, is where you'll find despair.It's a heart-breaking film that shows us the journey of several children whose parents addiction has landed their offspring in a world they never would have expected, although far preferable to what must have been hell on earth before. Located in eastern Ukraine, the story is one that can be told the world over, sadly.",False
3,8,Had my heart in my stomach the entire time,mickeythechamp,n/a,15/08/2025,"Road to the Oscars 2023. This documentary is nominated for 1 award and it´s best documentary. This doc floored me. I sat with me heart in my stomach the entire time and it might be one of the toughest watches I´ve done in a while. I think this is a really strong ""fly on the wall"" doc. Simon Lereng Wilmont really blends into the background and just let things happened no matter what they might be. He captures some really strong moments where you as the viewer can interpret them as you see fit. This is a tough watch as a fair warning, it had me constantly on the brink of tears and the subject matter of abused and forgotten kids is a heavy one.In an institute in Ukraine for kids whose parents can´t take care of them. We follow the every day of the staff and kids. Listening to their stories and see their outcome after the 9 months they can stay whereafter they either has to go to an orphanage or a new family.First, a few things I Didn't like about the doc. I really don´t like the current war is mentioned in promotional material and descriptions. This doc mentions the war once and what it does to the home and that´s it. This is a doc about the kids and their situations and nothing else. It feels like a cheap way to create interest and sets bad expectations for the doc in my opinion.I didn't like some of the more artistic shots in this doc either. Not the senary shots but things like ""this kid is gone; someone erases him from a board"". It seems a bit too pretentious and artistic for a doc so intimated and grounded in real people. I know it looks great when you capture shots like that and I would totally do it too, but you remind the viewer that someone filmed and edited this, and it can break the immersion to me. This doc is so good at being anonyms, keep that up so we forget someone is holding a camera.I really must applaud Wilmont here. He is such a patient and incredible documentarist here and clearly took his time with the kids and their situations. There are a few noticeable cuts but overall, it seems like Wilmont just filmed, stayed, and waited. This captures some real emotions from these kids and the patience it must have taken him to just stay on someone, so they'll forget his filming is incredible.This is a devastating documentary to me. To see these kids, their situations and feelings really floored me and I cried and had my heart in my stomach the entire runtime. To realize these kids will probably grow up with the same issues as their parents as the doc also mentions is devastating and the feelings the kids show are haunting to me, even when they are happy. There are so many things they say they shouldn't, they use a lot of adult words, they are mad, sad, and happy but in some really tragic ways. The way they play and talk to each other is full of violence, abuse that probably sound like their parents and one kid takes care of his siblings at the home, while also smoking, making tattoos and cutting. These kids are shown with their real emotions and even though they might play it up for the camera now and again, it seems like Wilmont captured them in a way that is so authentic and devastating.The doc has a really nice flow to it. It starts out showing some good stuff and then gut punches you with the reality of the kids lives and situations. The phone conversations with their parents, them saying goodbye, them being overjoyed when good things happen, the aftermaths of conversations where they just sit in silence and sadness. The doc really pulls you into their lives and your immediately pulled into their narrative and want them to succeed.I´ve praised the docs intimate nature and it´s all up to the incredible patience and camerawork. Wilmont is just an observer here. He doesn't want to intrude or say anything even when he probably wanted to stop the kids or ask them something. He just films and let things happen. This creates this closed off intimate feeling where the documentarist disappears and let´s the subject and objects speak for themselves.This is a reality check doc. It shows a terrible cycle of substance abuse and violence in the worst way possible. Even thought they want you to feel there is hope and a happy ending I just don´t really believe it. The doc shows a part of reality that is hard to swallow and digest, and when you see the state of these kids, it´s hard to believe there is a happy ending, but who knows.A house made of splinters is a devastating and strong doc. It shows so many powerful emotions from kids that don't need to feel them. It´s a sad watch that will leave you floored, and it has no Mersey. It´s also extremely well filmed and the approach to this doc is perfect for what it wanted to show.Oscar predictions: There are some really strong contenders this year for best documentary. I personally liked this more than Fire of Love but I would no be mad if any of them won. I haven't seen the rest yet, but as far as I can understand Navalny is also a strong contender. I want this to win so far from what I've seen and hey, it´s directed by a Dane, it´s nice t have some representation from my country at the Oscars.",False
4,6,A House Made of Splinters,CinemaSerf,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is quite a touching documentary that follows the lives of some young children who are not orphaned in the traditional sense, but who are subject to ongoing legal proceedings relating to their parents and guardians. For many of these boisterous and confused youngsters, this large hostel is the safest place for them to be - but with many very young and unsettled, the task for the facility's administrators is very much eggshell treading territory. It's set in Ukraine - before Russia invaded, but it could actually quite readily relocate to many places around the world where the traditional family units have long stopped functioning effectively - either as a result of neglect, or tragedy, or just parents who cannot cope with children with special requirements or behavioural difficulties. This institution is not a permanent solution, and as we are introduced to the kids we appreciate that their futures are all pretty fluid. Another orphanage? Adoption? Can siblings stay together? ""I just want to go home"" is a phrase oft said by boys and girls alike as they struggle to navigate this unwelcome uncertainty. The downside of productions like this, though, is keeping the camera in it's proper (discrete) place. Here, that doesn't really work and frequently the actions and reactions look just a bit too staged. How are you expected to get a genuine reaction from an eight year old when there's a camera crew adjacent? There are scenes of intimacy at which we simply do not belong, let alone need a front row seat for. The skill from the director requires us to see enough, but not everything - and to know when to call an halt to the intrusion of our observations. That skill isn't so evident here. There are some fairly characterful children though, and their professional carers really epitomise just how difficult it is to house and rehouse these lively and rudderless individuals when there is constant pressure on funds, space, time and on themselves. It's certainly worth a watch, but it could have benefitted more from some editorial subtlety and a more judicious sense of what we ought to have seen.",False
5,9,Very touching,till_mirami,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very touching film about children in a shelter. You get to follow some children during they stay, wich can be no more than 9 months.I liked the film very much and was touched by it. It would have been the same even in different times, but now when Russia has attacked Ukraine 10 days ago and so many suffer badly. Those children don't have an easy life and now also the war. Do they have food, water and heating? Are they still alive? Those thoughts came to me when watching. It's such a cruel war. All wars are cruel, of course.Thank you for this wonderful portrait of the children!",False
6,9,So sad.,destiny_west,n/a,15/08/2025,"I had to push myself to keep watching A House Made of Splinters, not because it was bad - it wasn't. It was because it was so heart breaking. Regardless of this being set in a Ukraine children's home, I think this documentary is universal as there are children going through this all over the world. Drug addict, alcoholic and abusive parents who don't give a damn about their children is something that is unfortunately wide spread across the world, it happens even in your own suburb probably.It was hard to watch these beautiful children going through such sadness. I would hate to know what they are thinking in their delicate minds, how unloved they were feeling, how abandoned they were.The staff of the home appear to do their best for them, but their hands are tied. They can't control useless parents.I think this documentary is a must watch for any parent.I hope that all these children featured are safe and having better lives.",False
7,8,"If Nothing Else, It Will Assuredly Move You",brentsbulletinboard,n/a,15/08/2025,"It's patently unfair that anyone of a tender young age should have to endure the pain of life's hardships. Growing up can be challenging enough in itself, but, when it's compounded by such difficulties as parental abandonment, abuse, the death of loved ones and war, one can't help but wonder how the children saddled with these ordeals are able to survive. Thankfully, there are individuals and organizations that are willing to step in and offer support. Such is the case with a special shelter in eastern Ukraine, located not far from the front lines of the Donbass conflict, designed to care for youngsters awaiting court and government agency decisions regarding their fates. It's a place of both hope and sorrow but, most importantly, a wellspring of compassion to help see them through these trying times. Director Simon Lereng Wilmont's Oscar-nominated documentary takes a candid, probing look at life in the facility, told through the eyes of residents and staff. This heart-tugging chronicle captures the joy of success stories and the sadness of those whose suffering never seems to end, as well as the courage of others who manage to soldier on in the face of their circumstances. It also depicts the keen sense of realism that the shelter's residents develop at incredibly young ages, an awareness of the world that they shouldn't have to face so early on in life. Their understanding of these circumstances ultimately either helps them cope with their conditions or sends them down paths from which recovery is nearly impossible, despite whatever guidance they receive from their caregivers. No matter which direction their lives may take, however, viewers can't help but be moved by their stories, an expertly developed and eloquently nuanced aspect of the film that comes through loud and clear. Ideally, the film would have been stronger with a little more background about the facility itself - how it was established, how it's funded, what drew the staff members to it - but, considering the essential nature of its mission, some might contend that such information is incidental by comparison. In addition, for those wondering about the impact of the Russian-Ukrainian war, it should be noted that this production was filmed before the start of the onslaught, but an update on the residents' status is provided before the closing credits. It's indeed tragic that this current conflict has only added to the already-existing list of trials and tribulations affecting these children, but, as the film observes, of all the virtues and vices present in our existence, hope is the last one to die, a sentiment that aptly reflects what this remarkable refuge is all about, no matter how difficult things may get.",False
8,8,A Heartbreaking and Eye-Opening Documentary about Ukrainian Children in Crisis,FilmFanatic2023,n/a,15/08/2025,"A House Made of Splinters is a documentary by Simon Lereng Wilmont, an Oscar-nominated filmmaker who spent a year filming four children living in a shelter for abused and neglected kids in Ukraine. The film shows their daily struggles, hopes and fears as they face the threat of being sent to a state orphanage or being caught up in the ongoing war.The film is not a conventional documentary that provides facts and context. Instead, it focuses on the intimate and personal stories of the children, who range from 6 to 14 years old. They are Marharyta, a shy girl who loves animals; Anjelika, a rebellious teenager who dreams of becoming a singer; Olga, a cheerful girl who suffers from epilepsy; and Sasha, a boy who has been traumatized by his abusive father.The film does not shy away from showing the harsh realities of their lives, such as poverty, violence, addiction and corruption. It also captures their moments of joy, friendship and resilience. The film is shot with a handheld camera that follows them closely, creating a sense of intimacy and empathy. The film also uses natural sound and music to create a contrast between the bleakness of their situation and their inner world.A House Made of Splinters is a powerful and poignant documentary that exposes the plight of millions of children in Ukraine and beyond. It is also a testament to their courage and humanity. It is one of the best documentaries of the year and deserves to be seen by everyone.",False
9,5,Banal,PedroPires90,n/a,15/08/2025,"They did it again! In a year full of bangers, the Documentary branch and the committee for International Film at the Oscars proved again that they can always find boring and pedestrian stuff to nominate.This issue is very important and the kids obviously deserve a better life, but this, as a documentary, doesn't deserve a lot. This is no better than any weekly documentary that you will see on your local TV. In fact, those channels wouldn't even make something like this because they wouldn't be able to keep the audience watching this for 90 minutes. This coming from Ukraine is the only reason why this got a nomination. A few cool scenes, but no structure, no commentary, it doesn't challenge you, and it doesn't make you think anything else than ""poor kids"".",False
10,10,What hope do any children have...,mmacgregor-09830,n/a,15/08/2025,"I appreciate documentaries as these ,sometimes feel it's all sad music and encroach emotions but..situations such as these happen all over the world,not just Ukraine.While heartbreaking,I felt after watching it,these poor kids will be lost in some system,probably forever. They seem as if they don't have a chance. Parents who don't care and children who are too young to understand that they could be forgotten and want to come across as tough,hard lined and would,hopefully,survive life.The staff are beautiful as they don't give up and genuinely care for these kids unconditionally,but know it's to no avail.Kids that age don't really know what's going on. In a house with others that are hardened to the reality that they won't leave,or simply return,they mould the younger to emulate them...some kind of legacy for them.For what is going on in Eastern Europe at the moment,it's a heartbreaking reminder of the lost,abandoned children of a war they will never understand and any war doesn't really solve anything ,conflict just holds a grudge against it's ""enemy"" ,only to to show its ugly head again years later and more innocents suffer.Beautiful but heartbreaking and I wish the women who run the establishment thanks for genuinely caring for these lost souls.",False

1,1,One Man's Gospel and Witch Hunt,maliahilden,n/a,15/08/2025,"The single writer of this film, Cary Gordon, is a third generation pastor and self-entitle president of the Cornerstone Church in Sioux City, Iowa. Cary's grandfather and father co-founded and pastored the church which is now under the control of Cary and his brother who is the ""Chief of Staff"" and oversees most majorly committees. After writing and releasing this divisive film which is bent on starting a cultural war with the church, it should be noted that ironically Cary is also the president of Peace-Makers Institute and Theological School.The film states that churches have succumbed to societal pressures and that this movement has its roots in Marxism and began with the influence of the KGB. Following the calling out of many churches, pastors. Seminaries and schools the website for this film created a ""Wokepedia"" listing of these same folks. It is basically a hit list and smacks of McCarthyism - a very dangerous road to travel.The film declares that all references, documents, information cited in the film are available on their website. They are not and have never been. This is ambush journalism at best. Secret recordings, interviews with people who have either been thrown out or have left churches, schools and seminaries is pieced together to make it look like a conspiracy. No one in authority is interviewed, schools and churches are not given a chance to respond to thes accusations.Ironically Gordon begins his film by railing away against creating dissension in the world, creating an ""us"" against ""them"" mentality and yet that is precisely what HE is doing. His brand of information is akin the the lefts definition of tolerance. ""They"" only tolerate what they agree with. The Scriptures are filled with warnings against creating dissension within the church (Titus, Ephesians, Matthew, Romans, Galatians, James, I Timothy...and on and on). Yet Gordon ignores these Scriptural admonitions and calls out person after church after school without citing factual evidence other than personal observations which are about as accurate as eye witness testimony.This is a hack job, not investigative journalism. And while there may be a serious point to be made here which is valid, this work does NOT have the research or the methodology to draw these conclusions at this time.I would not support the work of this man, certainly NOT his website with his hit list. This film is NOT worth viewing as its conclusions cannot be drawn due to a lack of quality investigative journalism.I would give it zero stars if I could. Don't see it. Don't support this work.",False
2,10,A film for every Bible believing Christian.,christianshields-67870,n/a,15/08/2025,"If you fear God and believe in His Word, this movie is a must watch. The shocking truths reveled in this film will anger you, shock you, and maybe bring you to tears. The filming, production, and interviews are above par in every way. But even if they weren't, the information presenting in this film... the smoking guns revealed are worth every penny. Don't sleep on this film.",False

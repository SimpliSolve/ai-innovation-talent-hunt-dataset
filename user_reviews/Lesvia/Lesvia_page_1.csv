1,10,"Amazing, deeply moving, poetic and powerful",ruthonearth,n/a,15/08/2025,"I love this movie! It is a poetic, sensual, political and nuanced exploration of a unique place on earth, the only truly international lesbian village in the world, Skala Eressos. As a ""double lesbian,"" filmmaker Tzeli captures the needs, longings, missteps, incredible courage and creativity of the women-loving-women who traveled to Eressos from all over the world in search of freedom and a homeland, and also documents the evolving tensions and growing reconciliation with the conservative Greek locals who at first didn't understand what a lesbian was, then thought only foreigners and not locals could be lesbians, and ultimately came to proclaim, ""To see two girls in love -- it's their right!"" Tzeli also shares bits of her own journey. I've seen the movie four times and will watch it again - each time it moves me in a different way. In addition to the story, the cinematography is just gorgeous, including sensuous underwater and landscape shots that will make you feel as if you're right there. Essential viewing for lesbians and anyone who loves us, as well as anyone fascinated by the sociology or cultural anthropology.",False

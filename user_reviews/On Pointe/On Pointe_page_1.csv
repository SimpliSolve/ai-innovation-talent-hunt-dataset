1,10,Why did it have to end?,MsDJH,n/a,16/08/2025,"I really wanted to know so much more! About every single dancer and teacher, the school, its history, the program. What a wonderful documentary series. A real treat for any current, future, former or wannabe dancer.If Covid cut this short, I hope they will reprise this eventually. There are just not enough shows out there like this about ballet in particular or dance in general. Positive programs that do not perpetuate the idea of fierce competition. Yes, the dance world, like any other artistic field is tough and requires skill and grit, but it's also nothing without good sportsmanship. Very well done showing exactly that!",False

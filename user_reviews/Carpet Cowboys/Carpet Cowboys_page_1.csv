1,1,I can't even,mightyjak,n/a,16/08/2025,"I watched this on a flight as I had endless time and low bar for what seemed interesting or entertaining. I've passed through Dalton and thought some weird deep dive into it and carpet would be weirdly interesting. It wasn't. I don't even really know what it was about other than a series of vignettes about people that were directly, indirectly, or tangentially related to the subject. I feel like this was long on production and flash and extremely short on content. I'm not passionate about carpet by any means, but I'm still confused about some of the recurring visuals, loose threads (get it?!), and discordant story telling.",False
2,9,Cute and sad but happy?,MsBananagrabber,n/a,16/08/2025,"I heard about this movie because of John Wilson (How to with John Wilson) since he is the executive producer of this movie, so because of that I kinda know what to expect but still didn't think I would love it this much.It's beautifully filmed and full of mesmerizing scenes, but what makes this movie are the lovable and eccentric people. Filmmakers really did a great job portraying them and showing us a glimpse of someones reality without much fanfare.It's such a warm human story filled with laughters, cringe moments and tears. If you are fed up with boring template documentaries this one is for you. I think it is the perfect watch for a slow cozy Sunday afternoon.",False

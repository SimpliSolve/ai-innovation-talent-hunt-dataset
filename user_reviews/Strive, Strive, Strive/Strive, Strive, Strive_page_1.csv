Football has the power to bring people together, and the community created by Clube Atlético Mineiro was strengthened in the fight on and off the field.The documentary shows that it is in the diversity of those who love Galo that the fans gain the strength to support the team in any scenario. The ironic parallels throughout Atlético's history make us wonder if everything in sport is in fact just a

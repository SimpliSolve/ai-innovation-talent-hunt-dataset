1,6,Will the real Paris please stand up...or leave?,MasterFantastic,n/a,17/08/2025,"While the title is somewhat unflattering, it's my perception of what Paris Hilton was and perhaps still is. Admittedly, it's a little hard for me to take anything Paris Hilton says at face value--at first.However, perceptions change. This was a revealing documentary, revealing in the sense that she suffered trauma and abuse as a young girl and then teenager, that she put on a public false front to conceal the hurt, that she surrounded herself with yes-people who catered to her every whim, and that part comes through quite well in this film.At the same time, though, what we see in her public face is that which we remember. And what we remember more than anything else is an image of a vapid, spoiled, not-too-bright socialite who comes from old money, who doesn't have to worry about where her next dollar is coming from, who flaunts her success to everyone willing to listen to her, and who makes it appear that she doesn't care what anyone else thinks because she's rich, rich, rich!Still, she likes animals, so that's one point in her favor.Yet...after watching this documentary, in spite of some of the revelations of her friends, her entourage, her relatives, and her own observations, I never really caught who the real Paris Hilton was and is. She's always come across as the living embodiment of spoiled WASPy privilege, and revelations in this documentary aside, she's not done much to alter my perceptions of her. I don't wish her ill; I wish that on no one.But I have a feeling that this youtube flick is simply another way for her to reinvent her public persona, to gain more followers to someone who should have grown up years ago, and to show another side of her personality without ever revealing who she truly is.",False
2,7,A surprisingly engaging portrait of an oft-misunderstood person...,mdw0526,n/a,17/08/2025,"I can't believe these words are about to come out of my mouth (or from the ends of my fingertips), but this Paris Hilton documentary is actually great. It's truly mesmerizing and well worth your time, and yes, I know, pass the smelling salts and get thee to the fainting couch.I've never been a big fan of hers, but I also wasn't that bothered by her antics. I watched ""The Simple Life"" back in the early aughts and was entertained. She then popped back on my radar after we watched the Netflix docuseries ""The Program: Cons, Cults and Kidnapping"", in which she appeared and then again when she testified in Sacramento a few weeks ago about her experience. That led to this documentary, which is an imperfect, though sincere and vulnerable portrait where she goes into more detail about her harrowing experience as a victim of the troubled teen industry. I have more sympathy for her and what she went through and while it might be hard for an heiress to change her image (leopard, spots), I think she's definitely not the worst person alive. There are so many more worthy contenders for that title.",False
3,7,She's Not Her Persona,stefstars,n/a,17/08/2025,"Growing up in the 2000's, I remember Paris Hilton being the ideal for many girls. She was a trend setter, she was attractive, she was always at THE places to be at. Yet, everyone figured she was a bimbo. Doing a show like ""The Simple Life"" just fueled that perception of her. While she pretended to be stupid in public, so did many regular girls. I witnessed that at my own schools. I found Paris funny but I was always more of an Amy Winehouse fan at the time. Another ""wild girl"" of the time but who couldn't be bothered with keeping a made up persona. Pretending to be stupid was never my thing. Something always told me Paris Hilton was not the vapid girl she displayed herself as in the public eye. This documentary confirms that.You can see that she struggles with letting her real self come out. The baby voiced Paris we're all familiar with comes out even when she's trying to let her guard down. That alone is enough proof of the trauma this woman has. Too many people might accuse her of being fake, but you can tell that she's uncomfortable being her true ""imperfect"" self in front of a camera. The real Paris with the deeper voice comes out when she's really into her emotions and especially when she's retelling the trauma of attending that horrible excuse for a school. Learning how strict and conservative her family is helps all of Paris' public decisions make sense. Another tale about how money makes no difference. All the riches in the world and the ugliness of life can still creep in.Yes there are times where her spoiled upbringing comes out, such as her talking about her large collection of shoes (some of which she never wears) or her goal of being a billionaire. This can rub the average person the wrong way but it shouldn't take away one's ability to empathize with her. No one deserves to have gone what she's gone through. This was a free spirited girl who was trapped by her parents and when they couldn't really do it, they had abusers in the guise of disciplinarians do the job. I think if her parents were more realistic and simply cautioned her about what comes with being a socialite rather than just treat her like a prisoner, she wouldn't have gone overly wild, and that's true of any child from any socioeconomic background.The documentary isn't perfect, it's not this cinematic or (youtube) masterpiece, but you certainly get a new perspective of Paris Hilton. I hope people listen to her story instead of instantly bashing her.",False
4,7,Even 'It Girls' are real girls,KittieC,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerThere are some really uncharitable reviews on here. Not necessarily about the film itself which is an ordinary production, but about its subject who, like it or not, is an actual person.Privilege shouldn't equal excuse but neither should it equal dismissal. Does Paris Hilton have a privileged, largely vacuous life? It seems so, and in fact it's pretty much repeatedly admitted by Paris herself. But that doesn't protect her from either injury, nor the long-term consequences that can come from injury, especially when they are inflicted on a child.Spoiler - Paris reveals, and is supported in her disclosures by multiple other victims, that as a child she was hauled from her bedroom during the night by strangers and taken to what might be described as a reform school. With the consent of her parents, upset by her teenage rebellion and it's stain on their conservative family brand, Paris tells of physical and emotional abuse. Her peers also refer to sexual abuse. In light of what we now know about institutionalised child abuse, these claims have a ring of truth.Now an adult, an insomniac, a work-a-holic, a recipient of domestic violence, and largely friendless, Paris' fantasy lifestyle has all the hallmarks of a seriously damaged young woman, albeit on a very luxurious scale.Enter the judgement of a lot of reviewers who can't get past the gowns and jewels to offer any sympathy to a woman who, to me, seems obsessively committed to creating a safe space she can cocoon herself inside of. All the 'stuff', the transient lifestyle, the collection of animals, the relationships with unworthy men, the creation of an alter ego - none of this will be unfamiliar to anyone who has spent time with damaged children who've grown to adulthood.The film itself is patchy and while I'm sympathetic to Paris, it is, as any autobiography is inclined to be, an exercise in curation and indulgence.Ultimately, it's not going to change any of our lives but maybe it could help Paris change hers.",True
5,6,Coming to terms with Paris,pietclausen,n/a,17/08/2025,"She comes from a rich family and like any family it has it ups and downs. Paris as a child always wanted to be in the limelight and over the years this has not changed. Contrary to what she says, she is still feeding her brand, this time seeking sympathy by telling the hard times she had as a child. But let's face it, Paris was out of hand and any parent would have taken steps to curtail this behavior. Perhaps Paris was badly traumatized at Provo and is reliving this to this day, but for sensation and dramatization, this viewer does not buy it.It is obvious looking at her over the years that she loves the attention and will always do as Paris does.",False
6,10,So much more than you would expect,haggiag-1,n/a,17/08/2025,This film totally surpassed my expectations. The documentary reveals someone who has been hiding in plain sight. It broaches deep and universal questions; and examines what fame and fortune look like in excess. I highly recommend this documentary to both fans of Paris' and those who wouldn't think this documentary was for them. It takes you to the unexpected and will leave you questioning what you thought you knew about all sorts of public facing personas. Simply excellent.,False
7,7,A good watch but weird timeline,jessicaelizabethbyrne,n/a,17/08/2025,This was an interesting documentary but the bit about where her trauma came from should have been closer to the beginning.,False
8,9,This will shake your perception of Paris,xlaim,n/a,17/08/2025,"I've long thought Paris Hilton was an intriguing character of modern Hollywood, and this documentary gives us true insight behind the curtain. Trailblazer of 'new fame' as we know it today. Paris' life - from abuse; to rebellious club kid; to the socialite and head of a multi-billion dollar conglomerate - is heartbreaking, inspiring and controversial.Well worth a watch, for fans and haters alike.",False
9,6,You may come away with a new appreciation for the heiress,Sir_AmirSyarif,n/a,17/08/2025,"A tad too long and disjointed at times, 'This is Paris' isn't as powerful or compelling as it might have been in more capable hands - or less produced by Paris Hilton herself. Still, the documentary manages to be a surprisingly sincere and shockingly vulnerable portrait of the ""original influencer"" who created the blueprint for a new breed of celebrity who uses social media to gain attention, and then turn that attention into their own brand. You may come away with a new appreciation for the heiress.",False
10,5,Left me still wondering who the real Paris is!,gold_nava17,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerIt seemed at the beginning we may finally be getting more insight about the real Paris but further on into the documentary you see that she's really not that much different from her dumb blonde alter ego (I'm not saying she's dumb). We see her natural voice is actually a bit deeper, she suffers from insomnia, she's more of a tomboy at heart and she has nightmares but that's about it. We find out she was sent to a series of strict boarding schools during her partying phase as a teenager which she tends to blame on mostly all her problems later in life. I had a lot of trouble believing one of the strict boarding schools she was sent to had her in solitary confinement just staring at a wall for 24 hours and that they beat the crap out of her when she was disobedient as she stated. She says she doesn't want to be seen as a reality star yet she has the audacity to unnecessarily throw in a bogus relationship and fake acting (which was laughable) in her personal documentary! I'm surprised she talks about how she wants to be a self made billionaire because all the average person needs to hear is a rich person talking about money *sarcasm*. I understand she wants to get more credit then just be seen as riding off her parents money but she was born to wealthy parents and got a huge chip on her shoulder in life and that helped her tremendously. The least thing I want to hear is how she wants more money or how she's never been photographed in the same outfit twice or even how she buys tons of stuff she never wears that just sit in her closet. She partially touched on her infamous s*x tape (which was the main reason she was a household name) but it was nothing that I didn't already know. I think she forgets she's playing a character so much that the character becomes her which she still played a lot in the documentary to the point I really feel like I still don't know who the real Paris is. It's like she acts like she's being forced to stay in her dumb blonde character. She still acts like a little girl that hasn't grown up at heart which she fully admits. I do love how she is always sweet to her fans and how she tries to stay smiling even through her hard moments which I do feel is genuine unlike The Kardashians but through the whole one hour and forty five minute film (which could of all easily of been condensed in less than an hour) I still felt like I really didn't get to see that much of the supposed real PARIS that she made us think we'd see in the promo trailer!",True
11,10,Very Brave,bethabrand-02816,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerTo talk about the abuse someone suffers in those 'schools' is very difficult. When other reviewers doubt it is abuse, it just shows that they have never experienced it and they are fortunate. Of course Paris gets to produce this film because the material is so incredibly sensitive. You are woken up in the middle of the night, kidnapped and brought to a boot camp prison in effect. Because they tell you that you deserve it and your parents, your protectors, agreed to it (or some version they tell the parents), it makes you incredibly vulnerable. They probably treated her worse because of who she was. And she suffered sexual abuse there which makes it all that much worse. Because of the shame, it's hard to talk about to a professional let alone the entire world. But Paris used her celebrity to speak up, advocate in Congress, and help get laws passed. It is so huge for the others who have no voice but also suffered in these places.And the story was told with a nice balance of the sensational and the practical. Paris is a celebrity persona, that's her job, and she's very successful at it but this story humanized her for those of us who only know the persona. Honestly, it reveals a lot about the business of celebrity and the filmmaker did it with a sympathetic eye. It's so easy to bash these women but this film was more objective about that part which was fascinating.",True
12,7,Sheds a new light on the Paris we know,PoliSci21,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerLike many born in the late 1990s, Paris was a distant memory of the embodiment of the ""spoiled rich girl"". She was ditzy, media savvy and cunning. I was too young to ever be interested about her life in the 2000s but presently, I viewed her nothing more than as a smart businesswoman who knows how to build a very profitable empire of her image similar to the likes of Kim Kardashian. In short, no one of particular interest to me but was living a very materialistic but presumably happy life.In the documentary, it reveals a lot more about her childhood and what triggered her desire to create this empire in spite of being perfectly able to live an extremely high standard of living with her inheritance and any money she would have made during the early '00s. Yes, Paris is an executive producer on the documentary which led me dock a few stars on the bias she would have had on the documentary and another was docked from the straying away but understable reasons behind not pressing more substantial questions on some of the interviewees. However, I think it's human nature to not want to see people suffer and be vulnerable when it's obviously painful, even if it's a rich, young, conventionally attractive heiress.In many ways, her fixation on accumulating wealth is tied to her painful adolescence, Yes, she went out partying at a young age (and probably dabbled into alcohol) but was it ok for her parents to create an environment in which her sister was placed into a very uneven dynamic where she was parentified and encourage to tattle on her sister, Paris? Some additional disturbing details such as the kidnapping her parents planned in order to send her this sort of rehabilitation camp for children who misbehave are also revealed by a clearly, still-shaken Paris. While a flawed argument for such a rash reaction could be made if the person was being harmful to herself and/or society, many, including I would argue that her family's ""legacy"" does not conspire to the same burden. If I were to have children in the future, I would hope to be in a relationship with my children that was close and where we could be honest and for them to not be afraid of me.If you still view her as just another rich socialite with no sense of reality and disposable, I hope that you'll at least take a page in how not to be a parent or a human being. For all of us in life, empathy is free and/or cheap and even a millionaire-heiress who has said questionable things in the past deserves some of it. I think it will be great for humanity if they saw the film and situations such as the ones mentioned in the film with some more empathy.",True
13,3,And the real Paris is pretty much the one you already know ...,smithnumber,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerI remember Paris from the 90s so was interested to see this doco. Anyway, it turns out the that 90s footage of club hopping Paris is the most interesting thing about it. What they've tried to do is build something out the the 'trauma' she suffered as a wild teenager when was was sent to a series of strict boarding schools where she was abused (exactly how is not really explained) and how this has scarred her for life. And now she wants to break the silence, speak out, show the real Paris and all that. The only problem is there isn't much real Paris to show. She just promotes products, flies around the world, dresses in sparkly gear and fights a bit with her boyfriend. But that's what we all thought she did anyway.She gets down a bit and has trouble sleeping - as would anyone who travels 240 days of the year. What isn't mentioned is how she built her business. Did she have managers? A team of promo people? How did it start? None of this is covered. There's a few interviews from people surrounding her, with glaring omissions such as her father, Nicole Richie and the guy who made the sex tape with her. It gets pretty boring in the last 45 minutes and I doubt many people would watch this to completion.I suspect this was created to help kick start her profile again but it's unlikely to have that effect. She's just not quite right for what people are looking at now. The 90s were a time and place and she was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time.",True
14,7,It finally peels away any glitter and star-fame from pure human existence.,thedarkhorizon,n/a,17/08/2025,"I was deeply moved... and I think this world deeply needed this message from Paris.

She rally gave you a VIP access to her VIP life, and the burden she carries. An amazingly privileged burden but it's there nevertheless.",False
16,8,Pleasantly Surprised,sharonpurcell-66265,n/a,17/08/2025,I'm in my 30s so I grew up watching Paris on tv & seeing her in the tabloids so I assumed this documentary would be the same old Paris persona but I was pleasantly surprised it was not that at all! I have a new found respect for Paris & I hope she continues to show her true real self.,False
17,7,"I am not in any way a Paris Hilton fan, but I couldnt help but being mesmirized by this documentary about her.",imseeg,n/a,17/08/2025,"I am not a fan at all and I just wanted to watch a few scenes out of curiosity and I ended up watching the entire documentary. And I actually really liked it! Quelle surprise!It is tough being rich and famous. Honestly.Did you know she cant sleep at night, out of fear being abducted by men who break into her room? Did you know she was tortured, beaten by therapists at a special school and almost froze to death?This is according to her very own words.Do we have to believe everything she says? She is known to be a DRAMA QUEEN.Her sister is featured in this documentary as well, as is her mom. Those 2 give some context to all the things that Paris Hilton claims have happened to her in her childhood. What is real, what is fake, what truth lies in between?I wasnt a fan of Paris Hilton at all. Based on all the media hype II simply thought she was another airheaded spoiled rich kid with issues. BUT I still got mesmirized by this documentary. THAT is the power of Paris Hilton. And she aint bad... she allright!",False
18,10,Brave and a survivor!,Ameliex,n/a,17/08/2025,"WOW!!!
I did not expect this documentary to be THIS GOOD. It opens your eyes. You feel the pain coming through the screen right into your heart.
It shows you that each and one of us, is battling something. No one knows what the other person is struggling with.
This documentary was very educational as well. Shows you that even celebrities struggle with something. Even if from the outside everything looks all rosy and wonderful, behind the curtains no one knows what pain the person is having.
After watching this I see Paris with different eyes now. She truly is strong. A boss lady! A survivor. A warrior. She is so strong. Amazing how she built this empire that she has now. The dedication and willpower she had to create all of this.
And her work ethic, wow.
Such a insightful and interesting documentary.
Some of the stuff that Paris talks about, a lot of people can relate as well. The anxiety, relationship issues, sleeping issues, body/image and trust issues etc. There is so many things we all can relate to. Paris might be rich and famous, but if you take away the fame and money etc, she is just like you and I. Also struggling with something. We all struggle with something. Regardless big or small.
I totally recommend this documentary. One of the best documentaries that I have seen in ages!",False
19,1,PR job,dreiz,n/a,17/08/2025,"This is all a PR job to change her public image. 'Unfiltered' yeah right. There had to be a plot revealing her weaknesses to make us empathize with her, to make us forget the two decades she spent cultivating the dumbness and vanity in people. Don't be fooled by low grade garbage like this, this is a PR stunt, not a documentary.",False
20,8,Privilege doesn't mean a life with no problems,purpletangerinepromotions,n/a,17/08/2025,"Ive never enjoyed shows like simple life or the characters that come with them... One thing I have always thought though, was that they are just that... Characters...Paris hilton is relatable and likeable... She's just a female adult who has past trauma and trying to make her best life... Unlike a lot of celebrities she does not appear to be self obsessed (refer to the lady gaga documentary for a perfect example... Just annoying) she clearly has a good soul and a heart of love... Sometimes I felt like giving her a cuddle. I'd be proud to someone like Paris as a friend or daughter...",False
21,2,Waste of time,mariabondarewicz,n/a,17/08/2025,"SpoilerA complete waste of time.
First of all, I believe that any intelligent human being realized from the beginning that this blond girl with blue contact lenses, walking like a robot and talking with artificially high pitched voice, claiming that she doesn't know what Wallmart is, is an act. Sorry Paris but we all knew. Even in Simple Life you sometimes spoke with your regular low voice so no surprise here.
I do feel sorry for Paris for having to deal with with psychotic men. But hey, some of us also have to deal with them but we have less money and time to feel sorry for ourselves.
Second, I don't buy that trauma stuff. I mean I do understand that it must have been awful being taken from your own bed by some strange people and I do believe that what they're doing there, in that school, is sick. But at the same time I feel like Paris should have gone to therapy a million times since then. She has all the means in the world to get the best help she can get to deal with trauma. What's more important, she has all resources to be who she wants to be, or to be someone who does something good for the world. And this brings me to the last thing. What really made me disappointed with this documentary was Paris' claim that she won't stop until she's a billionaire. As simple as that. No higher values, no other purpose. But one can see, and she admits it, that she's all about the money. And that's just sad. Especially when you think of her best friend's half-sister, who was named the youngest billionaire of all times. It must have hurt. And makes me feel like she just made another documentary to make more money. And she needed something shocking that would help her gain more viewers but it's not really as shocking as one may think. Yes boarding schools are tough, but so are public schools in bad neighborhoods.
After watching this documentary I feel like I was wrong.",True
22,8,A New Start,brynnkeel,n/a,17/08/2025,"This documentary was amazing when you read between the lines. For a woman who acted her whole life and pretended to be perfect, Paris is beginning to show who she is.There are people who say she is fake and is using this to promote a ""new brand"" but that isn't the case. She has never showed her faults and it's extremely difficult to do that after being the architect for a form of fame and a new type of celebrity. I loved this documentary because it shows that everyone has trauma and demons and it is extremely difficult to let them out after decades of hiding them.Cheers to Paris and I hope she is able to find true joy and sleep without the fear of nightmares.",False
23,10,The Not-So-Simple Life,kickseat,n/a,17/08/2025,"If you only know Paris Hilton from THE SIMPLE LIFE, or the sex tape, or her short-lived stint as a Hollywood actress in films like THE HOUSE OF WAX remake or THE HOTTIE AND THE NOTTIE, chances are you wouldn't care to watch an hour-and-forty-five minute profile on a vacuous, impossibly dim-witted blonde bombshell.I understand this prejudice because I had them. But it took Kim Kardashian to shake me of the idea that reality TV personalities are not to be taken seriously. And once I had this breakthrough, it didn't take long to add Paris Hilton to those ranks--and, no, I've never met either of them, so this is a working hypothesis.It would be one thing to put on a ditzy, skimpy-clothed persona, rake in millions of dollars via various revenue streams, and then fade away into obscurity. Though few people breathe that rarefied air, it's not impossible to achieve--especially if you have wealthy, famous parents.Sustaining a glamorous brand, however, takes endurance, business savvy, and a degree of self-awareness that absolutely cannot be faked. Think what you will about societal degradation at the hands of influencers who are famous for being famous, the truth is that Hilton and Kardashian are famous because they work at providing a product (themselves and the aspirational lifestyle they market to dreamers worldwide) and sustaining that product's relevance in a pop landscape whose features change by the news cycle.Director Alexandra Dean gets unprecedented access to the Hiltons (the ones who'll appear on camera, anyway), and gives audiences a front row seat to the exhausting whirlwind of a life that Paris maintains in pursuit of her goals. Throughout the film, she can be heard to say that she won't rest until she makes a billion dollars.Arguably, pre-COVID, her net worth was well over that--or at least the brand she and sister Nicky stood to inherit was well in that ballpark. So why claim that she needed to reach that milestone? The answer, as we come to learn, is that SHE wants to earn that money--to be her own woman and show that world that it takes constant fan outreach, tweaking the brand, and an unrelenting 250-days-a-year travel schedule to achieve larger-than-life dreams.That's one big key to Dean's successful profile. The other is the ability to capture Hilton with her guard down. Entire books could be written about the disconnect between Paris' bubbly public persona and her down-to-business backstage demeanor. The two give and take in fascinating ways, particularly in a brief stretch where we meet a new boyfriend. The culmination of that relationship at a music festival cracks the door of Hilton's guarded psyche even wider, and Dean transitions smoothly into the movie's final act--wherein a number of big puzzle pieces fit together in an ending that moved me in ways few films have this year.I'm being deliberately vague here, as I want as many people to see THIS IS PARIS unspoiled as possible. You may come away with a new appreciation for the heiress, as I did. Or you may believe Dean and the audience members who fall for the end product to be dupes who've been suckered by a manufactured and utterly disposable personality. Either way, it's impossible to absorb this movie and not see celebrity culture, politics, and even everyday relationships in a new way.To quote Ben Stein (or Jim Carrey IMPERSONATING Ben Stein, whichever you prefer), ""We all wear masks...metaphorically speaking."" So even if you believe there's something cynical and calculating underneath the blonde bob and pouty-model lips, there's no denying that there IS something there.",False
24,1,This Is Not Madonna Truth or Dare,fayandray,n/a,17/08/2025,"I was really hoping this would to shed light on a hidden layer of depth we've never seen. Unfortunately, beyond learning about her real voice, there isn't much. She tries to build up what she went through as suspense, then sell it here as a point of compelling interest. It doesn't work. I wish I could've felt sorry for the trauma she went through, but she's had all the money and more time than the average person to work through it. Quite blatantly, this is part of a continued money-grab in which nothing is offered for it. It wanted to be as good as Madonna: Truth or Dare, but fails.",False

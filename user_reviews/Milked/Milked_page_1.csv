1,9,Lies about Dairy exposed,Watcher49,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film shows you the truth about the Dairy industry once exposed they are willing to threaten your life. It also reveals the false benefits of Dairy.This film is well created taking into a count every side of the story from farmers to local to even the head of the industry. This that people are willing to lie and manipulate the truth to us just to keep their income and financial plan intact.Agriculture really leads to water pollution, Our planet is what we must look after.",False
2,9,A refreshing and quintessential film,robotchicken-80114,n/a,16/08/2025,"Milked is a film that easily sits on par with its contemporaries, following the general format of Cowspiracy/What the Health.There is something incredibly caring and sincere about this film. Chris Huriwai, the host, weaves together his own personal story with an animal rights and environment centered message and an often forgotten consideration for people in the industry.I am impressed at how well this has been edited together with the great range of topics and sources of information present. The pacing still works and leaves the viewer wanting more after.With stats abound and a great variety of interviews, there is plenty to be learnt here. However this documentary means more than that. It challenges the national identities reliance on the dairy industry and begins an important conversation towards resolve.A beautifully presented piece working to turn the tides of complacency and ignorance. Mahi nui.",False
3,10,Status quo not an option,phillipanewton,n/a,16/08/2025,"This film takes people out of their comfort zones to see the reality of the devastating impacts Dairy in NZ has on our treasured environment and the global climate crisis.It reveals how we have all been falsely led to believe in the benefits to our health and NZs economy this industry makes. Its a big wake up call and its powerful message will hopefully motivate us all to take a stand to save our planet, ourselves and the animals.",False
4,10,A 'Must Watch' Movie for all Kiwis (and Many Others),carldscott,n/a,16/08/2025,"Simply amazing. If I could, I'd give it 11 stars out of 10.I saw the trailers and teasers for this movie and I thought it looked pretty good. But when I saw the actual film I was blown away. It completely exceeded even my most optimistic expectations.It is bold and it is courageous. The NZ dairy industry is huge and powerful. Some people might even imagine it to be untouchable.But Aotearoa's largest exporter comes with some major inherent problems, and this movie isn't afraid to dive right in and ask the hard questions. It pulls very few, if any, punches.Although the movie's primary focus is the NZ dairy industry, in a broader more general sense it also leans into some much wider, and very serious environmental issues.It also investigates our food system in general and touches on some pressing concerns regarding human health and well-being which relate to the food we consume.Finally, it also explores some important issues related to veganism, plant-based diets, and animal rights.It asks the question, that with the rise of so many plant based alternatives coming on-stream now, are the animal industries becoming obsolete? And if so, what does that mean for our farmers?As a Kiwi myself, this is the movie I have been wishing someone would make for years. That is to say, a film which explores all of these issues from an New Zealand-centred perspective, yet one which is also relevant to the rest of the world.Someone has finally made it, and it is simply brilliant.It is very well shot, and includes some quite outstanding camera work. Many of the sequences must have been very hard to get, but they got them.The editing is excellent, and the animations and graphics are wonderful additions to the film. They make some of the more complex concepts and facts far more accessible and easy to understand.The music and soundtrack are excellent, and most of the people they interview are of a high calibre, sharing personal perspectives which are compelling yet relatable.It is definitely not an 'anti-farmer' movie. The film makes it clear that the farmers are just a part of a much bigger and very problematic system. We are shown that in some ways the farmers themselves are victims of the whole gigantic mess that is modern animal agriculture.I highly recommend this movie. I would love every Kiwi to see it. I think it has relevance to many other countries too. Especially those nations for which farming is a major part of their economy.This documentary has the potential to help generate and/or amplify some very critical and urgent conversations. Yet it does all that in an accessible yet powerful way.Did I mention that if I could, I'd give it 11 stars out of 10? Because I absolutely would!",False
5,10,"Well researched, brave and honest",petterssoncarole,n/a,16/08/2025,"You will be a better person for watching this film. It's not often that people go to all of this trouble for the greater good. In this case, the film has been made for the greater good of animals (including humans) and the planet. It offers a wake up call and an honest and well researched account of the wider impact of that tasty bit of cheese. At the same time, it is entertaining and beautifully narrated. Some of the stuff you can't 'unsee' - but you must see it to fully understand the impact the milk industry has on our health, the environment and cows.",False
6,10,Great environmental documentary,timmycooper-08917,n/a,16/08/2025,Highly relevant film that highlights the severe environmental issues in Aotearoa.Speaks with many stakeholders including farmers about environmental and animal welfare issues.Examines the structure of capitalist profit based agriculture and the challenges this creates for society within Aotearoa and globally.Focus on education of these issues and I highly recommend to all.,False
7,10,Fantastic Environment Documentary,bensudsie,n/a,16/08/2025,"A fantastic documentary that is a must see for anyone that loves animals or the outdoors.The documentary reminds you of the beauty of New Zealand, why we need to keep improving our environment and what we need to repair.Definitely worthwhile viewing.",False
8,10,Thorough must watch for all,kateklubienpage,n/a,16/08/2025,"This movie looks at this complex issue thoroughly. Anyone on Aotearoa New Zealand who loves to drink clean healthy water, who is interested in the impact of companies like Fonterra on our environment, who wants to feel informed about one way to mitigate climate change caused by the greed of big companies, who is interested in the welfare of animals, and who wants to understand the predicament that our NZ farmers are in, should watch this film.",False
9,10,"Important, relevant and hard hitting.",samidge-49361,n/a,16/08/2025,"Being an NZ citizen, it was fantastic to have such an important film produced that show cased the dairy industry in an honest way. We were able to see what has been predominantly hidden from the public eye as the dairy industry is such a backbone for NZ and it would be bad for business of the truth came out. However, without the truth, how can any consumer make an informed decision. This film was hard to watch as it brings truth to light, but it also provides a light at the end of the tunnel and offers insight that all is not lost.A much needed educational film that should be seen by all dairy consumers.",False
10,2,"Stretching cherry picked ""truths"" too far",KongMosaic,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was just another plantbased lobbying film who knows exactly what to leave out to make it seem believable to the not so educated masses.It's full of old numbers and stats and it's set out to be confusing enough to make you want to blame dairy for everything wrong in this world. It's somewhat sickening that it touches upon farmers' suicides for a sob story and briefly introduces cannabis plants as a mental health saviour. While the problem with pollution of water is extremely important and needs urgent solutions, it falls into oblivion in this film too due to the obvious agenda of promoting plantbased products. If that's a concern of yours, don't bother with this film. The scenery in the film is what gives it one star and the fact that it claims to want to at least highlight water pollution in the beginning gives it the other star. Other than that I highly do not recommend this film to anyone other than vegans who need to wake up to environmental causes. Sorry not sorry.",False
11,10,Top marks for excellence 100%,melclark-69871,n/a,16/08/2025,"Great to have a locally relevant, up to date documentary on this vital subject.Great cast, expertly researched and covered information we need to get to everyone.I'd like to see this screening throughout our entire school system.Thanks to Chris Huriwai for all his fantastic mahi.Kia Ora.",False
12,10,Fantastic Documentary,emilyjmajor,n/a,16/08/2025,"This was a stunning documentary with applications that extend far beyond just a New Zealand context.This film was engaging, informative, and eye-opening. The arguments were well-backed up and the film did a fantastic job at not blaming the farmers - instead, they place blame on the big corporations - Fonterra - cough* cough* - that are directly responsible for milking the New Zealand environment and being part of deplorable animal rights violations.I highly, highly recommend!",False
13,10,Dairy at the expense of environmental destruction and obscene animal suffering,annalouisedobson,n/a,16/08/2025,"This documentary frames the complicity of environmental destruction in Aotearoa with the Dairy Industry. The Dairy Industry in Aotearoa has been hailed as economic adrenaline when in reality the entire economic basis is as reality distorting, blinding, toxic, destructive, addictive and fatal as opiates to junkies. Fonterra is Aotearoa's biggest environmental polluter for the sake cow milk production at the expense of ground and water pollution, and methane emissions that send NZs greenhouse gas contributions into the stratosphere. This film is excellent.When the Aotearoa Dairy Industry's best defence is attacking their opponent on the form and not on the content of the film, you then know you have identified a very uncomfortable and undeniable truth. You guys are showing the truth. The dairy industries fight only gets more pathetic from this point on as they are on the losing side and refuse to accept their industry's major glaring problems that the rest of us cannot ignore. I recommend this film as a truth that everyone should be informed of. A truth that cannot be ignored.",False
14,10,"Powerful, honest, hopeful. A must see.",kiaora-34409,n/a,16/08/2025,"I went in expecting a tough watch but I was surprised. While some parts are tough to watch, it is hopeful. This film approaches many facets of the dairy industry and gives the opportunity for all voices to be heard. I especially appreciated hearing from the farmers who had some quite startling things to say about the industry. The film is stacked with leaders in their field.This film is important. It is well researched, genuinely interesting and I hope more people around the world are able to see it. I hope this helps to shed some light on what is really happening in the dairy industry and also to the potential for that to change.Finally, it's great to see this conversation led by Maori!",False
15,10,A Must-See Documentary for 2022,yms247,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA brilliant mashup of terrible realities and hope for the future. This spell-binding documentary of the dairy industry in New Zealand is current and necessary. It investigates the true impact of the dairy industry on the environment, animals, and people. At the same time, it brings in ideas to turn the situation around and hope for the future, ending in a call for action.",True
16,10,Brilliant Documentary,thesilvershopnelson,n/a,16/08/2025,"We went to see Milked at the Suter Gallery in Nelson we left feeling very satisfied to clearly see what is ahead for Nz Dairy Industry..
Such a positive ending ..
Please go see this brilliant insight into how we need to change both in Industry and our own personal choices to protect the Earth its Species and our own health..
For the past 8years I have spoken to many people in the Nelson Cbd so they get to see What the Health..
Racing Extinction.. Forks over Knives.. The China Study .. Cowspiracy.I consider Milked to encompass these documentaries and therefore would as a priority recommend people watch this great effort as a fast track to understanding the changes required to return to a clean healthy environment and body.A major upgrade to the excellent doco Cowspiracy and a inline with David Attenboroughs plea to change our diet away from animal agriculture quickly to ensure a halt to Species Extinction including our own..
All Respects to Chris and Samah and the production team..🙏🌴🕊🌴🐄🌴🐑🌴🐖🌴🐣🌴🦈🌴🐝🌴🌻🌴🐦🌴💕🕊",False
17,10,Don't look away,ilikeunicorns12,n/a,16/08/2025,"Extremely important film. Wonderfully made.With all the information available, staying ignorant is one choice. Your other choice will be uncomfortable at first. But for the sake of our planet, please make it.",False
18,4,Intriguing,osborneifert,n/a,16/08/2025,Good to grasp an understanding of people's perspective towards the dairy industry. Some very valid points that are easy to grasp from reputable people. Also some more dubious contributors to the conversation. A topic that still needs plenty of robust conversation.,False
19,10,Changed my world,francescalovesperfume,n/a,16/08/2025,"Why did it change my world? It secured the belief that working together, and making certain choices as humans that we will and can create a better world for all life on this planet.There's hard core facts alongside very moving human stories of how the Dairy industry in New Zealand (and glimpses of other countries) has become a very negative force. It really shows the bigger picture in a concise and easily understandable way. Needs to be shown in all Aotearoa's schools! Thank you.",False
20,10,A brighter future is on the horizon,neenalove,n/a,16/08/2025,This film takes you on a journey - a journey into the devastation of the dairy/animal agriculture industry and make no mistake it is utterly devastating on EVERY level; I guess I was expecting to see this.What I was not expecting to see were the solutions. There are new upcoming and innovative solutions that are like the dawning of a new day and there is no doubt that these solutions provide much needed answers. It's easy to see that the mass adoption of these solutions will be inevitable. I was left with the feeling that maybe there is some hope for us yet.If you have been concerned about the future of humanity and even if you haven't this documentary really is a must watch.,False
21,10,The Spotlight that needed to Shine on Dairy,truthqy-42848,n/a,16/08/2025,"It has been along time coming, the dirty New Zealand Dairy industry and the poor, hardworking farmers that are caught up in this huge mess. A very provoking doco that has been missing from the world stage until now, thanks to the courageous participants and crew behind the scenes for bringing forward what needed to be shown.",False
22,10,Must watch! The truth about dairy,hannahelizabethshelton,n/a,16/08/2025,"Fantastic documentary highlighting how detrimental the dairy industry is, not only in Aotearoa New Zealand but on a global scale.If you consume or buy dairy, or don't, please sit down to watch this to educate each other. It's factual and sad but it's the reality we are facing to urgently change farming habits. Dairy industries are hurting the earth as our home. It's harming innocent animals. It's significantly impacting our health.Must watch!! <3.",False
23,10,Essential viewing for NZ environmentalists,bgcjwmy,n/a,16/08/2025,"A country that markets itself as clean and green to the world actually hides a big dirty secret. This is the story of that dirty secret that our farmers, politicians and most consumers refuse to talk about. A must watch for all people concerned about our environment, ethics and future.",False

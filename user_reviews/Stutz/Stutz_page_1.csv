1,9,Johah and Phil .... Thank you for this,laserwiz77,n/a,15/08/2025,"It has been my experience that smart people seek out therapy. Further, highly intelligent people need therapy. Unfortunately the topic of therapy is taboo in the Unites States. If you think you may need therapy the chances are that you do. If you are confused about, can't find, afford or commit to finding a therapist this documentary is a great place to start. IMHO (in my humble opinion).While I'm not a therapist I have benefitted by seeing a therapist a few times during my 62 years on the planet and recognize the value in using the tools described in this documentary. It's relevant and not difficult or hard to watch. I applaud Mr. Hill for having the courage in making this documentary and want to thank Mr. Stutz for his insight and wisdom.",False
2,9,"Heartful, smart, awkward and funny",ardenderi,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a movie about relationship with some therapy and teachings.Although the movie does include some of the tools of Stutz and some ""demos"" of them, this movie is not a self help type of a documentary. The heart of the movie lies in the relationship between Phil and Jonah.I think it is good movie for all of us to watch for reminding of some basic truths about life and how minds work or can work. Overall though it is slight taste of these modern style therapy lessons and ideas.Technical aspects of the film are all top notch, brilliant look on the film and very good structure and flow. There are few clearly forced parts, but they are not that distracting.",False
3,7,A pearl with a turd in it.,timmyhollywood,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis is a tough one. A lot of reviewers here seem to have loved it; they've had an emotional response. I did, too. When Jonah brings out the poster of himself as a teenager and talks about letting that kid back into his life, I cried. I have my own 14 year-old self that I'm ashamed of at times, and have tried to disconnect from. That's the point -- many of us do.But Stutz is a documentary. And a documentary has a certain objective. Even in today's world, where there are docs about pretty much everything and anything, we still need to have some way to measure it. What was its aim, and did it work?Jonah claims he wants to make a doc about his therapist to share with others the great mental health tools psychiatrist Phil Stutz has given him. No drugs are mentioned (although Stutz, as a doctor, can prescribe), but basic stuff, like visualizing activities and reframing techniques. Things derived from basic psychology, such as Maslow's hierarchy of needs, or Buddhism's loving-kindness.Stutz, the man, is lovely. He's self-deprecating and funny and you have extra empathy for him because of the Parkinson's. The documentary peeks into his past a bit, but it feels like certain things are off limits, that even Stutz has a few guards up.The tools go by quickly, and there are a lot of them: Part X. Wave of gratitude. The shadow. The snapshot. Pain / Uncertainty / Constant work. The pearls and the turds. I found myself looking for a pen and paper. I wished we'd spent a little more time lingering on each one, or that there was a pause to summarize them at some point, to build a better picture of how Stutz works. For, he says, near the beginning, at the outset of therapy, he tells his patients he's going to give them tools so that they start feeling better right away. He guarantees it. It's a bold, unorthodox style, but it's not quite captured in the doc.I found myself wishing for more of a story about what state Jonah was in when he met Stutz, and actual, practical examples of how those immediate tools worked for him, and so on. Jonah says he didn't want to make the film about himself, but he's the patient of the therapist who's the subject of his film! It's a conflict that he has to soon resolve, or try to.About a third of the way in, a visibly anxious Jonah admits to Stutz - and us - that he's struggling with this doc. That it's been two years in the making (two years??). He reveals that they're sitting in front of a green screen, and wearing the same clothes, and he even has a wig because he cut his hair at some point. But after that moment, the wig is rarely, if ever, visible again. What was that all about?Again, I sense some truth being protected, or guarded. Why did this documentary take two years? Why does it really seems like it could've been shot in a couple of days? What held it up? Why, out of nowhere, is Jonah's mother brought in? What did that do? Why did I feel like I couldn't follow certain conversations, like the editing snipped a bit of context?I'm not suggesting anything was staged, but the conversation with his mother felt odd, at a distance. The weird joke about Stutz saying he ""banged her"" was awkward. Again, there's this distance felt between me, the viewer, and Stutz and Jonah, the subjects. It doesn't help that Jonah Hill, the person, is a bit hard to separate from some of his movie roles. In telling Stutz he loves him, I'm reminded of his character in Superbad telling his best friend Evan the same thing. He uses some words questionably, such as absolve and placate, and it contributed to an idea of someone playing a part, in this case a surfer dude caught up in a west coast wellness culture.Finally, near the end, the film veers completely from documentary to art house when Stutz claims he wants to lie down, walks into the other room, gets in a bed, and the green screen fills in with oceanic views. He proceeds to have some kind of vision, his eyes squinted shut, his mouth open, about his baby brother who passed away years before. It's all very interesting and touching, but again, nothing really like a documentary.In the end, Stutz, the film, never quite lets you in all the way. It's more mystery than reveal, more experimental film than doc. I applaud Jonah Hill sincerely for his willingness to be vulnerable and share his journey, but this felt, at times, inauthentic to me. And I say that not to be mean, or to just find something to criticize, but because authenticity seems to be something Jonah is striving for. There's that scene where he's looking at a picture of himself taken shortly after he started coming to see Stutz, and he observes how he seems stripped of anything false. I think he was trying to do that here with this film. Shot in black and white, with Jonah in a simple white t-shirt, the green screen laid bare without any effects, it seems to be yearning for authenticity in its aesthetic. But something -- some Part X, maybe -- nevertheless got in there and muddled it up.Maybe, then, it's just like Stutz said. A pearl with a turd in it.",True
4,10,Stutz's Tools,edwin-wks,n/a,15/08/2025,"Dr. Stutz's eclecticism is what makes him a formidable therapist. He was schooled in psychoanalytic theory, but has blended cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness and acceptance into a simple yet potent formula to follow.Step 1: Identify your Part X, a.k.a. Your inner saboteur. These are all the negative messages about yourself from society, community and family that you have internalised. They form barricades that prevent you from reaching your goals and attaining self-actualisaton.Step 2: Befriend your Shadow. Most people try to run away from their shadow yet the shadow is irrevocably a part of them. It is the side of you that you are the most ashamed of and the reason you are ashamed of it is Part X, the negative messaging. Be compassionate to the shadow by refuting Part X and loving all parts of yourself.Step 3: Beware the Snapshot. The snapshot is the thing that we think will finally bring us happiness once we have achieved it, and make up for past hurts and disappointments. Hill thought it was fame and success for him but soon plunged into depression when he realised that it did not make his shadow go away. The snapshot is a diversion.Step 4: Get out of the Maze. This is us holding onto old grievances, demanding that life should be fair when it is not. It keeps us stuck in the past, unable to enjoy life in the present, and contaminates the future. To get out of the Maze, Stutz advocates for Active Love.Step 5: Exercise Active Love. Embody the love that you wish to receive from the universe and project it onto those who have done you wrong so that you may forgive them for their actions. This is exercising kindness for yourself and empathy for those who have been responsible for your Part X, finally allowing yourself to let go and move on.Step 6: Use Radical Acceptance. Try not to resist your negative thoughts and feelings. Whatever happens when you get told not to think about a pink elephant? Instead acknowledge the pink elephant, tell it kindly that you will not engage with it and turn your attention to something more productive and rewarding.Step 7: Practice the Grateful Flow. Surmount Part X by reminding yourself the things that you are grateful for in life, no matter how big or small. This is like a mindfulness practice in that it helps us to ground ourselves and not be carried away by the incessant negative messages from the world.Stutz says that his biggest fear is not getting enough done before he dies. He has a website offering The Tools, but there is probably an opportunity for a book like the Happiness Trap, which takes people through the steps of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).",False
5,10,"The film I needed to see right now, or 15 years ago.",danwilberforce,n/a,15/08/2025,"I have struggled immensely with my mental health over the past 12 years and on a lesser scale the other 29 years of my life. I have had countless therapy sessions, more often than not with one of the sit there and listen, but don't contribute therapists Jonah and Phill discuss near the start of the movie and whilst they were great at allowing me to vent, the only therapists that truly made an impact on me, were the ones who would have an actual conversation with me, call me on my issues and help me explore ways I can improve my life.Stutz is the perfect example of this method of therapy and I am so grateful for this movie and the wisdom it imparts on us.Whilst the cinematography, editing and pacing of the movie are all great, what makes Stutz truly remarkable is the vulnerability and truthfulness found within Jonah and Phill's relationship. You can really feel the openness, love and respect between these two people, which allows us as the viewer to be honest with our own answers to the questions posited throughout.I doubt either of them will ever see this comment, but to Jonah and Phill, if you do see this, I just want to say, thank you. I related to so many of the stories and thoughts that you both shared and even found myself crying when responding to some of the questions you asked. I hope that this reaches as many people as possible and that people gain as much from it as I have.",False
6,6,"Fascinating Figure, Confusing Format",moritzlauper,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerStutz seems to have great lessons which should be heard from more than just his clients. I just can't really comprehend the concept Jonah had in mind.Honestly, I feel like he put his ego way too much in this. I didn't understand why his mother showed up. I didn't get why he had to do this whole ""plot-twist"" with the green-screen. That one just felt out of place.Jonah said the doc is not about him. But it feels like it is.Why didn't he just focus on the lessons of Stutz? The lessons were truly the most compelling part of it but it was hard to keep track of them.Jonah you are great, but there was too much of you in there.",True
7,10,There will never be anyone who has it all figured out,ASmithJackson,n/a,15/08/2025,"This is a beautiful film. The goal of helping people by sharing Stutz methods, has at least in my case, been met. I love that the film actually contains tools and actions that a person can use. As you watch, you can follow along with exercises that Stutz asks Jonah to do. The relationship between Jonah and Stutz is really special and as a viewer it feels like you're seeing them both so vulnerable and intimate. There is a real sense of honesty throughout. I also really enjoyed the visual aspects of the film. The film also has the perfect amount of humour. I will be rewatching this film and would definitely recommend it.",False
8,7,Couldn't shake the feeling of fake,siderite,n/a,15/08/2025,"The film is overtly about Phil Stutz, Jonah Hill's therapist, a person who is more hands-on than most other therapists - if he can say so himself - so much so in fact, that he encourages his patient to express love and reciprocates it. That's not bad in itself, I don't subscribe to the idea of the detached guidance-only role of the psychologist, but to watch an entire production dedicated to the strong bond between the two men, masquerading as some sort of sharing with the world of great healing instruments, was uncomfortable to me. It was pretty obvious that, while presenting a lot of things about Stutz, the film was not really about him, but about Hill.Don't get me wrong, I am sure Hill and Stutz were very real in their intentions, but the production itself, the way the patient-therapist relationship turned out to become, the specific (buzz) words and terms both people involved used and so many little details made me distrust the reality of what was presented. I am sure they believed in it and that they also felt it helped a lot, so I am not accusing anyone. I am just unsure they were honest with themselves to the degree displayed in the film.A good effect of the movie was that it generated a lot of honest self-reflection and discussions with my wife, which is something I will celebrate. And I also believe that ""the instruments"" they talked about are real, have power and can be turned to very good use. The overall feeling that I got, though, is that this is a little vanity project for a Hollywood celeb and that most of the stuff they said was bull.Bottom line: I rated it average because it did prompt some introspection and honest conversation, but I would not recommend it.",False
9,10,Therapy session,mcginleyskgg,n/a,15/08/2025,"I don't go to therapy. But this was kind of like going to a therapist. I paused it at several points to think about my answers (for instance my shadow). It made me think a lot about things I haven't let myself focus on and it was helpful to address those things internally and this gave me an outlet to do that. I appreciate the honesty shown by both Jonah and his therapist. Great job, great film. So rare to see truth captured like this I was really surprised how much I enjoyed it. Even if therapy isn't your thing I recommend giving this a shot I think it would surprise even the biggest cynic. The tools given are really life changing again I'm super grateful this was made.",False
10,6,"Technically nice, compelling. Absolutely not for me.",straylightrun,n/a,15/08/2025,"While Interesting technically, it ended up being a bit of a disappointment. I was very invested in the first 25m, which fell away to disorganized and unclear descriptions of ""tools"" and what they're for.Very much not for me, but I'm glad that others seem to be getting a lot out of it. I can see how alternate therapy methods appeal when the classic mode of therapy fails to produce tangible results for those who seek it.The relationship between the Jonah and Stutz is immediately obvious and very warm, but it just wasn't enough to carry me through the nonscientific and sort of....let's just say it, made up techniques to improve life.",False
11,10,They should do more documents or programs like this!!!,cemileatilan-30217,n/a,15/08/2025,This was really what i needed seeing things from a different angle. Second opinion. Different way to look at things. Learning to accept things we cannot change and live with it. It was really good i couldn't stop myself from crying. They should do like series of each method!!! Not everyone can afford to seek help and this would be an amazing way a platform to reach out to people. It feels comforting to know that we are not alone to feel this way. Everyone is going through things in a million different ways. I wish i had a chance to sit and talk or have a session with Phil Stutz!Thank you Jonah Hill!!! And Phil Stutz.,False
12,n/a,I knew it,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"Jonah Hill has always been one of those actors by which I was expecting a sudden big unconventional beautiful masterpiece: here we go! Jonah always felt to me so full of somehow trapped potential... This movie is touching, delicate, unorthodox, audacious, courageous. It's very contemporary in its essence, in its need to communicate something to trivial and yet so unreachable to many of us: life gets tricky at some point and you're well equipped to make it through: you just need to know how. That though, passes through knowing youself better, adamantly, embracing who you really are: bad bits and good bits. Watch it.",False
13,6,"Some good perspectives in a very messy, quick format",Im-Not-A-Critic,n/a,15/08/2025,"I went into the documentary expecting data based science and groundbreaking information and knowledge relating to mental health by a ""leading psychiatrist"". Not only was the information laid out too quickly making it hard to follow at times, the whole 1 hour and 30 felt super messy. The whole point of the project as said by Jonah was to make a film about Stutz, but they barely scratched the surface. We got nothing on his education or career, and while we did get some information on some terrible events in his life, it felt shallow. He didn't dig dip like I had hoped. The whole documentary oversimplified the extremely complex world of mental health and didn't dig deep into the why's, a question I consider of vital importance when talking about the brain. It did have some good points and a good message, but even the good points lacked data, the ""why's"". Other points were laid out in a confusing way and some of the tools didn't make much sense, like the ""sun-world"". You'd expect for a ""leading psychiatrist"" to understand the brain to a point were he knows how to lay things out in a clear way... He didn't touch at all on how the brain works and how trauma affects it, and instead gave band-aids to what could be deep mental issues requiring surgery (by surgeries I mean trauma-based therapies which dig deep into the subconscious). I feel like a lot of his points might help in the short term but might lead to complications in the long term. Felt very old-school and it felt like he lacked a lot of new information discovered over the past decade even I know about. If you watch this to learn about mental health you're way better off reading a book by top psychiatrists, or even watching free youtube videos for that matter.",False
14,5,Simplistic Therapy in a Complicated World,milksa,n/a,15/08/2025,"This may not be a popular sentiment but to me while Dr. Stutz has an easiness and directness about him as far as his communication style and ability to simplify his message, overall his therapy isn't.. challenging? To me, it all sort of boils down to a ""look on the bright side"" approach to helping people out of their anxiety/depression. Giving vs receiving; don't give up, etc. From his sun above the clouds metaphor to his stick drawings, none of this seems like rocket science, but I think his delivery and way of communicating the message is the real art here.The beauty of Dr Stutz' therapy style is that there are so many lost people in this world and especially in Hollywood who cannot see the forest for the trees that what he says and the way he says it comes across as deeply profound.Now I understand that 90 minutes of a documentary does not encompass Dr. Stutz' entire arsenal of therapeutic skills, but I almost feel like Jonah Hill's obvious love and affection for this man who has morphed more into a father figure/mentor than therapist, took away from diving deeper into HOW his therapy tools really help others. Jonah Hill has been helped. That's obvious. But I still don't feel like I understand how. It can't just be from stick drawings and envisioning yourself giving love to others.. can it!?After seeing this documentary I'm torn between wanting to know/see more from Dr. Stutz to figure out if there's something more profound there to just believing that maybe some people have a better ability/tools to resolve their own anxiety/depression than others.",False
15,10,"Powerful, refreshing, healing, inspiring.",zywickih,n/a,15/08/2025,"I recommend everyone watch this movie. I respect Jonah Hill so much for making this, especially in todays climate, and also for being a MALE raising awareness on the tremendous help and importance that therapy provides. There are so few resources available to people who need mental health support, and many of those resources available are crazy expensive or therapists are booked solid with clients. This film is for everyone. We all struggle sometimes. This made me cry, laugh, and take notes. I will go back to this movie every time I feel the need for a therapy session. It also reminded me of my relationship with my counselor that I went to for ten years. Bless Jonah and Stutz. What a gift of a film.",False
16,10,"Perfectly imperfect, but it was constantly moving forward",Moviedude90,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThe irony about this movie is it exemplifies the way Stutz' therapy is meant to be practiced-imperfectly, but constantly moving forward.The other ironic part about Stutz is he spent so much of his life trying to figure out the roadmap paved with tools for other people to use, he didn't stop to use them on himself, and did what so many others do which is turn to comedy to detract and emotionally procrastinate. He is so good at developing his craft, so much so the terms and ideas sounded like he had a script or a teleprompter, but in at his 50+ years of evaluating the system, he rarely if ever used it on himself; it took Jonah Hill making this movie to get him to actually make real changes in his own life and relationships.Lastly, did you get the feeling when he was lying down on the bed, and Jonah asked him to articulate whether he could see his brother, Stutz responded that he wasn't young, ""he is more like your age,"" what he was really trying to say was he saw Jonah as what his brother would be like all grown up. This really became clear to me in the last few scenes when he told Jonah in an unsolicited manner that he loved him, again using the 'world of the suns' tool and emanated love.A really well made documentary because it wasn't well made; it was actually documenting the raw journey by constantly moving forward. And I'll never look at Jonah Hill the same again-really became a person and not a caricature for me.",True
17,n/a,Inspiring and enlightening,n/a,n/a,15/08/2025,"A human and sincere emotional film shot masterfully in black and white, in few scenes resembling Cuaron's ""Roma"". Even that it's filmed during ""one"" therapy session and in a closed studio space the film never gets really boring or claustrophobic. Maybe because of the themes that inspire us to reflect our own lives or the humility of the subjects in the film (each with a very personal story that resonates a great deal with everyone trying to make sense with what life brings). The precise editing and visual effects, the drawings and music of this film makes us often ""fly"" outside of that confined space and add to the quality of the conversation. One can feel that right from the beginning this film brings a feeling of calmness, unpretentiousness and being in the moment. But it will also surprise us at different times. Near the end it carries a sense of relief for the authors but also for the viewer that it was made, so that these profound ideas could reach even more people. This film is maybe more than anything else a sincere portrait of the relationship of two different humans that bonded through therapy in difficult times, sometimes the therapist being also the patient.",False
18,6,Pearls and Turds,betneal,n/a,15/08/2025,"Watched twice and took copious notes. Some of the tools were excellent others meh.Even after Jonah decided to open himself up he held back. I wanted more realness and vulnerability from him, however, the biggest turd in the pearls came when Jonah's beautiful mother joined a session. She was being very real, open and honest about how she treads lightly when having talks with her son. She felt she could not be totally herself with him out of fear she'll say something wrong that would cause him to think a certain way about her. It was particularly interesting to me because I feel exactly the same way with my only son who is highly sensitive like Jonah. My son is the only person I hold back with when I deeply long to be free to be myself completely and share openly without my guard up so I was eager to see where the discussion would go. To my utter disappointment Jonah quickly and completely blew off her feelings in a placating manner while Phil sat awkwardly offering no assistance to Jonah's mother, than out of the blue, Jonah thinks a good idea to land Phil's joke about banging Jonah's mother. The in poor taste joke by Phil should never had made the doc, period, but since it was not cut, Jonah's betrayal by outing Phils unfunny joke with his mother present was beyond inappropriate. Jonah did exactly what Phil did when talking about something uncomfortable by deflecting with humor except it was not even remotely funny or cool. I felt sad for his mother and could clearly see Phil's awkwardness and urgent need to shut down that session as it was ""devolving"" at that point according to Phil. I did think the genuinely funny moment, and the person who saved that awkward joke moment, came from Jonah's mom who said ""you'd remember if it was me"", in reference to being ""banged"" by Phil. Jonah's mother is a quick wit and that was a brilliantly funny retort. She saved that session single-handedly!Stutz was enlightening on many levels, imperfect on many levels, and full of turds and pearls.",False

20,6,New Genre and Insightful BUT Distant,jertenenbaum,n/a,15/08/2025,"Somehow ""Stutz"" manages to be vulnerable and distant at the same time. The last scene where Stutz and Jonah Hill acknowledge that they have gotten closer feels rational, not emotional.Above all, the movie is about their relationship (between S and J) and not so much the stated-purpose of sharing with the world some tools that Stutz taught Jonah Hill.Hyper-rationality...

22,7,Good but not great,mason25,n/a,15/08/2025,"This movie was never going to receive a 10, just due to how therapy goes.It DID do a great job of summarizing it though, as well as showcasing the process of healing or the path to healing.No the same path won't work for everybody, if it was that easy, we all would've been on the path to begin with since someone long ago would've found it and passed it on. So what you get out of watching it may not be the same as what someone else gets out of watching this movie.Another review commented on the movie being ""genuine"", well that's just how any movie is going to be, because they do have the ability to cut and edit it together however they like, as well as tell us it's the truth when maybe it isn't. It doesn't really matter if it IS the truth or not, what matters is if they were healed by the same process with whatever they might not be telling us about.It really loses points for a double edged sword effect here.1. The movie feels marginally more focused on Jonah Hill, but it's presented as if it's BY Jonah Hill FOR Dr. Stutz.. so I feel it misses it's mark there.2. Would this movie be watched as widely as it will be if it had have been ""just some Dr. With just some patient"" .. fk no. You, me, and 90% of the viewers who chose to watch it, chose to watch kt because it's Jonah Hill. So whilst it misses the mark because of point 1 above, it also gets distributed to a much broader audience because of it, since from a marketing stand point, I'd call that a win.In the end, the move was good, and only marginally let down for reasons beyond it's control because of the medium being a movie with a time restriction.JONAH HILL, if you're reading this and ever want to chat, my username at Hotmail.You seem like the type of celebrity that would be down to earth enough to message someone for their input l/opinion.",False
23,10,A must-see,bevclews,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerThis film was thought-provoking, interesting, moving and gritty. It was like watching an intimate dance between Hill and Stutz as they moved from showing vulnerability to being defensive, often using humour to do so. The tools, for me, are a side issue the real content of the movie is the relationship between the two of them.Spoiler: it seemed to me that the movie started with Stutz in the driving seat, the definitive therapist with very strong boundaries. Somewhere in the 135 minutes, not too sure where, it began to pivot until the tables had turned. A significant point was when they had a conversation about vulnerability and going deeper, and that is what happened.I am a therapist myself and loved the film's exploration of the therapeutic relationship, but I didn't need to be in order to love this piece of art.As the credits rolled I thought, ""this will win awards.""

They also seem to think they are the first to practice visualization and to use tools in CBT. There is something half naive half insincere in this, the pouring of the hearts in front of the camera, the mutual acknowledgement of all the work done and all the progress, the intervention of the mother in a documentary that the director insists is about the therapist, the tender moments ... it all, at the end of the day, lacks geniunness, as anything that is performed in front of a camera with a full crew watching, and then edited, does.

1,8,The man you never heard anything about,kosmasp,n/a,16/08/2025,"No pun intended - every once in a while an actor comes along that is quite intriguing. Maybe not for the right reasons .. but still. I would not say that Cliff was a great actor ... but was he enticing? Was he able to make you like him? You bet he did.So if like me you had no idea who this is, watch this documentary and then seek out the movies he was in. Bad movies I reckon - all of them. But bad as in being entertaining .. with a lot of quotes that will make laugh out loud ... and then some. And while he is a Brit I do not think this is something only interesting for those in the UK ... this is a documentary for anyone who loves movies. Who understands the passion behind making them ... who just enjoys making them ... like Cliff was ...",False

3,1,Why the dubbing?,Sennara,n/a,16/08/2025,Can you just let people talk in their languages? Why dub over with English? Extremely unnecessary and irritating. Why can't you give people an option to hear the people's real voice?,False
4,9,Music was dope,boogieburger,n/a,16/08/2025,"What a great perspective from the people of the nighttime Tokyo. It was very inspiring seeing people being themselves and enjoying one another without the conflict, angst, and skepticism we have to deal with in the US. Music was nice too.",False

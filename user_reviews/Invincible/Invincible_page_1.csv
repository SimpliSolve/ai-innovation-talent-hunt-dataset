1,7,A reasonable effort.,philip-00197,n/a,16/08/2025,"Kolinski, pretty much, ticks all the boxes when it comes to making a documentary. The art of storytelling certainly is in place as we follow the career of; polish, female MMA fighter Joanna Jedrzejczyk. A reasonable anount of detail is covered with regard to what aspiring champions have to endure in order to reach their goals.The dramatic edge is also there as we follow Joanna through some of her fights. Arguably deeper insight into her rationale and a more personal presentation would have been beneficial - as character development is a bit sparse.If you are looking for a compassionate insight into the mind and world of a fighter - you may find that ""Joanna Jedrzejczyk"" falls a bit short. If, on the other hand, it is a glimpse into ""behind the scene"" footage of the build up to, and actual, fight you are looking for - Kolinski delivers.Footnote:
This film appears with three different titles - which may be somewhat confusing. It first appeared on IMDb under the title ""Joanna Jedrzejczyk"" it was later changed to ""Niezwyciezona"". On HBO it is currently titled ""Invincible"".",False
2,n/a,"It's like watching a great feature film, and sometimes like a thriller!",n/a,n/a,16/08/2025,"If anyone hasn't seen it yet, it's a must-see, it's like watching a great feature film, and sometimes like a thriller! I have seen all of JJ's fights and I consider her to be the best Polish athlete of the last decade. Interestingly enough, remembering the reaction of the fans in the stadiums and the bus-sized billboards of her on the main street in Vegas. She is probably more appreciated in the US than in Poland. It's a fantastic film which I've been waiting for a long time. And for those of you who think that MMA is just smashing each others faces, maybe you'll learn something and change your mind after watching it.",False

1,6,Kinda like having a crazy aunt,eunbi0530,n/a,16/08/2025,"Odd show, it starts off messy and all over the place, most part in the middle is cohesive and fun, but by the end it starts deviating from the cohesion and gets chaotic again and it just ends?She feels like a crazy fun aunt, some of the stuff she says are funny, others feel like ""things that happen to you when you get 'old'"". I had some good laughs, other things I related to what she said, but they weren't necessarily funny.It is alright, all things considered.",False
2,8,Cristela is gem and her material rocks - except for the almost-mandatory identity politics stuff,muratmihcioglu,n/a,16/08/2025,"After seeing a great deal of the bunch of comics endored by Bill Burr bomb terribly on stage, I was kind of losing trust with NetFlix' taste.Cristela Alonzo saved the day thanks to her energy, mostly-clean humor which requires more intelligence, and her smooth way of commandeering the audience.Her previous special (seen also on NetFlix) was also highly notable. But this one is even better because the way summons the jokes has progressed notably, also thanks to the financial progress in her life, which she generously uses as brand-new source of humor.The visit to the gyneacologist, the way she opened the gif pack from NetFlix while in dialogue with the cops... All are genuinely priceless and one needs to be Cristela Alonzo to actuall experience these situations. It is very smart of her to carry on stage her ""changing"" self as the backbone of the show.The only thing that bothered me was how she resorted to certain classical praisal of speaking ""politically correct"" - we no longer need endorsement of PC culture on stage, even if we may need PC culture to capture a few more fronts. Addressing people's amazement at ""not beling allowed to use certain words"" by saying ""it was never okay, you are just learning it wasn't!"" just does not line up with the authenticity and the spirit of her humor - especially not after she makes use of ""shades of white"" as she tells her story of immersing in white-dominant circles. It is funny as hell to hear her make point of how ""white"" some people are, to the extent that she thinks she is encountering a ghost delivering a message from her dead grandma. Given THIS is okay and welcome, so should most of the stuff PC culture has selectively been shunning.Cristela is a highly intelligent woman and I believe she will climb further the ladders of stardom. She deserves it.",False
3,7,Refreshing,Ani_,n/a,16/08/2025,Finally a female comedian that isn't talking about vulgar stuff the whole time... gets old.. most these days talk about the same things over and over again and they think the more vulgar they get the more popular they'll get.She is good. Has original content & stands out.,False
4,7,Kind of racist.. but that's okay.....,NullUnit,n/a,16/08/2025,"Just to point out how racism IS seemingly ""okay"" at times.....Many of the jokes rely on skin tones which differ from her own... so.. well... is that not the definition of racism? It would certainly be racism for any white comic to tell a string of jokes based upon the skin tone of others.I'm NOT condemning the ""white jokes"" by any means. My point is, I'm white... I found the jokes slightly racist.. and also quite funny at times. I can laugh at myself and my race. I wish everyone could.It's NOT an hour of ""white jokes"". That's merely a couple pieces. She does delve into other things - aging, health, some self-deprecating stuff, etc.. so It's not like the entire hour focused on race.I laughed.. thought this was a funny set for the most part.",False
5,9,Cristela is new to me - and a riot! (A good one...),thejdrage,n/a,16/08/2025,"This program popped up on Netflix, and I had nothing to lose except time, so I watched it. And was totally entertained and laughing for an hour. How refreshing!She is one of my new favorites. I like it when people make fun of themselves and their situations - without making everyone feel bad, but laugh at the humor of our lives. She is adept at crafting things I've done a thousand times and making them interesting (i.e. The internet). And don't leave out a trip to the doctor's! We've all been there - you have to admit it!I look forward to seeing more of her! One reviewer said she uses old material, and I know how disappointing that can be. Am hoping she takes his words to heart and discovers some new stuff to toss at us.Bet she will - she is obviously one smart performer! And that's another reason I rated this 9 stars - it's whip smart.",False
6,4,I get a case of Deja Vu,camelon-24012,n/a,16/08/2025,"My title is due to fact that I have heard most of these jokes performed before and there only funny the first time. This was another show where a comedian sticks to what she's good at but these days it's not funny anymore. Needs to get out comfort zone as if your telling jokes, nothing is off table no matter your leaning. I gave it four stars as if you are watching comedy for the first time, you may get a laugh but if you have been watching for year's you will turn off after 5 minutes as other reviewer hit it on head when he said the first part of the show she is all over the place. Just a grab of money with no thought put in.",False
7,1,She's trash,luticrist-75086,n/a,16/08/2025,"Bad enough she's introduced by one of the Castro's but she immediately jumps into exposing her ignorance and stupidity with Covid ""jokes"". She's a moron and not remotely funny. I liked her ABC show back in the day so I gave her a chance. Don't waste your time.",False
8,4,Not suited for my sense of humor...,paul_m_haakonsen,n/a,16/08/2025,"I think I've seen one show from Cristela Alonzo before, because she seemed somewhat familiar. But if I have seen a show of hers before, I must have erased it from memory. Regardless, I sat down here in 2023 to watch her 2022 stand-up comedy special ""Cristela Alonzo: Middle Classy"", as I found it available on Netflix.First of all, I will say that Cristela Alonzo definitely is a charismatic woman, and she does have a lot of energy and feels naturally at home on the stage and in the spotlight.However, I must also go on to say that the material and jokes she delivered in ""Cristela Alonzo: Middle Classy"" just wasn't really catering to my particular sense of humor. I found the show sort of dull and monotonous, and she actually failed to bring me to laughter throughout the 60 minutes that the show ran for. Yet I did manage to endure the entire show, oddly enough.My rating of ""Cristela Alonzo: Middle Classy"" lands on a four out of ten stars.",False

1,9,Entertaining In Every Way A Film Can Be,zkonedog,n/a,15/08/2025,"I've never watched a car race in my life. I have absolutely no knowledge of the historic events surrounding the Ford and Ferrari motor companies. None of those two things mattered in my viewing experience of ""Ford v Ferrari"". Not only does it allow the viewer to be a complete clean slate, but it provides the utmost of entertainment on almost every front.For a very basic overview, this movie tells the story of how the Ford Motor Company was struggling in the 1960s and thus turned to racing cars to give their image a boost. The problem? For years, Ferrari has been the gold standard in that theater. But with Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) overseeing the project and the volatile Ken Miles (Christian Bale) in the driver's seat, they set out to take down Ferrari at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.One of the main strengths of ""Ford v Ferrari"" is that it tells a bunch of different stories within the basic framework. Not only is it the clash that the title anticipates, but also a story of personal redemption for Shelby, one of personal goal-achievement for Miles, and even a healthy dose of ""big corporation screwing over the little guy"" thrown in. All of those angles are very distinct, with nothing muddled along the way. The 2.5 hour runtime really helps with this, allowing such arcs to play out in their entirety.The acting is also incredible from basically the entire cast. Bale gives a unique, quirky performance as seemingly only he can, Damon is solid (as always), and everyone else does their part admirably. Especially affecting are Miles' wife Mollie (Caitriona Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe), who both provide much of the sentimental emotions present in the film. A specific scene where Ken explains to Peter exactly what he does on each individual racing lap is as good as acting gets.There's also a never-ending sense of forward momentum and just overall fun to ""Ford v Ferrari"". It never takes itself too seriously, yet it isn't a comedy. It's long, but doesn't feel that way due to the expert pacing--a perfect balance of pulse-pounding action scenes and slower, more emotional scenes within the understated 1960s period feel. Director James Mangold probably deserves a good amount of the credit for making this all congeal together as well as it did.Overall, this is a spectacular film precisely because it can hit audiences in so many different ways. Whether through the action, emotion, true story, or underlying themes, most viewers will be able to find something to enjoy here. Even if, like I said before, no previously knowledge of racing is present.",False
2,8,"""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this.""",jordanucsd,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI've seen a lot of car movies, as a self-professed car nut. As such I judge them harshly, and immediately dismiss entries that don't provide enough reason to care about what is more important than the car: the driver. Think of the Fast and Furious and Transformers franchise. If you care about the driver, and the driver cares about the car, you care about the car. The car is a tool, an extension of the hero's body, and gains provenance with the audience when it helps the hero on their personal journey. Movies that come to mind that do this effectively include Gone in 60 Seconds, Bullitt, Need For Speed, The Italian Job, Batman Begins, and The Bourne Identity. Some of the James Bond movies do it well, like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loves Me, The Living Daylights, and SkyFall, but many do not because of the lack of character arc in the story. We cannot forget about perhaps the greatest car movie of all time, Back to the Future. The shining example of how to make the car a proper star.And now enters a film by James Mangold and starring talented actors Matt Damon and Christian Bale called Ford v. Ferrari. My arms crossed, and expectations lowered, I was ready to be disappointed. Although I love Mangold as a director, somehow I assumed there would be a Michael Bay approach to the movie, putting more emphasis on car action sequences than the characters. To my surprise, not only was I dead wrong, but the film became one of the best car movies I had ever seen.Thinking back, I should have known better. Unlike many car action oriented movies, this one is based on a true story, and fact-based dramas tend to take themselves more seriously. It is sort of a shared biopic between legendary sports car designer Carroll Shelby and race car driver Ken Miles. The movie focuses on their efforts to beat Ferrari at Le Mans, a story I'm well aware of (like I said, bonafide car nut). And Mangold is an Oscar winning filmmaker collaborating with Oscar winning people such as Damon and Bale.And boy do their talents shine in this movie. The driving engine of the story, if you will, is the loving but at times clashing relationship between Shelby and Miles, portrayed brilliantly by Damon and Bale in a manner that in my opinion is more entertaining and engaging than the dynamic duo of DiCaprio and Pitt in Once Upon A Time ... in Hollywood. Damon and Bale have different styles of acting, but both arrive at the same place: creating a character that faces disappointment in the search for victory.Shelby has to come to terms with the disappointment of having to quit his racing career due to heart problems, and creating a winning team at Le Mans is his way of proving to himself he's still a winner. Miles is desperate not to disappoint himself because unlike Shelby, he's never had a shot at winning at a big race. This is due to his abrasive personality, despite an amazing talent on the race track. On top of this, Miles desperately doesn't want to disappoint his wife and son, who support him fervently in his dream. Both characters have their own obstacles in search of escaping disappointment, with Shelby dealing with the suits at Ford and Miles dealing with problems of the car in the race as they present themselves, and the trial of besting the other race car drivers. Their individual struggles intersect in the mutual desire to win at Le Mans, resulting in a brotherhood and mutual love for each other that feels genuine and earned.Henry Ford II, played by a very effective Tracy Letts, reveals in a quick but moving scene why he wants to win at Le Mans. After Shelby takes Ford on a whirlwind nauseating ride with the new race car they have engineered, Ford breaks into tears. Not so much because of the physically jarring experience of being jostled around at breakneck speed, but because of what the car means to his family name. ""I had no idea. If only my dad were alive to see this,"" he tells Shelby. Damon, in that scene, responds with wet eyes. The character Ford reveals how much he doesn't want to disappoint his family legacy. In fact, the entire endeavor started with an insult from Ferrari, stating, ""You're only Henry Ford the second, you'll never be Henry Ford."" And in an earlier scene, Ford compares himself to his legendary grandfather in a speech to Ford factory workers concerning his disappointment in current company sales.Cars represent man's desire to chase a dream. Whether it be designing the fastest car, or driving cars the fastest. And despite all the obstacles that may get in man's way, the biggest one is always himself. But with perseverance and the help of others, this obstacle can too be overcome. Ford v. Ferrari manages to get to the heart of this message with deceptive ease and supreme confidence. The film's absolutely gorgeous cinematography and direction capture some of the most amazing car sequences ever put to the big screen. A surprising but believable behind the scenes factoid is that Mangold and the cast are not car nuts at all, and were simply moved to tell the story of the characters. This is why the movie works so well, because they understood the car as supporting the story rather than the other way around.Ford v. Ferrari is an absolute winner, with memorable performances from its cast, and my favorite Mangold picture thus far. For me, it is one of the best of the year, and as far as car movies go, one of the best ever made, and miles away from a disappointment.",True
3,8,Racing with a soul,agm_tcr,n/a,15/08/2025,"As a Ferrari fan I was pleasantly on the side of a Ford driver, all because of the soul Christian Bale was able to portrayed as Ken Miles, a sports car racing engineer who's hart was beaten in unison with an engine of a race car. Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene. The passion take us to the circuit and made us push the accelerator. What I miss is the surprise of the plot since I knew the story. The cast is brilliant, and finally in one Americans movie I have the pleasure to see casted Italians brilliants actor for the roles of the Ferrari Team, speaking perfect Italian, as oppose as being disappointed when they cannot.

5,10,As close as possible to the truth but!,nickfarf-42699,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI was at the Philadelphia Film center premiere on 11/11/19 to view this terrific movie. At the age of 68 and a tifoso of Ferrari since age 8, ( 1959 ), this movie hit a nerve. Truth vs Fiction. This was a David vs Goliath movie, however Goliath wins. The movie recreates a golden era of auto Racing. It was seriously dangerous with death and injury a guarantee at every race. These drivers were absolute warriors and we're fearless. Now Ferrari winning LeMans six straight years in a row from 1960-1965 is actually the David in this movie. Ferrari for all their dominant winning form was still a tiny company that sold fancy $15,000 sportcars to support his racing team. Winning LeMans was a $16,500 team prize. These Ferrari drivers were salaried. The prototype class at that time was wide open with no upper limit on engine size. There was an under 2 liter class that Porsche and Ferrari dino control, but the over 2 liter was unlimited. I read carefully about the Ford move to acquire Ferrari, as daily news reports would cross the associated press. The movie is spot-on about Ford cars lacking desire back then. Chevrolet had the Corvette, Corvair and sporty looking Impala and Chevelle. Now Ford is the Goliath in this movie. They are the big corporate giant with unlimited resources. Ford paid for the Ford GT. It was really a Lola Gt with a Ford badge put on it. Ford put their name on every innovation provided by all the racing/equipment suppliers that went into that race car. Unlike Ferrari being designed, engineered and built handmade in that Italian factory. Ford spent more money on developing a racecar than the total price to buy Ferrari outright. Hired every Nascar team to provide expert pit crews, engine builders and offered 80,000-100,000 to each driver for one race . Now the movie, it's a movie that non race cars fans can and will enjoy. It shows how Shelby and Miles are really the heroes of the winning team. This was true. Their relationship is spot on in the movie and they know what is needed to win. They battle off the track against Ford executives and against Ferrari on the track. What is not disclosed in the movie is the quitting of the Ferrari ace driver John Surtees. When he left Ferrari, the team was devastated. He along with Ford's Ken Miles were two true warriors. Also not shown but lightly covered in the movie is the three years of disastrous outing for the Ford racing team. Did Shelby steal the Ferrari pits stop watches? Did Shelby actually throw spear lug nuts into the Ferrari pit lane to make the Ferrari pit crew think that the race car was missing a nut on the car out on the track? Did Enzo Ferrari actually tip his hat to honor Ken Miles? Who really knows. Everybody is dead. I remember the lug nut rumour in the 1960s, as that was a southern stock car trick. I never heard about the theft of Ferrari stop watches by Shelby. As far as Ferrari tipping his hat. Ferrari was known for or not attending many races. All that aside, did I as a Ferrari fan enjoy this movie. My answer is a Yes, Yes, Yes. With the exception of James Garner in Grand Prix, this is the best movie to deal with the sport of autoracing. Bonus is that it is also a great human interest story and they create the mood of the sixties as U vividly remember it. I rate this movie a ten and should be nominated for Oscars.",True

7,8,old fashion greatness,SnoopyStyle,n/a,15/08/2025,Racing champ Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) has to retire due to a medical issue. His racing friend Ken Miles (Christian Bale) is seen as difficult and the IRS has confiscated his garage. Ferrari has been at the top of racing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Ford Motor Company finds its sales going stale and Henry Ford II wants a big idea. Marketing VP Lee Iacocca has the idea to enter the race. They first try to buy Ferrari and Enzo Ferrari insults Henry Ford II. Iacocca recruits Shelby to create a racing car and Shelby recruits Miles to be his driver.This is an old fashion rip roaring good times. Damon and Bale are great. All the actors are great whether it's Tracy Letts being told that he's not Henry Ford or the villainy of Josh Lucas. It's a solid sports underdog story. It's fun like Caitriona Balfe driving crazy.

It think it's a ridiculous waste of resources, and boring to watch. I have zero interest in cars - and thus I know absolutely nothing of the history. I knew nothing of this film beyond reading the blurb before I started watching it, so I was very interested to see whether I would like it at all. I did. Despite being so uninterested in the subject, the film got me interested in the story, and especially during the final race I was on the edge of seat not knowing what would happen. Fantastic acting job from both Damon and Bale, usual. They never disappoint. Excellent writing, directing, cutting, sound editing..

11,6,"well done for its genre, but only just, good acting on the part of Bale and Damon",trelerke-politics,n/a,15/08/2025,"SpoilerI used to race cars, still spend a bit of time on the track, so I know this story,
even met some of the actual people involved here (I'm old), and I wanted to really like the movie more than I did. Of course the car porn was fantastic, the casual way in which iconic multi-million dollar cars were placed around the set and even some of the scenes showing the GT40 moving around the airport tarmac were very good. For the latter, they captured speed well here, which is very difficult. So, kudos. But the actual danger involved, although shown to some extent, was not given the attention really needed. I understand the dramatic demands for a movie, but I would think emphasizing the danger would only help. Just to be clear, there were two deaths in a five month period, Miles and Macdonald, although deaths and massive injuries were very common then, these deaths actually had an effect on the racing community. Also, to be clear, the Ford effort was massive, they simply hired the very best in the US to get the GT40 developed. It really was a huge disparity between Ford and any other team. In reality, once Ford got out the kinks, it was a foregone conclusion, no matter that Ferrari made amazing cars. In this regard, little was made of the genius and absolute necessity of Phil Remmington to the entire GT40 project, he was the actual development lead on the car and he was made out to be a Disney -like character, uncle Phil with almost no real role to play. Well, actually, the character of Miles, also an engineer on the project was a compiled character that included ""Rem"" but because Rem was the essential piece for GT40 development, they had to gesture towards him, I suppose. Again, it was an okay movie, very much in the genre, although a bit better acted, Damon and Bale fighting with each other, using food, a thrown wrench, the supportive, loving wife. Within the context of a buddy movie, the movie does work, but its too long and you feel it, although I did like the way Miles death accident was shown, not a lot of buildup, save for the music, and then a highspeed muffled crash, no huge histrionics after and then the both true and movie cliche line ""sometimes they don't come home."" I wanted more of the internal mechanics of that, I wanted more of Henry Ford crying in the car, a great scene, actually because both the absolute insanity of being in a racing car as well as his joy were conveyed, I thought that was a magnificent human moment, unexpected and worth the movie, on it's own.",True
12,10,Best Race Car Movie Ever? 💯,Instant_Palmer,n/a,15/08/2025,"Gut level racing movie with no need to manufacture fictional drama - Fact takes over the drama (with some embellishments) throughout Ford v Ferrari, with its glorious on-the-edge engagement fueled by the Hi-Test performances of its two stars, Matt Damon and Christian Bale.Being a former SCCA racer (in my 20's), my bucket list need for speed took me to the track to live out my childhood dream of racing cars, and I did an admirable job at winning races at one of the lowest levels possible in racing - but it was always about being the best that I knew I could be (and could afford as car racing gets very expensive as you move up to the higher performance level cars), which as it turns out was better than anyone else at that level.Hill took that to the top production and competition levels of racing (financed primarily by competing manufacturers utilizing endurance racing to showcase their design prowess in making the World's greatest race cars, and those independents with extremely deep pockets), illustrating the universal need race car drivers have to validate their abilities, which is magnified 100-fold at this top professional racing level.This is a great film as filmmaking goes, whether one is a race fan or a movie fan, and deserved its nominations and awards. Best race car movie of all time?? X marks the spot, and that is 'Ford v Ferrari'. No brainer 10/10.👍👍",False

14,2,A motor racing film that will disappoint motor racing fans,davidallenxyz,n/a,15/08/2025,"Somewhat surprised by the high ratings and Oscar nominations this has garnered. Writing as a motor racing fan, it simply isn't a good film.I'll start with some positives.The supporting cast are good, and the rivalries and relationships between Shelby (Damon) and Miles (Bale) and the Ford Motor Co. And Miles' own family are engaging. Production values are high too.But there is a long list of negatives.Biggest problem by far is the two leads. Christian Bale, as usual, is ACTING and he wants the audience to be very aware of it, to the extent of putting on an over-the-top Brummie accent complete with non-stop commentary on everything he is doing while inside the car.Matt Damon is ""acting"" as only Matt can. He is doing a bit of an accent as well. At least he isn't quite as annoying as Bale.You just can't engage with either of them.And the weak lead performances just make you notice all the technical inaccuracies. It's not a good start when some of the first cars you see on screen are obvious modern replicas. On top of that, the timeline is changed to make the story more dramatic (ignoring the GT40s origins in the UK, playing with the timeline of the Fiat/Ferrari takeover, transporting the ""old man"" to Le Mans).But probably the greatest crime is that the testing and racing sequences fall into all the bad tropes of filmmakers who don't understand car racing, and change the dynamics to make it more appealing to a general audience. Cars ALWAYS have an extra gear that gives them a 20mph boost to overtake. Drivers coast along the main straights so they can have a lingering look through an opponents window, or maybe even say a few words. Cars are never on the racing line, instead they are weaving at random. Cars collide (or are forced off the track deliberately) and burst into flames with no reference to the consequences.Ford winning Le Mans out of spite is a great story. This film doesn't do it justice.",False

17,9,Filled with Energy,kjproulx,n/a,15/08/2025,"Biopics can be a hard sell at times. Whether you're diving into the troubled life of an addict or exploring someone's sexuality, there are many touchy subjects these days. With that said, I feel there are also those that will stand the test of time, in terms of being able to please a wide audience. Ford v Ferrari is one of the latest true stories out of Hollywood that will be hitting the big screen soon, and here's why I believe it absolutely deserves attention.Following multiple characters throughout, Ford v Ferrari focussed on the fact that Henry Ford II was given an idea to create the fastest race car in the world. His mission is to take down the likes of the company Ferrari, who have held the title for years. Carol Shelby (Matt Damon) is approached by a member of the Ford team and is recruited, only to be the one finding himself recruiting the driver in Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That's the core premise and there's a lot to dive into from there.If you're a fan of racing or cars in general, this movie will be for you. This is a very well-directed film by James Mangold, and the racing sequences are quite long, taking up a good chunk of the nearly 150-minute run time. Luckily, they are very intense, practically shot, with a fantastic score to back it up, and sound effects to get your heart pumping. Everything about the exciting aspects of this film was top notch.Christian Bale and Matt Damon give stellar performances here as the two leading men in the film and I totally bought their rigid friendship that slowly developed. Sadly, without giving anything away, there is an incident that I feel was not explored enough, which slightly took away when a certain moment is meant to impact the movie. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie from beginning to end.In the end, Ford v Ferrari is engaging, emotional, and downright thrilling when it wants to be. I was invested in these characters and on the edge of my seat during the climactic races. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this movie. There is a missed opportunity in terms of emotion during a certain scene, but I was able to forgive that, seeing as the rest of the movie was so impressive. Ford v Ferrari is one of the best movies I've seen so far this year and it will be one to see when it officially releases.",False

The characters are fleshed out very well and give you the emotional attachment you're looking for in a movie. Bale and Damon's performances are great; they pull you into the story and completely disappear into their roles. James Mangold proves, once again, to be a master behind the camera. The action scenes are shot to perfection and will have you biting your nails.The film's technical aspects were top-notch as well. Wait for this film to be nominated for sound design and editing. These technical aspects, during the climax of the film, will blow your hair back and give you goosebumps.All in all, this film provides a pleasing experience for the crowd that not many films can even come close to delivering.

Yes, this movie might be 20mins to long, but it takes you on a long and exciting ride with an end you won't see coming, unless you spoil yourself with how the race in '66 ended - my advice: DON'T! it will pay off.I'm a Formula 1 enthusiast and occasionally watch the Le Mans races as well, so I wasn't aware how the race in '66 ended. I wasn't even aware of the rivalry between Ford and Ferrari back then, but this movie won't bore you with the details to much. It gives the necessary overview of the needed context, so that every viewer understands what's on the line here.I'd recommend a viewing in an IMAX for sure, to feel the sound and experience the race for yourself.

24,5,I wanted to like it,ptone-93207,n/a,15/08/2025,"I was really looking forward to watching this film, but I was disappointed about how Mangold directed it, some overacting, and a too melodramatic script.First, the director expects us to believe that two race car drivers will drive side-by-side giving each other the evil eye while careening down the straight at 210 miles per hour. Better yet, in some early scenes they shout at each other in their open-top race cars, as if they could be heard over the sound of the engines. Mangold also channels Ben-Hur's chariot race, with cars nudging each other sideways. During the Le Mans race, he cuts away multiple times to driver Miles' wife and child watching the event on TV. I'm sorry, but no network then or now would televise a 24-hour race in its entirety. I can almost hear the laughter of anyone in the racing industry who watched all the absurdities (I am sure they would have a longer list than this one).Next, the director did not rein in the outrageous overacting by Christian Bale as Miles. Add in the demonic glowering of Letts as Henry Ford and you have a cartoon, not a well-conceived treatment of an historical event for American racing. As is par for the course with these testosterone-driven movies, the female characters are destined to be background cheerleaders for their men; in this one, there's only one of them.Equal blame then to the scriptwriters, who came up with a predictable plot line in the best (or worst?) tradition of American melodrama. We have the bad guys (Ford and Beebe) and the good guys (Shelby and Miles), and everyone else is window dressing. Not a shred of nuance here, which should be an insult to the moviegoer, but I guess the bar has been set pretty low for decades now.The racing scenes themselves are well-filmed, with lots of low-angle shots that create even more of a feel of being there. A lot of viewers want explosions, and you get more than your fair share of those here -- maybe too many to be realistic.It's unfortunate that in a film of almost epic length you don't get a good exposition of the friendship of Miles and Shelby. Unless I'm wrong, and it just consisted of a lot of bantering and occasional meaningful looks.",False
25,8,Mangold has a knack for this type of film.,LeonardoOliva69,n/a,15/08/2025,"A very forgotten film during the 2020 Oscars.It had the difficult task of competing against ""Parasite"", ""Once upon a time in Hollywood"" or ""Joker"" among others.So poorly rated that it had neither C. Bale nor M. Damon nominated as best actor/supporting actor nor Mangold as best Director.And despite all this, it is a real great film.I am not a fan of this kind of film, however ""Ford vs Ferrari"" perfectly conveys everything it wants.From incredible performances, a no less formidable direction. A photography and sound that put it in a very particular place.All this set in the 60s with a race as renowned and mythical as the 24 hours of Le Mans.This is an auteur film, very much in the vein of what Mangold has accustomed us to in biopics, for example of Johnny Cash in ""Walk the Line"" or of Bob Dylan in the recently released ""A Complete Unknown"". This type of film suits him perfectly.The 2 and a half hours that the film lasts fly by, it is dynamic, you can feel the tension and it never wanes.Perhaps the very biased focus on Ford and the United States, or how they forget about John Berthal in the second part of the film, even though he is also an important actor in the story, takes away a couple of points.However, and I repeat, it is a very good film in its technical and acting quality and it deserved better luck at the Academy Awards.",False

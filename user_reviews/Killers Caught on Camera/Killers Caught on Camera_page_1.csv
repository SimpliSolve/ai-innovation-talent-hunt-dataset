1,7,"It's a fine true crime show, with room for improvement",dustinrondeau,n/a,16/08/2025,"You can tell it doesn't have quite the budget of other true crime series, but they make up for it with decent analysts and professional commentary. I do wish they had been able to secure interviews with more eye-witnesses, and also family / friends of the deceased. It would make the cases much more personal. Instead, we hear primarily from police, detectives, forensic analysts, psychologists, etc, which is fine.There's two stories per episode, so a good pace is maintained. They make the stories compelling by the sequence in which they introduce the evidence, but the problem is that most cases are easily solved within the introduction to the story. For example: ""Their marriage fell apart, and they divorced..."" and you immediately know who the killer is going to be. The rest of the episode is then spent proving it. There are occasional plot twists or unexpected pieces of evidence that keep the series compelling enough to keep watching, but I wish they would leave the audience guessing a bit more to keep you in suspense.Overall, it's engaging enough to watch an episode here and there, with some episodes being more compelling than others.",False
2,7,Terrific Show ..,phwagz-46691,n/a,16/08/2025,Although the scenes being shown in each episode are disturbing and graphic I am always left feeling so sad that the victims lives ended so horrifically.. and if anyone had an doubts about the statistics cited in this show then they should read the FBIs stats on these types of crimes. Importantly some of the victims ignored the obvious red flags and were subsequently killed by their lovers/husbands. It's disturbing that many victims who had the courage to report the abuse to the police were not provided adequate protection.. weak stalking laws were ultimately responsible for their deaths. An an aside .. the cohort that committed many of the crimes were male blacks who kill more women ( either stranger killings ) and they seem to constantly target young vulnerable white women .. that's a stat you would find in the FBIs database! Why? To mask an obvious truth. The evidence for that is clearly annotated in the episodes presented in this show .. bad parenting always makes bad children which then progress to become very dangerous adults. Some will consider that statement heresy.. but the pictures speak for themselves.,False
3,10,its merely...,ops-52535,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerA perfect true crime production for the nerdy true crime documentary viewer, so i give it a 10 of gratitude to the people thats lost their loved ones, and in the memory to those almost 30 victims connected to this series...i say ''merely''in the header and there are 2 production techniques used that i do not like. 1 - they drag the showtime in such a manner that even the most patient viewer feels like chewing sawdust, 2-by all the ultrabasic psychological, comprehensive, but in the length boring due to repetitiveness, its obvious, murder and suspicious death aint ''normal'', i believe most people know that, and to some extent its told in away that would suit a minor (or an a.i.), and minors aint supposed to watch stuff like this, cause they havent got the power of reasoning and understanding...some might think i exhagerate this, maybe, but viewers aint dum when benching in front of the tv screen once a week to see the reason why we need video surveillance as part of any investigation...they could have used even more ''boring'' video footage just to show the facts of the crime, also a bigger level of police interrogation video wouldve made this series even more sturdy and relentless...but one thing the producers and viaplay will derserve my acclaim for, and that is the complete, 100% complete ,absence of dramatized acting, a production technique that really drools and desimates loads of other productions.I will be looking forward to the next season of killers:caught on camera, cause it really nips the nerve of how cruel life can be, and how seredipitous life may be. A full recommend from the grumy old man.",True
4,10,One of the better true crime docs,perillomike,n/a,16/08/2025,This is a lean and mean program using almost exclusively criminal forensic and investigative interviews. Not watered down for heart tugging effect by the constant interviews and dramatic shots of loved ones. It features in great detail every aspect of digital footprints left by killers and the victims. What i also loved was the occasional interview with the criminal psychologist explaining why certain actions and comments are made by the guilty parties especially during interrogation scenes. Gives you a keen insight to the mind of the desperate and guilty. All eps include 2 criminal cases so they move quickly with no drag whatsoever. Highly recommended for true crime fans.,False
5,9,New stories for true crime watchers,gotsuzuki,n/a,16/08/2025,"Love the show, for obvious reasons
its true crime
stories are new
well put togetherthe only criticism I have is that the ""psychologist"" who gives her assessment of the criminals...Julia Shaw wears what appears to be a black negligee top in every episode.. despite her wearing a sport jacket , the negligee is inappropriately low cut so her breasts are impossible to ignore... which in my opinion is in poor taste. She's a very attractive woman so I don't see any reason why she has to wear low-cut negligee on on such a serious show as people's families getting murdered. It's really just inappropriate and makes her look in a bad light.",False

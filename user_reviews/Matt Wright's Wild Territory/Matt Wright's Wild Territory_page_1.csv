1,9,Amazing show!,effietwest,n/a,16/08/2025,"SpoilerThis show was so amazing and provided insight into the elusive character of the Northern territory. All the crew had such natural chemistry with each other and it was so enjoyable to watch. Loved watching sweet Banjo and Kaia as well. Also watching the relationship between the crocs and humans was so surreal and incredible to see how close they go to the animals. I finished the show so quickly and desperately want a second season. The pacing of the show was great and didn't feel rushed or too slow, not a dull moment! Additionally devastated to see that Wilson passed away at the end of the series he was truly such a joy to watch! Finny was.",True
